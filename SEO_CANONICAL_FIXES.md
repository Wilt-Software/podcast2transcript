# SEO Canonical URL Fixes

## Problem
Google Search Console was reporting "Duplicate without user-selected canonical" errors for blog pages, even though they were indexed. This indicates that Google detected potential duplicate content but couldn't determine the canonical (preferred) version of each page.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Canonical URLs to All Blog Pages

**Files Updated:**
- `src/app/blog/page.tsx` - Blog index page
- `src/app/blog/[podcast]/page.tsx` - Podcast listing pages  
- `src/app/blog/[podcast]/[episode]/page.tsx` - Individual episode pages

**Changes Made:**
```typescript
// Added to each page's generateMetadata function
alternates: {
  canonical: metaTags.canonical
}
```

### 2. Enhanced SEO Meta Tags

The `src/lib/seo.ts` already included canonical URL generation in:
- `generateEpisodeMetaTags()`
- `generatePodcastMetaTags()`
- `generateBlogIndexMetaTags()`

These functions now properly generate canonical URLs that are used by Next.js metadata API.

### 3. Canonical URL Structure

All canonical URLs follow this pattern:
- Blog index: `https://podcast2transcript.com/blog`
- Podcast pages: `https://podcast2transcript.com/blog/[podcast-slug]`
- Episode pages: `https://podcast2transcript.com/blog/[podcast-slug]/[episode-slug]`

### 4. Verification Tools

Created `scripts/verify-canonicals.js` to test canonical URL implementation:

```bash
npm run verify-canonicals
```

This script checks that:
- Canonical `<link>` tags are present in HTML
- URLs match the expected canonical format
- No mismatched or missing canonical URLs

## Expected Results

1. **Google Search Console**: The "Duplicate without user-selected canonical" errors should resolve within 1-4 weeks as Google re-crawls the pages.

2. **SEO Benefits**:
   - Clear signals to search engines about preferred URLs
   - Prevents duplicate content penalties
   - Consolidates page authority to canonical URLs
   - Improves search ranking stability

## Monitoring

1. Check Google Search Console weekly for reduction in duplicate content issues
2. Monitor crawl stats to ensure pages are being re-indexed
3. Run `npm run verify-canonicals` after any blog-related changes

## Additional SEO Features Already in Place

- ✅ Proper robots.txt configuration
- ✅ XML sitemap generation with proper URLs
- ✅ Structured data (JSON-LD) for podcast episodes
- ✅ Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
- ✅ Internal linking strategy
- ✅ Mobile-friendly responsive design

## Next Steps

After canonical URLs are implemented:

1. **Submit sitemap** to Google Search Console (if not already done)
2. **Request re-indexing** of affected pages in Search Console
3. **Monitor Core Web Vitals** for any performance impacts
4. **Track keyword rankings** for improvement over time

The canonical URL implementation should resolve the duplicate content issues and improve overall SEO performance for the podcast transcript pages.
