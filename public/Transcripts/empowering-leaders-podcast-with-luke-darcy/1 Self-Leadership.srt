00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,890
a listener production. Welcome to a special episode of Empowering Leaders. What an incredible

2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,429
privilege I found it to be to sit down with inspirational and diverse leaders learning

3
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:20,690
from their life experiences. I've loved every moment of it. We at A Leader believe that success

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,949
leaves clues and that there are a number of dimensions of leadership that are consistent

5
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:31,609
with the 21st century purpose-driven leaders we've spoken to on this podcast. This is episode one,

6
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:36,570
an insight into how some of our guests view self-leadership and what it means to them.

7
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:43,289
In season 2022, 44 leaders have sat down with me, and each one has brought a unique and powerful

8
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:48,009
insight into the way leaders from across the world of business, arts, social venture, sport,

9
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,850
and more lead and collaborate in their world. I asked every one of them about self-leadership

10
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,570
and what it means to them, and I look forward to recapping some remarkable moments throughout

11
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,590
the year. All of these episodes tie into a great passion of mine, and I look forward to

12
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,810
you would have heard me talk about it throughout the year. A business co-founder with a great friend

13
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,409
of mine, Matt Wadowitz, called A Leader. It's a place where leaders come together to collaborate,

14
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:14,349
to learn from one another. People like the great Ange Postacoglu from Celtic,

15
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:19,489
Mikel Arteta from Arsenal, Mike Dunlap from the Milwaukee Bucks, just to name drop a few.

16
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,989
But please, you don't have to be an international sporting coach to join us at A Leader.

17
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,810
We are really passionate about supporting a world of collaboration, inspiring connections

18
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:31,390
from people from a range of different backgrounds,

19
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:36,650
love you to check out our signature A Leader Connect program, head to a leadercollective.com.

20
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,579
One of our collaborators is the great Andy Lee from Hamish and Andy. He was one of the earlier

21
00:01:55,579 --> 00:02:00,980
episodes on the podcast, and when I asked him about self-leadership, he had a truly unique insight.

22
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,879
The opportunity to reflect in your own world and what you're doing. We talked about this a bit in

23
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:13,699
our group. One of the mantras that we kind of stumbled across for Radio Craig,

24
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,800
is that we try and create this culture really quickly.

25
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,520
So when you say employ 50 or 60, but you only take 10 on the trip.

26
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,780
Yeah, so we take 10 from Australia.

27
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:57,740
Right, okay. So 40 US citizens that you haven't met before, you employ on the ground. That's big on a

28
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,639
show, yeah.

29
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,479
Then you might have someone in graphics department who's fantastic year one, so you're like,

30
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,199
oh, that's easy. You don't need anyone there. And then the year two, you're over in Britain,

31
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,879
you're like, oh no, we should have got more people here because you don't know whether

32
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,060
you're going to have the same type of skill sets as you travel.

33
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:19,180
And so what we found was it was important to reflect on every single element of the show and

34
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:25,300
also every single person that we worked with. And it sounds like it's a bit self-bashing, but

35
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:31,620
Tim and I and the guys sat down and went, what if it was our fault that this person didn't succeed

36
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,719
or didn't get the best out of them? It's so easy to go, that guy was crap, we need to replace them.

37
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:37,960
Yeah.

38
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,219
But what could we have done to give them a better chance to succeed?

39
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,319
And that's part of the self-leadership that I've really enjoyed of recent times is like,

40
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:55,860
how can we give everyone that I'm working with or I was working or working for or they're working

41
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:02,479
for me their best chance to succeed? And taking a step back and going, what am I doing to help that

42
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,759
rather than just expecting of people? So that's probably the main one.

43
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:11,620
Brilliant thought. And I think of the sporting environment, Andy, where it always in the past

44
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,520
coaches, he can't kick. He's like, I can't kick. I can't kick. I can't kick. I can't kick. I can't kick.

45
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:13,699
I can't kick. I can't kick. I can't kick. I can't kick. I can't kick. I can't kick. I can't kick. I can't kick.

46
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:17,060
Not a great mark. Always telling you what you couldn't do. And I always just think,

47
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,019
isn't the art of coaching, we need you to do one or two of those things better. How do I support

48
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:28,019
you to get better rather than this is a blank line through you because that skill is not something

49
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:32,360
that's... Can I just follow up? I'm fascinated in that because you're going to live and die by

50
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,699
those 40 people really, aren't you? Did you find you got better? You did several gap years.

51
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,379
How did you identify good people? I mean...

52
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:43,639
Without stereotyping, you go to the US and everyone can do everything,

53
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,519
and they're the best at everything. So it's actually very...

54
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,120
Is that in their minds or is that actuality? Well, no, it's in their mind. So it's actually

55
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,160
really hard to interview for. So you sit down, you talk to some lighting guy who goes, yeah,

56
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,339
I'm the best there is. I can light this, I can do that. I can light the Statue of Liberty from here.

57
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,279
And you're like, oh, this guy seems pretty good. Then the next guy gives you the same kind of

58
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,579
treatment. So it was actually very difficult to try and work out who to go with. And then you head

59
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:12,920
to Britain and you're talking to someone who's got amazing credentials and you ask them a question

60
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,519
like, oh, look, I'm not...

61
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,600
I'm not sure if I'd be the best at this.

62
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:24,339
So the difference in personalities was fascinating. In Thailand, I think it was 50% of the crew

63
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:29,019
didn't speak English. And same with when we were in Buenos Aires. So you had to trust the top people

64
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:36,579
that they were translating back to you. So all in South America, the director directed in Spanish.

65
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,199
Wow.

66
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,220
So all the cameramen spoke Spanish and we just smiled and hoped that Tim would be tapping on

67
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:43,439
the show.

68
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,759
Correct. It was bilingual.

69
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,939
Did the humor translate? Were they getting the gags?

70
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,160
Yeah, they got the gags, which is really great. So, I mean, it's a long-winded answer to the

71
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:00,240
question, but what you needed to do is make sure that you were set up so clearly from the head.

72
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:00,839
Yeah.

73
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:07,360
And that is just the structure of what we're trying to create was so clear and so defined

74
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,259
in the head roles that we are taking across there. So they know what's expected of them.

75
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,360
And then they can...

76
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:20,560
They can then employ the people that are going to answer to those people. So our key personnel

77
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,620
that we hired in country, we were more rigorous with getting them on board and we chose really well.

78
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,980
Jeez, what a great privilege it is to spend some time with Andy Lee. And I love the way

79
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,939
that Andy asked himself and the Radio Karate team asked themselves, you know what, maybe

80
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:38,800
it's our fault. I think that's incredibly admirable. Always learn something from Andy.

81
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,079
It's not something that you see every day. He's always got an incredibly unique perspective.

82
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,480
Our next highlight, one of my favourite conversations from the year of podcast that

83
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,019
we've done, one of my favourite conversations ever, and that is Jagua Jones, inspirational

84
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:57,680
singer-songwriter who stood up to the might of Sony Music and sparked a wave of conversation

85
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,300
around the culture of Sony Music and the wider music industry, it has to be said.

86
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,319
Here is Jagua reflecting on her interpretation of self-leadership

87
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:08,620
and the story behind her song that rocked the industry.

88
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:12,060
I never thought I was like a leader, but I think

89
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:19,899
what makes a great leader is someone who listens. Often we have this, you know, picture

90
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:24,920
painted of a leadership who just takes control and is in front of the pack. But to me, leadership

91
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,939
is you're amongst the pack and you're listening to the stories around you so that you grow

92
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:36,060
your awareness, you come into your empathy and you make decisions based on what is best

93
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,779
for the collective.

94
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:41,819
What an answer. It's funny, Jay.

95
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,319
The amount of leaders that I've spoken to who say exactly what you said first. I never saw myself

96
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,240
as a leader. And I think that humility is part of what is the trademark of great leaders that

97
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,420
we're seeing going forward. And I love your song, Who Died and Made You King. And I just can't help

98
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:04,000
but smile when I, can I just read the opening lyrics for you, back to you? Clearly they're

99
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,079
yours. But to me, this sums up what you're on about in such a powerful way. I'm leading

100
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,660
on the voice of change. Your downfall,

101
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,439
isn't far away. Believing that you're here to stay. Now that you're leaving, we can finally

102
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,399
say, who died and made you king?

103
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:31,110
I'm the voice of change. Your downfall, that you're here to stay, now that you're leaving.

104
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:44,049
The song for me was all about, I guess the industry is built on all these little kingdoms

105
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:49,070
and, you know, you could have even like an even bigger kingdom, but there's this kind

106
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,690
of hierarchy of kingdoms in the industry. And on top of that, there's this kind of hierarchy

107
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,029
of kings, and on top of that, there's this kind of hierarchy of kings, and on top of that,

108
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:59,370
every kingdom is a self-made king that has somehow decided to give themselves so much

109
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:05,549
power and exploit so much and cause so much damage because they feel like they are entitled

110
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:12,509
or have earned the right to that power. And I guess it's all about decentralizing that

111
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:20,750
kind of hierarchical structure of the industry and, you know, trying to instill healthy relationships

112
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,009
and healthy environments.

113
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:29,330
Um, it just needs a lot of change. I sit here laughing when you read those lyrics back

114
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:37,889
to me, but at the time, I was, I don't know if I can swear, shitting myself. Like, I was,

115
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:41,649
I don't know what, how else I could say it, but I don't know if you can, if I can swear.

116
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:46,970
You can swear as often as you like, you can do whatever you like. It was an apt description.

117
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,970
I have never, ever written a song like that. That song was,

118
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:59,889
the first time I allowed myself to feel anger. For so long, I felt like anger was a bad emotion

119
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:06,590
because the people around me used anger in the wrong way. But what I didn't realize is that I

120
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:12,029
wasn't acknowledging myself or giving myself the love that I deserve by holding back the anger I

121
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:17,929
should be allowed to feel because of what has happened to me. That song was this, like, huge

122
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:22,250
step of change for me. I wrote that song.

123
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:30,149
So quickly in one day and listen back to it going like, oh my gosh, who is this person with so much

124
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:37,590
anger and sass? Like, I don't even recognize her. And then I went down this like, um, spiral of,

125
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:44,509
I'm going to have lawyers all up against me. I sampled someone as the instrumental.

126
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:50,029
I sampled someone's speech, hypocritical speech in the instrumental.

127
00:10:52,690 --> 00:11:08,889
I just went on this crazy research of, am I going to get sued? How much risk is this?

128
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:14,669
What am I up against? Should I do this? Am I going to get into trouble? Is it worth it?

129
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,850
It was two months of me being in my head going, I don't know if I should do this.

130
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,649
But I'm so, so, so glad I did because it ended up coming.

131
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:31,470
It ended up coming out, um, hand in hand with the Four Corners, uh, like documentary

132
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:38,629
behind, I guess, um, a particular story in the music industry. And it became this like perfect

133
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:45,690
storm of all these elements locking into place so that, I don't know, survivors can finally find

134
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:52,490
this voice and give themselves the anger that they deserve and charge on through demanding change.

135
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:55,409
Wow. That song, Who Died and Made You King,

136
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:59,629
what an impact that had. Such a great representation of self-leadership and the

137
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:04,690
reflections that Jaguar Jones had about herself and her attitude. Incredibly inspirational and

138
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:10,129
amazing. So moving from the world of arts to the world of finance, fortunate enough to have for

139
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:15,110
the incredible Scott Pape, the barefoot investor on for an interview earlier this year, man who

140
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,929
sold more books than anyone in Australian history. He started his self-leadership reflection with the

141
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:25,029
idea that he wasn't a leader, but finishes with a piece of advice that shows to me why

142
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:30,149
so admired. Yeah, again, I don't really see myself as a leader. Um, one of the things I've

143
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:37,570
tried to do is every column for nearly 19 years, the, uh, I don't know why I started doing this

144
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:44,070
from the very first column. It was that my sign off is Tread Drone Path. And to me, that has been

145
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:51,649
what I've tried, kind of my North Star in that, um, I wrote a book, I did very well. Um, and then

146
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:55,190
I looked at it and thought, what am I really interested in? I'm interested in people who've,

147
00:12:55,409 --> 00:13:01,230
who struggle, or I'm interested in making sure that their kids and all kids learn this stuff.

148
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:05,529
And I'm interested in my kids and spending more time with them and less time, you know,

149
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:12,210
running around promoting myself. So I guess for me, it is the whole Tread Drone Path ethos and

150
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:20,309
not buying into more money is better because I've, I've learned enough through meeting other people

151
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:25,370
who have become very, very wealthy that you can't buy back the time that you can spend,

152
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:29,049
with your family and your kids. Can you sum it up? What, what, what are the things that kids

153
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:33,690
need to know? What are the basics they need to know coming in and out of school? Well, I mean,

154
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:41,350
I think, um, in, in a primary school level, um, my view is that you need to understand it sounds

155
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:47,909
really basic, but I, you need to understand it's fun to work. It's good to work. Um, um, it's good

156
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:51,929
to spend money. No one wants a tight ass, you know, it's good to spend money, but I'm, I'm careful

157
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:55,350
about the money that I spend. And I'm, I'm kind of, I understand that I'm going to be,

158
00:13:55,409 --> 00:14:00,649
manipulated by marketers to, to, to want certain things, especially on social media and influences

159
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:06,129
and stuff. Um, uh, it's good to invest. That's how you get rich, right? So your money grows while

160
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:11,429
you don't have to work. Uh, and it's good to give, you know, it's, it's the givers in this world are

161
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:16,809
the people that are the happiest. So they are re they're, they're behaviors, right? That's not,

162
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:22,669
that's not getting too technical, but if you can teach a kid that it's good to get up and work,

163
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:25,049
I know 35 year olds that haven't got that lesson.

164
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,649
You know, that, that, that just hasn't computed for them. So they're those basic lessons that you

165
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:35,049
can, if you can instill them in your kids, right? The thing I say is that with no one wants to raise

166
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:40,169
a spoiled brat, it just happens, right? And the way it happens is you give kids money for doing

167
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:45,269
nothing, right? And you don't have a focus on giving. Yeah. So if you, if you get kids to,

168
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:50,029
to do some sort of giving within their community or they, some of their money has to go to giving

169
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:55,289
someone other than them and working hard, I think that's important. Um, for the high school

170
00:14:55,289 --> 00:15:03,070
kids, um, I created a program, uh, and, and the, the book Barefoot for Families, um, is around this

171
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,389
idea of the Barefoot 10, these 10 things that you can get your kids to do, you know, having your

172
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:14,110
kids, um, be able to cook a delicious, nutritious meal, right? Rather than getting Uber Eats, um,

173
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:19,370
having them apply for a job. So they actually have to go and sell themselves when they're

174
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:24,289
teenagers and they, you know, grumbly and stuff. Um, you know, having them hopefully getting a bad

175
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:24,730
boss.

176
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:30,190
You know, rides them a bit, you know, so that they actually have to work out, you know, that

177
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:36,009
whole power dynamic and relationship. Um, learning to invest, you know, or just these little learning

178
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:39,990
lessons that you can do with your kids that while they're still under your roof, they can,

179
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:46,809
they can make those mistakes, but they just have that ability because what I find is I will meet

180
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:53,649
23, 24 year olds who say when they're 16, I'm not really good with maths. I'm not a really,

181
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:55,110
not a good numbers person.

182
00:15:55,289 --> 00:16:01,129
Um, and so what happens is they turn 18, they get a credit card, they get after pay debt,

183
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:06,350
and then they wind up in my office saying, see, I'm, I told you I was no good with money and I've

184
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:11,750
got the credit card balance to prove it. And so for me, what's important is trying to get kids to

185
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:19,090
learn that life skills before they graduate, because as soon as they do, they are the most

186
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:24,590
heavily marketed to generation in history. And all, as you said, all the financial institutions

187
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,210
have been doing that.

188
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:25,250
And so they're not, they're not going to do it.

189
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:25,269
Um, so they're not going to do it.

190
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:32,850
an A-B split tests. They know exactly how to get you to spend their money. And so I just think that

191
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:38,009
the banks have become very good at selling money. We need to get better at helping our kids resist

192
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:50,019
that. The game of rugby league, let's change tack for a moment, is a brutal one and it isn't often

193
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:54,759
seen as an environment where people can open up and be their most vulnerable self. But the way

194
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:00,000
Trent Robinson, the coach of the Sydney Roosters, legendary coach I have to say, talks about self

195
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,680
leadership and reflects on his methods of leading himself and then others, shows how much this 21st

196
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,460
century style of leadership is impacting the way we live our lives. I think there's often a, like,

197
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:18,480
am I on a path myself just because I've got a role? Am I thinking that I'm a leader because

198
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:26,500
I've been given a title? And I feel like that self-leadership is, I don't expect to be perfect,

199
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,119
but I have to be on a path.

200
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,059
To getting myself better as a leader, you know, there's a real responsibility for that.

201
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:46,460
So self-leadership, I feel, is me continuing to, you know, get better and open myself up to

202
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:52,319
more leadership and different leadership methods. And I think you need to lead yourself

203
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,539
well first before you can lead others.

204
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:59,759
I love the contrast. You're training athletes in one of the most brutal sports in the world.

205
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,759
And effectively, you know, to spill blood on the field and it happens regularly in the amazing

206
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:13,720
intensity of NRL, but at the same time, you know, the heart and the softness at the same time.

207
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,880
You would have found that though with, you know, the teams that you play with, because this is,

208
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,819
you know, when I talk about that, it seems like a, seems a bit airy-fairy, right? So it's something

209
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:29,279
that is a bit weird to go into. But...

210
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,440
You know, the best teams that you played in,

211
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,559
there was an emotional bond or connection with those players that I mentioned.

212
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,759
100%. I couldn't agree with you more. I just love that we're openly talking about it now as a,

213
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:47,039
as a, as a, you know, I say new generation coach, you've been doing that for a long while. The best

214
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,779
people in my life were exactly that. And those connections and friendships to me is the best

215
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:57,480
part of sport. When you do open yourself up and you do break down, you know, that level,

216
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,960
as you described it so well, isn't it? You maybe start with your,

217
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,039
your partner and your wife, and then you really truly, uh, drop all of, uh, the facade amongst

218
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,000
your friends. You end up with these lifelong friendships in sport. So I love that it's come

219
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,619
to where you are now, where it's talked openly about. And it seems to me the Roosters are

220
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:18,119
destinations for people wanting to be in that sort of environment from what I can see.

221
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,099
Well, that's, I mean, this is the part of it, right? Because it always felt like it's a bit,

222
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:29,720
um, soft to talk about it in, in a brutal sport. But the more work we've done is, you know,

223
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,279
that's what warrior cultures are about. Like they've understood there's a, there's a Trojan

224
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,960
warrior that used to talk about this. It's written around how he would spill blood in

225
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,480
the morning and carry his baby in the afternoon. And what's more of an ultimate warrior than that.

226
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:52,500
And so we talk about sport and we want to see the warrior on field, but you have to balance that off

227
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:59,940
the field. You know, the samurai used to talk about how they would, you know, swords, the swordsman,

228
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,680
that they were, and they used to defend their clans, but they also used to have the imbalance

229
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:11,099
of doing, um, poetry or painting to balance out their sides. Cause they understood that they,

230
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:17,359
that's how a warrior was. And so there's no difference in our walk through life is we've

231
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:23,039
got to balance the two. And that's, I guess that's what I'm talking about there is, is being

232
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,460
open to talking about both sides. True. My mind's going, I've had a great pleasure in, uh,

233
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,819
in this series. So,

234
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:34,619
on this podcast, talking to a range of different people and, and Steve Butoff, uh, comes to mind

235
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:40,240
who's the author of, um, you know, sold over 4 million books in Australia on raising kids. And

236
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,680
his book, Raising Boys was one of the bestselling books. You would, you would have heard of Steve

237
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:49,700
and he speaks about being in rooms of big theaters and he presents to, to big groups and, and, and

238
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,359
often to, to females. And he asked them a question around, what do you want in a man? What's the

239
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:58,720
ideal man? Which he says is an interesting question. And, you know, you start off with the,

240
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,920
the banter, but he says, well, I want to be a man. I want to be a man. I want to be a man. I want to be a man.

241
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:06,480
And he said, it comes down to two things really quickly. Females want a male with spine and a big

242
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,759
heart. And he sort of puts it in those two categories, which I think sums up a little bit

243
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:17,779
of what you're talking about, isn't it? Yeah. And that's, you know, that's our role. Like I say,

244
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:25,240
just coming back to rugby league or our sport, we, we get men walk in at 17, 18 and walk out at 35.

245
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,819
Um, and if we're not looking at that part of their life,

246
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:37,400
you know, if we're not trying to help walk the path of that, um, that building that man, and,

247
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,640
and then, you know, we're missing the point of coaching. We, we've really got to, we've got to

248
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,940
do that. And that's a, you know, that's, you know, Steve and his books have been really key in,

249
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:54,039
in how do you, you know, how do you develop yourself and the people around you into being

250
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:59,200
that? And that's, there's no difference. Like, that's why I say brutality is really key for the

251
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,680
roosters, how we play. We have to play a hard style. Um, but the method about getting that

252
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:11,299
across has, um, it has changed over the years. You know, it's been, it's getting more open.

253
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:20,039
And to be honest, the hardness is, is harder than ever. It's just, um, the, the walking the

254
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:24,339
path of a good man off the field is, is, is, is getting a bit clearer.

255
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:29,000
How impressive is Trent Robinson? Love the insight that he offers and such a new way of

256
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,180
thinking.

257
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,700
Which we love to see from the world of sport to the world of business. We have loved talking to

258
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,500
a range of leaders and up next, Jeff Harris, the co-founder of Flight Centre, one of Australia's

259
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:45,380
most successful business people and an incredible leader whose self-leadership journey comes with a

260
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:50,980
story that I found interesting talking about his time as a board member at Hawthorne in 2008,

261
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,140
they were determined to win the premiership, but it took an incredible sense of self-leadership

262
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,380
to make it happen. I think it's more just being,

263
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:04,660
totally honest and transparent with people, um, doing the right things by people, what comes

264
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:11,039
around goes around. Um, and, and people will see through you if you're not genuine and you're,

265
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:15,480
and you're not communicating directly and honestly with them. And, and as I said,

266
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:21,000
and have their backs as well. That's the basics really. Um, it's hard for me to explain.

267
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,200
Jeff, you know, I find that fascinating and it has been a common response with people like you,

268
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,359
clearly you've had an extraordinary life of leadership. The humility,

269
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,819
to say, I don't see myself as a leader, but as I asked that question, I look at some of your

270
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:37,720
points on your, on your document. Point nine, leaders must radiate optimism, enthusiasm,

271
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:41,380
a can-do spirit. Point 10, leaders must raise the bar, lift expectations,

272
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,720
set a clear and compelling vision. So many of, uh, the things that you clearly have done throughout

273
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,000
your life. Can I mention at that point in a clear life example, again, this was Jeff Kennedy,

274
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,599
who's president and Jeff, you know, he's got, he's got people who love him, people who hate him,

275
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,359
but he was a crash through leader as a politician. And I remember in,

276
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,980
in 2008, when he was president of Hawthorne Football Club, I was next to him as vice president

277
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,059
on a board meeting and we were, we'd won the first nine games that year, the Hawks. Great,

278
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:14,660
Luke, it was fantastic. Um, and, uh, we had the youngest list in the comp and, uh, and conventional

279
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,720
wisdom was Geelong was going to win the grand final because they'd won the previous year in

280
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:23,119
2007, if you remember, and they had the oldest list, the most experienced, most successful team

281
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:27,700
around, but all the media was saying Geelong's going to win. So we won the first nine and Clarko

282
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,359
and Chris Fogarty, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

283
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:28,420
and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

284
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,279
and a footy manager at the time come in for a board meeting to report on one of our monthly

285
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,440
board meetings. And Jeff was there at the end of the table and they're doing the report

286
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:40,480
on nine zip. And all of a sudden, Jeff, he's fidgeting with his papers and he, he bangs

287
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,160
the table and he says, okay, I've heard it all. What do we need to win the premiership?

288
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,740
And we all sort of looked at each other and he, and he said, what resources do you need

289
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:53,460
extra? This is our year to win the flag. We might never get that opportunity. How are

290
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,940
we going to do it boys? What, what extra resources do you need? So he said, do you need any other

291
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,680
physios? Whatever you need, we will supply it. But this is our year to win the premiership.

292
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:07,839
I expect us to win it. So, and it was sort of, not exactly that language, but, but the

293
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,680
moral of the story was the leader raised the bar. The leader raised the bar. And us, me

294
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,779
and Mort was looking around, well, shit, we're not competing for the premiership. Now we

295
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:21,140
are expected to win the premiership. So what that did was the leadership group in the football

296
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:26,920
department, the players, took it upon themselves to get in Stuart Chew, who'd been with Port

297
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,160
Adelaide in the grand final and said, we're expected to win the premiership. We think

298
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,240
we can win the premiership now. We're not just competing because the favourites are

299
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,660
going to win. What do we need to win the premiership? And so all that sort of stuff started to happen

300
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:44,960
and we won the flag. So the moral of the story is the leader has to set the tone in terms

301
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,819
of where the organisation's going. And that coach was fantastic. It was really a wonderful

302
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:49,400
bit of leadership.

303
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,500
How did the coach respond across the board table to that? Because that's a delicate relationship

304
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:53,940
at times.

305
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,900
Well, it was, but I think Clarko was a fantastic coach and leader. He meant it. He was a fantastic

306
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,799
coach anyway as well. But sometimes there's that imbued in the fog of battle. It's hard

307
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:07,400
to look above the parapet. So I think someone clearly setting the expectations and the fact

308
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,380
that, yes, you are good enough, coach. Yes, we have the player list. And these boys, these

309
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,940
young boys might never get an opportunity. You know, we have to seize the moment. That

310
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,900
was a mantra, seize the moment. So I think that was, yeah, that was wonderful.

311
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:21,859
And one of the great grand final wins.

312
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,660
That was fantastic.

313
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,799
That was Geoff Harris, the inspirational co-founder of Flight Centre.

314
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,119
I encourage you to check out his episode. It was a masterclass for me on leadership

315
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:36,539
in life and in business. Moving from Geoff to one of the more recent episodes of the

316
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:41,400
year, the five-time Olympian and the 2010 Olympic gold medal winner, Lydia Lassler,

317
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:46,980
who chatted to me all the way from Lapland in Finland in an episode that covered sport,

318
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,019
business and parenting. Lydia's take on self-leadership was incredibly valuable.

319
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,640
I'm the leader of my life. So, you know, we have, you know, yeah,

320
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:56,900
this is a very important part of my life.

321
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:02,539
It's life because we've engineered it that way. It's not happened by chance or by, you

322
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:08,900
know, some kind of extraordinary gift. It's been a lot of grit and hard work and steadfast

323
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,660
kind of resilience to stick to what is important to you. So lifestyle for me is important.

324
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:19,799
Being able to work abroad and do what I want to do and give the kids these opportunities

325
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:24,660
is important for me. So that's something that we've engineered over many, you know, over

326
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,619
many years.

327
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:26,700
And, and,

328
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:33,279
and so lead it, leading your own life, leading others. You know, I've run a couple of businesses

329
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:40,359
now for nearly 15 years from, from overseas, from my laptop, from abroad. And so I think,

330
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:44,539
I think I'm a pretty good leader. I'll have to ask everyone later on, but they don't say,

331
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:50,859
they don't seem to complain too much. And, and, you know, that whole leading by example is,

332
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:56,259
is kind of true because, you know, if I portray self-discipline and then if I give people a go and

333
00:27:56,259 --> 00:28:03,019
give them independence to show me what they can do and, and to do their job without breathing

334
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:07,019
down their back is, as I do my job without anyone breathing down my back, I think it

335
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:13,880
empowers people. So I really try to give them the confidence to, to get the job done and

336
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:20,700
to, to develop their skills and to encourage them to develop their skills. So that's kind

337
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:26,240
of, you know, within, you know, my remote workplace, that's, that's how I suppose I,

338
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:32,980
I lead. I encourage them all to find, you know, a balanced lifestyle as well. You know,

339
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,980
it's really important if you're happy at home, you tend to be happy and productive at work.

340
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:45,920
So balance for me is important and finding, you know, and that balance through your relationships

341
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:51,440
and through your own learning and through performance and career and, and through,

342
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,779
you know, giving back as well, like contributing,

343
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,240
I think is,

344
00:28:56,259 --> 00:29:03,799
is, is really important. And so that's, you know, I mentor athletes as well. So I, in

345
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:09,319
a way, you know, I'm leading them or guiding, guiding them through their own journeys and,

346
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:16,759
and teaching and, and passing on and contributing in that way, passing on things that I've learned,

347
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:22,059
which I believe is a lot about myself, but also about the process of being successful.

348
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:25,980
So I really enjoy guiding,

349
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:32,299
helping athletes and giving them that kind of information or helping them flesh through their

350
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:40,039
own, their own story, you know, not just story, but process and, and what makes a difference to

351
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:46,640
their training and their, their performance on a, on a daily basis and help them find things

352
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,180
outside of their sport that they're interested in so that they can be a wholesome athlete,

353
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:55,880
you know, and a well-balanced athlete. So I really, yeah, I think leadership,

354
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:02,720
for me, you know, my dad was, you know, ran his own, he was, you know, an entrepreneur in his own

355
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,279
right. So he ran his own business. And so that was instilled from a young age for me. I never

356
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:13,039
really envisioned myself working for anybody. I've always thought I'll just be like dad,

357
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:19,059
you know, and run my own show and have school holidays, have a lifestyle. And, and in certain

358
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:24,019
respects that has definitely, you know, flowed through to me and, and our kids, you know,

359
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:25,660
are seeing it now leading, leading,

360
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,099
our children through life. You know, they see mum and dad working from home.

361
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:33,519
They always have, they've never gone to a nine to five job. So they've no,

362
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:38,539
they don't know anything different. So they might want to go to an office to work,

363
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:44,119
but who knows, they might want to do what we do as well. So I think you just, yeah, I think

364
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:49,880
ultimately if you can figure out how you want to live your own life and find that balance that we

365
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:55,720
all strive, you know, start with leading, leading your own life. But,

366
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:01,859
it's important to empower a team as well, even as an athlete, you know, I was still leading that

367
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:07,960
team of physio and coach and management and telling them what I wanted to do and how,

368
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,299
and then we all did the little jobs to get there. Now I can't replace the physio and I

369
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:17,220
can't replace the mental trainer and I can't replace the coach, but you can empower them.

370
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:25,119
What an incredible insight from a remarkable set of leaders. All those episodes are available in

371
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:25,859
the Empowering Leaders newsletter.

372
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,599
We encourage you to check them out and get an even better understanding of how all of those

373
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:35,859
leaders lead in their world. Next week, we'll be featuring highlights from the next question I

374
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:40,880
asked all of our guests throughout the year, how they view the idea of positively impacting others

375
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,680
in their environment. Empowering Leaders is produced by Ed Gooden with sound design by Matt

376
