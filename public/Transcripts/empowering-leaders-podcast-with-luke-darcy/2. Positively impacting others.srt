1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,619
a listener production. Welcome to another special edition of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,300
I have to say again what an incredible privilege it has been to sit down and learn from inspirational

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,000
and diverse leaders who talk about their life and what has made them successful in so many areas.

4
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:25,440
We at Aleda believe that success leaves clues and that there are a number of different dimensions

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,559
of leadership that are consistent with 21st century purpose-driven leaders that we've spoken

6
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:37,320
to on this podcast. The idea of having a positive impact on others in your environment we think is

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,840
one of the keys to being a great leader and something that was really unique to the leaders

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,200
that we sat down with in 2022. 44 leaders in total each with a unique and powerful insight into the

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,740
way they lead from the world of business, from arts, from social venture, from sport in a more

10
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:59,240
collaborative way to impact others in a positive way in their world. All of these episodes tie

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,460
into a great passion of mine.

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,760
You would have heard me mention a lot throughout the year a business co-founder with my great friend

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,900
Matt Waterwitz called Aleda. It's a place where leaders come together to collaborate and learn

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,900
from one another. People like Michael Voss, the coach of the Carlton Football Club, collaborating

15
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,920
with Benjamin Northey, who you would have heard on this podcast, the legendary conductor of the

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,280
Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, Dr Chris Brown, to name drop a few again. But you don't have to be

17
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,540
internationally known or a legend in your space to work with us at Aleda. Our passion is about

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,640
supporting a world of collaboration, inspiring connections, and we'd love you to check out our

19
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:51,140
signature Aleda Connect program. Head to aledacollective.com. Back to the idea of having

20
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,879
a positive impact on others, which is the focus of this recap. Something really passionate about

21
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,799
exploring with leaders like the CEO of Rugby Australia, Raelynn Castle, who had a unique

22
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,519
practical insight into the idea of what positively impacting others means to her.

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,560
I went for a guy in my very first job. I was a

24
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,919
very enthusiastic marketing graduate that was, you know, looking to, I suppose, you know, take on

25
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:24,120
the world, if you like. And he was a very experienced Xerox executive that had come from the UK. And

26
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,199
I'd go into his office with this idea and I'd be like, I've just been thinking and I reckon we can

27
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:34,819
do this and this and this. What do you think? And I always left his office better off than when I

28
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:40,300
went in there. So I always had value added to the thought. He told me you should go and talk to the

29
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,719
this person. Maybe if you just tweak that and go about it this way. So it's something I've really

30
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:50,840
thought about and that when someone comes and approaches me with something, an idea, a thought,

31
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:55,840
you know, whatever, that hopefully I can send them away just a little bit more knowledgeable

32
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,259
or point them in a little bit better direction than when they arrived in.

33
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,379
And, you know, like I said, he taught me that right from my very first job.

34
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:07,639
And you can always identify when someone's just not listening to you, can't you? It's pretty

35
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,159
deflating, even if the idea doesn't get up.

36
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,139
The idea that someone's actually genuinely listening and maybe that can be transformative

37
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:21,099
resonates with me. Brian McNamee on this podcast, who was the legendary CEO of CSL,

38
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,960
that took that to, you know, the biggest company by market cap. And that was what he said routinely

39
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,860
he did. Didn't put meetings in his diary, just wanted to walk, you know, ended up with 40,000

40
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,199
employees, CSL worldwide, but just wanted to walk and talk, walk past people's desks,

41
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,000
find out from someone obscure about what was happening, you know, in the inner sanctum of

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,680
the organisation.

43
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,780
You know, rather than the old version of hierarchy, which is really the passion for

44
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,460
leadership we're talking about. Jeff Harris, who founded Flight Centre recently, the same thing,

45
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:53,500
you know, walking into the stores and finding out from those at the lowest rungs of the

46
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,620
organisation was the most beneficial. And have you found that's really related to you

47
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,379
and as you've gone on in your working life as well?

48
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,439
Yeah, it has. And I have to say it's my single biggest frustration about COVID is the fact that

49
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,219
you get, you know, last year I had four months at my dining room table in Auckland,

50
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,159
because Auckland was in lockdown, dealing with, you know, the people that I obviously

51
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,600
had to deal with on a daily basis, 40 hours of Zoom calls, but actually no capability

52
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,879
to get that physical and environmental contact that I really find rewarding from a job point

53
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,899
of view. And, you know, be able to get a sense of walking past someone and saying,

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,959
how's your mum? Or how's your dog? Or did you win footy in the weekend? Or what did

55
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:39,959
you think of the Grand Prix in the weekend? Wasn't it a great performance? Those are the

56
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,300
types of things that I find really rewarding.

57
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:46,920
You can taste it and smell it around the culture of an organisation. But if you're not doing

58
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,079
that because you're locked behind a screen in COVID, that's really, really, really challenging.

59
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,060
And as we start to move back into an environment where we want people to come back into the

60
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,279
office to have that human connection, that's a real cultural challenge for a lot of organisations

61
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,560
where people and staff have got used to working from home, it suits their lifestyle better,

62
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,740
they realise that they've got more flexibility, and it might be better for the organisation,

63
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,279
for the industry.

64
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,120
But it's more challenging for the organisation. So I think that's a real challenge facing

65
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,800
leaders as we emerge out of this COVID world.

66
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:24,860
Raylene Castle there with a fantastic story and insight, a chat that I really enjoyed.

67
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:29,860
Now, the next grab is from a conversation that I was expecting to be a lot of fun, and

68
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:35,120
it was, but I wasn't always expecting it to be as expansive and thought-provoking as it

69
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,480
became.

70
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:40,199
These are three great friends of mine, Nathan Brown, an old teammate of mine from the Western

71
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:40,639
Bulldogs.

72
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,420
Chris Judd, AFL superstar, Mark Howard, the number one podcaster in the world, the Howie

73
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,259
Games, at least according to Howie, that's the case. They are part of the team of the

74
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:54,639
Friday Huddle. I spend Friday nights throughout the AFL season with them. It's a light-hearted

75
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,920
take on the world of AFL. Now, the three of them each have an interesting take on positively

76
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,279
impacting others, but it was Howie who kicked it off.

77
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,839
I like to be led by really positive people. So if I'm in a situation where I'm being cast

78
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,579
as the leader, I am as positive as I can.

79
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,139
You understand that there are going to be issues along the way, but just get up, dust

80
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:20,620
yourself off, keep going. But yeah, to me, it's all about positivity, putting some positivity

81
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,579
out there. I think it pretty much comes back your way tenfold. So leadership to me is positivity.

82
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,899
And in fairness to you, Howie, I can't remember seeing you ever walk into an environment and

83
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:36,259
be flat. So I think, in fact, you're always up, always in that space, just genuinely got

84
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:39,019
an energy about you. And that's probably one, that's just the other category of talking

85
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:39,139
about.

86
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,620
People in the environment is something that we see as a dimension of leadership for great

87
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,160
leaders. And is that the same for you, Howie? Is that just, that's your one word, going

88
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,259
to positivity is how you impact the environment?

89
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,339
Yeah, absolutely. Because I think, I was reading something the other day, a book by a guy called,

90
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,560
I don't even know how to pronounce his name. It's Jesse Itzler. Anyway, he got a seal to

91
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,000
come and live with him for a month, like a Navy seal, and train him. And this bloke kept

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,319
saying to him, no matter how hard the workout is, keep going, because you know it is going

93
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,600
to end. It always ends. So I look at it like that. When things are hard, there will be

94
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,339
an end point. So when you get to the end point, you can look at it and think, gee, I bitched

95
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:25,139
and moaned the whole way through, but I got there. Or I was positive the whole way through,

96
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,879
and everybody saw me being positive, and I had a positive impact on the group, and we

97
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,259
still got there. I want to be the one that gets to the finish line being positive, rather

98
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,560
the one that really moaned and whinged the whole way.

99
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,000
Jodie, you've been a premiership captain and a captain of two clubs. Did you think

100
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,759
that your impact positively on others in the environment?

101
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:51,420
Yeah, I did. And certainly, modelling behaviours was something I thought a heap about. But

102
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,639
certainly internally, I just had a lot more knowledge about myself that I needed to get

103
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,759
to be the type of leader I would have liked.

104
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,259
What do you mean by that? You wish you had more knowledge of yourself looking back?

105
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:08,540
Looking back, yeah. I just had no idea where I sat personality-wise.

106
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,100
Until after footy. I'm a real outlier in certain areas of my personality.

107
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,800
Oh, you think?

108
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:24,420
Yeah, I can be very obsessive, and there's some shortcomings there and whatnot, which

109
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,379
are good for some things, but really poor for others. And I just had no understanding

110
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:33,480
of that until, I think until I was about 31, 32, which was a shame.

111
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:40,059
So if you look back, you couldn't have had a more successful AFL career. It's full of trophies,

112
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:45,360
as you used to remind us regularly. But you think if you had a better understanding of

113
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,700
yourself, you could have impacted others better just by knowing your personality type?

114
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,580
I think so. When I look back on my career, I was just so highly strung, so obsessive

115
00:08:52,580 --> 00:09:00,440
around performance and maximising output. And I just never really understood that other

116
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:08,259
people weren't wired the same way as that, or not to that same level. So to impact people

117
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:09,980
and just understanding that they...

118
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,039
Yeah.

119
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:15,419
...were driven by different things and different emotions and a different personality type

120
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:19,940
would have been something I wished I had had more knowledge around at the time.

121
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Did that take the joy out of it a little bit when you look back, you being so obsessive

122
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,600
about performance? Were you able to enjoy it along the way?

123
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,159
Well, I mean, I found it really rewarding, but I'm surprised that looking back now that

124
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:36,840
I'm just not nearly as stressed and uptight, just how tightly strung I was as a player,

125
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,399
I'm really surprised now over such a long period.

126
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,039
Okay.

127
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,019
Thanks so much, Chris Judd.

128
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:43,019
Thanks for coming in.

129
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,019
Absolutely.

130
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:45,019
Thank you for joining us.

131
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,019
You're welcome.

132
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,019
We'll be back, everyone.

133
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,019
Take it away.

134
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:49,019
You're welcome.

135
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,019
Have a great day, Chris Judd.

136
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:51,019
Thanks again.

137
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:52,019
Thanks for that.

138
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:53,019
And Kiara, we'll see you next time.

139
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:54,019
Bye.

140
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:55,019
Bye.

141
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,019
Bye-bye.

142
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:57,019
Bye.

143
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:58,019
Bye.

144
00:09:58,019 --> 00:09:59,019
See you then.

145
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:00,019
Bye.

146
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:01,019
See you.

147
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:02,019
See you.

148
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,019
Bye.

149
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,019
Bye.

150
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,019
Bye.

151
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:06,019
Bye.

152
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:07,019
Bye.

153
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,019
Bye.

154
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:09,019
Bye.

155
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:10,019
Bye.

156
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:17,120
out and so it should right and and and so if you've got good values inside and good culture

157
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,480
inside that's going to come out into all of the things you do um but if you don't and so if you're

158
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,980
projecting and this is often probably where some things get critiqued maybe rightfully as they

159
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:34,840
project a very positive image on the outside but there's massive dysfunction on the inside

160
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,639
and it's that dysfunction that everyone eventually says well that doesn't add up how

161
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:46,320
is how can you be double-minded or double life or like what so so i think it comes back to that

162
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,559
like our internal culture and our internal you know i suppose the flow and effect of me as a as

163
00:10:52,559 --> 00:11:00,320
a leader is huge and i've probably seen the years when in the times when i was not really focused on

164
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,580
that i was just focused on results and sales and outcomes and impact with with sort of missing the

165
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,620
the internal impact but i think it's a really cool question and

166
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:14,500
it's a very important focus for any leader of people and i think i liked the idea that there

167
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,299
wasn't a huge link between the internal battle or the internal challenges i face and then the

168
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:27,440
organization i get to lead and it turns out they're they're intrinsically linked and so if i'm

169
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,940
yeah and that that's the hard reality but i think as as a leader that's the first job

170
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:39,639
it's leading yourself it's taking the time to reflect and that's not like a

171
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:45,620
10-minute job that takes time um and you probably need help coaches mentors advisors and i had them

172
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:52,659
all in fact a couple years ago i i got a 2018 i think i i booked a session with a psychologist

173
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:59,720
and i promised you i was gonna cancel and then i i like i i hid myself on the way in and i in my

174
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,340
head i'm like i'm doing this once because people like you should see you you carry a lot of pressure

175
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,659
and i'm like i'm gonna do one and in this session i reckon he figured out i was only gonna do one

176
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:09,620
because he he said daniel you're gonna do this and i'm like i'm gonna do this and i'm gonna do this

177
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:15,720
you say that you have this fear of failure but i don't think you do and he said i actually think

178
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,840
you have a fear of rejection and as he said i started crying i couldn't stop i don't know where

179
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:26,980
it came from but he and then we ended up unpacking this like oh what fear of rejection yeah turns out

180
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:33,659
that was a thing in me and it went back all my life and and that inward journey helped me to

181
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:38,940
the point that man i kept those sessions going and now i'm not like hiding my way in i'm not

182
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,620
trying to tell everyone

183
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:44,580
like talk to someone do you know what i mean like like like you're crazy if you don't have

184
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:49,700
a psychologist like it's it's it is something shifted in me because i've kind of detached from

185
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:55,179
however i was thinking but that's actually helped me lead a lot more transparently and authentically

186
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:59,759
so i think that's the job for every leader that was really one of the highlights of the year for

187
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,740
me to chat with dan hearing his vulnerability around seeing a psychologist and being so open

188
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,440
about it and then spreading the positive experience he's had that was such an unique

189
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:22,120
way of impacting others in a positive manner another person with great passion about globally

190
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,379
impacting others is former socceru craig foster a legend of the round ball game and a consistent

191
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:32,259
advocate for human rights around the world craig has always been passionate about using sport as

192
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:37,059
a platform and you can hear in this highlight the way in which craig pushes the message that sport

193
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:43,080
is one of the best possible ways to impact others in a positive way you know i i just recognize that

194
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,659
look a broadcast and what you're doing now and so on is very very positive and i think it's a very

195
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:52,480
powerful and influential position and uh and it can be used for tremendous good as we've seen

196
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,860
around the world with trumpism and all of this type of things it can be used for really nefarious

197
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:04,460
untruthful things um and that's perhaps why it needs to be used uh for truth and for uh you know

198
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,340
what is good and to help people you know i have a responsibility through the platform that sport

199
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:16,639
has given me uh to help anyone who comes within my purview if i have time uh and

200
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:22,279
can do it in a you know an authentic substantive way you know not in a superficial way and what

201
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,980
the hakeem you know and i used to like every athlete you know i was ambassador for a thousand

202
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,840
things you know even when i was playing i was part of the republic movement you know i spoke at the

203
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:36,600
town hall here in sydney around the referendum on being a republic with malcolm turnbull uh and

204
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,659
you know homelessness domestic violence uh you know you name it you know i just think if people

205
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:46,200
came and said look these people don't have what you have they haven't had the same opportunity

206
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:52,559
they're in trouble and you could somehow help them then i just always felt compelled to do

207
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:58,059
whatever it is that i could fact check me if i get anything wrong along the way but uh you you

208
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:03,159
i believe said this the real power of a sporting career is the platform it gives you to do something

209
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:08,000
else it's why i work so hard now with human rights i wanted to start craig by asking you

210
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,320
it was an outstanding sporting career why is the next part of your life meant so much

211
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,980
because it's just about people and many of the lessons that we learn in sport

212
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,659
are the lessons that we learn in sport and the lessons that we learn in sport are the lessons

213
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:22,000
are the same and i've just taken those into the rest of my life in fact i've tried to make them

214
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,279
authentic you know what i've learned as i've gone on is that many of the propositions uh

215
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:33,620
the slogans that sport promotes a lot you know aren't necessarily as real as we'd like them to

216
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,720
be when we're young athletes we think that you know sport has this extraordinary power we think

217
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,679
that it's about people it's about humanism it's about solidarity and equality and all those things

218
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:46,559
but sport struggles to live up to that so you know the old

219
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:53,200
i've got i've committed myself to trying to make that occur i happen to believe that if sport does

220
00:15:53,200 --> 00:16:00,200
become more people-centered uh and that means speaking out uh for people uh who are facing

221
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:06,639
injustice for racial equality uh for gender equality all of these things then the world

222
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,299
will be a far better place there are a bracket of people craig to say i need my sport to be a

223
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:16,440
sanctuary away from the heaviness of dealing with these things i want to go to the foot i just want

224
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:16,659
to support the sport i want to support the sport i want to support the sport i want to support the

225
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:21,779
sport do i need at the same time to have to deal with these issues you would say yes you would say

226
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:26,340
sport needs to step up more than than it is well i'd say two things number one is that the people

227
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:31,360
who play sport are human beings and they have the same right as you to speak about any issue that

228
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,620
they feel uh comfortable about um i happen to think that human rights are important uh and that

229
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,240
we should all be helping others does and why should athletes be different um it's absolutely no no

230
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,899
different one of the reasons why that's been kind of propagated within the sports industry

231
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:53,100
because it's been led by um largely by sponsors and by commercial interests it's a bit like when

232
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,519
you talk about climate action in australia you know clearly fossil fuel companies are still very

233
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:03,620
much shaping the narrative of both government and many people in society and and industry and

234
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:08,000
business are a big part of that as is sport you don't see sport in australia being as prominent

235
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,900
as even the finance industry and and others at the moment so um i think this separation of

236
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,660
athletes and therefore sport because athletes are sports and they're not sports and they're not sports

237
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,579
the rest of the people involved are there just to facilitate for athletes to play that's their job

238
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:25,779
the the concept that they're not citizens the concept that they're not human beings

239
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:31,279
uh the concept that they shouldn't be care they shouldn't care about all the aspects of social

240
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:36,460
and civic and even political life when they're playing a sport is to my mind just completely

241
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,079
ridiculous i know that that's what people have been led to believe i know that's the way that

242
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:46,180
sport has conducted itself but i think it's wrong and sport has contributed to much harm in the world

243
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,619
um and one of the reasons it's contributed to a huge amount of harm is because of that uh you know

244
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:58,400
that kind of propaganda telling all the people everywhere that well sports exceptional to society

245
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,259
and you know we don't speak about anything we're just completely neutral from one code to another

246
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:08,740
as we venture back to a chat i really enjoyed with cricket superstar and the australian test

247
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:14,079
captain pat cummings whose take on positively impacting others moves from the dressing room

248
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,579
with the australian cricket team all the way to fatherhood

249
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,440
you know i try and be really consistent um you know naturally

250
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:28,079
you know i'm lucky i feel like i'm quite a happy positive person so um you know i try and bring

251
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:34,019
that to the table as much as i can try to stay curious and and open-minded and create a safe

252
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:40,220
space for people to be themselves and and talk to and i think you know cricket side or any you

253
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:46,519
know sporting side or office you you have this kind of critical mass of where most of the people

254
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,559
are and and what makes them tick and even if that's different to to me or someone else trying to

255
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:57,279
make sure we kind of encourage that as much as we can and facilitate that now i understand uh that

256
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:02,420
you're not far away from uh being a father in october with your beautiful partner beggy have

257
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:08,200
you thought about leadership through the eyes of of being a dad um have you given that some thought

258
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:16,259
i have a little bit um not as much as probably becky wishes i had um yeah naturally i think you

259
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,980
your own childhood and i was lucky i had a great childhood um you know i've got two brothers two

260
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:27,579
sisters parents are great so yeah you try and take the best things i guess out of that and then

261
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:34,400
yeah just how do i want to um kind of what life do i want to yeah give uh you know give the child so

262
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,660
um yeah i've thought a little bit i'm sure i'll think of more ideas but at the moment my head goes

263
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:46,299
to playing sport getting up to mischief as opposed to probably reality which would be nappies and no

264
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:52,140
i yeah i was having a look i've never never been to the blue mountains but uh it uh just looks like

265
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,599
a magic place that you grew up and i see as you said your two brothers uh two sisters and it looks

266
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,680
like an incredibly close-knit family the cummins family and what was it like i mean clearly the

267
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,980
person you are you know we're all a product of of our how would you describe it how has that

268
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:14,519
influenced the person you are yeah we had a big family so family of seven um five kids and i was

269
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:22,940
born and raised by my mother so uh in terms of i guess a cricketing and sporting sense we we were

270
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:29,079
so sporty i remember we went on a big holiday went on this one big holiday in my childhood um

271
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:36,240
over to europe and uh we took a football so every single photo in front of the you know eiffel tower

272
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,839
or um wherever we are we're passing a football louvre museum we're passing a footy down the

273
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:46,359
horse so um just always active always competitive

274
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:54,619
we had a big backyard space and just just fun we're always up to plenty of different things

275
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:59,460
us kids and mum and dad and um there's always adventure mum and dad are you know really

276
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:06,099
positive happy curious people so yeah you know just had a had a great childhood really lucky

277
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:11,339
i've just got an image of uh of my uh learning to kids on the spanish steps kicking footies off

278
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:16,400
the top of that uh amongst the crowd and trying to take speggies it sounds like a similar upbringing

279
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:22,180
it's the footy goes everywhere it's it's like an appendage in house even my my daughter is 16 so

280
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,900
it's a it's it's either in the dna or it's not isn't it mate it comes with us everywhere i know

281
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:33,480
we're in um we're in paris and my brother tried to drop kick over this huge tree and uh got stuck

282
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,359
up there so we spent a whole day in paris going to all the sports stores trying to see if we got

283
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,960
to share it well you know bill man i see i've seen you kick the footy pretty well mate is it

286
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,440
regrets i wish i played afl um as a kid both my brothers played a little bit but not till

287
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,940
probably kind of mid-teens we had a school across the road with a big field and we'd go there

288
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:08,400
literally every afternoon in winter and um and we'll just try and slot goals and you know

289
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,160
contests you had to kick right left foot um it would be out there for hours till dark um so i

290
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,099
love the afl swanee's used to go into

291
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:22,079
um you know scg and az stadium to watch the swanee's and uh yeah still follow along

292
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:28,400
really enjoyed that chat with pat cummings legend of australian cricket and captain of the men's

293
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,640
australian cricket team one of the most high profile leadership roles in australia and you

294
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,839
get a real sense of pat's values and leadership every time he speaks now moving again to a

295
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:45,279
conversation that had a huge impact scott pape is the barefoot investor and this grab is a

296
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,660
fantastic insight for me to be able to talk to him and to talk to him and to talk to him and to

297
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,940
into the values that scotty pape has the way he approaches his life he's got a lot of gold i would

298
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:57,299
strongly suggest checking out the full chat but for now this is scott pape on why positively

299
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:04,819
impacting others means a lot to him one of the things that i've tried to do is with barefoot

300
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:12,019
investor it became a huge and it is a huge community um and so what i try and do each week

301
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:16,660
in the newspaper and on my email it goes to like half a million people and i'm like oh my god i'm

302
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:23,240
people is to i try and tell people stories um and there's a lot of family violence of people that

303
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,539
have escaped in the middle of the night and who have been able to rebuild themselves

304
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:34,079
or um about little kids that have started a lemonade stand or stories of people that have

305
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:41,539
been able to rise up um through either barefoot investor or just because of them drawing a line

306
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:46,299
and saying this is what i want to do so for me um i sort of see the

307
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:52,200
community that i've built even though it's really big now as highlighting those stories

308
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,680
and and and celebrating them not sure you could positively impact people more than that and if you

309
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,579
if you think scotty pape doesn't live his values he had a subscription uh business every business

310
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:07,700
wants a subscription model and you shut it down and he said i mean it's extraordinary and i'm

311
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,839
going to do this all for free i'm going to get my newsletter out there and that's the way so if you

312
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:16,299
want to get weekly communication how do we get that with scott uh well uh either and then in the

313
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:22,099
or um go to barefootinvestor.com and you'll get the the email because a lot of us aren't born

314
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:27,779
with the finance cards we do other things and so to have that trusted provider and i think it's one

315
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:33,079
of the great assets in life when you find someone i ultimately trust everything scott pape does and

316
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:37,720
i think that maybe is you know your plain language and your point of difference isn't it is that trust

317
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:44,799
is there really uh really intensely you're a father of four now uh papy they're going to have

318
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,660
a different upbringing than you had now given the

319
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:52,500
success that you had how do you teach those values to them now with you you are a household

320
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,980
name and you've been an extraordinary success i know you've just gone on a trip around australia

321
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:00,240
i'd love to talk to you about that but how do you teach those values well i mean you know part of

322
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:07,319
i live on a farm in romsey um and you know really um like we've seen it in in working together

323
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:13,500
you know a couple of years ago i really made the decision to pull back on a lot of the media that

324
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:23,700
take the holidays school holidays off um and you know for me the kids growing up on a big farm

325
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,200
there's always something to do there's always sheep that um that need to be looked after there's

326
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,740
like just like a million jobs so for them you know they understand what i do but you know even

327
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:42,240
um before christmas they were at the agency that i work at and they were packing up food

328
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,059
hampers for people for families that that didn't have enough food for christmas

329
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,359
so for me it's really important that they understand that you know too much is given

330
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:56,420
much is expected yeah and so yeah they're that you know they're uh having to do you know a lot

331
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,640
of the the jobs and things because they've got the barefoot investor for a dad i'm gonna ask

332
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,400
you a question you might find this hard to answer there's so many i want to go back to the trip

333
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,880
around australia there and yeah your timing in lockdown in melbourne to get away with the family

334
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:14,420
it was a great story but is there a net worth amount that equals happiness for a family can

335
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,660
you actually give a number on that that you're going to give to your family

336
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:22,880
if you've got beyond three million dollars or ten million dollars or fifteen can you can you

337
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,299
have a guess at that well there was a there was a news.com um article um that that looked at a

338
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:34,339
survey and it said how much do you need to be financially well off and i think the figure was

339
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:43,660
about 360 grand a year that's five times the average income uh and so you know what i would

340
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:51,980
like you know we are judging our values when i grew up i was judging my values of people who

341
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:58,720
lived in in the country now our kids judge their values and and there's a lot in life

342
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,240
by what they see online yeah so it's completely warped yeah so for me again and just to tie into

343
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,940
to going around australia you know we were living basically we're free camping a lot of the time

344
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:16,140
you know we were you know just eating um you know on on the on the barbie um spending very little

345
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:22,359
and that was the most that was the best trip of our lives how much that's cost not that much i

346
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:26,460
mean i didn't have i didn't work for four and a half months so there's a there's a um there's a

347
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:31,220
cost there but just that idea that i don't know if i could give you a figure because i think it's

348
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:37,240
different for a lot of people but i think there are a lot of people that i meet that think they

349
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,819
need to earn more yeah and the definition of wealth is someone who's wealthier than you and

350
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:46,539
that can be a real trap because what really matters i think

351
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:46,640
you know i think it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's

352
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,720
is the time that you spend with your family ultimately i mean you can do a lot of things

353
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,579
in your life and make a lot of money but i met a lot of very wealthy people whose kids don't

354
00:27:55,579 --> 00:28:02,640
really like them yeah you know so for me once you have a roof over your head and you know you

355
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:11,019
pretty much paid it off um you got a decent car um you know everything else is gravy you know

356
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:17,990
money's not going to make you any happier that was scotty pape the barefoot investor finishing
