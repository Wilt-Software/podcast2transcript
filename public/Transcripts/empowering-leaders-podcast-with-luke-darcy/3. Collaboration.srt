00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:11,119
a listener production. Hello and welcome to episode three of a special series of Empowering

2
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,820
Leaders, highlighting the dimensions of what great leadership looks like in the 21st century

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,899
and some of the remarkable responses I've been getting from the leaders that I've had the

4
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:26,640
incredible pleasure of talking to right throughout 2022. It has been a great pleasure talking to a

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,120
diverse range of guests this year on the Empowering Leaders podcast, each with incredible stories to

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,359
tell and unique insight into how they lead. It's these type of insights that align with a great

7
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,719
passion of mine called a leader. You would have heard me talk about it throughout the series in

8
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,060
the year, the business co-founded with my great friend Matt Wadowitz. It's a place where leaders

9
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,299
like the ones you'll hear from today come together to collaborate and to learn from each other

10
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:54,539
in bespoke unique environments. If you're interested in learning some more about it,

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,140
love you to head to a leadercollective.com. We love collaborating with all sorts of leaders

12
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,100
across industry, sport arts, social venture,

13
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,739
you name it. You could be involved in a small business or simply wanting to improve the way

14
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:10,079
that you impact others in your environment. Encourage you to book a discovery call at a

15
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,299
leader and you can check out our signature Leader Connect program where we come together to learn,

16
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,459
to lead and to collaborate. Now, speaking of collaboration, it's what we think is one of

17
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:24,060
the most important aspects of so many parts of our lives, from our work relationships.

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,060
Collaborating is one of the ways leaders are able to impact their environment and to get the best

19
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,099
out of their team and other people.

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:48,549
Our first highlight is with a member of our Leader Connect family, legendary NBA coach Mike

21
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:52,790
Dunlap. And I asked Mike about collaborating with others and what it means to him.

22
00:01:53,269 --> 00:02:00,370
It's everything. And that's why the payback on collaboration is don't you dare, if you've had

23
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:05,549
other people help you, make sure that your door is always open. And, you know, the word yes comes

24
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,310
out of your mouth a lot. You can't always say yes, because sometimes you're just busy and those

25
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:10,569
things come out of your mouth. And that's why we're here today. And we're here to help you.

26
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:16,889
But share your information without charge. Be fearless and understand that if you really

27
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:22,030
believe in your self-esteem and who you are, there are no secrets. I don't think you have to

28
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:29,250
give everything away. That's not my point. But my point is be generous and be open and,

29
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,669
you know, understand that you're no big deal. You know, nobody's a big deal.

30
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:40,009
Don't do it that way. You know, do it the other way. And like you said, was it Rubenstein?

31
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:45,629
Rubenstein, you were talking about earlier. Yeah. And what he's talking about are missing

32
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:54,090
chips and building those chips within young men in particular. There's been an emasculation

33
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:02,650
unintentionally of generations now of young men who need to be shepherded through to, like I said,

34
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:09,530
know how to act and do certain things. But the problem is, is that the imprint or the modeling

35
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:18,409
is broken. So you have to go through these arduous steps in order to reclaim that soul

36
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:24,189
and who that young man ultimately is going to be because it's worth it. It's absolutely worth it.

37
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:30,270
It's imperative then in order to be that and have great energy that you be empathetic and have

38
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,310
compassion. And yet you have to get to, hey, look, we've got to hump it today and we got to get

39
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,969
going. You know, but I think that the positivity,

40
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:45,349
is the validation of, hey, this is going to be a hard today. This is hard because you got something

41
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:51,810
else going on. But yes, we can. And yes, we will. And then you roll up your sleeves and whatever

42
00:03:51,810 --> 00:04:01,389
that is, they see you also as a hard worker, as somebody who's not hypocritical, et cetera,

43
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:08,490
because as a leader, your talent has to be to delegate. I mean, you know, when I say hard worker,

44
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:15,830
if you're constantly down in the engine room, then you have no sight of where the ship is going.

45
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:21,769
And so you have to, you know, modulate. You have to be up there. Then you kind of got to move

46
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:26,509
down there, get into the boiler room, be empathetic, validate, and then say, hey,

47
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:32,769
that's a great job, especially when things are good. We call it praise, prompt, and lead. The

48
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:38,389
prompt is, hey, there's what you did with the shovel to get the coal in the stove. Let me show

49
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:39,250
you a better way.

50
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,990
You know, and now you show it. So you're kind of being critical because you say you've got a

51
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:50,189
better way that he might slope his shoulders or she might slope her shoulders. And so you have

52
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:54,689
to say, hey, you see that body language there? That's not going to play well because we're going

53
00:04:54,689 --> 00:05:01,629
to move through a couple of buyers here. And so we need to have a better shoulders back, eyes up,

54
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:07,430
greet them. You're important. And I think you're damn good at what you do. I think you're the best.

55
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,209
But I'm going to tell you right now,

56
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:14,170
you got to do better with those shoulders back and give me some eye contact. We got that? Boom.

57
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,069
And then walk away from them. You don't have to sit there and admonish them. And you praised them.

58
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:23,050
You gave them a compliment. You prompted them. You told them and showed them what you want.

59
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:29,870
And now get away from them. And so those are all methodologies. So positivity sounds good,

60
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,610
but it's amoeba-like and you have to be more specific with it. And you have to have

61
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,670
techniques and skills in order to distribute.

62
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:41,750
So that it's not just a puff of smoke.

63
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,089
Well, that has got to be one of my favorite conversations this year.

64
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,649
Coming from a sporting background, hearing the way Mike is empowering his team with collaboration

65
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:55,189
and that get in the trenches mindset is fascinating to see. If you didn't hear the

66
00:05:55,189 --> 00:06:00,689
whole Mike Dunlap episode, go back. The Miracle Morning is something that you want to learn from

67
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:04,949
for sure. Love catching up with Mike Dunlap. So staying in the sporting landscape, I had the

68
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,189
pleasure of chatting with Lakeisha Patterson, or Lucky as she's more commonly known,

69
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:14,410
six-time world record-holding Paralympian who has overcome mental and physical challenges,

70
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,449
which are so difficult to fathom. It was Lucky's grit and determination that got her to where she

71
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:24,589
is today. But the humble way in which she presents herself has come through when she talks about the

72
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:28,990
collaboration she has with her team, her parents, and others that have helped her along the way.

73
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:35,449
It's so important and so vital. And I would not be where I am today without the support of

74
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:39,449
my team around me. I think it is incredibly...

75
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:46,209
important and vital to everyone that they have a network around them. It definitely does take a

76
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:52,410
village to... Well, it's taken a village to raise me and to get me along this journey that I'm on.

77
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:58,290
And it's not always easy, I suppose, being an athlete and to get sponsors and people that

78
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:02,750
are willing to invest in you and help you out throughout your journey. And I am very

79
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:09,509
fortunate to have had incredible people around me. And I want to make sure that the people that

80
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:15,910
I work with align with my values and I align with theirs so that we can get the most out of

81
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:22,170
the collaboration and the partnership. And I can give back as much as they've been able to help me.

82
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:30,029
It's really special. And I suppose, from my family, my friends, my teammates, my squad,

83
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:38,029
to my sponsors supporting me with my recovery, my training, where all the little things like that is

84
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:39,209
able to help me.

85
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:44,470
I think it's really important for me to be able to grow and achieve the best that I can. And also

86
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:50,089
sharing what they do and the different organizations and how they can help different people in different

87
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:58,910
areas. It's all really just networking as well and being able to get into that space. And this

88
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:04,490
could help someone else. This could help you. And it's really made an impact in my life and

89
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:09,410
hope it can to others. So for those that don't know me, I was born with

90
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:15,069
cerebral palsy, left hemiplegia due to the trauma I sustained during birth. So essentially,

91
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:22,949
I was born breech, blue and not breathing. So it was a little bit of a tricky situation. And

92
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:28,370
essentially, down the line, because of that trauma sustained, I was diagnosed with cerebral

93
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:34,250
palsy. So essentially, that means that the left side of my body doesn't quite work as well as my

94
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,570
right. I don't have as much function, balance, coordination.

95
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:49,330
And a little challenging things along the way. So I can't fully open my left hand as well as

96
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:54,549
balance and kind of dragging my left foot a little bit. So my right side is definitely more dominant

97
00:08:54,549 --> 00:09:03,230
and I have to do a lot compared to my left. But I suppose for myself, I've just been accustomed to

98
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:08,330
being able to adapt from a very young age. And alongside that, I was also diagnosed with epilepsy

99
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,309
when I was five.

100
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:16,090
And mycographia at 12, meaning that my writing is extremely minute. So I have to use technology

101
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:21,850
to be able to communicate. So it's pretty awesome that we are able to live in the world that we live

102
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,870
in today, that I am able to be able to communicate with people. But yeah, I suppose for a lot of

103
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:32,129
people, it can be seen as quite a lot of challenges. But for myself, I've just been raised to be able

104
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:36,889
to overcome anything that's come my way. And I definitely don't see it as a disadvantage at all.

105
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:39,509
It's a remarkable story. At the age of five,

106
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:43,350
is when you were diagnosed with epilepsy and reading some of your life story,

107
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:47,649
a theory that I think you were suggesting that perhaps it was on the back of a bad

108
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:54,190
batch of vaccinations. And I'm going back to Lucky. I'm here talking to Lucky and a lot of

109
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:59,250
people would think, God, how much hardship does one person have to endure? How much bad luck? I

110
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,870
mean, do you remember ever thinking, why me at some stage along the way?

111
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:08,350
I think it's definitely very easy for a lot of people when they come into these difficult

112
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:08,970
circumstances.

113
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:14,350
Why me? And I definitely am human as well. And I have gone through that. I suppose

114
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:19,870
when I was younger, I didn't really know anything different. So I don't think I really had that

115
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:25,210
mindset then until, you know, growing up a little bit more and actually being aware of these

116
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:30,850
differences compared to my classmates around primary school and high school age. But I suppose

117
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,769
for myself, I was just growing up with an incredibly strong mom who raised myself and my two

118
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,509
other sisters on her own. And she really instilled in me that power of being able to do things that I

119
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:40,509
wanted to do. And I think that's something that I've always wanted to do. And I think that's

120
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:40,549
something that I've always wanted to do. And I think that's something that I've always wanted to do.

121
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:45,230
And, you know, it's not what happens to you, it's how and what you make of it and how you can

122
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:50,190
overcome those circumstances. And yeah, it is a bit ironic that my name and nickname is Lucky,

123
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,470
but I suppose for myself, it's also a great way of showing that despite what

124
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:02,649
challenges have been thrown my way, I have seen the other side of it. So yeah, it's all,

125
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:08,149
I suppose, how you approach the situation. Well, what an incredible athlete, incredible

126
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:09,149
insight. Lucky Patterson.

127
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:14,190
Lucky Patterson. Great to catch up with her. Next conversation was really special to me. Farmer

128
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,909
Dave Graham, a changemaker in every sense of the word. He runs a program called Rough Track,

129
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:26,529
spelt R-U-F-F. It's an organization helping at-risk kids get their life off a path of

130
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:32,570
potentially dangerous behavior and onto a clearer, more focused way of living. Dave's insights

131
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:37,769
highlight just how the program uses collaboration to help kids and their families get back on track.

132
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:43,990
You can't raise a kid without a village. So we have our tracker network, which is,

133
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,629
there's nine of our organizations throughout New South Wales and Queensland. So we're constantly

134
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:52,590
collaborating with each other about what it is that we can do in each of our communities. We

135
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:57,990
catch up every two months. We all visit each of us in our silos to make sure we break down that

136
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:04,750
silo within their own community because this job can be all consuming. But this organization,

137
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,750
Rough Track, only started with heat.

138
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:18,309
The kids are coming to us. They're enemy number one on all fronts. But today when I took the bus,

139
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:24,970
a busload of kids out to do some flood recovery work, stopped on the side of the road in our bus

140
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:30,330
and then right next to us was a PCYC full of cops. Kids are all having a yarn to them. And that's

141
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:36,090
when you know you're breaking down barriers. So when you collaborate with the enemy, you find out

142
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,750
that they're not actually the enemy. And that's when you know you're breaking down barriers.

143
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:43,769
And that's when breaking down barriers, whichever direction you can go, be it the general public,

144
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:47,769
again, a lot of our kids hate the general public because they think the general public hates them.

145
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:55,529
And giving them the opportunity to have a pathway of communication to be able to

146
00:12:56,169 --> 00:13:02,730
get a hand and give a hand. It's just everything that we do is collaboration. And, you know,

147
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,529
oftentimes just getting our kids to work together on a project to lift something that's heavy to

148
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:11,610
together. You've got to communicate and you've got to work together to be able to get that because

149
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,330
I guarantee you every kid that comes here, the first thing that he's going to do if I ask him

150
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:22,409
to help out is drop it and go, fuck this. Fuck, this is shit. But give him a couple of weeks or

151
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:27,929
give her a couple of weeks and they're like, okay, ready? One, two, three, and away they go.

152
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:31,610
And then they're communicating with each other about how it is they're going to get that heavy

153
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,809
object to where they want to go. And then afterwards the smile on their face when they get something

154
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:42,970
as a team, where they want it to go, which is exactly what I saw only about an hour ago,

155
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:48,409
when the last three kids left here, they built a huge big fire pit, a big, massive metal fire pit

156
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:53,450
with rough track on the side. And they had to get it in one of the kid's boots of his mum's car.

157
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:57,129
And the fact that they all got it in there and then I just saw them all turn around and

158
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:01,769
smile and high five each other. It's just like, that's gold, that's collaboration.

159
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:07,129
And I mentioned in the preamble that you're an internationally renowned a dog trainer and the,

160
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:12,870
use of dogs in the Rough Track program is at the core of the program as well. Is that for every

161
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:18,389
child? Does every child get to select a dog? Is that part of it? Yeah, that's what does make us

162
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:24,649
unique in the tracker network, which is that every kid does get a dog. I mean, we've got 30 dogs here,

163
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:31,730
so every kid gets to bond with their own dog. And it's just crazy cool how each different child,

164
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:38,190
depending on their own personality type and their excitement levels, which dog they end up

165
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,409
choosing. And of course, the dog's got to choose them as well. They've got to have a coming together

166
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:46,809
of the relationship because kids need to learn how to manage a relationship. Often they don't

167
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:51,490
have good role models of what a healthy relationship looks like. So having that relationship with their

168
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:56,789
dog is teaching them how to have a healthy relationship moving forward to break any

169
00:14:56,789 --> 00:15:01,389
domestic violence cycles that they maybe have dealt with themselves. I mean,

170
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:01,590
let's...

171
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:06,750
Let's face it. I mean, in our young people, some of them are domestic violence perpetrators

172
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:13,830
themselves, and some of them have received that in their own young relationships, let alone their

173
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:20,389
family relationships. So that dog is teaching them how to be kind, how to be compassionate,

174
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:24,909
but also how to communicate effectively without language. You know, you can't just say to a dog,

175
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:30,750
hey, do this. You know, you've got to use body language. And oftentimes when a teenager,

176
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:38,309
we've all seen it. We've been at ourselves. They don't give much. They grunt. And their body

177
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:41,730
language is usually, I hate the world when you see them first thing in the morning because they don't

178
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:46,029
want to be out of bed. They were playing games all night on their computer. So, you know, it's

179
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:51,529
learning how to activate a dog and how to activate a relationship by being involved, by being present,

180
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:57,450
but also making sure that the mood isn't just done by your words, but also done by your behavior.

181
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:00,529
So that behavioral exchange coming from the dogs is...

182
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,470
Absolutely key to giving these kids that strong ability to create healthy relationships.

183
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:10,789
And I don't think non-dog lovers quite appreciate what you're saying. Dennis,

184
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:15,649
this blue staffie in our house is, but I say this seriously, is by far and away the most important

185
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:21,309
contributor to the house. And I've got four kids, three teenagers, one turns 12 next week.

186
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:26,889
They pour, the teenagers, they pour their love into Dennis. And that's how they express themselves

187
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:30,350
because he doesn't yell back. He doesn't tell them to make their bed. And he's got this

188
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,830
incredible intuition around, you know, who's having an off day. And I love that you're

189
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,970
extrapolating that out to kids. And I suppose the brilliant part too, is that at the end of it,

190
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:47,669
I understand that you make them pass that back on at the end, don't you? So it's not a dog for life.

191
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,330
It's, this is a learning experience. Can you explain why that's important as well?

192
00:16:51,929 --> 00:17:00,669
Yeah. So the idea of being able to give, give an opportunity to, the idea is that,

193
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:06,069
you can love something and love it, holus bolus, and it's, it's your everything and it's your

194
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:14,470
whole world, but then you've got to let go. And oftentimes men aren't taught to let things go.

195
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:19,430
And that's why we have these terrible atrocities that happen in our society of crimes against,

196
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:24,369
and mostly, mostly women, but also men, because we don't know how to let go of something that we

197
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:30,289
love because not all relationships are forever. In fact, most relationships we have for short

198
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:30,730
periods of time, we don't know how to let go of something that we love. And that's why we have

199
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,569
but they can be very intense. So to have that skill of being able to form this amazing

200
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:41,190
relationship, to work together, to camp in your swag together as the kids do with their dogs

201
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:47,089
and, and really build this beautiful relationship that takes them to, you know,

202
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:53,809
audiences of tens of thousands, which the kids perform with their dogs together right around

203
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:59,269
Australia. But then to be able to let it go is such a unique part of the program, which,

204
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:00,710
which gives us,

205
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:06,549
the knowledge that that kid is ready for the world and is ready as a fully fledged adult that

206
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:12,230
knows that I can love, but I can let go. And I don't need to hold on or force a relationship to

207
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:18,430
continue when it's past its use by date. So when a kid comes to me and says, Hey, you know, I'm

208
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:24,990
ready to move on. All I'm waiting for that young person to say is that, and I really want my dog

209
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:30,269
to stay in the program for another young person. And that's when I know that kid has broken the

210
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:37,730
cycle of domestic violence and broken the cycles of dependency and, and is, is no longer anything

211
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:43,309
but a self-empowered, resilient, young person ready to take on the world with their boots on

212
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:49,670
and their, their brain set for the abilities to really give back to society as an independent

213
00:18:49,670 --> 00:19:01,970
human. Collaboration is such an important part of leadership as we see it in great leaders in

214
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,609
the 21st century. It's a big focus for the work that we're doing at Alita. And one of the

215
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:10,789
people that we've had the pleasure of including in our leadership pods, our signature program,

216
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:17,130
Alita Connect is the great Ange Postacoglu, coach of footballing giant Celtic FC. Ange has been a

217
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,569
great advocate for collaboration and he's part of one of our Alita Connect signature programs.

218
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:26,069
He catches up on a regular basis with Luke Beveridge from the Western Bulldogs and the AFL,

219
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:31,529
Neil Craig, legend of high performance, Brian Gorgian, who is an Australian basketball coaching

220
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:36,650
legend. But you don't have to be a world-leading coach like that group to contribute and engage

221
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:41,210
with one of our Alita Connect programs. Encourage you to check it out. So with those conversations

222
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,869
being had, when I asked Ange about how he's collaborating, not surprising to me that he

223
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:50,650
had such a diverse and remarkable insight. I'm probably a little bit old school in that,

224
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:55,210
in that, you know, I've kind of haven't had mentors or people I've felt. And as I said

225
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:01,750
earlier, I think maybe if I was starting out again in today's world, I maybe wouldn't take

226
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,670
do it the way I've done it. But within that though, now, even now,

227
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:11,650
I still know that what's really important for me is the people I work with, not just

228
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:18,349
the players, but the staff. They're a vital sort of conduit to me creating the right environment.

229
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:25,309
So in every aspect of it, they're my collaborators. They're the people I work with every day.

230
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:31,190
And I try to empower them as much as I possibly can, give them as much responsibility, almost

231
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:36,650
like they feel like they're in charge. And in many respects, they are, even though I'm

232
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:42,869
I've got sort of my fingerprints all over it. You know, as the old adage of, you know,

233
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:48,109
I tell people what to do, but I don't tell them how to do it. You know, that's what they

234
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:52,230
bring to the table. You know, whatever your role is, this is your role. This is what I

235
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,289
want you to do. But man, do it your way, you know, bring your own personality. And in a

236
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:01,730
sense, those people, rather than, I think in the end, feeling like they're working for

237
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:06,470
you, they're working with you, you know, and I think that's really important. And, you

238
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:06,650
know, I think that's what I want to do. And I think that's what I want to do. And I think

239
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:06,730
that's what I want to do. And I think that's what I want to do. And I think that's what

240
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:06,769
I want to do. And I think that's what I want to do. And I think that's what I want to do.

241
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:13,569
But I, in kind of, in my game, it's pretty common practice that when you move around

242
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:17,950
as a kind of coach or a manager, you take a group of people with you because there's

243
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:23,930
a sense of security in that and people understanding. And I've tried to shy away from that. I've

244
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:27,809
kind of moved myself. So even when I went to Celtic, I kind of went there on my own,

245
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:31,890
which was very unusual. And everyone sort of found it bizarre that I'd move sort of

246
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,609
halfway across the world and not take anyone with me, no staff member, no one who already

247
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:36,150
knew me.

248
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,309
And, you know, sort of a trusted ally. I was literally walking in and I was the only new

249
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:45,289
person in there. Everyone else was there from last year. And, you know, how do you get those

250
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:49,930
people? But I love that because that means there's another group of people I've got to

251
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,529
sort of get to believe in me and this new vision. So that means I'm going to be at my

252
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:59,170
best. I'm on super high alert. Whereas if I'd taken half a dozen people with me, maybe

253
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,630
that would dull those senses a little bit because I know, well, he's got that in, he

254
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,650
already knows what he's doing. He already knows what he's doing. So, you know, I'm

255
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:11,890
kind of not at my best. So when I do that, it means that I need to then make sure that,

256
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:19,890
you know, everyone who's working with me feels part of, you know, an important part of the

257
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:24,509
machine we're kind of building. And so, you know, for me, that's where the collaboration

258
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:30,150
comes in is that even though I'm kind of, like I said, in many respects, people would

259
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:34,410
look at me and say, well, he's very old school in the way I work in terms of I'm kind of

260
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,470
the dominant leader.

261
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:41,750
I think when you walk into the Watch Us work, you wouldn't get that sense. I think you'd

262
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:49,430
see that everyone is working hard at it. Everyone has responsibility. Everyone's a leader in

263
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:56,490
their own right. Celtic in Glasgow, it goes beyond that because for the people who love

264
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:00,829
that football club, they're not supporters. They're not fans. You know, it's not for them

265
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:06,630
that, you know, they look forward to a game. It's for them, it's part of their life. It's

266
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:13,890
as much a part of their life. It's an extended family member. And I'm not talking about a

267
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:18,630
distant family member. This is a family member that they bring into their household, that

268
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:23,890
sits at the dinner table with them, that organises their year, organises their, you know, their

269
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:29,369
significant moments. You know, so when we're getting the fixture list out on Friday and

270
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:35,750
people will map out the whole year, the next 12 months around the fixture list. And that's

271
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,630
because it's generational.

272
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:43,769
It's been passed down from, you know, great grandparents to great grandparents to fathers

273
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:52,109
and sons and mothers and daughters. And for that, then you walk into that and understand

274
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:58,369
that everything I do, whether that's not just in a game sense, but every time I speak or

275
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:04,930
every time, you know, I'm seen or I'm heard from has an impact on that each and every

276
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,529
household. It's massive.

277
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:12,089
And then you put the expectations, because it is a league where, you know, when you look

278
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:16,529
at it at the moment, it's Rangers and Celtic that have been the most dominant by far clubs

279
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:20,930
and people think, oh, well, at least you guarantee, you know, you're going to be successful.

280
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:26,069
But what people don't understand is that finishing second in this league is you may as well finish

281
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:31,470
last. It's not, it's not well done. You know, you got close. Second is not, so every year

282
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:36,630
the expectations are you will win and you will be successful. So all of that sort of

283
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:42,109
encompassed is, is, it is, it's, it's, it's probably one of the most sort of high profile

284
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:49,430
pressurised positions in terms of the football club. The flip side of that is I love it.

285
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:56,420
You know, I mean, that's, that's what I've always wanted. And my frustrations with Australia

286
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:01,500
and Australian soccer was, it was always being that it wasn't the people who loved the game

287
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,420
or the people who hated the game. It was the apathy that sort of landed in between, which

288
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,019
was probably the biggest part of it.

289
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,440
People just didn't care. You know, I mean, even when people had a crack at soccer in

290
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,980
Australia, I, I kind of, I didn't mind that because, okay, that's, that's somebody being

291
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,460
passionate about it. And the ones who love it in Australia, you know, even that, there

292
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,019
was, you know, we weren't even a united voice in that, but that, I could live with that.

293
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:29,460
But it was the apathy in between that, you know, people just didn't care that it just

294
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,720
would churn in my guts because I love this thing. This was my passion. So now to be right

295
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,299
smack bang in the centre of it. It almost like,

296
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,539
this is where I was supposed to end up at some point in my career, you know.

297
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,920
Ange Postacoglu there, one of the great coaches in world sport and one of the highlights of

298
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,200
the year for me. Starting in the world of sport now, but moving from pitch side to pool

299
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,019
side, I got to talk to Olympic great Ariane Titmuss. The Tokyo Olympics were the stage

300
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:04,000
for Ariane's greatness. She became a dual Olympic gold medalist as she beat out the

301
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,539
great American, Katie Ledecky. The memorable moment outside of the pool being

302
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,819
a coach, Dean Boxall's incredible celebration. And it's a relationship that Ariane touches

303
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:17,740
on when I asked her about what collaboration means to her.

304
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,240
Certainly Dean is my biggest partner through all of this. There's obviously a lot of other

305
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:30,940
people that play a big role. But he is someone who we made this deal. If he writes the program

306
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,579
the best that he can, I will execute it the best that I can. And so it certainly is a

307
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:38,500
partnership. I couldn't do it without him. He's quite an eccentric person. He's got a

308
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:44,819
very eccentric personality and I don't think that he would work well with some people because

309
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:49,680
he does set such high standards and he has quite an out there personality. But for some

310
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:55,559
reason he just found the key to me and we just clicked straight away. And I think our

311
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:00,420
personalities just gel perfectly. I mean, you'd think that they'll probably clash because

312
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:08,420
I'm quite opinionated and out there and, you know, quite fiery, but, but it's, it's, it's

313
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,700
it just works. And I think probably because of our work ethic, we work really well together.

314
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:19,440
He gets quite frustrated if he sees things not being done the best that they can be.

315
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,740
And so I try to do everything as best I can to keep the peace as well. But it's more so

316
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:31,619
with us, it's about making deals. And so, I mean, even this week, I've just come back

317
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:35,960
from break and he said to me, you know, are you giving me the green light to go? Like

318
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,319
we've got less than two years. Are you giving

319
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:43,220
the green light to go and and put you under pressure and um go through those hard moments

320
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:49,000
again and and for me it's not even a question um for sure like if he he's got to do what he's got

321
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,900
to do to get the best out of me and some people can't handle that but um i'm i'm open to anything

322
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:01,740
to get get more out of me and and reach my potential and i he just knows how to how to get

323
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,400
that and i love hearing that he does ask that question and he's and he knows the answer i'm

324
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,839
assuming but without asking it you're not part of the process are you and then to hear you say

325
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:15,519
hey i've signed up to that he's done his best and he's working overtime and not sleeping at night

326
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:20,700
i'm going to hold up my end of the bargain as best i can it's great you know we're a bit obsessed

327
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,900
with leadership and leadership stories but in the past that wouldn't have been a coach

328
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:29,140
relationship is having you part of the once you sign on i'm assuming all bets are off you know

329
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:35,240
you then do your best but uh it sounds like you're included in it uh to that point yeah well he always

330
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,680
when he was an age group coach i had an age grouper come to me and go i want to win at national age

331
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:47,039
and he goes okay if you want to win then you have to understand what that's going to take so

332
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,220
um are you ready to sign on to what i'm gonna have to do to get the best out of you and

333
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:56,960
and they go yeah yeah yeah and then you know training happens and they get put under pressure

334
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,480
and they've got to repeat things and and they don't like it and you know he goes well you're

335
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,559
the one that came to me and said you want to win he said you telling me you want to win is the worst

336
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:12,099
because it gives me the right to go after you and try and get the best out of you but

337
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:17,480
for me um i love it i love being pushed to the limit i love doing the repeats i

338
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:23,740
love having the feeling of knowing that while my competitors are done training and or asleep

339
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:29,059
on the other side of the world i'm here doing the extra and um i think that's why we work so

340
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:35,920
well together the coach and athlete relationship is always meaningful and special but hearing the

341
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:42,200
and dean work together and collaborate is a remarkable insight to finish off the conversation

342
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,500
in a space that's really important to me and i'm sure many others being a father of four education

343
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,180
and the way our kids are learning and being taught is one of the greatest responsibilities in our

344
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:57,859
society so when i got to sit down with christine causey one of australia's leading educators and

345
00:29:57,859 --> 00:30:02,200
principal at rudy hill high school in the western suburbs of sydney i was able to get a meaningful

346
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,000
and practical insight into how collaboration has worked well for her

347
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:13,799
and the school i think it has worked very well for us at rudy hill around our strategic projects

348
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:20,420
it does work particularly well in education when you've got people who who not only have the shared

349
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:24,740
interest in what they're doing but also have a shared expertise i think we face some real

350
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:31,460
challenges of embarrassing people when we insist on having people forced collaboration

351
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:36,319
uh i like to think of i i actually don't try not to

352
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:41,319
use the word too much we did a big executive project where we tried to define collaboration

353
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,579
at rudy hill high school and what we ended up deciding was we weren't very collaborative we

354
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:49,859
were just a school and um it was pretty it was pretty funny because we read everything

355
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:55,400
uh we read everything and it ended up being the most hilarious discussion as we tried to put it

356
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:00,460
together but what we those with an interest need to be able to share it that's collaborative

357
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,460
and collaborative is it's it's really quite critical

358
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,380
for building a

359
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,240
for building your culture if you want to have a kind of shared culture

360
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,420
so one of the reasons the student agency is so important at rudy hill

361
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,680
is because they're part of the collaboration

362
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:22,180
uh they are they're very much part of the collaboration and they're very much part of

363
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:30,420
the conversation uh so again we must never think that young people should be left out of it they're

364
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:35,859
not there to be done to now they're there to interact with us and give us feedback and help us

365
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:42,160
i like to think we have a very high level of collaboration at rudy hill and i also work

366
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,019
with a number of colleagues in our local area and i like to think we're highly collaborative too

367
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:54,609
but boy covid posed some challenges that was legendary australian educator christine causey

368
00:31:54,609 --> 00:31:59,430
there taking us to the end of a remarkable insight into collaboration and how some of

369
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:03,650
this year's guests have gone about leading teams and working with others throughout their incredible

370
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:07,849
lives next week a focus on communication and how the leaders at rudy hill have been able to

371
00:32:07,869 --> 00:32:11,849
we've spoken to through this year have gone about communicating with clarity and sending
