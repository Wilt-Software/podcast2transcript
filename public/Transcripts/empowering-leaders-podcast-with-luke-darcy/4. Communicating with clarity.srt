1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,080
a listener production. Welcome to episode four of a special series of the Empowering Leaders

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,019
podcast, highlighting the dimensions of leadership we see in a new generation of purpose-driven

3
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:20,719
leaders and the incredible responses I've been getting from the diverse range of people we've

4
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,460
had the great pleasure of talking to this year. Sat down with some remarkable people on Empowering

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,800
Leaders, each with an incredible story to tell and unique insight into how they lead. So these

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,759
types of insights that align with a great passion of mine, Alita, the business co-founded with my

7
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,799
great friend Matt Waterwitz. It's a place where leaders like the ones you'll hear from today

8
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:44,979
come together to collaborate, to learn in bespoke, unique environments. If you're interested in

9
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:49,439
learning some more about it, please head to alitacollective.com. We love collaborating with

10
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:55,000
all sorts of leaders across industry, sport, social venture, the arts. You might be starting

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,740
a small business or simply just want to improve the way you impact others in your environment.

12
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,740
We would encourage you...

...to book a discovery call and check out our signature Alita Connect program.

14
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,799
Communicating with great clarity is such an important aspect of our lives.

15
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,239
Great leaders find ways to communicate with everyone in their environment,

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,900
shifting and changing their messages so every person in every context understands the mission

17
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:34,620
and the goal of the situation. Our first highlight is from a remarkable chat, one of the most popular

18
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,680
episodes this year, premiership coach and an old teammate and friend of mine, Luke Beveridge.

19
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:40,439
This time, we're going to talk about how to be a leader.

20
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,540
Just to mention, hit home for Bevo as you'll hear in this insight.

21
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:51,540
Setting the scene and providing context is absolutely critical for all of our people.

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:00,079
But I think it gets back to the learning mediums and to continue to think about how do you,

23
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:09,960
in a group setting, how many can actually process the spoken word? If you speak for 10 minutes,

24
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,199
what are they going to do? What are they going to do? What are they going to do? What are they going to do?

25
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,780
What are they going to take in? Most of us, I think, have got a real appetite for the visual

26
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,919
mediums, whether it's pictures or videos. And it's such an effective way to get your message across.

27
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:29,680
And the physical side of it, actually, whether you're walking through or demonstrating and

28
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,500
being physically active, which you can't always do in a normal workspace,

29
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:40,180
is really valuable in what we do, obviously, in a high skill game sense.

30
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:54,419
So as far as the communications go, exploring the best mediums, reminding people how they can do it

31
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:59,439
better. And that constant loop of feedback, especially with our coaches, is to, hey,

32
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:06,780
think about this, understand your audience. Because the one-on-one connection is a little

33
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,939
bit simpler. It's just when you've got a group, Cody,

34
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,020
we've got a group of coaches, we've got a group of coaches, we've got a group of coaches,

35
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,180
we've got a group of coaches, we've got a group of coaches, we've got a group of coaches,

36
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,280
we've got a group of coaches, we've got a group of coaches, we've got a group of coaches,

37
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,319
we've got a group of coaches, we've got a group of coaches, we've got a group of coaches,

38
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:18,599
is the most challenging. And I think I probably, as far as the spoken word goes,

39
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:28,180
I've always been somewhere between a mumbler and a reasonable orator. And you can get lazy.

40
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:35,680
And I think I've become more conscious about pronouncing my words a little bit better,

41
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,159
because I'm pretty laid back most of the time. And I think I've become more conscious about

42
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:55,500
And I think that can be construed as, you know, almost being a, it starts to connect you with your history and you become known as a skateboarder more than a coach.

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:06,960
So I've become a little bit more mindful of pronouncing my words and making sure that I get the message across in a fluent way.

44
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,620
I'm always, you know, trying to describe yourself, Bevo, as almost the impossible task.

45
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,060
And I don't know if you sense that as well.

46
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:19,100
But to me, you've always had this great emotion, great connection, great empathy for people.

47
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,800
And perhaps those stories that I shared before are evidence of that.

48
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:30,300
It always felt to me like you were thinking about how other people were going at any particular stage and a great love for people.

49
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:35,939
You know, I use that word love on purpose because not many people in our era would have felt that way.

50
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,939
But you also...

51
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:39,319
If you cross the line with you, Bevo, there's a line.

52
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:46,600
And you can be pretty direct when that line's crossed and maybe even a little bit brutal when that's the case.

53
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:49,220
Is that a fair way to describe it?

54
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:50,660
Yeah, maybe.

55
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,560
I think my default is to love and care for people first.

56
00:04:55,579 --> 00:05:06,639
I give people chances if, you know, there are accidents or unintentional outcomes where people's best intentions were there.

57
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:20,480
But I must admit, I don't give people many chances when the early read is that they're not a good person or that they're selfish and they won't hesitate to do wrong by people around them.

58
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,939
I don't tolerate that.

59
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:35,100
And unfortunately, I think what happens is, you know, 99% of the time, you're a caring person who, you know, wants to help others whenever you can.

60
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:36,480
And on the odd occasion...

61
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:44,019
On the odd occasion where maybe there's some emotion and it is a bit edgy, that's sometimes what you're remembered for.

62
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,600
And I'm sensitive around that because it's still a part of me.

63
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:53,279
And in what I do now, I've got to be really careful that there's no controversy.

64
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,339
Yeah, it's a fascinating insight, Bevo.

65
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:02,939
I mean, to me, I think that's as, you know, greater part of you as any part.

66
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:04,439
The care and the love comes out.

67
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,920
But I love the fact that people around you know exactly.

68
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:09,180
Where they stand and always have done.

69
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:13,600
I think even from that really young age, you could, you know, knowing you at that time,

70
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,300
you could stand pretty clearly on where you're still with Luke Beveridge.

71
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:20,139
Is that something that you try and soften a bit when you get older?

72
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:22,259
Or it's just that that's your DNA and that's who you are?

73
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,920
I think, you know, I've matured like all of us, you know, and got to know myself a little bit better.

74
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:33,860
I'm fortunate that I've been lucky in life, you know, at different stages in my life.

75
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,620
I've worked hard.

76
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:35,860
And...

77
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,860
And...

78
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:41,579
And not just in my working life, but, you know, in my relationships with my family.

79
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,079
I've had stability.

80
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,279
I'm fortunate in many, many ways.

81
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,279
And I don't think I was...

82
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,079
I think I believe I was a later mature.

83
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:53,939
I had that...

84
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,139
My personality was probably a little bit volatile for too long.

85
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,300
And probably until, you know, into my early 30s.

86
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,800
I think that was when I really...

87
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:07,480
Really came around.

88
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,040
And coaching really helped me with that.

89
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:14,680
Because you're not only technically and tactically in control of something,

90
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:20,139
you're a manager and you've got to make sure that the human resource

91
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:26,439
and what you're trying to achieve with managing personalities and emotions is on point.

92
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,680
And that hastened, I think, my maturity at that point in time.

93
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,480
But it was a bit late.

94
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,019
You know, I wish I was like that in my early 20s.

95
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,480
And there were...

96
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:40,620
I definitely cared for you, Luke, and my teammates

97
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,319
and everyone that I've ever played with and been involved with in sport.

98
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:54,519
But I think, in totality, I didn't grow up enough, you know, in my 20s.

99
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,779
Western Bulldogs 2016 Premiership.

100
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,600
Coach Luke Beveridge there with a fantastic insight and reflection.

101
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,620
Well, our next guest is stepping slightly out of the sporting world

102
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,600
to one of the most creative...

103
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:08,379
...and passionate people I know.

104
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,600
It's the fantastic Russell Howcroft.

105
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:13,439
Now, when you talk about communicating with clarity,

106
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,259
there isn't a much better person to speak to

107
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:22,300
than the globally recognised advertising guru and guru-in-transfer co-host Russell Howcroft.

108
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,939
Ironic, then, that he was left a little stumped when I asked him about communication.

109
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,379
Well, you...

110
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:36,299
I was going to say scarcity, but that doesn't quite wash, does it?

111
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,940
Oh, my God.

112
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:40,940
Look, I...

113
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:46,519
Trying to stick to what I know, I think, has been what I've done mostly.

114
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:50,100
So I feel very comfortable talking about ideas and advertising.

115
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:51,960
And, you know, so the...

116
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,500
Initially, I'd be on the radio with Virginia Trioli and I'd talk about ads.

117
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:58,539
You know, and then Gruen, I'd talk about ads.

118
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,480
Mojo did a documentary that's about ads.

119
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,000
It's different what I'm doing now, for sure,

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,299
but maybe that's because I've just got a bit more comfortable with media.

121
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,879
So sticking to what I know, though, has been the...

122
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,879
That's been the core.

123
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,460
I think I've...

124
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,639
See, I wouldn't urge caution talking to the media.

125
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,580
And I think a lot of people, they're cautious when speaking to the media.

126
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,379
And I don't think that that's a good thing.

127
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:29,360
Americans aren't cautious when talking to the media.

128
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,539
They just go for it, right?

129
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,879
And they very much see the media as just part of their big democratic world

130
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,720
that is the States.

131
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,740
You know, everything's up for debate.

132
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,019
Everything's up for argument.

133
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,600
And everyone's discussion is fair and reasonable, you know, to a point.

134
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:47,740
Everyone's an open book.

135
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,899
And as a result, they all do really good media, don't they?

136
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,320
So I think it's hard.

137
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,639
I think it's hard for Australians.

138
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:55,460
I think we have a natural caution.

139
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,220
We don't want to show off, for one.

140
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:58,620
Yeah.

141
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,539
And for two, we're cautious about how we might get tripped up

142
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:05,720
or we might, you know, say the wrong thing and then not sleep at night.

143
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:06,919
You know, I think a lot of us are like,

144
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,820
I have been like that.

145
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,019
I still am a bit like that.

146
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,480
So I'm cautious and try to stick to my knitting,

147
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,980
but none of that makes any sense.

148
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:16,620
I wasn't like that.

149
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,620
I'm more like that now.

150
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:17,840
Right.

151
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:21,940
I think the sort of cancel culture part, I think, is a real thing.

152
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:24,720
And you can't actually say sorry.

153
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:26,480
You can't make a mistake.

154
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,460
You can't have slipped up because, you know,

155
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,600
the more you're in front of the microphone,

156
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,019
the odds are just going to say you're going to get something out there

157
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:33,919
that you didn't mean to.

158
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,860
But you haven't got that luxury anymore.

159
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,899
I mean, 15 years ago,

160
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,919
15 years ago, you could be looser, you know,

161
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,980
and I think it was healthier because, you know,

162
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,100
you want to hear people as close to their real self and not guarded.

163
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:45,299
I'm not sure where.

164
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,639
Yeah, I think that's true.

165
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:49,720
And there is an issue in that Google, let's just say Google,

166
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:52,379
but it's all digital, doesn't forget.

167
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:53,080
Yeah.

168
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,080
So, and I think that is really, that's not good for any of us.

169
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,639
You know, maybe it's not good for you or I because we're talking

170
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:04,480
and this is, you know, a lot of what we do is public.

171
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,700
But for people that are deeply private,

172
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,259
it's not good for them either because, you know,

173
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,500
you might Google that particularly private person

174
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,820
and discover seven years ago something happened that, you know,

175
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,320
wasn't good.

176
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,320
It may have been taken out of context as well and, you know,

177
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,179
an imbalanced version of what happened as well.

178
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,860
I don't like that because I think that's unfair on all of us

179
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,879
because all of us make mistakes.

180
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:26,440
Of course, we all do.

181
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,559
There's a lovely piece of legislation in Europe called

182
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,620
the right to be forgotten.

183
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,940
And you can actually, you've got to go through a very,

184
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,120
a very major process.

185
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,519
So, you can't be a naughty person and then say,

186
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:41,379
I want to be forgotten.

187
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,419
You've got to be a fine, understanding citizen

188
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:46,399
and then go through the process of being forgotten.

189
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,539
Getting your digital history cleansed, effectively.

190
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:49,440
Yeah.

191
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:51,820
And I'm going to go off the grid.

192
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:54,639
You can be officially off the grid, yeah,

193
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:00,080
which who knows that might happen, that might become more prevalent.

194
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,600
I do think there needs to be a rebalance with regard

195
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,299
to the big tech behemoth businesses and all of us individuals

196
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:11,320
because us individuals provide them with the data

197
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,659
that they make the money, right?

198
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:15,159
So, there isn't a balance at the moment.

199
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,980
I could talk more about what should happen there.

200
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,299
Should I?

201
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,980
Well, you know what I was thinking, Russell?

202
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,960
My mind was going back to Shane Warne again.

203
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:26,039
I was thinking why we love Warne so much is that he owned all of his history

204
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,539
and we loved him for it because we could see our own failings

205
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:30,840
and our own mistakes in it.

206
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,379
And that was a great celebration.

207
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,240
You needed to be as charismatic as Warne and,

208
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,059
I mean, taking 700 test wickets probably gives you a bit of credit, Russ.

209
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,620
It does.

210
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:39,700
Not many did.

211
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,740
There's a book that someone could write and it could be called Media Brave

212
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,700
because he was media brave.

213
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:51,159
So, he wasn't intimidated by what might happen as a result of a headline.

214
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:52,240
I don't think he was intimidated.

215
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,120
He might have had sleepless nights, but I don't feel like –

216
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,080
I feel like he was brave.

217
00:12:57,659 --> 00:12:58,879
And I don't know, there's many.

218
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:03,620
Really enjoyed spending some time with Russ and hearing his reflections.

219
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,100
He lights up the world.

220
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,679
You're in, Russ, with his passion and enthusiasm.

221
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,259
If you didn't hear the whole chat,

222
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,120
I encourage you to go back and listen to the episode with Russell Howcroft.

223
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:16,480
It's not often I get to have someone on the podcast who I both went to school with

224
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,500
back home in South Australia growing up at Ross Trevor College,

225
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,679
but also who scored a goal to send Australia to the World Cup.

226
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,600
We're talking about Australian soccer legend, the great John Aloisi,

227
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,500
coach of Western United, legend of the round ball game.

228
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,779
His coaching philosophy and mindset is incredible.

229
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,679
And you'll hear that right away when he talks about communicating with clarity.

230
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:43,639
So when I first started coaching, it was like I knew all this stuff.

231
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:46,679
And it was, you know, you know, so, you know, you would –

232
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:49,019
but sometimes I look back and I go, did I confuse him?

233
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:51,620
Because I gave him too many instructions, you know.

234
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,200
So like I said about behavior guidelines, it's simple.

235
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,159
You know, it's not too difficult to understand.

236
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,980
And so the players understand that.

237
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,279
The same with, you know, the tactical guidelines.

238
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:07,740
They make it as simple as possible so the players know their role.

239
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:13,539
You know, they know, you know, in a defensive moment what they should be doing.

240
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,159
And, of course, you have to practice it, but they sort of understand this is –

241
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:22,159
and I have clear, you know, for a defensive moment I'll have a clear word

242
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,019
that someone can scream out so the players go, okay, I know what that means.

243
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,779
You know, in an attacking sense, they know their movements.

244
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,799
They know their patterns.

245
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:33,019
You know, so I try and make it very clear and concise.

246
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:34,019
And I –

247
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:36,019
and it's even when I'm speaking to them.

248
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,980
It's, you know, it's just don't go on and speak for 20 minutes or 30 minutes or whatever

249
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,039
because players switch off.

250
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,100
You know, get them engaged in what you're talking about, you know.

251
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:47,799
And I got that from television.

252
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,940
I got that from doing a bit of media because people don't want to just, you know,

253
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,299
hear someone just rumble on.

254
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,059
They want to hear what's the message.

255
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,480
You know, what are you trying to get at?

256
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,940
And so I took that into coaching as well.

257
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,440
Look, you can show, you know, the positive.

258
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:03,940
Look, I like to –

259
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,259
to be positive most of the time anyway with the playing group.

260
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,539
So you're trying to reinforce what your playing structure is.

261
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,620
So you're trying to show them the positive moments.

262
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:13,980
Yeah.

263
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,379
Because it's very easy to pick up negatives.

264
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:15,899
Yeah.

265
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:18,799
But, you know, the player then starts to get a little bit, you know,

266
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,100
seeing a negative moment in training or in a game or whatever,

267
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,440
and they start to self-doubt themselves.

268
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,120
So if you had a percentage on that, are you trying to be, you know,

269
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:32,100
70% positive highlights, 30% areas to improve,

270
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:33,519
or is it not as structured as that?

271
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,179
Oh, it's not as structured.

272
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:39,000
It's just that more or less that, you know,

273
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:41,700
sometimes you will show a negative,

274
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,759
but that's only because the player hasn't –

275
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,919
if a player miscontrols a ball, I don't care, you know.

276
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:54,679
If he misses a chance but he's trying to do the right things, I don't care.

277
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:58,679
But if a player stops trying, that's a negative that I'll show

278
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:03,139
because, you know, that I don't like and the group –

279
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:04,120
for us to be successful,

280
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,940
you know, you make a mistake, it doesn't matter, you know.

281
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,159
So let's, you know, fight even harder for the next ball

282
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:12,200
or don't shy away from it.

283
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:14,340
And, you know, it's all about being brave.

284
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:16,679
And I talk a lot about being brave,

285
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,320
being brave in the way that we're playing with and without the ball.

286
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,580
So, you know, a lot of that is, you know, the positive nature.

287
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,820
So, you know, sometimes when you lose, you have to show what we did well.

288
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:32,899
And when we lose – when we win sometimes is what we could improve on.

289
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:33,100
Yeah.

290
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,740
And so it's always – you know.

291
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:33,779
Yeah.

292
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:33,799
Yeah.

293
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:33,860
Yeah.

294
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:33,980
Yeah.

295
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,080
Yeah.

296
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,320
about the improvement, I feel.

297
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,799
You know, we're always improving

298
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:40,039
and that's the positive reinforcement

299
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,200
that I'm trying to give the players.

300
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:43,480
Results will come and, you know,

301
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,000
but we're improving as a group and as individuals.

302
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,740
Having known John from such a young age,

303
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,039
not surprised by that passion, insight

304
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:55,820
and so clear on the way that he communicates.

305
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,240
Just a few weeks after the chat,

306
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,539
Western United, the team that John coaches,

307
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,759
went on to secure their maiden A-League championship,

308
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,500
a testament to John's leadership

309
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,680
and the way that he goes about his job day-to-day.

310
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:10,019
A unique conversation coming up next,

311
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:13,440
it was another great pleasure to sit down with Peter Singer,

312
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,460
who is known as the world's greatest living philosopher.

313
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,279
You can imagine then that he had some incredible thoughts

314
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,680
on what communicating with clarity means to him.

315
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,220
It certainly doesn't come automatically.

316
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,420
You have to work at it.

317
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:29,279
I think writing is something that you work at.

318
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,440
If I go back, the first lengthy piece of work

319
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,640
that I wrote was my MA thesis

320
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,160
that I did at Melbourne University for Master of Arts in philosophy.

321
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:41,019
And if I go back and read that now,

322
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,400
it's not very well written.

323
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,660
And it is, I guess, written more for the other philosophers.

324
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:51,039
And then I think, you know, if I look at my further writing,

325
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:52,900
I do make gradual improvements

326
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,980
and being at Oxford certainly helped.

327
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,259
I had a professor there, R.M. Hare,

328
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,980
who actually emphasised clarity of thinking.

329
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,380
And, you know, the method of teaching at Oxford was,

330
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,059
you would write an essay and drop it into your professor's mailbox

331
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:10,880
and two or three days later you would talk to him about it

332
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,660
and he would go through it line by line.

333
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:14,319
And if he didn't understand what you were saying,

334
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:16,940
he would tell you, you know, what does this sentence mean?

335
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,720
What are you saying here?

336
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,259
And that's a really good discipline, I think,

337
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:23,660
to make sure that what you're saying, you know,

338
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,559
you may know what you were trying to say in this sentence,

339
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:28,380
but if the sentence doesn't convey that to someone else who's reading it,

340
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,660
that's your problem.

341
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,880
It's not necessarily their problem.

342
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,180
It's your problem for not having expressed yourself sufficiently clearly.

343
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,240
There's much change in the world as we've had in my lifetime for sure

344
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:47,019
and enormous amounts of fairly significant, you know,

345
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:49,119
moves from government which, you know,

346
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,500
probably you would think should be debated more than any topic

347
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,599
that we've had in recent times, but there seems to be this fear to do it.

348
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,480
I mean, what's the anecdote to that?

349
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,680
And are you concerned that we don't seem to have that free debate anymore?

350
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:01,799
Well,

351
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,420
I am concerned that there have been a number of incidents where people

352
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:10,539
who have tried to promote free discussion and debate have been in some way,

353
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:17,259
you know, either abused, threatened, or even dismissed from positions,

354
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,660
including university positions, which I think is particularly shocking

355
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,759
given that universities ought to be exactly teaching people how to think

356
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:28,960
for themselves and not thinking that if you're controversial,

357
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,460
you don't belong at a university.

358
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,660
So I deplore that kind of culture and, in fact,

359
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,619
to try to do something about that, together with a couple of colleagues,

360
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:43,140
I've started a journal called the Journal of Controversial Ideas,

361
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,380
which is an open access free journal.

362
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:51,180
You just go to journalofcontroversialideas.org and actually at the end of this,

363
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,519
well, maybe in two or three days, we're going to publish the second issue.

364
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:56,059
We had the first issue a while ago.

365
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,920
It's, you know, we have peer-reviewed articles.

366
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,200
We don't publish anything.

367
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,059
That's just sort of emotional venting.

368
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:08,980
But we want to provide a forum where people can publish controversial ideas.

369
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:11,940
And if they don't want to put their name to it, they can use a pseudonym

370
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:17,119
because we do know particularly some junior academics who've really been penalized

371
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:21,920
in their careers by saying something that was worth saying that, you know,

372
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,500
whether you agree with it or not was definitely worth putting out there

373
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:30,779
and having it discussed, but got so much vitriol as a result of that

374
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:31,079
that they...

375
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,859
They've found it really hard to take and didn't want to write more on those topics.

376
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:40,900
So, Pete, in recent times, we've seen the world's richest man buy Twitter with cash.

377
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:45,640
And we've seen former presidents banned from that platform,

378
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:53,319
which some people will argue justifiably for mistruths and outrageous comments.

379
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,339
Where do you sit on that?

380
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,859
Where is the line of free speech in social media platforms?

381
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:00,700
Should people be banned?

382
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,980
Where does that sit?

383
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:08,700
So, I'm generally a defender of a wide range of freedom of thought and expression.

384
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:14,099
As I say, as long as it's people are putting arguments or providing evidence for their views.

385
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,240
If someone...

386
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,460
I'm not a supporter of hate speech.

387
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,559
So, if somebody is just pouring out hatred against any particular group,

388
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:30,180
whether it's a matter of race or sex or, you know, religion or whatever else it might be,

389
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,559
I don't think that belongs in the public forum.

390
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:40,099
And I think it's reasonable for organizations like Twitter or Facebook to say,

391
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:41,960
no, we're taking that down.

392
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,160
But if somebody, and that would include the former president of the United States,

393
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:51,220
wants to put reasons up for what they're saying and defend those claims,

394
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,240
I think that they ought to be there.

395
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,420
I think that ought to be there for other people to refute and show why they think that that's wrong.

396
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,599
But I do think that censoring people is not the way.

397
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:14,079
I think the way is to refute positions, to hear them out and then to show why they're wrong.

398
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:19,339
I think we have to try to get back to that idea that we can have reasoned discussions

399
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,099
that can lead us towards the truth.

400
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,839
What a great pleasure it was to speak to Peter Singer.

401
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:28,880
His book, The Life You Can Save, is a brilliant look at the world of giving

402
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,180
and for me really challenges the way you look.

403
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,539
You look at what you have in your own life.

404
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:41,589
Now back to the round ball game.

405
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,269
Another Australian soccer legend, Ange Postacoglu,

406
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:47,750
the head coach of Celtic FC, the Scottish Giants.

407
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:50,809
But before that, he was the head coach of the Socceroos,

408
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,130
a team that came under a lot of fire.

409
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:57,150
But hearing Ange speak, you can hear the way that he makes his players feel calm,

410
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:00,349
even with such an intense pressure surrounding them.

411
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,529
I'm not a massive communicator in that, you know,

412
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:06,230
I'm not constantly talking to players every day.

413
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,230
You know, I really...

414
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:11,109
I kind of give a lot of responsibility to the other coaches, the other staff

415
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:15,450
and even the players themselves to sort of dictate the day-to-day stuff

416
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,410
so they're not constantly hearing my voice.

417
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:22,009
So when I do talk, I try and make an impact in those moments

418
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:24,869
and, you know, I put a lot of thought into what I'm going to say

419
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:26,009
and why I'm saying it.

420
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:30,049
For me, the key is, as you said, is the clarity of message.

421
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:30,789
You can't...

422
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:35,970
Again, I've met so many brilliant people who have the most unbelievable knowledge

423
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,390
and yet when I hear them talk,

424
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:40,210
particularly in front of a group of people,

425
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,150
it gets lost when those words leave their mouth.

426
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:46,710
You know, they lose the room, not because of their lack of knowledge,

427
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:50,049
just their ability to really make that clear and concise

428
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:52,730
and relatable to the people they're talking to,

429
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:54,069
the audience they're talking to.

430
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:58,269
And, you know, I've worked really hard to try and make sure that,

431
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:02,390
you know, the biggest impact I can have in a communicative sense

432
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,730
is that when I talk, there's a purpose behind it

433
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,750
and it's really clear, you know,

434
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:10,450
it's not just me talking just for the sake of it.

435
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,809
And I had plenty of examples.

436
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:14,289
I mean, there was a couple of coaches I had when I was playing.

437
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,190
I remember one, he used to talk for 45 minutes, 50 minutes before training,

438
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:22,009
you know, and then we'd go out there and all of us would be brain dead by then,

439
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:24,710
you know, because, you know, we were part-timers back then,

440
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,130
like most sport in Australia, you know,

441
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,450
most of our guys were plumbers and bricklayers

442
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,750
and the last thing they wanted to do was come to training

443
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,089
and listen to the coach talk for 45 minutes,

444
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,650
even though he was a real knowledgeable guy

445
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,369
and what he was saying was great, but I'd go, mate,

446
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:38,910
it's just not working.

447
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,630
And, you know, I kind of understood early on

448
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,309
that for me to have the biggest impact is that when I spoke,

449
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:47,589
like I said, there was a purpose of clarity.

450
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:49,950
I got really challenged in Japan with that

451
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,809
because obviously, you know, that's, like I said,

452
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:54,690
it's a major, I think it's a major asset I have,

453
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,069
the ability to, in a room of people,

454
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,549
to be able to sort of have a real clarity of purpose in the message

455
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:03,809
and when language is taken away from you,

456
00:25:03,829 --> 00:25:04,970
because I've got an interpreter,

457
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,190
I've got three interpreters in the room,

458
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:11,450
that became, you know, real sort of,

459
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,190
real kind of tricky for me to figure out,

460
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,089
well, I'm really relying on another person now

461
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:23,789
to get this message the way I want to across, you know,

462
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:25,109
and how do I know?

463
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,609
Because I don't understand what he's saying.

464
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,609
So I'm saying it in English, he's saying it in Japanese,

465
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:32,150
the Portuguese guy is waiting for him to finish in Japanese

466
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:35,170
so he can then say it in Portuguese to the Brazilian players,

467
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:36,390
the Thai translator.

468
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,190
So there's,

469
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:40,549
there's four or five people talking in a room while I'm talking

470
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:43,910
and I'm hoping that this isn't Chinese whispers

471
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,490
and my message isn't getting diluted or changing along the way,

472
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:49,130
saying, so how do you know, you know?

473
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,549
So that was really tough and I ended up,

474
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,269
I think I said to the boys in the coaching group

475
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:57,509
that I ended up illustrating a bit on,

476
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,789
and I'm a terrible drawer, I'm talking stick figures,

477
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,549
but I ended up going on a whiteboard

478
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:03,289
and while I'm telling the story,

479
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,190
starting to draw these stick figures

480
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,710
and just making sure that what I'm saying,

481
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:10,049
they kind of got as clearly as possible

482
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:12,210
and I still do it now actually,

483
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,410
but the boys get a laugh out of it,

484
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:17,109
even in Scotland because like I said,

485
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:17,970
they're terrible drawings,

486
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:20,990
but your ability to make an impact

487
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:24,230
and be clear in what you're going to say

488
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,869
is I always felt is probably one of the most

489
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:29,910
sort of vital roles within the group.

490
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:34,269
Now to finish off this special episode of Empowering Leaders,

491
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,529
a unique experience,

492
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:37,529
took the podcast on the road

493
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,710
and recorded this one

494
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,710
from Byron Bay

495
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,089
with the incredible Dr. Arna Rubenstein.

496
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:45,369
Arna is a global leading expert in rites of passage

497
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:47,289
that is created for young boys and girls

498
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:49,170
and the way he communicates with clarity

499
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,009
is truly amazing.

500
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:51,789
As a father of four,

501
00:26:52,109 --> 00:26:53,230
I found this fascinating,

502
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:54,769
listening to the top three ways

503
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:56,490
he describes to be a better parent.

504
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,829
Well, I'm trying to get more and more clarity.

505
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,950
I did write a book called The Making of Men,

506
00:27:02,069 --> 00:27:04,269
Raising Boys to be Happy, Healthy and Successful.

507
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:05,170
Can I recommend that?

508
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:07,069
Just, it is brilliant

509
00:27:07,069 --> 00:27:08,609
and I found it really,

510
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,569
you know, Bex here with us today

511
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:12,549
and I was on the plane,

512
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,250
I was reading it on the way up

513
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,410
and you wanted to pass the page back to her

514
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,650
and then she passed one back to me.

515
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,390
There's a few tears there as well around as a parent.

516
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:21,950
It's confronting sometimes

517
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,690
and so I recommend if you haven't read Arnie's book,

518
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:25,170
go and do it.

519
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,490
It's brilliant.

520
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:26,970
Yeah, thank you.

521
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:27,490
Thank you.

522
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:28,490
Yes, I agree with you.

523
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:31,609
And we have sold 25,000 copies around Australia

524
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:32,289
and around the world.

525
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,049
So that, you know, it's had a good impact

526
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:35,630
but I'm writing another book

527
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,410
and it's about,

528
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,190
you know, you could call it

529
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,390
Rites of Passage for Dummies

530
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,329
even though that's not what the book would be called

531
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,269
but really explain,

532
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:46,150
I want to explain to people clearly

533
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:49,130
about why Rites of Passage are important,

534
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:50,529
how we can bring them in,

535
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,990
how we can create them

536
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,670
and this idea of having a transformational mindset

537
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,589
and what I mean by that,

538
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,930
we've heard about, you know,

539
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,410
having everyone has a mindset

540
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,490
and we have, we can get to peak mindset

541
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,869
and we talk about a growth mindset

542
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:06,470
but a transformational mindset is like,

543
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:08,549
it's that ability to,

544
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,450
find the next thing in our lives

545
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,769
but that's not necessarily just a development

546
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:16,250
from the thing that we're doing.

547
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,529
It's a, you know, it's another step

548
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:20,369
and in order to do that,

549
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:22,509
we have to actually periodically

550
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:26,329
remove ourselves from our normal life space

551
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:29,450
and have time, you know, time out.

552
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,690
We actually, you know, time to think about things

553
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,789
and that's why going out into nature is so powerful

554
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:37,670
or, you know, on a well-run workshop

555
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:38,650
or things like that.

556
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,170
Where we can leave everything else behind

557
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,650
and actually look at,

558
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,730
well, hang on, let's take some time out.

559
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:45,589
Who am I?

560
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,650
What's really important to me?

561
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,589
What do I want to be doing?

562
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,890
What do I want to not be doing?

563
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:55,849
You know, everybody needs to periodically

564
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:57,470
get those opportunities

565
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,549
so that we can keep growing.

566
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,930
So let me ask you this question.

567
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:04,089
What's the key then to being a good parent?

568
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,809
I think there are a number of keys to being a good parent.

569
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:11,630
I think that, you know, parenting is an ongoing journey.

570
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:13,490
There's no perfect parent.

571
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,329
So it's about recognising it is a journey

572
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:17,309
and we're always learning.

573
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,650
But some of the key things that we recommend to parents,

574
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,829
if I was going to name three,

575
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,829
is that we make sure we have one-on-one time

576
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:27,450
with all of our children

577
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,809
so that we actually form a genuine relationship

578
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:31,990
with all of them,

579
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:34,730
doing things that we both enjoy and being present.

580
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,250
And, you know, you've got four children, Luke,

581
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:37,789
so that's a big thing.

582
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:40,809
But it's even more important when you have more children

583
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:43,750
that you get some one-on-one time with them regularly.

584
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:48,029
The second thing is that we practise acknowledging

585
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:52,170
what they do well and recognising, you know,

586
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,809
that they are different from us,

587
00:29:53,849 --> 00:29:55,210
that they all do have their own gifts.

588
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:57,269
And a big role for us as parents

589
00:29:57,269 --> 00:30:00,089
is to help them find their gifts, their passion,

590
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,430
their genius and their purpose.

591
00:30:02,289 --> 00:30:05,769
And then the third one is that when our children muck up,

592
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:06,849
and they will,

593
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:08,690
they are going to do things they shouldn't do,

594
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:11,069
they are going to do things that fail and are not okay,

595
00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:12,730
that we don't shame them,

596
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:15,890
but we actually use it as a learning opportunity

597
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,069
and we support them.

598
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,990
We support them to learn and grow from their mistakes

599
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,589
rather than shaming them,

600
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,029
which unfortunately happens a lot

601
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:26,230
and has some really negative impact on them.

602
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:30,670
Dr. Arno Rubenstein there,

603
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:33,329
one of my favourite chats on the podcast this year.

604
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:35,369
Well, that finishes off this week's focus

605
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:36,549
on communicating with clarity.

606
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:37,710
Next time,

607
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:38,750
we're going to take a deep,

608
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:40,089
deep dive into how leaders

609
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:42,190
that I spoke with throughout 2022

610
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,970
create and share their vision.

611
00:30:44,529 --> 00:30:45,250
And once again,

612
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:45,990
for me,

613
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:47,089
there's some incredible insights

614
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:48,109
that I'm sure you're going to enjoy.

615
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,829
Empowering Leaders is produced by Ed Gooden
