00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,490
a listener production. Welcome to episode five of a special series of Empowering Leaders,

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,410
highlighting what we see as the common dimensions of great leadership in the 21st century,

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,690
new generation of purpose-driven leaders. And the incredible responses that I've been getting from

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:26,469
some of these leaders has been a great pleasure right across this year. I've had such an enjoyable

5
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:30,550
experience sitting down with diverse people on the Empowering Leaders podcast, each with an

6
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,969
incredible story to tell and a unique insight into how they lead. It's these types of insights

7
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,869
that align with a great passion of mine, a leader, a business co-founded with one of my oldest

8
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:44,810
friends, Matt Wadowitz, who would have heard me talk about it across the year. It's a place where

9
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:49,630
leaders like the ones you'll hear from today come together to collaborate, to learn from each other

10
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,990
in bespoke, unique environments. If you're interested in learning more about it, we'd

11
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,329
love you to head to a leadercollective.com. We love collaborating with all sorts of leaders

12
00:00:58,329 --> 00:00:59,649
across different industries.

13
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:05,689
We often talk about sporting backgrounds or from the arts or from education, whatever it is,

14
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:10,769
small business would encourage you to book a discovery call with us at Alita and check out

15
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:26,599
our signature Alita Connect program. Now this week, it's all about vision and how leaders that

16
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:30,959
I've spoken with this year go about creating and sharing that vision. Well, what does that mean?

17
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,159
It can be about their business and expressing the goals of the company and what they're trying to

18
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,519
achieve. Or maybe it's in parenting, having your kids believe in the way that you're guiding them.

19
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,140
Or we see great vision from sporting leaders building a plan of attack on the field and having

20
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,760
their players have the faith to believe and execute that plan. It's the world of music though

21
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,019
that we're jumping into first and foremost with Benjamin Northey, the principal conductor of the

22
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:00,519
Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. I've got ideas around the ultimate performance of a piece,

23
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:07,980
you know, when I come out onto the podium. But it never works out that way, you know. So it doesn't,

24
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,419
like my vision can be,

25
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:14,919
very strong, but it's always got built-in flexibility. And that's what I'm talking

26
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:19,500
about in it's collaborative. It's not a power thing. It's not like this is what we're going to

27
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,039
do. I can say that at the beginning of a week, and that's great. That makes everyone feel like,

28
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:29,599
okay, good, this person's got a clear plan. Can I understand that for a second, Ben? Sorry

29
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,060
to jump in again, but I'm trying to, so you've got the vision for the piece and you're conducting

30
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,199
them in the way that you are, but a certain section suddenly, you know, gets, catches

31
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:39,520
fall.

32
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:45,819
For one of a better term, you think, hey, that sounds better and I can let that go more than I

33
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:47,979
initially planned. Is that the sort of living, breathing?

34
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,620
Exactly. Yes, you've worked it out. So that's the thing. You let, you know what it is? You've got

35
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,719
to know when to help, and that means lead in this point, and know when to get out of the way and let

36
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:06,300
them, let them do it. So that's the balancing act that's going on there. And so, you know,

37
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,120
you might hear something, you might hear a player play something,

38
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,979
that you really like, and it's different than how you thought about it, and it's great. And you

39
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:20,000
just, what are you going to do? You just get out of the way. Let that magic happen. And it's

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,180
different also depending on where you are, what orchestra you're working with, that particular

41
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,340
group dynamic, what their strengths and weaknesses are, the hall you're in, different acoustic

42
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:34,719
sounds, the occasion, you know, energy levels of the group, time of the day. I mean, there's so

43
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,520
many variables around this that you have to be ready to, you know, you have to be ready to, you

44
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,800
have to be ready to respond as well as lead. You know, that's what I've learned. It's, you've got to

45
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,979
be so alert to be able to respond. I'm fascinated by it. I find it so, so your, would you have a

46
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,879
good read if you go over to London or, you know, I mentioned in the intro, the, the international

47
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,620
space, have you, have you got a good idea who the French horn player is and the, is it to that level

48
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,139
of detail or on the night you're getting surprised by, hey, someone's doing something that you didn't

49
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:09,280
believe in? Oh, that, that happens, that spontaneity happens in performances, but it's

50
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:14,879
the rehearsal process. Cause that's when the conductor really does their work. It's, it's away

51
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,360
from the performance space. It's, it's the working the orchestra out, especially a new orchestra.

52
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:27,420
So one of the teachers in Finland, he said, know who the divas are in the orchestra. So if there's

53
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:34,000
somebody who you really need to be aware of, find out early, get there, just, yeah, principal Ovo.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,319
Yeah. Okay. Be ready. I'm on you. Be ready. And so, you know, you, you were, and that's,

55
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,480
part of the working with the personalities as well, but also, um, celebrating what they can bring

56
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,220
as, as individual leaders in, within the orchestra itself. In preparation for this, I, you know,

57
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,220
read extensively your love of that collaborative nature of large scale music making. There was one

58
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,959
quote that was attributed to, I wanted to read back. It's one of the few, this is your words,

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,060
one of the few examples of a large number of human beings cooperating in real time to achieve a very,

60
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,740
very difficult end product. As a metaphor for what human beings can achieve, there's nothing

61
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,620
and orchestra. I can hear the passion in those words. Does that sort of sum up to you that the

62
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,699
reason why you love getting out and trying to create that sort of joy? It is, it is. And, and

63
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:28,500
see, you know, as human beings, we, we kind of want to collaborate, I think, um, by our nature,

64
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,019
we want to be part of something bigger. The things we can achieve as a collective are much greater

65
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:38,139
than the things we can achieve by ourselves. And that's the truth with music. So my daughter,

66
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:42,300
we were talking about, um, before we started, she's just started violin. She's 10 years old.

67
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,199
She, you know, is doing a practice. She did her first state music camp this year and got to play

68
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,199
in an orchestra for the first time. And so she hasn't really been that into the violin up to

69
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,699
this point. All of a sudden she gets in the orchestra. She says, dad, you should hear it.

70
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:59,139
It's unbelievable. I said, yeah, I know. That's what I do. She goes, no, you don't understand.

71
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,899
I really like, it's really amazing. And so, you know, it's that kind of feeling of, um,

72
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,100
of, of the power of, of,

73
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:15,819
um, cooperation, you know, and, and the orchestra for all of its crazy kind of old world, um,

74
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:22,699
stigma and stereotypes, it's actually still a very relevant institution.

75
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,360
We talk a lot about creating and sharing your vision, but nothing quite as tangible

76
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,259
as creating a vision. You can hear incredibly unique insight there from Benjamin Northey.

77
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,920
What a great Australian Ben is. Love the opportunity to spend some time with him.

78
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,939
An incredible leader in his field. Now in our library, this episode was released the week

79
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:47,519
after Ben Northey's similar mindsets in the way they approach creating and sharing a vision,

80
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,220
but from completely different avenues of work. And that's what I love about this platform.

81
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,060
It's the ability to have such diverse conversations. John Bertrand, Australian

82
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:03,319
sporting legend and skipper of Australia too. The beyond belief story of Australia's win in

83
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:08,060
the 1983 America's cup, breaking the longest ever winning streak in,

84
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:12,199
sporting history. His vision was to defeat the dominant American sailing team,

85
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,720
an almost impossible task at the time. So the way he shared that vision was absolutely crucial.

86
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,920
Well, first of all, let me tell you a little story. Um, John Longley reminded me of a couple

87
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,639
of years ago, he was a grinder and an assistant manager on the, on the dock with Warren Jones,

88
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:35,980
our America's cup hitter. I've, I'd forgotten what I said, but anyway, he reminded me, he said

89
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,079
that, that race where we're so far, we're so far, we're so far, we're so far, we're so far, we're so far,

90
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:47,819
we can hardly read their bloody numbers. That's how far back we were. I, uh, apparently I said to

91
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:56,180
the guys, I said, if we don't keep concentrating, we may lose this race. So you're talking about

92
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,660
positive, crazy positive at that stage. And it looked like the impossible challenge at that

93
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:08,060
stage. 99% of the world would say it's impossible. Forget it. Turn the television set off or what

94
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:13,319
have it, go home. Uh, so anyway, apparently that's what I said. Well, that was, that's the

95
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,899
mindset of a, of a skipper of a boat that eventually we were able to be successful.

96
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
And a supreme optimist.

97
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:23,459
A supreme optimist. Ask Raza, my wife, you know, drives her nuts.

98
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:29,120
To see you overlay your leadership into every other area of your life, I find equally fascinating.

99
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,200
The Australian, uh, swim team is probably from an Olympic point of view, the most prestigious

100
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,980
group that win medals, lost its way. Uh, only one,

101
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:43,879
won gold in London and had lots of cultural and behavioral issues. And John Bertrand steps up to

102
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:49,279
the plate and, and, and you bring your psychology and your leadership to swimming, uh, Australia

103
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,720
with great success. Tokyo's the most successful Olympics the Australian swim team's ever had.

104
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,940
Can you tell us about how you went about instilling that in the, in the swim team?

105
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,419
Well, uh, I was approached initially, uh, by one of the directors, Clem Doherty,

106
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:07,240
former partner of McKinsey's, uh, who I knew previously. He asked me whether I'd consider

107
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,039
taking on the championship. And I said, well, I'm not going to take on the championship.

108
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:11,539
I'm going to take on the championship role of Swimming Australia because it, it was, you know,

109
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,080
it, it had its issues. And I initially said no, but anyway, he came back a few times and

110
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,919
eventually I said, I said, there, let's give this a shot. I didn't have any swimming background at

111
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,759
all, which was, as it turns out, an advantage. So I went in as a clean skin, you might say.

112
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,000
Lots of politics, you know, these, these, uh, amount of organizations, great intent, but so

113
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,600
much, you know, so many people, so much passion or, you know, lots of blood on the water.

114
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:44,940
I can tell you. And, um, primarily, uh, it was dysfunctional when I first saw it, saw the whole

115
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:52,039
thing. It lacked trust, which is so important when it backs to the wall and it lacked, lacked a

116
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:58,460
vision. And, um, so as I came in as chair, I said, yeah, this is of national importance. Let's give

117
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,360
this a shot for better or worse. So I embarked on the journey just after the London Olympics in

118
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,879
2013 and, uh, major, major changes.

119
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:14,100
Internally, but primarily, I guess, if you talk about the major positions and change,

120
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:20,779
it was, uh, and again, coming from the school of hard knocks and losing as well as a bit of

121
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:27,019
winning with the world of America's cup. Um, part of my sort of added value is this vision of

122
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:32,340
what's this game going to look like in 10 years time. Let's get there faster than anyone else

123
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:37,740
in the world. Okay. So take the blinkers off. And it was based on my own experience with the

124
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,440
Olympics where you've every, and the Olympics is really the cutting edge of human endeavor.

125
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,840
There's no confusion. You're either, you're either win or you're a bum. There's no confusion out

126
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:52,120
there. You know, I, I, I won the leather medal at the German Olympics, fourth place. It's worse

127
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:58,000
than last. And other than mom and the kids, nobody cares. Okay. I got on the platform on the podium

128
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,360
and won the bronze and, you know, in, in Montreal, thank goodness, you know, my God, the difference

129
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,019
between fourth and third is unbelievable. So, you know, with no money, no coaching,

130
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:11,779
no anything. But at any rate, if you look at any four year period, you get improvement in

131
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:16,419
performance, a hundred meter sprint, throwing a jab on. Interesting enough, any 10 or 20,

132
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,379
particularly 20 year period of the Olympic movement, a quantum leap in performance.

133
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:27,000
So the question is not why is it so? It's just that history tells us that in 20 years time,

134
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,539
uh, the playing the game of this thing called the America's cup will be much further progressed

135
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:37,860
than what it is now. AFL football, the business, the industry of podcasting, what we're doing now,

136
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:45,899
in 10 years time, you know, it's hard to imagine the way this thing will evolve, but it's years,

137
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:51,159
it's fast, it's growing. Human endeavor, the human brain is amazing. You know, we,

138
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:57,539
the suggestions is, is that we, we use maybe nine or 10% of the potential of this incredible

139
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:04,019
computer hanging between our ears, the brain, the massive supercomputer. Okay. Yeah. If we can move

140
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:07,840
to 10 or 11, sorry, 11 or 12%, you have major, major breakthroughs. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

141
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,419
True. So when we look at human endeavor, Olympics, you get improvement in performance. There's no

142
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:19,820
question. Same analogy for this crazy thing called the America's cup. So part of my, and, and same

143
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,740
with the swimming Australia, we do not know what freestyle will look like in 10 years time. That's

144
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:32,279
got to be the mentality. Freestyle was originally called the Australian crawl in the late twenties,

145
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:37,820
1920s. Other than the head going down, the human body getting stronger. Okay. Nutrition,

146
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:43,320
whole bunch of stuff. Nothing's changed. Our next highlight is from a special collaboration

147
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,700
with the AFL and an opportunity for the empowering leaders podcast to talk to some of the AFL's most

148
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:54,519
impactful leaders. We started with someone whose work is so crucial to the success of the sport of

149
00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:00,679
AFL major general, Simone Wilkie, former head of the Australian defense force and AFL commissioner.

150
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:06,700
Her take on creating and sharing a vision relates to the success of AFLW and where she sees the

151
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,820
competition moving forward.

152
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,500
In the coming years, you can have a vision, but if you don't provide the resources for that vision

153
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,179
or you've actually produced as an illusion. So a vision is a great thing to have, but you have to

154
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:24,840
make sure that you've enabled people to get there. And it has to be an achievable vision.

155
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:32,440
That's why I like strategies. So, you know, you set that vision and then you put the key tenants

156
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,080
or the pillars that you need to have for it. Then you actually need to go away and produce a plan

157
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,820
for how you're going to do it.

158
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:46,299
And sometimes that's where people don't quite get it right. So making sure that you've got the right

159
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:51,500
structures, that you've got the right resources, that you've got the right people in those roles

160
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:58,279
and then being able to adapt them. I always think one of the hardest things you can do as a leader

161
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:02,919
is actually to turn around to someone and say, you're no longer part of our team.

162
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:07,820
And I'd call it, I call it swimmers and non-swimmers. So, you know, you get into the

163
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,639
pool and there's people who can naturally swim and there's people who haven't been taught to swim.

164
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,500
And then you can teach some of those people to swim. And then there's people who's still going

165
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,539
to be floundering around in the bottom of the pool. What would you do if those people look?

166
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,480
Well, there's not a role for you, is there? Eventually, if you're not up to it.

167
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:30,159
So get them out of the pool because it's not good for them and it's not good for everybody else.

168
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:35,879
But to actually sit down with somebody and say, we know you really want to be there. And this

169
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,820
is probably the hardest decision, one of the hardest decisions you can make.

170
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,320
One of the hardest decisions I ever made in the army was a young lady who was in recruit training.

171
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,759
She so wanted to be there. She'd always wanted to be a soldier. If everyone was as committed as she

172
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:54,700
was, would have been fantastic. But she just couldn't do it. And all the other girls were

173
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:00,740
helping her. And eventually I had to say, look, I'm sorry, but we're discharging you.

174
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,559
Yeah. You know, that was really difficult because that was a person who so wanted to be there.

175
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,519
And yet then.

176
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,059
You'll have some other people in your team who are just naturally gifted and

177
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:16,980
lazy. And how do you then motivate those people to give their best?

178
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:23,799
It's a brilliant answer. And it leads to a lot more thinking. And that's why I love the crossover.

179
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:31,059
And sometimes in football, we used to think it's almost a little bit naive to think about being in

180
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:35,460
a war zone. But I think in terms of knowing your people, it's been a much more sophisticated

181
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,159
environment in AFL. You're getting 40 or 50 people. You're getting 40 or 50 people. You're getting

182
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:37,820
40 or 50 people. You're getting 40 or 50 people. You're getting 40 or 50 people. You're getting

183
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,480
40 or 50 people from incredibly diverse backgrounds and remote Indigenous communities and private

184
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,440
schools and all sorts of different situations. I think that has come a long way now in coaching

185
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,759
the individual and the care for the individual as a whole person. And is that something that

186
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,460
you've seen evolve in the other leadership spaces you're in as well?

187
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,460
Absolutely. Because that's how you make that team. That's how you get all of those different

188
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:07,299
people merging together for the same purpose. And, you know, if I go back to the army, when

189
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:11,659
I was running recruit training and when I was running officer training, all those people

190
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:17,039
came from every different part of Australia, just like a football team does. So if you

191
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:22,399
know that they have all those different experiences and backgrounds, you have to provide an opportunity

192
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,700
for each and every one of them to shine. And you know that they're all different. I think

193
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:33,000
one of the areas, you know, Australia as a nation sort of moving to is accepting and

194
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,259
celebrating difference. You know, it sort of goes to the tenets of inclusion.

195
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:42,659
But we are much better at that, in my view, than we used to be, where we'd put people

196
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:47,360
in categories and we'd just leave them in those categories rather than helping them

197
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:54,500
to shine and become part of that team. A friend of mine, Scott Gaten, who did his PhD in high

198
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:00,299
performance teams. And when he, the essence of what he came down to, there were about

199
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:07,079
four or five values that high performance teams have. And that's things like courage,

200
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:16,660
integrity, persistence, good judgment, and being a team worker. Now, that was a review

201
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,839
that he did. Well, not a review, that was his PhD, I should say. It takes a long time

202
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:29,339
to do a doctorate. They were the values that he saw in special forces and officer training.

203
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,640
That was Major General Simone Wilkie there. Fascinating to hear her talk about the tough

204
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,400
decisions she's had to make throughout her career.

205
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,279
Really, really good.

206
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,240
Really admirable leader and inspiring in every sense of the word. Next up, an extraordinary

207
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,400
conversation with one of our most recent episodes, Terea Pitt, a leader who had her life changed

208
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,920
in an instant after being caught in a wildfire and suffering burns to much of her body. Her

209
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:58,099
incredible ability and positive attitude to see the positive in her situation, the remarkable

210
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:02,599
amount of strength that you could possibly imagine. Her take on creating and sharing

211
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,680
a vision is practical and insightful.

212
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,940
Well, I think at the start, I was a little bit of a bit of a, you know, I was a little

213
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,519
bit of a, I was a little bit of a golden boy. I have a little bit of a big, little bit

214
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,259
of a little bit of a kind of a big, little bit of a dream. But it's okay if you don't

215
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:14,559
know exactly what it is that you're trying to do. Because, you know, so many people might

216
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:21,339
get hung up on creating a 10-year bulleted out, detailed, extensive business plan with

217
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:26,559
multiple spreadsheets importing into it. That might be overkill because you might not actually

218
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,740
know if what it is that you're thinking about doing is what it is that you want to be doing

219
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,599
or maybe you don't enjoy doing it or maybe it might change. So I think a general direction

220
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:44,799
direction is helpful but don't get hung up on knowing like the exact degree where you're going

221
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,980
to end up i think that you know not getting too hung up on that and and also acknowledging and

222
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:56,819
understanding that as you go you'll work it out um you know we had those really bad fires in

223
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:03,740
it was in the summer of 2019 right so the fires are burning all up and down the east coast of

224
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:09,819
australia actually all around australia they're burning and in my hometown of aladala the fires

225
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:17,000
were really bad we had fires burning north of us south of us west of us so our town was pretty much

226
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,339
encircled by flames and a girlfriend and i we thought we wanted to do something to help our

227
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:31,079
help our community or help the communities around australia that were going through these bushfires

228
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:33,680
and we wanted to help small businesses because in our community

229
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:39,119
all of the beautiful little businesses that rely on that summer trade there was no no tourists in

230
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,640
the town everyone had gone home um so we were worried about all of those businesses because

231
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:49,980
they would have you know ordered extra stocks um organized extra supplies all of that type of stuff

232
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,660
and then they wouldn't be able to sell it um so we so we decided we wanted to do something we

233
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,759
wanted to do this spend with them campaign which we thought was going to be an instagram page and

234
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,559
we weren't really sure what we were going to do we're like we'll just profile some businesses

235
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:11,480
don't really know what's going to happen now we could have sat down put more thought into it

236
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:18,559
planned it out more got on board extra resources done all of this work mapped out everyone's what

237
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,660
everyone's job role was going to be mapped it all out and spent spent weeks doing all of that

238
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:28,160
or we could have just gone fuck it we don't know let's just put it out there let's let's see what

239
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,720
happens so we just did a did the logo and canva um put it out there and we're like oh my god we're

240
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:38,559
out there and we're like oh well this could just fall over we might not get anything and within a

241
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,859
couple of days we had over 200 000 followers the businesses that we profiled you know they were

242
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:49,859
making enough money from people buying stuff from their store to make their mortgage repayments um

243
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:56,319
people made more money from one post than six months worth of markets so we really helped

244
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:02,619
small businesses around australia and if we had have stopped and if we had have thought about it

245
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:03,720
and if we had have stopped and if we had have thought about it and if we had have stopped

246
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,339
and if we had have put on additional resources because we were both staying up until like

247
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:13,339
you know 3 a.m to write back to everyone and i was two weeks away from giving birth to my second

248
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:18,880
child so it was a crazy crazy time but if we had have stopped and thought about it

249
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,319
then we might have not have done it you know we might have been like oh it's heaps of work

250
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:29,359
and i don't know if it's gonna work and you know maybe by the time we were ready it would

251
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,380
have been three months down the track and then maybe the businesses might not have needed

252
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:40,859
so much support so i think if you've got an idea don't overthink it just put it out there see what

253
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:46,319
happens maybe people will froth on it and you'll say great awesome this is a good idea let's get

254
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,859
let's get some more let's build the team let's get more help in or maybe no one cares about it

255
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:56,940
in which case there's your answer as well what a remarkable courageous and brilliant australian

256
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,599
terria pitt if you didn't hear the full conversation she certainly put me back in

257
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:03,079
my place a couple of times i encourage you to go and check that out

258
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:15,289
marcus gordinio the former ceo and now executive director of fair share who cooked tens of

259
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:20,690
thousands of meals a year nutritious meals to support the lives of australians living in

260
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:26,609
hardship i sat down with him at his industry-leading kitchen space in collingwood in melbourne what a

261
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:30,869
chat his insight into creating and sharing a vision focuses on the work he's doing at fair

262
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:37,089
share but offers a perspective that isn't always considered it's interesting as this food relief

263
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,150
sector has has evolved and i think it's going to be a big thing in the future i think it's going to

264
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:45,869
evolve and matured over the last couple of decades um there are some great organizations

265
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:53,849
and some fantastic people doing good work but i think what um for for me we needed to find was

266
00:22:53,849 --> 00:23:01,109
our niche in that um and for us it wasn't too difficult it was around the cooking bit

267
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:09,029
and so therefore if i look at food bank and oz harvest and second bite and fair share all of us

268
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:16,069
have surplus food all of us give food to frontline charities but only one of us cooks on a scale

269
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:23,309
and so more and more we're having conversations with those other organizations at a strategic

270
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:30,769
level at an operational level around fair share honing its operations to just that cooking bit

271
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:38,349
so it means that ingham's chicken can approach second bite and say we've got probably two to

272
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:40,150
three pallets of chicken breast

273
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:45,089
and maryland with a day or two left on it a week that we can donate to you but it can't be frozen

274
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:50,490
and it must be cooked before it's given to a charity and second bite obviously knowing the

275
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:55,130
value of that chicken it's tasty it's nutritious wants to do something with it but the only way

276
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:01,690
they can comply with that requirement of ingham's is by passing it through fair share so they said

277
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:06,789
yes they brought ingham's down here ingham's you had their checklist their notebook and they looked

278
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:10,150
at our procedures and our facilities and our staff and said right you can have this

279
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:17,869
chicken as long as it passes through fair share so this is where that mission is really narrowing

280
00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:22,730
to the cooking bit so let's second bite work with ingham's steward that relationship

281
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:30,150
bring collect bring the chicken to us we'll cook it but before that van of theirs backs out

282
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:35,809
load it up with three pallets of fair share meals and take it out to the local charities when you're

283
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:40,089
taking out the fruit and veg you're giving them as well so they've got chicken casserole chicken curry

284
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:44,130
and a whole lot of chicken based dishes as well we're not cooking it in a couple of minutes but

285
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:51,250
what we cooked the day before and so that's where um we've got our biggest facility up in brisbane

286
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:57,430
and it's there because there's so much surplus food in queensland that food bank gets offered it

287
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:02,450
the only solution to them is for it to be cooked and to food bank's credit they looked at it and

288
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:09,309
said well cooking isn't our shtick that's not our expertise we're warehouses we're logistics

289
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:10,150
but you can't cook it in a couple of minutes so we're not cooking it in a couple of minutes

290
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:15,369
that group down at fair share could come and set up up here and we could bookend them we'll bring

291
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:20,349
the food to them they can cook it and we'll distribute the meals they cook and so we've got

292
00:25:20,349 --> 00:25:25,150
australia's biggest charity kitchen up in brisbane and we've been working with food bank in that way

293
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:30,670
for five years and it just makes sense and it was funny going to a few philanthropists and they said

294
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:35,910
yeah we've supported food bank before we've given grants to second bite we've backed oz harvest and

295
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:40,150
we thought we'd done food relief but what's so unique about this is that you can't cook it in

296
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:45,549
you've teamed up here and you're working with respective strengths of charities not competing

297
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:50,470
because we see so much competition but actually collaborating around your respective strengths

298
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:56,630
really enjoyed that chat with the executive director of fair share marcus gordinio you hear

299
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,950
him mention collaboration if you get a chance go listen to the full episode and hear his take

300
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:06,930
on collaboration it is really worth a listen our final highlight comes from another remarkable

301
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,650
conversation it's with dr dinesh palapana

302
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:16,349
one of australia's first quadriplegic er doctors after a car crash dinesh was left without movement

303
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:21,250
in his legs and arms but that didn't stop him from fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor

304
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:26,490
perhaps dinesh's insight goes against me even talking about that but it's his attitude that

305
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:34,809
i found so interesting and compelling i would actually love to see a day where we don't need

306
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:39,549
to have these conversations we're just like oh yeah he's just a guy you know you know with the

307
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:41,849
spinal cord injury being a doctor like you know

308
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:50,470
not a big deal i'd love to see a day where where people can just do what they want they're accepted

309
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:58,690
and we just we just have this beautiful inclusive peaceful society where everyone can have all these

310
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:03,569
opportunities and do what they want and we're all thriving together so i'd love to see that and

311
00:27:03,569 --> 00:27:10,109
that's definitely a vision but i think um at the same time like if you if you want to be a leader

312
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:11,809
apart from things like

313
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:17,430
selflessness and wanting to give back to the community and the people around you know those

314
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:25,190
things but i think one of the most important things is also um being an example and living

315
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:31,450
a good set of values i think those values are really important like things like integrity and

316
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:41,910
honesty all those perseverance so um i think modeling those values and

317
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:46,849
living it and being an example is really important as well like uh like they say you know you're going

318
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:52,109
to be the change you want to see i think good leaders understand that they're not good at

319
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:57,150
everything um and i read a book about warren buffett a little while ago where he says that

320
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:02,029
what he does is to surround himself with people that are experts on various things

321
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:07,089
so he knows that he's not an expert on everything and he's he's like i just try to put together an

322
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:11,910
amazing baseball team so we can win the game yeah so i think um good leaders

323
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:17,990
pick people with different strengths and put the team together but i think the other thing is um

324
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:26,309
for us to grow and want for us to have um for us to perform better uh as individuals too it's about

325
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:33,289
understanding um that we don't know everything and that we have to defer to others and we have

326
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:39,089
to build our knowledge in certain areas and to have that humility um so i think it goes both ways

327
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:43,609
well what a fantastic conversation

328
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:49,869
that was with dr dinesh palapana a remarkable australian and what a fantastic insight from all

329
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:56,390
the guests we've had right across season 2022 that finishes up episode five in this special

330
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:00,829
empowering leaders series where we explored the idea of creating and sharing a vision

331
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:05,369
our final dimension which is really aligned with the work that we're doing at a leader

332
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:11,190
is leaders exploring curiosity it's a common theme that we hear a lot curious leaders really

333
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,450
wanting to find a way to improve and

334
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:21,670
constantly learn really looking forward to that one next week listener
