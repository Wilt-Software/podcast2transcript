00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,099
a listener production. Hello and welcome to episode six of a special series highlighting

2
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:14,880
our pillars of leadership and incredible responses that I've been getting from leaders that we've

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,679
spoken to and had the great pleasure of catching up with throughout the year. I've loved every

4
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:22,000
moment of the diverse range of guests that we've had on the Empowering Leaders podcast.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,640
Each have got incredible story to tell and a unique insight into how they lead. So these

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,939
type of insights that really align with this great passion of mine, a leader, a business co-founded

7
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:38,000
with my great friend Matt Wadowitz. It's a place where leaders like the ones you'll hear from today

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,659
come together to collaborate and to learn from each other in bespoke unique environments. If

9
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:48,000
you're interested in learning more about it, please head to elitercollective.com. We love

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,100
collaborating with all sorts of people across industry, sport, education, social venture,

11
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,299
the arts. You could even be involved in a small business or just simply wanting to improve the

12
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:02,159
way that you impact others in your environment. Whatever that environment is, I encourage you to

13
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:02,920
book a discovery call.

14
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:09,900
And check out our signature Elita Connect program where we come together to learn, to lead and to

15
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,780
collaborate. Now, speaking of collaboration, it's one of the most important aspects of so many parts

16
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,719
of our lives. From work to relationships, collaborating is one of the ways leaders are

17
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:23,959
able to impact their environments and get the best out of their teams and other people they

18
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:39,310
collaborate with. To round out this very special masterclass series, we're now going to dive into

19
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,969
some of my favorite chats around this topic.

20
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,069
Who would be the greatest leader in your life and who would you most want to collaborate with?

21
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:52,250
The following conversations are with, in my mind, some of Australia's most fascinating leaders,

22
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:58,430
including Scott Pape, John Aloisi, Luke Beveridge, Lakeisha Patterson, Nicole Gibson,

23
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:05,769
Peter Singer, Mim Bartlett, Paul Little, Jaguar Jones, Marcus Godinho and Gus Warland. But first

24
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:11,069
up, let's hear from AFL superstar, Marcus Pontempelli. Marcus Pontempelli debuted with

25
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:12,270
the Western Bulldogs in the AFL. He was a great player. He was a great player. He was a great player.

26
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:17,689
In 2014, in the eight years that has followed, he has achieved an almost unprecedented level of

27
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:23,110
success. He is at 26 years of age, a four-time All-Australian, four-time Best and Fairest winner,

28
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:28,150
including the Best and Fairest in the 2016 Premiership, which ended a 62-year drought

29
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:33,189
for the Western Bulldogs. He was voted by his peers in 2021 as the most valuable player.

30
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:38,129
In 2019, as the AFL Coaches Association Champion Player of the Year, he's the current

31
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:42,270
captain of the Western Bulldogs, universally respected and admired at every level.

32
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:46,590
Thanks for your time. Thanks, Das. Good to be with you and talking.

33
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:53,250
Who's been the greatest leader in your life? It's hard to go past my dad. I think family's

34
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:59,669
always the people that you spend the most time with, but you get probably the greatest

35
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:05,469
understanding of. My dad was a concreter from a very young age, from an Italian family,

36
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:10,689
so that seems to be where a lot of the Italians obviously ended up in the concreting business. But

37
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,150
he was someone...

38
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:20,150
Just from a watching perspective, worked incredibly hard, provided obviously for our

39
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:27,689
family, clearly with mum as well. But concreting is a really hard business. People who work in

40
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:31,610
that industry and probably the building industry in general, they work obviously long hours and

41
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:37,490
it's very physical work. But he definitely, when it came to my football and when I was probably

42
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:42,270
15 or 16, felt like I was falling further and further away maybe from the football.

43
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:45,650
And I think that's the football dream, which I'd sort of prayed and hoped for since a very

44
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,610
young age. But sometimes you just need that person sort of in your life who can give you

45
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:54,930
the confidence and lift your spirits and lift you up. And he did that for me pretty much

46
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:01,110
around that age. And it's to see someone I can rely on, someone in your life that you

47
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,349
know will always be there regardless. And then mum and dad are both the same in that

48
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:11,349
vein. But his work ethic and then his appetite to always...

49
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:17,569
Remember your family values is really strong and that definitely has rung true with me for sure.

50
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:23,449
And he was such a big influence for me from such a young age that he continues to do that sort of

51
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:28,149
regardless. Yeah. Well, I haven't heard you talk about that for a lot of... If there's kids listening,

52
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:34,069
that 15 years of age is a tough thing in sport for... You get the early developers who jump out,

53
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,149
have a massive size and strength advantage and kids lose their confidence at that age.

54
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,610
Did that happen to you a little bit where you're a bit of a later developer?

55
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,889
Yeah. And I wasn't sure how...

56
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:48,889
Far back you wanted to go sort of with this chap, but definitely as a 14, 15-year-old

57
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:55,610
late developer born later in the year, probably, yeah, lacked a bit of confidence at that age

58
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:01,529
when players start to either get bigger, grow faster. And once again, your mates around

59
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:07,509
you are all progressing, but you seem to be stuck in mud almost. And yeah, dad was probably

60
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:12,269
the one that probably saw me slowly questioning or doubting. And I imagine as a father, yeah,

61
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:18,230
you see that and try to do everything you can to continue to try and push your son along.

62
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:26,089
And it's funny, I spent school holidays, I'd work with him and sort of developed. And that's

63
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:31,589
probably where I got a sense for how hard he worked. I think that two-week school holiday

64
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:36,410
period you got, I'd spend with him being his lackey, just going to get different things from

65
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:41,089
him, not doing a whole lot, but just sort of watching. And actually being able to do that

66
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:42,269
probably gave me a greater appreciation for him. And I think that's probably where I got a sense for

67
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:47,310
appreciation for how hard he worked and then the things that he did just to provide for our

68
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:52,769
family. So I really probably even just now think about that and think what a great opportunity it

69
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:57,970
was to do that. And it also probably gave me a look at, I think if I can make this football thing

70
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:06,430
work, I'd probably prefer to do that maybe than be pouring concrete. And maybe he thought about

71
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,149
that, maybe he didn't. Maybe he thought it's a good insight into what I do and potentially what

72
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:12,269
you can maybe go and do if you want to. I think that's probably where I got a sense for how hard

73
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:16,689
you work enough for it. So inadvertently, he's probably had an impact like that without even

74
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:21,389
probably thinking it, or maybe he was smarter than I give him credit for and did. But definitely as

75
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:26,689
a 15-year-old, I sensed I was falling behind and had a bit of a growth spurt probably when I was

76
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:34,029
16, 17. And I remember him, we went down to one of the training sessions at the Northern Knights,

77
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:40,310
more or less just to try and show me that it's sort of a bit in your head that these kids are

78
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,209
good, but you're definitely capable enough.

79
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:49,870
To be sort of out there training. And like I said, he would be out the back with me. He didn't

80
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:55,610
grow up playing much sport or play football like I did. And he'd be doing his best just to try and

81
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:01,490
support his son in what his hopes and dreams were. So yeah, I definitely felt myself, I guess,

82
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:06,910
coming back to the initial question, falling a bit behind. He was there from a confidence

83
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,329
perspective to try and sort of continue to lift my spirits. And sure enough, I managed to

84
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:15,930
grow, develop a bit more confidence and then really come on late sort of in my, I guess,

85
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,790
my draft year, which was sort of all started with his initial push.

86
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,689
What a gift that is to have someone like that in your life and still to this day. The final question

87
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:29,949
is back to the word of collaboration. If you're asking this question, if you could collaborate

88
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:34,089
with anyone that could be in any part of your life, Bono, I know you've got passions outside of

89
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:39,250
your love of football, but if there was any collaboration, any person, who would spring to

90
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,750
mind? Straight away, I think sort of Roger Federer.

91
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:48,990
Which, you know, maybe that's just from a, you know, he's an incredible, you know, obviously,

92
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:54,230
you know, tennis player, but I've always admired the way that he sort of handles himself clearly

93
00:07:54,230 --> 00:08:01,089
off the court, the things that he does, how he speaks. There's a real genuine sort of nature to

94
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:07,509
him. And I think a lot of people are in the very similar vein of how they sort of see him. And

95
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:11,970
he's a, you know, authentic person. And I love that probably about him,

96
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:18,790
can, you know, yeah, represent, you know, such a, you know, really nice and caring and,

97
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:24,189
you know, nurturing sort of personality and be such a, you know, obviously a successful

98
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:28,529
sort of tennis player and athlete. So he'd be one that I think if you could just sort of sit

99
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:30,110
down and have a coffee with, it'd be really interesting.

100
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,190
Jono Luisi is a legend of Australian sport. He's widely respected as one of Australia's

101
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:41,409
greatest ever players. The first Australian player to play at the highest level and score

102
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,190
in the three big leagues.

103
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:49,210
of world soccer, La Liga in Spain, Premier League in UK and Serie A in Italy. Jon scored 127 goals

104
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:56,210
in his 459 senior appearances in an outstanding professional career spanning 20 years. On top

105
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:02,169
of that, Jon scored 27 goals in 55 matches representing Australia, a record at the time

106
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:08,370
of Jon's retirement from the game. Jon's penalty kick that took the Socceroos into the 2006 World

107
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,250
Cup was voted by the Sport Australia Hall of Fame as one of the three greatest

108
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,750
moments in Australian sporting history. Jon is the current head coach of A-League Club

109
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,590
Western United. And I feel very privileged to call Jonny a friend. We went to school

110
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:24,409
together, Jon, way back in year three. And it's always great to catch up with you, mate.

111
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:25,149
Thanks for your time today.

112
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:32,029
Thanks for having me on, Daz. I have to say my dad, you know, because just the way that

113
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:38,809
he's, you know, gone about bringing up a family, first of all, and also running a business

114
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:41,809
for so long and also finding time to...

115
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:47,610
To coach in soccer. He probably regrets that he got us down that path because he said,

116
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:52,250
you know, I would have loved to have lived in Adelaide, back in Adelaide, but you've,

117
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:57,289
you know, you left home at 16, you haven't come back. So it's nearly 30 years now. But

118
00:09:57,289 --> 00:10:03,690
yeah, so I would say my dad has been, you know, probably the best leader in terms of

119
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,690
who I learnt most off of. And I'm still learning today, you know.

120
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,990
So you pick up the phone and ring Rocky, there's something going on in your life.

121
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:11,250
Yeah.

122
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:11,649
Yeah.

123
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,009
Yeah.

124
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:18,149
And look, sometimes, you know, because he can be pretty negative still, you know.

125
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,309
Have you had that conversation as you've got older? Have you said, because I remember talking

126
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:26,789
to you as we would catch up along the journey and if you're back in town playing for Australia

127
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:32,669
and grab a coffee with you and you could have had an unbelievable year in the Premier League

128
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:35,590
in the UK, but Rocky was on to you about a certain part of your game.

129
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:35,850
Yeah.

130
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:37,629
And have you sort of said to him occasionally?

131
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:41,529
Oh, yeah. Often. I always say to him that... And look,

132
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:44,950
he's negative. By nature, I think he's negative.

133
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,509
Does he laugh about that?

134
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:53,250
He does, but then he'll just like let it go. But, you know, but sometimes it's not bad

135
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:58,710
because you need sometimes a few home truths, you know. So, you know, he might say something

136
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:03,049
that you go back and you go, you know what, I think he's right. I think he's right. So

137
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:08,289
I need to have a good look at that. You know, or, you know, dad, like settle down. You know,

138
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,509
this is, that's a one off. It doesn't, it's not a constant. So, you know, I think he's

139
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:15,230
you know, you're negative because of just the result or something like that. But, you

140
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,490
know, if it's something that you look and you go, no, that's happening on a regular

141
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,389
basis. I think he's right there. You know, but he was ruthless in terms of, you're right.

142
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,250
Like, oh, when I was playing, I remember having the best season I've had with Portsmouth.

143
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,409
It was in the championship in England and I was scoring game after game and he came to

144
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:37,450
visit me and, you know, he goes, you've gone backwards. And I was like, what do you mean?

145
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:41,049
He goes, your touch is not as good as what it used to be. And, you know,

146
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:46,509
you're not playing the same way. And I go, dad, I'm scoring every week and I'm a striker.

147
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,830
And then, but then I looked back and then after that, I started to work again on my

148
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:57,090
basic skills because I was going, you know what? He's not too far off. He's right. But

149
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,570
he was just, it hurt at the time.

150
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,750
Yeah, it's interesting. I had a very similar but different relationship with my dad. Super,

151
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:09,909
super close. He played and I was a father-son in, you know, in Australian rules football

152
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:11,370
and I'd ring him.

153
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:16,129
All the time. We lost him a little over a year ago, but it's funny, mate, because I

154
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:18,750
could pick up the phone. We might speak for two minutes or two hours, you know, depending

155
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,809
on if there was something going on, but I can have those conversations with him in my

156
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,309
head. Because I know exactly what he would say. He was less prescriptive. He wouldn't

157
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:30,950
tell me what to do, but he'd ask me questions and then in that way sort of find out myself.

158
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,330
So, but you're lucky in life, aren't you? If you had a father figure like you've had

159
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,269
and I was incredibly lucky to have, it's a gift, isn't it? To have that throughout your

160
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:41,210
life and you can hear how close that relationship is.

161
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:46,509
It is a gift. Others need to look elsewhere. Obviously, they, you know, might have an uncle

162
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:52,730
or, you know, a relative or a close mate or an older, you know, mentor. And I'm lucky

163
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,889
that, you know, I've had my dad there. You know, sometimes I don't call him after a game

164
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:02,970
because I don't want to hear the negative side. I'll leave her for a few hours and then,

165
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:09,149
you know, maybe speak to him a few days later. But, you know, it is always, you know, good

166
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:11,509
to have someone that, you know, that you're close to.

167
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:14,289
Close to that wants the best for you as well.

168
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:20,169
Now, final question, Johnny. The work we're doing, we're massive on collaboration and

169
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:24,710
seeing where that's heading at a leader. And I ask you this question, if you could collaborate

170
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:29,750
with anyone in the world, it could be on anything. It could be a coach. It could be outside

171
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,210
interests from your coaching world or from professional football. Is there anyone you've

172
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,710
ever thought you'd like to collaborate with someone? Question without notice for you.

173
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,769
Yeah, I would say that there's always coaches.

174
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,029
It's about coaches because, you know...

175
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:43,529
That's your world.

176
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:48,230
Yeah, that's my world. So, there's a Spanish coach called Luis Enrique. And I've had the

177
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,929
privilege to meet him a couple of times and spend time at Barcelona when he was coaching

178
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:58,009
Barcelona. But he's the current coach of the Spanish national team. And he's been through,

179
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:03,850
you know, a lot of ups and downs in his life in general. But his daughter passed away a

180
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:09,070
few years ago from cancer. And she was only eight years old. And, you know, now he's back

181
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,570
coaching the Spanish national team.

182
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:10,590
Yeah.

183
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:10,610
Yeah.

184
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:10,629
Yeah.

185
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:10,649
Yeah.

186
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:10,669
Yeah.

187
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:10,690
Yeah.

188
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:10,710
Yeah.

189
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,730
Yeah.

190
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:10,750
Yeah.

191
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:10,809
Yeah.

192
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:10,830
Yeah.

193
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:10,889
Yeah.

194
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:10,950
Yeah.

195
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:10,990
Yeah.

196
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:11,070
Yeah.

197
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:11,129
Yeah.

198
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:11,169
Yeah.

199
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:11,230
Yeah.

200
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:11,509
Yeah.

201
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:16,649
The way he leads the group and the way he's a leader of men and the way he actually can

202
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:21,389
adjust, you know, in certain environments. Because, you know, he was coaching Barcelona

203
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:28,230
when they had Lionel Messi, Suarez, Neymar, and you go on. They're hard three to coach.

204
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:35,690
Messi is actually the person that runs that football club, you know. And he had his moments

205
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:41,230
with him because Luis Enrique, he can be a hothead at a time. But he stepped away from

206
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:47,590
the way of being that and allowed others to control Messi in a different way. And then

207
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:51,649
you see him with the Spanish national team and he's got a really young group of players

208
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:58,289
that they're just looking up to him. And he's sort of always joking around with them, you

209
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:02,690
know, always being himself around them in a different sort of way. And I just find it

210
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,789
fascinating how he can just, you know, move into a different environment and, you know,

211
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:09,029
be a leader in a different way.

212
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:09,309
Yeah.

213
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:09,590
Yeah.

214
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:10,629
It's a great answer, Johnny.

215
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:16,250
I mean, to me, that art of leadership that I love is it's very different to the experience

216
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,470
I had playing sport. It was one size fits all. And if you didn't fit into that box,

217
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:24,789
you just went up to it and you moved on. I felt like we lost a lot of good people because

218
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:29,210
of that. So you're saying that ability to say you've got to treat Lionel Messi very

219
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,950
differently to, you know, a young guy coming through the Spanish national team. And you

220
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,190
think he does that as well as anyone you've seen?

221
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:40,149
Yeah. Yeah. He does it as well as anyone I've seen. Look, with Barcelona, it's funny because

222
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:44,509
the recognition, but he doesn't care. Like, he walks into a press conference and he goes,

223
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:50,230
all right, you're going to ask me stupid questions. You know, but he knows that the media, you

224
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,529
know, very powerful, especially in a country like Spain where football is everything. But

225
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:58,190
he just, it doesn't bother him. He said, if I lose one or two games, I'm going to get

226
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,529
the sack anyway. So I don't need the media. So that's probably why he hasn't got the recognition

227
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:06,029
of a Guadagnole because Guadagnole, he's got the full package. You know, he can walk into

228
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:10,210
a press conference and just, you know, control the whole, you know, environment.

229
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:15,250
He's a half stand-up comedian these days, Guadagnole. Do you think that's part of his

230
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,929
arsenal as well, where he can play that role really well?

231
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:24,570
And, you know, I talk about Luis Enrique because I, you know, I met him a few times. I've never

232
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:30,230
met Guadagnole, but I love the way he's been able to go into different countries and still

233
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:35,950
be able to go on different cultures and control, not control in the sense that he's controlling,

234
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,610
but able to get success and get his teams to play a certain style of football.

235
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:45,389
And win playing that way. And then you've got, on the other side, you've got someone

236
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:49,950
like a Klopp. I'm sticking with football here because that's the main thing that I follow

237
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:56,970
and love. And Klopp is this energetic person that always seems to have a smile on his face.

238
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:02,049
But you know that he's going to get angry, but it's, you know, that he's a lovable character.

239
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:08,990
He's walked into, you know, that Liverpool club, high expectations, but have struggled

240
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,769
to win anything.

241
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:16,349
Premier League in 30 odd years. And he walks in there and he just gives everyone a lift.

242
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:20,710
And to sustain that, it's been about seven years now that he's sustained that level.

243
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:26,109
And they play with intensity and a passion. And that's him. You can just see it, you know.

244
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:31,109
He gets the crowd going when he walks out into the field. And just, you know, to be

245
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:36,029
around and see how they are every day would be fascinating. And, you know, I would love

246
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:40,569
to be able to, you know, get in their inner circle and see how they, you know,

247
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,950
that they treat their players and treat the people around them.

248
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:49,170
Scotty Pape, known as the Barefoot Investor, has changed the paradigm completely for how

249
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,930
millions of Australians think and manage their personal finances. His book, The Barefoot

250
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:58,029
Investor, The Only Money Guide You'll Ever Need, is the highest ever selling book in

251
00:17:58,029 --> 00:18:02,950
Australian history, with over two million copies sold. His follow-up book, The Barefoot

252
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:07,670
Investor for Families, is also a number one bestseller. Scott's leadership in lobbying

253
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,609
state and federal MPs to overhaul financial stability.

254
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:16,450
Literacy in schools has put that issue firmly on the agenda. Scotty Pape's positive contribution

255
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:21,450
to the financial health and education of millions of Australians is a great story of passion

256
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,410
and leadership. Welcome to the Empowering Leadership Podcast, Pape. Thanks for joining

257
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:25,589
me.

258
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:34,349
Thank you, Das. Now, I'm, I think the greatest leader in my life. Well, I would say my parents,

259
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:40,450
obviously. My dad sat me down and paid me in one BHP share, which,

260
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:45,750
uh, blew my mind as a little kid, you know, in, uh, and, uh, you know, just having, as

261
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,130
I get older and deal with different people, having two parents that loved each other and

262
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:57,309
that loved me is such a huge step up in life, um, because not everyone gets it. Um, Warren

263
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:02,670
Buffett, uh, the, who we've just spoken about, um, I've met a couple of times.

264
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,650
How much time have you had with, uh...

265
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,430
Not, not enough.

266
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:05,750
Yeah.

267
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:07,869
Not enough. The time is, is very valuable with him.

268
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,430
But you, you're a regular pilgrim to, uh...

269
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:10,849
Omaha.

270
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:11,250
Omaha.

271
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,789
We're, we're not going through pandemics.

272
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:16,609
Um, and do you, do you enjoy that as much as for you? That, that's your grand final,

273
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:16,750
isn't it, Papey?

274
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,730
Yeah, it's my grand final, mate.

275
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:18,569
You love it, don't you?

276
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:18,990
Absolutely, yeah.

277
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,690
And, and is the wisdom still, he's over 90 now?

278
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:28,170
Yeah, he's, he's, what it is about him is that he has lived a very authentic life. You

279
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:33,549
know, he, um, he has become the richest person on earth. He still lives in the same house

280
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:38,349
that he, that, um, that he bought when he was a young person, um, loves his kids and

281
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:39,630
has given all the money away.

282
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,089
Yeah.

283
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:43,789
I think that is something, you know, I, you don't learn anything from, from me now. I

284
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:48,589
don't learn anything, but it's that re, it's like going to church. It just reinforces that

285
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:55,269
this is a guy who is the real deal. Money has not tainted him. Um, and he's made all

286
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:58,990
this money, he's given it all away. And, and so that legacy I think is really interesting.

287
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,710
And then the other one would be my wife who has supported me through deciding to go back

288
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,930
to TAFE to be a mature age student and, you know, drinking beer on a Thursday in the college,

289
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:09,990
uh, uh, lawns when she's...

290
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:13,670
Going home with the kids and stuff and supporting me with all the stuff that I've done. And,

291
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:15,130
and yeah, it's been good.

292
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,910
So we are into the world of collaboration. I love that you are honest enough to say that

293
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,369
it's hard for you and that's what, you know, tread your own path, you know, authentically

294
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:26,990
yourself. But if you could collaborate with anyone, is it in anything? And it mightn't

295
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:31,589
be finance, it might be you've wanted to write a song with someone or is there any collaboration

296
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:32,970
that, that would jump out at you?

297
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:39,069
Well, I mean, I think that the thing that I'm always interested in is, um, you know, the

298
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:40,009
space that I'm in.

299
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:44,369
And one of the things that I would like to do that I haven't done yet, but I, but I'm

300
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:53,509
interested in is I do believe that small business is the backbone of our country. And the one

301
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:58,930
area that I haven't really focused on is that I think that there's not enough training and

302
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,589
help for our small businesses. Anyone can set up a small business and you give it a

303
00:21:02,589 --> 00:21:07,069
go and we all know that the majority of them fail and you learn by trial and error. But

304
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:10,069
I do think that there could be something that you could do.

305
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:16,410
That I would like to collaborate with, with somebody who has been very successful, that

306
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:23,230
you could create something for small businesses. What I do is, um, uh, as part of my financial

307
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:27,130
counseling is, um, there's a small business debt helpline. A lot of small businesses get

308
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:31,950
in trouble and I see the pain that that inflicts on not only the business owners, but the family

309
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:38,029
and the kids. So there's something there I'd like to collaborate there to try and help,

310
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:39,869
um, help those small businesses.

311
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:44,769
They do it bloody tough and they work incredibly hard. You and I are both from small business

312
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:48,650
families. You know how hard it is. That's something that I would like to do. But, you

313
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,130
know, I'm just going to focus on the kids.

314
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:54,230
Well, I'd love to see that happen, uh, Pepe, because it's, uh, it is close to my heart

315
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:59,369
as well. Grew up in the hospitality industry, still, uh, actively, uh, involved in the hospitality

316
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:02,650
industry. Hasn't made a lot of fun in Melbourne, you'd imagine, for the last couple of years.

317
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:05,990
And, and, and you're right. It's one of those things. There's no playbook really hard to

318
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,049
get, um, other people sharing their IP.

319
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:09,809
Yeah.

320
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:12,930
Hoping there's going to be a better sharing economy in that space.

321
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:17,269
And there's a, there's a lot, we inflict a, it's sort of like finance. We, we suppose,

322
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,450
presuppose a lot of knowledge. So, you know, that you got these kids coming out, they're

323
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:24,549
18, they're, they've got to, supposed to know what health insurance is and super and all

324
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:28,950
this stuff. And with employees, we expect them, you've got to have all these regulations,

325
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,849
the pay grades, all these things. And you're trying to make a buck and you've got all these

326
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:36,750
other regulations. Something that actually mentors and helps those people. I know there

327
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,690
are programs around, but I would just like to try.

328
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,690
And work with someone who really has a deep knowledge and skill in that. And that's not

329
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,009
me.

330
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:49,569
In 2016, Luke Beveridge coached the Western Bulldogs in the AFL to their second premiership

331
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:54,549
in the club's history, ending a 62 year drought. He has twice been recognized by his peers

332
00:22:54,549 --> 00:23:00,569
as the outstanding coach of the year in 2015 and 2016. Last season, 2021, he coached the

333
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:04,869
Bulldogs to just their fourth grand final in close to a hundred years in the VFL AFL

334
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:09,349
competition. He's playing career extended over a decade and more than a hundred AFL

335
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:09,670
games.

336
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:14,549
Luke Beveridge is universally respected for his sense of purpose, his vision and his

337
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:17,690
leadership. Bevo, it's always great to spend time with you. Thanks for joining me on the

338
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,009
podcast.

339
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:20,829
It's a pleasure to ask. Thanks for having me today.

340
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,490
If you could collaborate with anyone in the world, and it could be on anything, Bevo,

341
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:29,369
it could be your love of surfing, it could be coaching, collaboration where we're interested

342
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:32,970
in. If you could collaborate, it might be in a rock band. Bevo, who would you collaborate

343
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:33,269
with?

344
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:39,670
Well, right at this point in time, I'd say Peter Garrett. Is that right?

345
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:46,730
Yeah. I've been thinking a lot about Peter Garrett, and I've always admired him fiercely.

346
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:56,369
My interest, my desire to be more influential in the First Nations space and recognition

347
00:23:56,369 --> 00:24:04,910
of Indigenous rights and reconciliation has really escalated over the last few years.

348
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:09,569
A good friend of mine, David Quinn, Paul Thompson, have been influential there.

349
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:16,210
He's on the scenes with me. Obviously, Peter has had a huge passion in that space. He's

350
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:24,950
want to influence our thinking around the environment. Obviously, a lot of the songs

351
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:30,690
that Minot Oil have sung and that they've written over the years have been really sensitive

352
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:36,730
to the environment and definitely First Nations people. His journey for me has been fascinating

353
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,369
for him to go into politics.

354
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:45,150
It's been a long, long time at federal level. I'd love to sit down and talk to him about

355
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:52,869
why not, because for me, he's just one of the most stand-up characters that Australia

356
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:58,109
has ever had the benefit of being exposed to.

357
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:07,049
And when you think of the diversity of him as an artist in the music industry, but then

358
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:07,910
as a politician.

359
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:09,049
Yeah.

360
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:09,069
Yeah.

361
00:25:09,069 --> 00:25:09,089
Yeah.

362
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:09,130
Yeah.

363
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:09,150
Yeah.

364
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:09,210
Yeah.

365
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:09,250
Yeah.

366
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:09,269
Yeah.

367
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:09,289
Yeah.

368
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:09,390
Yeah.

369
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:09,410
Yeah.

370
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:09,430
Yeah.

371
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:09,670
Yeah.

372
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:16,250
As a freedom fighter and a rights preserver, what an amazing person. So he'd be probably

373
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:22,369
number one in the way I've been thinking recently, because I just think he's just such an amazing

374
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:25,390
human being, and he'd be probably at the top of my list.

375
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:30,890
And the courage to go on the inside and go through the path at his age, and he could

376
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,109
have toured around the world and kept doing that. That would have been a pretty hard thing

377
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:39,089
to give up, I suspect, Minot Oil for that period of time. But I'm going to go in and

378
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:43,410
try and enlist a change from the inside. And then the hand grenades got thrown at him

379
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,950
everywhere. But the humility of his exit and the class with which he, you know, with all

380
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:52,089
sorts of mud being thrown his way, you know, it'd be a great conversation. I'd love to

381
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:56,569
hear a transcript of you two getting together. So I've given you some think time, mate, on

382
00:25:56,569 --> 00:26:01,809
the greatest leader in your life. Is there anything or anyone, or is it a handful of

383
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:01,990
people?

384
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:08,809
Yeah. I mean, so many influential people along the way, Dars. But the guy who's been a great

385
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:16,369
who stands out for me is a guy named Neil Jensen. Neil was the one who set up the financial

386
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:25,410
intelligence units in Australia. He was the CEO of Austrac. But the Australian FIU and

387
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:30,829
the Canadian FIU were the most powerful financial intelligence units in the world. Now, he was

388
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:36,890
involved in helping other countries set their own up, where essentially, you know, the data

389
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,509
capture and the analytics.

390
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:43,970
Around trying to detect money laundering and the mechanisms that surround that, he

391
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:50,630
was the one who was guiding and influencing. Austrac really has got two main offices, or

392
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:56,490
back when I worked there, and one's in New South Wales and one's here in Melbourne. And

393
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:04,529
Neil happened to be based in Melbourne at the time. And what struck me was he would

394
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:08,789
walk the floor as a CEO. He'd talk to everyone. He'd shake hands with them. He'd talk to everyone.

395
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:16,650
He knew everyone by their name, and he'd call them by their name. And he was at pains

396
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:23,269
to make sure that anyone new to the agency would feel welcome. And he was a CEO. Other

397
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:27,670
people could do that, but he felt it was important for him. And this is a government agency.

398
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:36,549
This isn't a private entity that he owns or runs. You might say, well, it's not part of

399
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:37,410
his remit, you know.

400
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,049
Right.

401
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:38,670
But he did.

402
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:43,690
He thought it was absolutely critical. And there was a real power in that because people

403
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:50,390
knew he cared. And so as far as the influence from the top down and the relationship piece,

404
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:56,089
it was really strong. There were great connections there at Austrac. And the reason why he stands

405
00:27:56,089 --> 00:28:04,589
out so much is he retired. And during the transition into the new legislation, they

406
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:08,089
recruited a lot of senior management from other government agencies, and there was a

407
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:08,589
new CEO.

408
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:15,190
And there was a new CEO who came in. And the whole environment changed. And that personable

409
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:22,609
caring aspect of the organization went within the space of six months. And I realized how

410
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:29,170
much of an influence Neil Jensen had on Austrac as an agency. And for me, it was just so tragic

411
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:35,710
that that agency now was in the state that it was. And I experienced the change and even

412
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:38,789
the toxicity that now existed in some of the agencies. And I think that's a really important

413
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:39,809
thing as well, Isn't it?

414
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:40,809
Yes, absolutely.

415
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:41,869
I love that the team became important to the team. And then you have when the team left

416
00:28:41,869 --> 00:28:42,869
and heMusik kept coming back. There was no reason why he wasn't head 채 It was overwhelming

417
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:43,869
for me, including the timing because.

418
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:44,869
Absolutely.

419
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:46,230
You know, there we go a so back and he's never heard again fromoured Ph Shugeneration

420
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,230
You don't think anything about Chuck.

421
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,230
I go back to the years.

422
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,230
Yeah,ян and Kirk I've soon back and resolvent a couple of times.

423
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,230
And I've got kind of a name briefly or just got to say that we do everything we're still

424
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,230
doing internally. We don't really know who do that to firms yet.

425
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,230
And it's tough when you're like, oh, why why I am making a point of doing something

426
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,230
like that.

427
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:01,029
Paralympic swimming superstar. She is a Queensland, Australian Commonwealth and Paralympic

428
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:06,509
champion, a six-time world record holder, a seven-time Paralympic medalist, including two

429
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:11,910
gold in Rio and a gold in Tokyo. She's also a two-time Paralympic Commonwealth Games gold

430
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:17,049
medalist, as well as being a recipient of the Order of Australia medal for her outstanding

431
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:21,529
achievements. Lakeisha, or Lucky, it is great to meet you. Thanks for joining me.

432
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:22,769
Thanks for having me on.

433
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,150
Who has been the greatest leader in your life?

434
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:31,990
Oh, that's a tough question. But I suppose probably as cliche as it is, it's definitely

435
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:37,230
been my mum. I know I've mentioned her a lot, but she really is such an incredible person. And

436
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:43,829
like I alluded to a little bit earlier, you know, you don't need a specific title to be a leader.

437
00:29:44,009 --> 00:29:48,809
You don't have to be, you know, the prime minister, the CEO of a company, a manager.

438
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:55,049
It can be those little people in your life that can make a huge difference. And my mum has been

439
00:29:55,049 --> 00:30:01,309
a massive impact in my life. And I can hands down say I would not be here without her in my life.

440
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:06,589
She's instilled all these remarkable traits in myself, you know, the strength, determination,

441
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:11,230
resilience, perseverance, going after what you want, not being afraid to fail,

442
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:19,390
giving everything a go. I've learned all of this from her and more. And as well as, you know,

443
00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:24,849
a mix of what she's taught me and everyone else I've been able to encounter along my journey.

444
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:32,369
Be that coaches, other athletes and friends, people from different organisations and businesses

445
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:37,529
I've been able to meet with and speak with have really shaped me into the person I am today.

446
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:44,210
And yeah, it's really exciting to see the impact that they've had on my life. And hopefully I can,

447
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,670
you know, give that back to them and then to the community and hopefully to other people.

448
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:54,029
Yeah. And hopefully mum listens to this and I'm sure, you know, you've said that to her,

449
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:55,029
but that will be the real thing.

450
00:30:55,049 --> 00:31:00,210
Isn't it as a parent to understand the impact that she's had, you know, I'm sure on you and

451
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:05,130
your sisters and everyone around her is, you know, another incredible story and not told often enough.

452
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:11,369
Lucky, the family legends like your mum, it's great to hear you mention her the way that you do.

453
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:16,970
In the spirit of collaboration, we love it in our world. We see great collaboration as a real

454
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:22,269
strength. If you could collaborate with anyone in the world, Lucky, on any plane, whether it's

455
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:25,029
your sporting life or any other aspect of your life, is there someone that you would like to

456
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:31,289
Oh, oh my gosh, throwing me in the deep end here. That's, that's a very tough question.

457
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:38,289
There's so many people I would love to, to meet and talk to in the world.

458
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:43,250
I couldn't narrow it down. Like there's so many different aspects of my life and

459
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:48,930
that have, you know, made me the person I am being the athlete space,

460
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:54,349
the personal development space and person space.

461
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:55,470
Oh, I don't know.

462
00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:00,789
I'll put you on the spot here, Lucky. Can I give you some inspiration? I've had people say,

463
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:06,269
but Lindsay Boyd is a great author and leadership coach in the UK. She said,

464
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:11,690
Elon Musk, I want to, I want to collaborate with Elon Musk. I had Luke Beveridge, who's the coach

465
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:17,309
of the board, who said he wanted to collaborate with Peter Garrett, who is starting to really

466
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:22,390
reflect on the First Nations people and their influence. So we've had this rain. I don't know,

467
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,150
it is a hard question. I have put you,

468
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:27,769
put everyone on the spot with that. So it could be anywhere in your life. I'm,

469
00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:33,210
I'm buying you a bit of think time here. Like, is there, is there anyone now with a bit of time that?

470
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:39,670
No, I can't think. There's so many names come to mind, but then I don't want to just,

471
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:44,809
you know, choose one. That's not, that's not who I am. I'm sorry. It's not quite the answer you're

472
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:50,650
looking for. Nicole Gibson is a multi-award winning social entrepreneur that prefers to

473
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,990
be known as an unstoppable messenger of love and human potential.

474
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:58,910
At 18 years of age, Nicole established a not-for-profit and grew it to sustainability.

475
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,190
At 20 years of age, she was a finalist for the Young Australian of the Year,

476
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:07,589
listed as one of Australia's top 100 most influential women at 21. She is a fierce

477
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:11,569
ambassador for mental health innovation and connection after recovering from her own

478
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:17,470
terrifying lived experience with anorexia nervosa through her teenage years. Nicole is the CEO of

479
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:21,829
the Rogan Roos Foundation and recently completed three terms as the youngest Commonwealth

480
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:23,869
Commissioner for Mental Health. Nicole, it's great to have you on the show. Thank you.

481
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:24,130
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

482
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:24,329
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

483
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:27,509
It's a great honour and privilege to spend some time with you and to catch up in person.

484
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,009
Thanks for joining me. Thank you, Luke.

485
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:35,339
Who's been the greatest leader in your life? Definitely my principal. That would be,

486
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:41,539
yeah, that would be one. I mean, on a personal level, he definitely, there's no other leader

487
00:33:41,539 --> 00:33:45,880
that's impacted me as much. Yeah. Pretty hard to go past that, isn't it? Yeah. It's a...

488
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,160
It was very defining for me. Yeah. Is he still teaching?

489
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:52,000
No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Retired or is he... On a farm.

490
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:55,660
Really? Yeah. Living the life. Yeah. And one of the things I've been doing for a long time is

491
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,339
one of the things I really want to do through this format actually is celebrate great educators

492
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:07,619
and, you know, we think it's undersold a lot. My great friend, Matt Waterwood, so we started

493
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:14,820
a leader leadership is a great educator and I feel like we, in Australia, quite do that

494
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:21,460
well enough. Oh, man. In other parts of the world, there's a lot more respect for people

495
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,639
who change people's lives like your principal did. It's undersold sometimes in this part

496
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:30,019
of the world. Teachers are expected to be so much, you know. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a

497
00:34:30,019 --> 00:34:37,599
big conversation too. And I think so much needs to change and I do think it will change. I think

498
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:44,280
we're going to most likely see a huge transformation of a lot of our systems and I hope education is

499
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:52,239
one of them because what worked, you know, 200 years ago, training kids to go into different

500
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,480
sort of batches of this factory style education. It's just...

501
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:00,539
It's not going to work for how the world is. And so, teachers are naturally not going

502
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:05,639
to be inspired, I think, working in an environment that actually isn't contextually relevant.

503
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:12,539
Peter Singer has been described as the world's most influential living philosopher. His book

504
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:18,239
Animal Liberation, published in 1975, is credited with starting the modern animal rights movement.

505
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,039
Peter's influence and extensive writing on the topic of effective altruism has led to

506
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,619
many of the richest people on the planet committing to donating.

507
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:30,619
The vast majority of their wealth in their lifetime. He's the founder of The Life You

508
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:36,099
Can Save, an organisation based on his book of the same name, which mounts a very convincing

509
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:40,699
argument that we should all be doing more to improve the lives of people living in extreme

510
00:35:40,699 --> 00:35:45,719
poverty. Peter was born in Melbourne in 1946, educated at Melbourne University and Oxford

511
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:51,239
in the UK. In 1999, Peter became the Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University. Peter

512
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:54,539
Singer, it's a great honour and a great privilege to meet you. Thanks for joining me on the

513
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:54,900
podcast.

514
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:57,860
You're very welcome, Luke, and I'm pleased to be able to talk to you.

515
00:35:58,179 --> 00:36:00,340
Who has been the greatest leader in your life?

516
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:07,019
The greatest leader in my life? Oh, I don't really know, but I have to say, you know,

517
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:11,199
this is maybe not the greatest leader of my life. But at the moment, I'm really admiring

518
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:17,199
President Zelensky of Ukraine. I think he's quite extraordinary, you know, especially

519
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:22,639
if you look at the background, I was following Ukrainian politics earlier on, and the corrupt

520
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,800
people that they had running that country.

521
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:28,980
They were some of the biggest leaders, and other leaders in the world, who, you know,

522
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,639
were just ripping off the country, making money for themselves. And then when there

523
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:36,960
was a big protest, they fled the country, and the previous ones are still in Russia.

524
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,179
And a lot of people expected when the Russians invaded, that he would leave Kiev and, you

525
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:46,340
know, either go to Lviv, which is more in the west, and away with the Russians, or actually

526
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:50,199
leave the country altogether. But instead, he stayed, and he took all his videos showing

527
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:55,219
himself walking around the main squares of the town, and he got everybody else to stay.

528
00:36:55,219 --> 00:36:58,360
I think he's been a fantastic leader for Ukraine.

529
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,500
Obviously, you could say the country has paid a heavy price for it,

530
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,500
but there wasn't really an alternative unless they wanted to be under Putin's thumb.

531
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:13,500
And so that's what comes to me at the moment when you ask that question,

532
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:17,860
rather than thinking back over the years, I'm thinking about Zelensky.

533
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:22,639
What a brilliant answer and what an extraordinary leader of the time,

534
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:26,300
as you said, the courage to not only stay, but as you said,

535
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:32,639
to really in real time declare where he is and show that he was being portrayed

536
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:37,579
as a former actor and a comedian and almost trying to picture him

537
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:42,980
as a sort of a clown president, but he's been anything apart from courageous

538
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,099
and admirable, hasn't he, under that sort of pressure.

539
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,860
It's been amazing to watch that in real time, for sure.

540
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:52,199
If you could collaborate with anyone in the world, Peter,

541
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:52,619
on anything.

542
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:58,599
Is there anyone that springs to mind, and clearly you've got these identifiable

543
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:01,400
passions of your life, but it could be in any other area.

544
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,320
Is there anyone that you can think of?

545
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:08,599
Well, there's a lot of very smart people doing important things for the world.

546
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:14,139
I think one of the important issues is artificial intelligence and where that's going.

547
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,599
So there are some smart people working for organizations like DeepMind.

548
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,619
I've had a little bit of contact with.

549
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,500
I've had a little bit of contact with some of them because I'm interested in some of

550
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,360
the ethical questions about AI and where it's going.

551
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:35,219
So that would be an interesting opportunity to work with them and trying to make sure

552
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:42,420
that AI is used for good, as it certainly has the potential to be, rather than for evil.

553
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:45,340
I'll have to follow up on that, just off the top.

554
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,500
What are the obvious concerns with artificial intelligence?

555
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,480
How damaging could it be if it is?

556
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:53,400
Not used for good?

557
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:58,539
Well, the overarching one that people are worried about is that as it gets better and

558
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:05,139
as it becomes really artificial general intelligence, so it's not just beating us a chess, but it's

559
00:39:05,139 --> 00:39:10,500
good in general, that if it's not aligned with our values, we might not be able to stop

560
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:10,659
it.

561
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,599
This is something that some of the people in the effective altruism movement have thought

562
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:21,619
about, people like Nick Bostrom and Will McCaskill, that we need to, they call it value alignment.

563
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,619
We need to align.

564
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:27,239
We need to align artificial intelligence with our values and make sure that it stays

565
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:27,619
aligned.

566
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,579
But even that's not quite enough, because when you say our values, then of course there's

567
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:32,599
the question, which values?

568
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:38,699
And certainly in the area of the treatment of animals, I think the values that most people

569
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:39,539
have are not good enough.

570
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:42,340
I don't want AI aligned with the way we treat animals now.

571
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,539
I want it aligned with the best values to produce alternatives to the way we're treating

572
00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:46,900
animals.

573
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:50,519
So there are, you know, that's just a couple of issues.

574
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:52,579
Clearly, there's many other issues as well.

575
00:39:52,699 --> 00:40:00,039
About discrimination within humans, about the use of AI for surveillance, which can

576
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:01,500
be put to negative uses.

577
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,980
So there's a huge range of questions.

578
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,500
Min Bartlett is a champion for strong, authentic leadership and wellbeing.

579
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:14,900
She's a qualified lawyer, psychotherapist, a sought-after coach facilitator, human rights

580
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,900
champion and gender equality advocate.

581
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:21,679
As a fluent Chinese speaker, she spent six years living and working in China, Hong Kong

582
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:22,400
and Singapore.

583
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:28,719
In law, sales and marketing, in 2015, Mim was recognised as one of the Financial Review's

584
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:29,820
100 Women of Influence.

585
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:36,000
Mim's work focuses on connecting people, ideas and resources that can lead to personal fulfilment

586
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,599
and social change in today's world.

587
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:42,420
In her work at Mim Bartlett Consulting, she challenges people to define their unique passion

588
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,860
or intersection, maximise their potential and generate positive change for themselves,

589
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:49,880
their work, their families and the communities they serve.

590
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,199
Mim, it's great to catch up with you today.

591
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,179
Thank you, Luke.

592
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:52,579
It's wonderful.

593
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:53,500
It's wonderful to be here.

594
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,719
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

595
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:57,960
Yeah, it's a really good question.

596
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:07,440
I'd say my mum around love and generosity and energy and zest that she'd bring to every

597
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,139
situation.

598
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,900
And then actually more kind of a little bit further afield, but Gloria Steinem, an incredible

599
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:21,119
feminist in America, the way she mobilised women and kind of empowered them to step up

600
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,139
and stand up for what they do.

601
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:27,300
Stand up for what they're worth and to believe in themselves and a whole lot more is absolutely

602
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,659
one of my role models too.

603
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,280
It feels like you're passing that on in all of the work that you're doing.

604
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,860
Is that inspiration for me?

605
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,000
I'm trying.

606
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,420
I'm trying one step at a time, but there's some incredible women who have gone before

607
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,179
us and I feel so grateful for them.

608
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,039
I'm just, I'm like a drop in the ocean.

609
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:48,820
So many people have just done incredible things and I love being inspired by them.

610
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,780
Yeah, and it's brilliant.

611
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,000
You know, whenever I have these conversations with...

612
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:56,139
with you and people, you know, think about being a father of a teenage daughter and not

613
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,679
really knowing where to go a lot of the time.

614
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,880
And so, you know, when there are people out there leading the way you are, it's the great

615
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,199
resources.

616
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:04,960
It's...

617
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,599
You're fumbling your way through, I'm sure.

618
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:09,039
I'd get that feedback from her if she was here.

619
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:15,820
In terms of collaboration, in the spirit of collaboration, is there anyone in any of your

620
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:20,079
varied and brilliant work that you've thought, if I could collaborate with that person, anyone

621
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,159
in the world on any issue?

622
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,119
Is there anyone?

623
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:22,820
Is there anyone that springs to mind?

624
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:25,159
Wow.

625
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,260
That's a great question, Luke.

626
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:33,400
Well, probably someone like Gloria Steinem because she's such a big visionary and she's...

627
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,320
and the impact that she's had just in so many areas of her life, but on such a big scale,

628
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:39,820
that would be amazing.

629
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,340
I went and heard her speak when she came to the Melbourne Town Hall and Mike came with

630
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,179
me and, I mean, it was just incredible.

631
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,320
So, yeah, that would be amazing.

632
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,239
I really loved my conversation last year with Mim Bartlett.

633
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:51,719
Truly inspiring.

634
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:55,119
He was an inspiring leader doing great things right across the globe.

635
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,239
I'm going to take a short break and we'll be back with my conversation with one of Australia's

636
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:01,039
most successful businessmen, Paul Little.

637
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,619
Paul Little is one of Australia's most successful businessmen.

638
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:17,019
In 1985, Paul negotiated a management buyout of the transport and logistics business Toll

639
00:43:17,019 --> 00:43:17,480
Holdings.

640
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,199
He went on to serve as managing director of the Toll Group from 1986 to 2011.

641
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,199
In that time, Toll grew from an 18-truck operation worth $1.5 million into an organisation that's

642
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,199
now in operation with 45,000-plus employees in 50 countries, eventually being sold to

643
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:36,159
Japan Post for $6.5 billion.

644
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:41,099
Paul's creativity and success has expanded through the Little Group investment in the

645
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:44,619
property, technology, marine transport and lifestyle sectors.

646
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,019
Paul and his wife, Jane Hanson, are very active philanthropists.

647
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,179
The Hanson Little Foundation has a singular objective to create a legacy of significant

648
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:55,420
and positive change that enables and inspires Australians.

649
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:58,139
Paul is the chairman of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation.

650
00:43:58,639 --> 00:43:58,780
He's also the chairman of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation.

651
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,780
He's the past chair of the Essendon Football Clubs and Visit Victoria.

652
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,820
Paul, in your mind, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

653
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:08,980
Oh, dear.

654
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,940
The greatest leader.

655
00:44:14,289 --> 00:44:16,530
I'd probably need to think about that one.

656
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:26,090
Are you talking about in every area of endeavour or are you talking about, I mean, I guess

657
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:30,489
I love getting advice from my family.

658
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:35,170
I love getting advice from my father when he was around and as a young man who probably

659
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:37,750
never thought that he would succeed.

660
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:43,210
I mean, you have a lot of self-doubt when you're younger and quite often that's what

661
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:44,389
drives you, I think.

662
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:51,789
But my father would always sort of point me in the right direction, I think, yeah.

663
00:44:51,949 --> 00:44:54,789
So he wasn't a leader, but he was my leader, yeah.

664
00:44:54,969 --> 00:44:59,510
And that is a common answer for people scared and they, you know, some people go to great

665
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:04,650
historical, you know, Mandela type leaders who they've read about and have had an influence

666
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:04,989
on them.

667
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:08,630
But those that had an influential parent, often that's where they start.

668
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,650
What sort of dad was he like?

669
00:45:11,769 --> 00:45:13,010
What sort of influence did he have?

670
00:45:13,809 --> 00:45:15,710
Yeah, he was very similar.

671
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:21,309
I mean, he played a few games with Melbourne, I think.

672
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:24,409
He was a great tennis player.

673
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:28,710
He was fairly...

674
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:34,130
He didn't have a crazy social life.

675
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,469
He was a good family man.

676
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:36,710
He was always around.

677
00:45:38,289 --> 00:45:45,530
Yeah, he was sensible, balanced, and he told me what he was thinking, which is probably

678
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:47,210
what I needed as a young man.

679
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:56,610
We see collaboration, as we said before, of being something that is really been beneficial

680
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,489
to the way people are thinking about leadership.

681
00:45:58,650 --> 00:45:59,409
Now, in that...

682
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:03,110
In that spirit, if you could collaborate with anyone on anything, Paul, and you've

683
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:08,130
got a diverse range of interests in any part of your life, is there someone that jumps

684
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,590
out at you that you'd like to collaborate with?

685
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:18,949
Yeah, if I had a problem or an opportunity of significance, I'd probably want to talk

686
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:20,309
to Jane about it, I think.

687
00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:25,690
And the two of you together, I mean, and she's had an extraordinary, you know, successful

688
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:29,170
life as an investment banker and, you know, she's an Order of Australia.

689
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:29,289
Yeah.

690
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:31,670
Alongside you for the work you do together.

691
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:36,809
So, it's a real partnership and a real collaboration on all those things, or do you have things

692
00:46:36,809 --> 00:46:38,170
that you sort of separated?

693
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:41,989
Oh, no, we don't always agree if that's what you mean.

694
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:49,650
No, no, but it's probably interesting for you and your listeners to know that Jane was

695
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:54,170
the banker who floated toll for us back in 93.

696
00:46:54,489 --> 00:46:55,070
Is that how you met?

697
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:55,409
Yeah.

698
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:56,250
I didn't know that.

699
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,809
And that's an interesting relationship to them.

700
00:46:58,809 --> 00:46:58,849
Yeah.

701
00:46:58,849 --> 00:46:58,969
Yeah.

702
00:46:59,289 --> 00:47:03,309
And was it an, it was, you know, they're an attraction straight away or?

703
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:06,250
Oh, you mean to the business or to me?

704
00:47:06,369 --> 00:47:18,010
Look, I think when Jane was asked by her sort of a quite a large, well-known global bank

705
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:24,389
to go out to a place called Brooklyn here in Victoria or in Melbourne, I mean, she knew

706
00:47:24,389 --> 00:47:25,949
where Brooklyn was in the US.

707
00:47:25,949 --> 00:47:29,250
She's slightly different than Brooklyn here in the western suburbs of Melbourne.

708
00:47:29,289 --> 00:47:35,030
So I think she'd thought she'd probably made the wrong decision to consider coming back

709
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:36,789
to Melbourne and working here for a while.

710
00:47:36,909 --> 00:47:48,469
But no, we talk about a lot of things obviously, and I respect her view, which comes probably

711
00:47:48,469 --> 00:47:51,590
from a different angle in my view with a lot of these things.

712
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:52,590
So it works well.

713
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:58,590
Marcus Godinho's impact on those less fortunate and in need is a great Australian story.

714
00:47:59,289 --> 00:48:03,690
FairShare, founded in 2007, is a charity that works with businesses to cook surplus

715
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,050
food into free, nutritious meals.

716
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:12,190
FairShare operates Australia's largest charity kitchens, where every week 1,000 volunteers

717
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:13,869
cook more than 50,000 meals.

718
00:48:14,389 --> 00:48:19,030
They collect food that business can no longer use, vegetables that no longer look perfect

719
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:23,710
but are perfectly edible, meat approaching its use by date, pastry offcuts from commercial

720
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:28,449
bakeries, high-fibre bread not sold on the day it was baked are some of the examples.

721
00:48:28,449 --> 00:48:33,070
Each of FairShare's ready-to-eat meals contain at least half an adult's recommended

722
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:37,849
daily intake of protein and vegetables to improve the diet and health of people who

723
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:39,050
have fallen on hard times.

724
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:44,210
Marcus's outstanding contribution is seen and recognised as one of Pro Bono Australia's

725
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:50,369
2022 Impact Award winners, City of Yarra Local Hero Award, and one of the 100 most influential

726
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:51,829
people in the City of Melbourne.

727
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:56,889
He's a Harvard University alumni in the not-for-profit management, innovation and performance sectors,

728
00:48:56,889 --> 00:48:58,289
as well as holding an MBA.

729
00:48:58,449 --> 00:49:06,469
Marcus, we have the title of this as Empowering Leadership, and yours is an incredible story

730
00:49:06,469 --> 00:49:07,530
of leadership.

731
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,869
In that spirit, who has been the greatest leader in your life?

732
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:12,949
Oh, goodness.

733
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,130
There have been a few.

734
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:24,300
I think one of the people who I've found most inspiring over the years is the person who's

735
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,460
succeeding me in the CEO role at FairShare.

736
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:27,940
Yeah.

737
00:49:28,659 --> 00:49:29,039
Yeah.

738
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:37,099
I think we talked about self-awareness before, and yeah, from, I mean, I know I'm a mobiliser.

739
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:42,800
I love engaging people externally and bringing them into FairShare and having them be part

740
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,079
of what we do.

741
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:51,960
I've been lucky to have people join and stay, and we've got a really strong team operationally,

742
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,719
and as our long-term president, David Harris, says, you're lucky because you can just hamble

743
00:49:57,719 --> 00:49:58,880
blindly over your shoulder.

744
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:05,159
I know that Kelly or any one of a number of people will catch that and run with it.

745
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:06,400
You don't need to look over your shoulder.

746
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:14,900
But look, FairShare's now around 70 staff, equivalent of about 45 full-time, and internal

747
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:21,980
leadership's as important as external leadership, and it's not a space that I play naturally

748
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:27,860
in, and I looked at it and thought, gee, I could train myself to do that differently,

749
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:28,679
to do it better.

750
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:37,840
I could spend time on it, and then somebody became available, and I'm speaking about Paul

751
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,960
Conroy, who's taken over from me, and I thought, gee, the team will be so much stronger if

752
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:47,260
he played at CEO than if I did, and you'd look at this in your footy career, and somebody

753
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:51,380
would come along, and over a few years, you'd think they'd play better in that position

754
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,280
than the person who had played there for five years.

755
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,960
The team will be stronger, so we're changing it, and that's how I've looked at this.

756
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,559
Lucky enough to have Paul.

757
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:03,960
Come in, and from day one, even though he said, I'll come in as COO, he acted like he

758
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:09,820
was CEO, which is exactly what I wanted, and it's what the organisation needed, and internally,

759
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:17,099
the staff responded so positively to it, and I just watch him with awe.

760
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:23,079
He's exactly what the organisation needed to be, FairShare 2.0, and it was a funny one

761
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:28,679
because a number of people have said to me, but FairShare was stronger than it ever had

762
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:28,920
been.

763
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,880
It was doing more important work and doing it so well, and you've changed it, and there's

764
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,860
a risk there, and I think one of the things for us is you don't want to throw the baby

765
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,639
out with the bathwater.

766
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:47,920
There was a real magic there at, I don't know what, but it was something, but you don't

767
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:53,500
want to lose that, but to see how Paul's now leading the organisation, it's wow, and I've

768
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,559
never worked with somebody who I've had as much respect.

769
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,019
Not easy.

770
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:01,960
But I just see the organisation even stronger for that.

771
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:05,599
And that takes incredible self-awareness and self-reflection.

772
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:12,380
Most people in the past give up that title, give up the hierarchy, and you shrug and you

773
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:17,679
think that isn't important to you, which again is reflective of the type of leadership we're

774
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:21,539
loving sharing, and those stories we're loving to share is to say, if I can find someone

775
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:26,579
to do that role better, that makes sense, but you still have to be in touch with your

776
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:28,599
ego and a range of...

777
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:30,159
There are other things to make that happen, so...

778
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:35,980
We've got a wonderful guy who's just about to step onto our board, and he's, I'm not

779
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:40,059
going to say who it is, but really impressive guy, and he said to me, Marcus, I've watched

780
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:44,280
over the years many founders, and I didn't start Fair Share, got involved very early

781
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,159
on, but didn't start it.

782
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:52,519
He said many founders haven't got the self-awareness when an organisation that's successful and

783
00:52:52,519 --> 00:52:58,300
gets to a point to know that it needs something else, and even if they do have the self-awareness,

784
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:05,059
they can't necessarily step away from that role, and to me, leadership is not about

785
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:08,519
a title, so I see myself in the leadership role at Fair Share.

786
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:15,500
That's not to undermine Paul's role as CEO, but we've got a wonderful partnership.

787
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,099
We bring different things to the organisation, and I think that just makes Fair Share stronger,

788
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:27,880
and I know that I can have even more impact now without being CEO, and that might sound

789
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:28,320
a bit odd.

790
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:33,340
But I think we're going to have so much more impact through him in that role, and so it's

791
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:37,739
about how you play the team to have the most impact.

792
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:38,400
Yeah, yeah.

793
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:38,679
That's what it's about.

794
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:39,559
It makes sense.

795
00:53:39,699 --> 00:53:40,960
Easier said than done for a lot of people.

796
00:53:41,019 --> 00:53:43,800
I'm thinking of Andrew Bassett, the founder of Seek, who I interviewed on this podcast,

797
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:47,460
and incredibly humble, incredibly successful.

798
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:52,739
Seek is a $10 billion company by market cap, and the thing he wanted to speak about most

799
00:53:52,739 --> 00:53:57,059
that he felt was the best thing he'd ever done was replace himself as CEO in the past

800
00:53:57,059 --> 00:53:57,719
18 months.

801
00:53:57,719 --> 00:53:57,800
18 months.

802
00:53:58,039 --> 00:53:58,280
18 months.

803
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:58,300
18 months.

804
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:58,320
18 months.

805
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:58,420
18 months.

806
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:58,460
18 months.

807
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:58,480
18 months.

808
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:58,500
18 months.

809
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:58,519
18 months.

810
00:53:58,519 --> 00:53:58,539
18 months.

811
00:53:58,539 --> 00:53:58,619
18 months.

812
00:53:58,619 --> 00:53:58,659
18 months.

813
00:53:58,679 --> 00:53:58,920
18 months.

814
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:58,980
18 months.

815
00:53:58,980 --> 00:53:59,019
18 months.

816
00:53:59,019 --> 00:53:59,039
18 months.

817
00:53:59,039 --> 00:53:59,619
18 months.

818
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:00,340
18 months.

819
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:00,619
18 months.

820
00:54:00,619 --> 00:54:00,639
18 months.

821
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:00,679
18 months.

822
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:00,699
18 months.

823
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:00,760
18 months.

824
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:01,179
18 months.

825
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:03,280
It's Ian Narev, who's the former CEO of the Commonwealth Bank.

826
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,539
He can do things that I couldn't do.

827
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:09,440
He does it better than I could ever do, which for people who've had great success, it takes

828
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,820
great humility to understand that.

829
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:18,320
We love the idea of collaboration in current leadership in the sense that that is where

830
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,420
a lot of sweet spots lie.

831
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:22,980
If you could collaborate with anyone on anything, I'm assuming fair share is where we're going

832
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:23,780
to go with this.

833
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,420
Has there been a partner?

834
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:28,619
I mean, you casually connect.

835
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:31,599
with incredible leaders all around the country?

836
00:54:31,719 --> 00:54:33,619
Has there been one collaboration that you thought of

837
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:36,139
I could get that going that would make a difference?

838
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:40,360
Yeah, look, the pandemic's been a real opportunity

839
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:46,360
for us to rethink how we, I'm going to say staff the kitchen.

840
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:52,239
So before the pandemic, we had 1,500 regular volunteers.

841
00:54:52,659 --> 00:54:54,300
We had the same number on the waiting list.

842
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:55,360
It was easy.

843
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:59,679
One person retired and a friend of theirs had heard about it

844
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:03,000
and they stepped in and it was just, you know, it was easy.

845
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,699
Volunteering's not returning to charities in the numbers

846
00:55:07,699 --> 00:55:09,900
that they were pre-pandemic,

847
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,539
which is harder for the charitable sector.

848
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,500
And that's an opportunity for us because it means

849
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:19,440
that we can look at how we can diversify our volunteering.

850
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,139
So, and Paul's really leading this and I so agree with it.

851
00:55:23,139 --> 00:55:24,880
So can we have more?

852
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:30,219
Ethnic diversity in the kitchen, volunteering on our kitchen gardens,

853
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,679
driving our vans.

854
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:35,739
Can we have younger people?

855
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:39,139
So people maybe not staying with us for 15 years as volunteers,

856
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,320
maybe for three years while they're at university.

857
00:55:42,199 --> 00:55:45,480
Can we have people who are recipients of our meals

858
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,219
coming in and helping as well?

859
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:50,420
And long answer to your question,

860
00:55:51,739 --> 00:55:55,340
but I think that last bit is where I'm interested in going.

861
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:59,340
And my mother was an academic up at Melbourne University

862
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,920
and did a lot of work with, in Arnhem Land.

863
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,360
And a few years ago, she said,

864
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:09,699
we've got a group of Indigenous kids coming down to Melbourne for a week

865
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:13,539
and could they come down and spend half a day in the Fair Share kitchen?

866
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:18,579
And I pushed her on and said, well, look,

867
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,920
the staff and volunteers would love that, but why?

868
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,360
And they want to go to the MCG.

869
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,659
And they were going there.

870
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:31,559
She said, because they've got tough lives.

871
00:56:32,539 --> 00:56:34,199
There's no hiding that.

872
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,500
But there are others in Australia that are doing it tough as well.

873
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:37,579
And I want them to see that.

874
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:41,599
And I want them to be part of something that's helping others who are doing it tough.

875
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:46,000
I think there'd be a really, it'd be a really interesting experience for them.

876
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,079
Anyway, we did it.

877
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:47,880
The staff loved it.

878
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,239
The volunteers thought it was great.

879
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:50,260
The kids left.

880
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:54,739
And I was speaking to mum a few days later and I said, how did that go?

881
00:56:54,739 --> 00:56:55,340
And she said,

882
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:00,320
I said, bar none, the best experience they had in Melbourne was volunteering at Fair Share.

883
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:01,219
Wow.

884
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,300
I said, I don't believe that.

885
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,539
It would have been going to the MCG.

886
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:07,980
But she said, no, it was exactly what I wanted.

887
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,960
And so I've reflected on that.

888
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:18,719
And to be able to take some people who, yeah, are doing it tough

889
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,739
and who have received or are receiving our meals and getting them in,

890
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:25,119
I think would be very empowering.

891
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:30,059
Because if you think about it, it's pretty challenging having to ask for

892
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:33,659
and receiving a meal when you're doing it tough.

893
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:36,500
There's a real, there's a power imbalance.

894
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:40,519
There's a dignity thing there, a dignity challenge for us as a giver.

895
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:47,940
And if you can then give people the opportunity to then be part of helping others,

896
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,199
it's not a paying back thing.

897
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,980
It's just, I think that's a very empowering thing.

898
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:55,280
And a beautiful moment for me one day in a fair,

899
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,579
share was a school group walking into the kitchen.

900
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,920
They'd been inducted, they'd washed their hands,

901
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,119
they're putting on their aprons and a young secondary school girl

902
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,860
just pulled me aside and said, thanks for doing what you do

903
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,079
and for the opportunity to come in today.

904
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:12,760
Our family received some Fair Share meals when we were doing it tough a few years ago.

905
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,599
So it's really special for me now coming in and being able to help somebody else.

906
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,800
Gus Wallen is a much loved Australian television and radio personality

907
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,780
alongside his great friend Hugh Jackman.

908
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,340
Gus created the Aussie Go series.

909
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:30,400
For more than a decade, Gus hosted the grill team on Triple M Breakfast Radio in Sydney

910
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,659
with rugby league legends Matty Johns and Mark Guyer.

911
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,260
Following the death of a great friend and mentor to suicide,

912
00:58:37,539 --> 00:58:40,179
Gus has become a passionate advocate for men's mental health.

913
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,679
In 2017, Gus founded the Got You For Life Foundation

914
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:46,480
to support better mental health outcomes for men,

915
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:49,460
running programs in communities right across Australia.

916
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:54,460
Gus's leadership in breaking down old stereotypes of what it is to be a real man

917
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:54,980
has created a new generation of men.

918
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:55,300
He's a great man.

919
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:55,340
He's a great man.

920
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:55,360
He's a great man.

921
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:55,400
He's a great man.

922
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:55,440
He's a great man.

923
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:55,519
He's a great man.

924
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:55,599
He's a great man.

925
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:55,659
He's a great man.

926
00:58:55,659 --> 00:58:55,739
He's a great man.

927
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:59,059
positive change and led to men connecting better

928
00:58:59,059 --> 00:59:01,199
and breaking the silence around suicide.

929
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,619
Gus, I genuinely love catching up with you, mate.

930
00:59:03,699 --> 00:59:08,480
I always feel inspired and I suppose wanting to be better, mate,

931
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:09,539
every time I'm around you.

932
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:10,519
Thanks for joining me today, mate.

933
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:11,139
It's a pleasure, mate.

934
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:14,579
I've loved your series and I really do feel honoured that you have me on.

935
00:59:14,699 --> 00:59:17,519
You've had so many wonderful leaders chatting to you.

936
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,699
So, yeah, I feel blessed.

937
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:20,139
Thank you.

938
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,960
Question we've been asking everyone, Gus, that's come on.

939
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,300
Who has been the greatest leader in your life?

940
00:59:26,019 --> 00:59:26,699
Oh, wow.

941
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,380
Well, it'll be an easy one to say Jacko

942
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,900
because he has in the last five years

943
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,920
given me so much good advice

944
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,880
that has kept me on my path

945
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,159
because I have had so many emotional moments

946
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:45,059
where I felt, you know what, I can't do this anymore.

947
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:47,719
But I'd have to say my mum

948
00:59:47,719 --> 00:59:52,139
and she learned it so much from my granddad on her side,

949
00:59:52,139 --> 00:59:52,639
her dad.

950
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:56,739
And that authenticness,

951
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:00,639
that level of care comes from my mum.

952
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,420
I spoke about it with Ian Roberts

953
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:07,280
who people don't know was a big tough rugby league player

954
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,300
and he's the first and only rugby league player

955
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,159
to come out as gay.

956
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:14,920
And I had him on my podcast a few weeks ago

957
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,000
and it's the first time I've spoken about it openly

958
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,019
that my father's gay.

959
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:21,159
And I normally speak about it with people

960
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,179
and then I edit it out.

961
01:00:22,179 --> 01:00:23,659
But I rang my dad and I said,

962
01:00:23,699 --> 01:00:24,679
I just spoke to Ian Roberts

963
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:27,099
and I actually spoke about the fact that you're gay

964
01:00:27,099 --> 01:00:29,099
and that your partner Ian

965
01:00:29,099 --> 01:00:31,019
and you have been together for 40 years

966
01:00:31,019 --> 01:00:32,960
and I found out as an 18 year old

967
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,679
and I really struggled with it until I spoke to you

968
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:37,059
and asked you some difficult questions

969
01:00:37,059 --> 01:00:38,880
and got some difficult answers.

970
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:42,039
Well, from my point of view, Dars,

971
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:46,679
having those type of conversations

972
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:48,420
where you are completely vulnerable

973
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,420
is where I grow the most,

974
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,000
where I feel the most awkwardness,

975
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:53,800
when I feel the most,

976
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:54,639
when I feel the most out of control

977
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:57,260
is when I grow out of my comfort zone

978
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,000
and my grandfather and mother,

979
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,380
because they were so close,

980
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,159
they taught me that.

981
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,380
Wear your heart on your sleeve,

982
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,280
your friends will come

983
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,840
and if people bag you or whatever,

984
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,159
well, it saves you the drama of getting to know them

985
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:09,159
than giving them the flick.

986
01:01:09,619 --> 01:01:10,179
You know what I mean?

987
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:11,940
That's always been their process

988
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,800
and it has hurt me a lot.

989
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,059
Telling girlfriends I love them

990
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:16,159
after two and a half hours

991
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,920
after when we've been sitting in a movie

992
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,440
and we haven't even actually properly chatted,

993
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:22,139
but I just feel so in love and connected.

994
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,139
You know, like, believe me,

995
01:01:23,139 --> 01:01:23,659
it hasn't been,

996
01:01:23,659 --> 01:01:25,300
it hasn't been all fantastic,

997
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:28,860
but, gee, I've got a great bunch of mates

998
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,360
who totally know who I am

999
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,880
and there's no BS amongst us

1000
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,420
and I think they would tell you

1001
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,420
that our friendship group is better because of that

1002
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:38,619
and that all comes from my granddad and my mum.

1003
01:01:38,739 --> 01:01:39,980
Great, great leadership

1004
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:42,880
and encourage you to go and listen to Gus.

1005
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I mean, they're brilliant conversations,

1006
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:46,059
starting with Hugh Jackman and Carl Stefanovic

1007
01:01:46,059 --> 01:01:48,039
and Lisa Wilkinson and Ian Roberts as well

1008
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:51,039
will be something that you'll learn

1009
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:53,039
an enormous amount from Gus

1010
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:53,639
in the spring.

1011
01:01:53,659 --> 01:01:54,699
Spirit of collaboration, Gus.

1012
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,079
We are passionate about the idea

1013
01:01:57,079 --> 01:01:59,460
of leaders collaborating extensively.

1014
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,380
If there was one person in any part of your life, Gus,

1015
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,639
that you could collaborate with,

1016
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:05,219
is there any name that springs to mind?

1017
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:05,880
Oh, wow.

1018
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:06,920
You know what?

1019
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:08,239
You know who was that person?

1020
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:09,340
I don't know if I've had a chance to do it,

1021
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:10,400
Darce, was Mark Burris

1022
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,079
because I am all about passion

1023
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:14,460
but not so flash on the finance.

1024
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:17,159
So I just grabbed him one day and spoke to him

1025
01:02:17,159 --> 01:02:17,579
and he goes,

1026
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,760
this is what you do,

1027
01:02:19,019 --> 01:02:19,840
this is what you do,

1028
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,659
this is what you do

1029
01:02:20,659 --> 01:02:21,940
and all of a sudden it was all great.

1030
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:23,219
For those who don't know Mark Burris,

1031
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:23,519
wizard,

1032
01:02:23,659 --> 01:02:24,659
Home Loans was the business

1033
01:02:24,659 --> 01:02:26,320
that along with the Packer family

1034
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,480
to great success

1035
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,420
and Yellow Brick Road.

1036
01:02:28,739 --> 01:02:29,340
Now, yeah.

1037
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,860
An amazing individual success story.

1038
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:34,599
Yeah, and he's got a podcast called The Mentor

1039
01:02:34,599 --> 01:02:36,940
and he mentors businesses and so forth.

1040
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:37,500
So that was great

1041
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,239
but there's actually a bloke called Earl Evans

1042
01:02:39,239 --> 01:02:41,659
from Shore and Partners Financial Services

1043
01:02:41,659 --> 01:02:43,039
who support my body

1044
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:45,920
and he gives $10,000 away to any guest

1045
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,139
that comes on our podcast

1046
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:49,460
as long as you give it to the charity of your choice

1047
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:52,460
and you can show what that 10 grand will mean.

1048
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:53,260
It's a brilliant idea.

1049
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:53,639
I think it's the,

1050
01:02:53,659 --> 01:02:54,760
it's the only podcast in the world.

1051
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:55,539
I've searched this.

1052
01:02:55,619 --> 01:02:56,360
I don't know if I'm right

1053
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,079
but I think we're the only one in the world.

1054
01:02:58,159 --> 01:02:59,840
So far we're giving $300,000 away.

1055
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:01,980
It's an amazing contribution that guest.

1056
01:03:02,059 --> 01:03:02,380
And he,

1057
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:05,639
I literally was having coffee in Collaroy

1058
01:03:05,639 --> 01:03:07,059
which is on the northern beach of Sydney

1059
01:03:07,059 --> 01:03:08,579
and he tapped me on the shoulder

1060
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:09,280
and he goes,

1061
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:10,460
can you give me a call?

1062
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:11,659
I'm Earl from Shore and Partners.

1063
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,840
I think I can help you

1064
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:13,659
and I turned around and went,

1065
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:14,579
yeah, of course

1066
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:15,579
but he kept walking right,

1067
01:03:15,639 --> 01:03:16,820
there was no proper conversation.

1068
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:17,820
So then I'm going,

1069
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:18,119
is it,

1070
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:19,239
was it Earl?

1071
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,659
Like I'm trying to write it all down

1072
01:03:20,659 --> 01:03:22,360
because when you run a non-for-profit,

1073
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,480
if someone says they're going to help you,

1074
01:03:23,659 --> 01:03:26,280
you call them as soon as you possibly can.

1075
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,139
You're going to regret this Earl.

1076
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,039
I'll be calling you in 10 minutes time.

1077
01:03:29,179 --> 01:03:29,500
Correct.

1078
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:31,500
And he's become a really good friend

1079
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,199
and confidant

1080
01:03:32,199 --> 01:03:34,739
and he also has a really good attitude to life

1081
01:03:34,739 --> 01:03:35,780
as you're only here once.

1082
01:03:36,099 --> 01:03:37,099
You can't take it with you.

1083
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:38,940
So have a goddamn crack

1084
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,260
and make sure you're proud of yourself

1085
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,099
at the end of the day.

1086
01:03:41,239 --> 01:03:44,559
And so he's been a great person for me

1087
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:47,059
just when I needed someone

1088
01:03:47,059 --> 01:03:49,380
to let me know that it's okay

1089
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:51,400
to not have all the answers.

1090
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,480
Like I've got to take some of my own advice sometimes.

1091
01:03:53,659 --> 01:03:54,559
Like I get sad

1092
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:59,059
if I feel like I'm not doing as well

1093
01:03:59,059 --> 01:03:59,920
as I feel I can,

1094
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:01,059
but it's just life, right?

1095
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:02,480
I have good days and bad days

1096
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,400
and I was down at Point Lonsdale

1097
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,619
this Saturday night

1098
01:04:05,619 --> 01:04:06,039
and I was just,

1099
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:07,059
I'd had a couple of beers.

1100
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:07,980
I wasn't drunk,

1101
01:04:08,059 --> 01:04:08,880
but I certainly was,

1102
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:10,619
I couldn't drive that way,

1103
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:11,400
but I wasn't drunk.

1104
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,579
My goddaughter's 21st

1105
01:04:13,579 --> 01:04:15,019
and I'm on the dance floor

1106
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:17,380
and I am the happiest

1107
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,840
that I've been

1108
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,940
that I can remember.

1109
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:22,719
And I have no idea why,

1110
01:04:23,079 --> 01:04:23,559
but I was just,

1111
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:24,760
in this feeling of like,

1112
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:27,099
I'm just in a good place at the moment,

1113
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:27,500
you know?

1114
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,719
And I just was smiling

1115
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:32,480
and the photograph that was taken of me

1116
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,659
that I saw the next day

1117
01:04:33,659 --> 01:04:36,940
is just this unbridled peace

1118
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:38,340
and you would feel that

1119
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,920
with your meditation

1120
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:40,900
and the fact that you do

1121
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,159
all the work you do with your resort.

1122
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,519
It's just finding a bit of peace

1123
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:46,539
knowing that you're on the right path

1124
01:04:46,539 --> 01:04:48,300
and it's not always going to be awesome,

1125
01:04:48,539 --> 01:04:49,699
but you're getting there.

1126
01:04:50,059 --> 01:04:51,900
That's probably where I'm at at the moment.

1127
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:54,880
What a big,

1128
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,539
hearted legend Gus Wallen is

1129
01:04:56,539 --> 01:04:58,019
having a huge impact

1130
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,539
on everyone around him

1131
01:04:59,539 --> 01:05:01,340
and creating a great legacy

1132
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:02,380
in everything that he does.

1133
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,099
Loved all of those conversations in 2022

1134
01:05:05,099 --> 01:05:06,340
and I'm looking forward to

1135
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:08,579
a really big year in 2023

1136
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:11,079
with some insight and learnings

1137
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:12,840
from great people all around the world.

1138
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:15,079
Well, that finishes up episode six

1139
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:16,179
in the Masterclass series.

1140
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:16,820
We explored

1141
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:18,900
who would be the greatest leader in your life

1142
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,820
and who would you most want to collaborate?

1143
01:05:21,059 --> 01:05:22,639
Thank you very much for listening.

1144
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,900

01:05:32,369 --> 01:05:32,849
Listener.
