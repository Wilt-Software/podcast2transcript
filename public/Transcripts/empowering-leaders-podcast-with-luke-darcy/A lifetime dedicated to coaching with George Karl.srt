00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:08,660
I really hope you enjoy this conversation on the Empowering Leaders podcast with NBA

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:15,339
Hall of Fame coach George Carl, as much as I did recording it. He shares his lifetime of wisdom

3
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:20,699
in what I found to be an incredibly open and honest way. He talked about how coaching is

4
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,320
the easy part, but the hardest thing is the connecting of your players and managing of

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,800
egos. He was completely open and vulnerable about wishing he'd been a better leader,

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,520
that he'd been more empathetic, particularly understanding the challenges that face the many

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,759
black athletes in his care. He also talked openly about being worried for the first time in his life

8
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:46,399
about the state and the divide that's happening in America, that he felt Donald Trump had brainwashed

9
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,359
half of the US into believing that dishonesty is okay. It's an incredibly open and honest chat

10
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:56,219
with one of the great coaches in American sporting life, and I'm sure you're going to enjoy

11
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,380
and learn from coach Carl as much as I did in recording it.

12
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:03,979
So incredibly grateful that George Carl is part of our Elita Connect program.

13
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:10,459
Love you to have a look at it, www.elitacollective.com. Coach Carl connects on a monthly

14
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:16,019
basis with Mikel Arteta from Arsenal, Matt Lefevre from the Green Bay Packers, Eddie Jones from

15
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:21,019
Australian Rugby, Mike Dunlap, and we are really passionate about what it looks like to bring great

16
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:25,219
people from around the globe together. You don't have to be an NBA Hall of Fame coach to be part

17
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:29,319
of Elita Connect. We would love to collaborate with you, so book a discovery call, head to

18
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:29,780
elitacollective.com.

19
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:35,980
Find out about why great leaders like that are taking the time to learn, to share, and to

20
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:41,299
collaborate together. Huge thanks, as always, to Jason Nicholas's team at Temper Australia,

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,099
New Zealand. A mattress like no other. We know great leaders like George Carl understand the

22
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:50,500
value of getting a great night's sleep, and sleeping on the world's best mattress is an

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:02:06,129
investment you will not regret. George Carl was drafted as a fourth-round pick to the San Antonio

24
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:09,629
Spurs in 1973 from the University of North Carolina.

25
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:14,629
10 years later, at just 33 years of age, George Carl was appointed as the head coach

26
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:18,789
of the Cleveland Cavaliers, making him one of the youngest head coaches in NBA history.

27
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:24,030
In 2016, when Coach Carl had finished his last role as a head coach in the NBA,

28
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:33,610
he had been in charge for a remarkable 1,999 games, winning 1,175 times, the sixth all-time.

29
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:38,810
He has coached the U.S. national team, is a four-time NBA All-Star head coach, was a 2013

30
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:46,849
NBA coach of the year, and in 2022 was inducted into the NBA Hall of Fame for his outstanding

31
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:52,449
lifetime success and contribution. Coach Carl, you've dedicated your life to the game of basketball

32
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:56,930
at the highest level. Sitting here now, talking to you at 72 years of age, you must be incredibly

33
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:02,169
proud of what you've achieved. You know, I'm in a stage in my life that I'm happy and peaceful with

34
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:08,650
what I've done. There are times I wish I've done it differently and better, but I love the game of

35
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:08,789
basketball. I love the game of basketball. I love the game of basketball. I love the game of basketball.

36
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:16,430
Very much. I have no idea why that I fell in love. I was, as a little kid, I grew up being a

37
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:22,949
baseball player and loving baseball and always dreamt about being a baseball player. And then

38
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:30,650
my dad came to me and said he wanted me to go to college. And at that time, baseball scholarships

39
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:38,789
were not that many in America. So I pivoted over to basketball.

40
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:46,889
And somehow, some way, I, you know, I was good enough to get a scholarship to North Carolina. And

41
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:52,490
that's where I fell in love with the game, is being tutored and mentored and coached by Coach

42
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:59,789
Smith, Coach Steve Smith at University of North Carolina. He was a tremendous friend, a tremendous

43
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:05,490
teacher of the game, but also a teacher of life. And I've been blessed. I've been blessed to be

44
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,550
living in it. My life has been in a gym.

45
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:16,290
I still get excited to go into a gym where there's going to be a game or a practice or

46
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:21,769
talk to coaches. It's a blessing to have a life where you can live your passion.

47
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:26,490
And Coach Carl, I didn't realize there was a baseball passion in your background. And

48
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,230
there's a similarity to the great Michael Jordan. I want to ask you about Michael Jordan in a few

49
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:36,069
moments time, who grew up with a love of baseball. And his dad wanted him to be a baseball player.

50
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:38,790
And we know that he took that time off in between that.

51
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,910
It's a tragedy of losing his father and went and played professional baseball. But I heard you say

52
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,230
at the start, you do some things differently. Is there something that jumps out when you reflect

53
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,930
on an incredible lifetime in basketball? What would you change?

54
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:58,850
You know, something that's come to my attention is I wish I had more insight on how to connect

55
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:07,930
and lead people with the game of basketball. Every, you know, in the NBA, the game gets

56
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,329
different.

57
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:16,610
So I started coaching in the 70s and got my head job in the 80s. And I coached all the way

58
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:23,470
in almost to the 20s, 2020. I think how you coached in the 80s is totally different than

59
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:30,709
how you coach today. And the generation of how the people change, how management change,

60
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:38,610
the money has changed. So the society of America has changed. And I wish I would have been,

61
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,970
I wish I would have been better at pivoting and learning and maybe being a better leader of

62
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:52,089
people. And the one thing that comes to mind is America right now is, I think, having a little

63
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:59,569
trouble with race. And I wish, and the vast majority of people I coached were black. And I

64
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:07,269
wish I was more aware of what they had to go through to get where they were. I wish I would

65
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:08,790
have been better communicator.

66
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:18,529
And maybe more empathetic towards the black man to help them in their path to maybe be coaches

67
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:26,230
and leaders and mentors of people. Because right now, you know, it's the first time in my lifetime

68
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:34,290
that I've actually worried a little bit about America. I've always liked being the leader of

69
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,790
freedom, the leader of democracy. I've always been,

70
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:44,629
I've always been proud of being an American. But the last 10 years in America has been

71
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:52,769
distressful in a lot of ways. And in that time, I've looked back at myself and said I could have

72
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:57,410
done things, I could have done some things better. Yeah, Coach Carl, it's an amazing reflection for

73
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,689
you to have that at your age and the sense of self-reflection to do that. I'm sitting here

74
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:07,670
talking to an NBA Hall of Fame coach with remarkable history of success. And I love that,

75
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,670
you know, curiosity.

76
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,209
I love that curiosity to what you could do better. And we have crossed over in a passion

77
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:19,050
we call Alita Connect, where you're connecting with some outstanding current coaches around

78
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,089
the globe. Mikel Arteta from Arsenal is doing an incredible job. Matt LeFleur from the Green Bay

79
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:29,129
Packers is in your Alita Connect group. Eddie Jones, who's a remarkable coach of Australian

80
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:34,269
rugby. Mike Dunlap's doing a fantastic job, but most recently in Milwaukee Bucks. Have you found,

81
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:38,350
I know they love tapping into your history and knowledge and passion. Have you found that

82
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,990
sitting there talking to the current coaches that, you know, even at 72, you're learning in

83
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,269
a different way about how they're approaching it now?

84
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:53,269
Well, I think the one thing I, I love the group, by the way. The group is the wisdom coming from

85
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:59,670
different sports like, like soccer and rugby and football. But there's really a connection

86
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:08,009
amongst all of us on how to try to inspire and get the best out of your players and how you build

87
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:15,870
a team and connection. But, you know, for me, I think what you, I think every year in coaching

88
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:22,490
basketball is different. What, what happened the year before, you can reflect on it, you can

89
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:31,810
celebrate it, but you cannot rely that it's going to be that way the next year. So being able to

90
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:37,830
adapt, being able to change, being able to be versatile in your thoughts.

91
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:45,169
You know, there comes in a lot of packages. Head coaches are strategy wise and coaching the game

92
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:53,110
is in a lot of ways, the easiest part of the game. The hardest part of the game is connecting

93
00:08:53,110 --> 00:09:06,750
and being the leader of a group of men or women and put them on a compassionate ride and journey,

94
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,889
a marathon,

95
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:17,769
of basketball to win a trophy. And it's, it's a joy to be a part of that. It's, it's, it's a privilege

96
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:26,350
to be a leader of that, but it also comes with a lot of scars and psychological losses. And win

97
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:34,210
loses. I don't miss the win lose of the game of basketball. I miss the game of basketball a lot,

98
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,149
but I don't miss those nights where

99
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:43,330
you're just trying to figure out what the hell's going on and what, what you got to do the next day.

100
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,909
And that is the, the beautiful art, as you said, the technical stuff you can do probably with your

101
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:52,149
eyes closed and you know how you want the game to be played, but it's that melting pot of

102
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:56,909
personalities, isn't it? As you said, uh, you know, coaching, um, you know, black American

103
00:09:56,909 --> 00:10:02,009
athletes have come from a completely different world than you and, and in sport around the globe,

104
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:07,149
isn't it? We just see here in Australia, we've got such diversity, multicultural world here.

105
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:12,470
Our beautiful indigenous athletes come from very different backgrounds to, uh, different parts of

106
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:17,429
the country. And so do you think, you know, would have been helpful, you know, having that sort of

107
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:21,029
sense of collaboration for you, you're, you're listening in and you're, you're chatting to

108
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:26,389
coaches who do find a way to do that connection in different ways, as you said, to really try and

109
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:31,110
get that empathy around your athletes. Is that been something that, uh, that Elite Connect has,

110
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,409
has brought to the table for you? I think connection and communication,

111
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:41,330
I've always felt communication is imperative to be, to be successful, but there's more than

112
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:49,230
that. Um, I mean, a dictator can communicate how to, how to be addicted. And there are times in a

113
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:55,950
season that you have to be a dictator, but there are also times in a season that you got to have

114
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:03,269
understanding to your decisions. And there's also times in the season that you must celebrate

115
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:10,710
where, where you're at and how you're doing it. Uh, and every day I would say for the last 15

116
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,110
years of my coaching career,

117
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:19,350
you know, every day, our, our, our, our morning coaching session was always based upon a meeting

118
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:26,230
of what we call ego management and attitude adjustment to get everybody in a positive

119
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:32,769
energy space. Because with winning and losing, sometimes there can be too much

120
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:42,049
positivity, which leads to arrogance. And in losing, you got to learn how to lift them up

121
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:49,870
and reward them and, and convince them that they are on the right path. And in the process of

122
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:55,110
winning a championship, you must be knocked down as much as you got to get up.

123
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:59,750
And coach Kyle, you had an incredible, consistently successful period. I look at your record,

124
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:05,490
you go to Cleveland, uh, in your first NBA job and immediately, uh, you take them to their first

125
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,509
playoff in six seasons, your second stint at the Golden State Warriors. They come from a losing

126
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:12,450
year to reaching, uh, the semifinal.

127
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:17,029
The first time that had happened in a, in a significant period, incredible success in Seattle

128
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:20,929
with the Supersonics, your record at Denver. I mean, what, what were the patterns that

129
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:25,909
enabled you to immediately have an impact and, and then have that consistent success

130
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:29,950
over such a long period of time? I'll be honest with you. I wish I would have gotten a team that

131
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:35,350
had a winning record one time. You know, most of the time I picked, I got a team that had a losing

132
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,909
record and they had to become winners. And then after you become winners, you got to become

133
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:47,590
champions and in the world of coaching we don't have a lot of patience with coaches i think the

134
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:54,409
one thing i love to do is tinker with the team and i've never felt that i've had one philosophy

135
00:12:54,409 --> 00:13:01,149
on how to play the game of basketball i think you got to build your philosophy around

136
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:08,710
the the talent that you have on your team and so so when you come in with a team like

137
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:15,610
in seattle when i came to seattle it was a defensive minded team we were dominantly a

138
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:22,690
defensive team and then eight years later i went to milwaukee and i tried the same defensive teams

139
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:29,049
but they weren't good enough to do to what seattle did but they were a hell of an offensive team

140
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:35,490
and so i became an offensive coach and then in denver i was more of a balanced coach

141
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,590
and so i i think the one thing i did well is i

142
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:48,210
realized i know the talent of the players i had how to fit them together and mold them together

143
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:55,330
and motivate and inspire them in a way that they played as a team i mean north carolina basketball

144
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:02,570
is all about we and not a lot about me and i'm a wee guy i believe in wee basketball

145
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,409
and the one thing i love about basketball is i think it's the best team sport

146
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:08,590
to you

147
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:15,590
can feel the energy of when a team is connected as we're in soccer i'm sure it's a team sport

148
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:23,129
but i don't feel that energy or in football i don't feel that energy or in baseball i don't

149
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:29,870
feel that energy that might be because there's too many guys on the field but with basketball

150
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:37,850
with five guys out there and you know that team is connected you can feel that power you can feel

151
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:38,669
that confidence

152
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:44,269
you can feel that they trust each other and when you don't have those things

153
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:50,830
it's very difficult to beat teams that have those things the magic of sport and why we love it so

154
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,730
much isn't it that intangible as you said that chemistry and that connection and when it's there

155
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,269
you can see it and you're probably right isn't a sport that's got five players

156
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:03,230
on a court lends itself to the to being able to pick that up perhaps quicker than you know with

157
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:08,649
a dozen players i want to go back coach carl you said something before that i wanted to pick up on

158
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:13,649
you said for the first time in your life you're worried about america you're you're proud patriotic

159
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:21,070
american but it feels like a time where leadership is in a challenging space how would you articulate

160
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:26,629
that why are you concerned about where america's at now well i'm i'm just gonna tell the truth i

161
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:35,529
think donald trump his brainwashed a part of our society into believing that lying and

162
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:38,190
and not telling the truth is okay

163
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:46,149
uh it scares me that we have so many people now that are not honest about life

164
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:51,649
many many america has been very fortunate because they've always kind of had hope

165
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:59,870
they've had dreams uh and they've had goals and americans have been very driven by that hope

166
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:05,830
and the ability that you come people come to america because they have a dream that they

167
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,870
can be wealthy or they can make money

168
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:13,470
they can have more success than where they're at well america right now i think is divided

169
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:21,389
i don't understand why it's divided but i think it's stagnated our brilliance

170
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:29,490
our country has been very very much a leader of a lot of great stuff freedom education

171
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:37,590
international connection but now we're a little more divided and i don't i don't see the rest of

172
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,690
the world seeing us as a part of the world and i don't see the rest of the world as a part of the

173
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:46,590
strong and as a leader as much as we have been in the past generations you know i really believe

174
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:53,110
we've had times like this before i don't think this is the first time it's the first time i felt

175
00:16:53,110 --> 00:17:02,929
it and i worry about it i worry about it mine i have an interracial family my my my daughter is

176
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:08,490
married to a black man i have two black grandchildren and i have four grandchildren

177
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:16,109
and i want them to feel the specialness of living in america like i did and coach carl it's always been

178
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:20,690
a trait of yours and you read through that you're not afraid you pause for a moment you said i'll

179
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:25,509
just tell the truth this is my feelings and i'm not afraid to do that and and it's you know look

180
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:32,029
at your memoir furious george 40 years of surviving nba's divas clueless gms and poor shot selection

181
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:38,230
you're not afraid are you to to express what you think and and we know how uh you know challenging

182
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:44,710
at times is that always been you is that just been how how you've been able to act yeah i got

183
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:53,029
fired twice by owners that told me i tell the truth too much and i go wow you know i got fired

184
00:17:53,029 --> 00:18:01,150
at gold state and the owner said to me i remember reminds him of vince vince lombardi a great nfl

185
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:08,609
coach and i said if i remind you of vince lombardi why the hell you fire me he said vince lombardi

186
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:15,710
couldn't coach in the nba and so you know the honesty of it i i have no problem with being

187
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:24,549
honest i like relationships i like connection that that are more honest than spinning and hype and

188
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:31,069
um perception our world is now being controlled by the public relations

189
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:37,970
as much as it being controlled by communication and connection i said i was going to talk to you

190
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:45,609
about michael jordan in 1995 96 your team the the supersonics uh take to the nba finals and you

191
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:51,009
run into michael jordan's chicago bulls a lot of listeners to the empowering leaders podcast would

192
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:55,609
have seen the last dance documentary on netflix which was commissioned by michael jordan and

193
00:18:55,609 --> 00:19:00,950
there's a there's a famous scene in that where he references that he felt like you snubbed him in a

194
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:06,509
restaurant during that nba final series can i get your thoughts what's your recollection of that and

195
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:08,690
then taking on the chicago bulls and michael jordan's Chicago Bulls

196
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:14,349
and michael jordan in that in that playoff series well you know the one time i got to the finals it

197
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:19,869
was against michael i had brought on to my staff for the playoffs a guy by the name of brendan malone

198
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:28,670
coach mike malone's father he was a coach that coached against michael in the nba playoffs before

199
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:35,869
and he always told he told us as a staff that michael likes to make up stories to motivate

200
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:37,789
himself

201
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:45,509
to get that by by by interacting and so i told my team before that series

202
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:51,390
because we had sam perkins we had a couple other guys who were very good friends with michael

203
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,789
and i said i don't want y'all to communicate with him so i ran into him in a restaurant

204
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:03,210
it was a he was about 100 feet away from me he said he walked by me i did not see that

205
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,309
and i did not go over there and say hello

206
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:10,390
because I had just told my team,

207
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,589
I don't want you to communicate with Michael Jordan.

208
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,430
And Michael, of course, said that I stopped him.

209
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:22,309
But Michael didn't also say that we held him under 40% field goal percentage.

210
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:26,390
We did a pretty damn good job on him that year,

211
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,910
even though he won the MVP.

212
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:35,089
I thought Sean Kemp was actually the best player on the court in that series.

213
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:38,490
But the team that wins gets the MVP.

214
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:39,710
I understand that.

215
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:40,609
I respect that.

216
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:46,509
But I've played golf with Michael 10 times since then,

217
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,170
and he's never brought it up to me.

218
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:55,910
So I just think it was a mechanism of him to get himself motivated,

219
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:00,990
to get himself energized for the playoffs.

220
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,910
You coach some extraordinary players, Hall of Fame players.

221
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,809
When you look at the great Michael Jordan,

222
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,650
was he that much better than even the great players?

223
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,170
And why is that so?

224
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:15,210
Michael Jordan is the greatest competitor I've ever played against.

225
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:17,230
He's amazing about it.

226
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:17,990
He has to win.

227
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,349
If he does not win, he feels he's a failure.

228
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,589
And then you put it with him,

229
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:30,549
maybe the perfect body type, in my mind, to play basketball.

230
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,309
He's big enough to cover big guys.

231
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,849
He's little enough to dominate on the perimeter.

232
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,369
And his basketball IQ is off the charts.

233
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:43,049
I actually think in today's game,

234
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:49,049
and I really think LeBron James is almost,

235
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:55,230
at times I think LeBron James is a better basketball player than Michael Jordan.

236
00:21:56,029 --> 00:22:00,210
I don't think he's a better winner than Michael Jordan.

237
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,809
And don't get me wrong, LeBron's a hell of a competitor.

238
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:03,890
But he's a better player than Michael Jordan.

239
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,349
But he's not in the class of Michael Jordan.

240
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:11,970
And because of that, I think he is the GOAT, as everybody calls him.

241
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,690
But in the same sense,

242
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,430
I think there might be someone better than Michael Jordan someday.

243
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,430
And I don't know who that's trying to be.

244
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:27,609
But, you know, the best player in the NBA today is Nikola Jokic,

245
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:29,529
the guy that plays here in Denver.

246
00:22:29,829 --> 00:22:30,490
He's amazing.

247
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:33,869
But he's amazing in a different way than Michael.

248
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:37,750
Because he's not a wow athlete.

249
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,069
He's not that guy to go, whoa, look at that.

250
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:47,069
He's probably as cerebral of a big guy

251
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:52,569
and a combination of a big man that can rebound and dominate around the basket

252
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:58,789
and also control the game with his passing at the offensive end of the court.

253
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,690
Now, we've had good big guys who were good passers before.

254
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,750
But never like Jokic.

255
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:09,890
And his leadership right now, everybody thinks Denver got lucky.

256
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:11,750
Denver didn't get lucky.

257
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:15,769
Denver might win two or three more.

258
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:19,109
And I'm sitting here talking to you in Denver today.

259
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,890
And I love the quote I read of yours around Nikola Jokic.

260
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,089
He said he's got a doctorate in basketball,

261
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,970
whilst everyone else out there is running around playing with a degree.

262
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,349
And it seems as though Jokic still polarizes people in America.

263
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:33,869
They don't.

264
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:37,930
They don't want to believe that he's as good as obviously you seem to.

265
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,589
I was amazed how when he got in the NBA Finals,

266
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,769
how so many people said, oh, I didn't know how good he was.

267
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,730
Oh, he's been that good now for about four or five years.

268
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:54,690
And he just hasn't had the luck to have a good team around him,

269
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:56,829
a good enough team around him to win.

270
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,190
But their team is very good.

271
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:03,710
Their management has finally put together,

272
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:04,869
a good roster.

273
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:08,490
They lost a couple of guys in the free agency,

274
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,549
but I think both guys are replaceable.

275
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:16,529
And the key to it all is Nikola Jokic will make it work.

276
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:20,009
Whatever you give him, he'll make it work.

277
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,450
And I love players that make other guys better.

278
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,109
And I've always thought Michael was that guy.

279
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,269
LeBron James was that guy.

280
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:31,710
Matthews Johnson was that guy.

281
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:33,849
Larry Bird was that guy.

282
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:40,970
And now I actually think Nikola Jokic is the best at doing that in the NBA.

283
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,089
Yeah, two-time MVP winner and now a championship winner

284
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,250
with the Denver Nuggets.

285
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:47,029
Hard to argue with that.

286
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,230
I've got to ask you, you said you played golf with Michael,

287
00:24:49,569 --> 00:24:52,730
you know, 10 or more times since that final series.

288
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:54,490
What's that experience like?

289
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,849
Yeah, North Carolina guys got together every August

290
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:00,690
down in Pinehurst, North Carolina.

291
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:03,170
It was called the Doug Moe Invitational.

292
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,750
And we did that for almost 30 years.

293
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,390
And we just ended it last year.

294
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,329
It was the last time we did it.

295
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:14,250
And Michael would come and play in that.

296
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:18,069
And that's where I always played golf with him at.

297
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:22,309
And Michael, in the North Carolina fraternity,

298
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,890
was very much a North Carolina tardiole.

299
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:28,630
He didn't think he was better than anybody.

300
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,829
He was proud of North Carolina basketball.

301
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,829
He loved the Smiths.

302
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:34,829
He loved the Smiths and Roy Williams.

303
00:25:35,829 --> 00:25:37,549
And in the end, he loved all of us.

304
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,630
And when he first started playing golf, he wasn't very good.

305
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,170
He was like me.

306
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:43,450
I'm not very good.

307
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:45,950
But when he first started playing, I could play with him.

308
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:50,109
About 10 years later, you don't want to play with him now.

309
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:53,549
I mean, he's made himself into a hell of a player.

310
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:57,269
I think his passion in life right now is playing golf.

311
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:00,170
And he's just as competitive.

312
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:03,490
And he's damn good on the golf course.

313
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,470
So it was fun to see that osmosis.

314
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:08,809
But I'm going to tell you, he's a hell of a competitor.

315
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:15,150
On the golf course, playing poker, playing ping pong, going on a bike ride.

316
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:18,150
Michael Jordan wants to win doing everything.

317
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:21,509
I'm told he's built his own course, Coach Carl.

318
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:26,430
And he's shaped the course in a way that is perfectly tailored to the way that he plays.

319
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:28,769
And he'll take on a professional golfer.

320
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:33,470
And they call it just almost impossible to win against him.

321
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,170
One, because he's so competitive.

322
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,410
But two, he's actually designed his own course to suit him.

323
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:43,690
As you said, that fanaticism to win is perhaps like we've never, ever seen before.

324
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:47,569
Coach Carl, you've had your own share of challenges along the way.

325
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:52,150
No journey without hurdles along the journey.

326
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:55,210
In 2005, you have surgery for prostate cancer.

327
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:57,549
You're the coach of the Denver Nuggets at that time.

328
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:00,150
You have to take some time off as a head coach.

329
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:03,549
And then you have neck and throat cancer appear in 2000.

330
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:08,509
And in 2010, how's it been dealing with that challenge and still, you know,

331
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,190
been able to coach at the highest level?

332
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:11,910
How have you found that chapter of your life?

333
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:13,849
Well, I'll be honest with you.

334
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,849
Cancer is a bitch to get.

335
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,329
And it's a sad moment in your life.

336
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:20,890
It's tough on your family.

337
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:22,170
It's tough on your kids.

338
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:23,250
It's tough on your friends.

339
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:30,470
But in the end, fortunately, I've gotten a couple cancers that are treatable and livable.

340
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:33,470
And it's taught me a lot.

341
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:41,650
And I think a lot of people that go through cancer learn, you know, that they're fortunate

342
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,009
and they learn from it.

343
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:49,869
And if they have one that they can survive, it usually makes them stronger, maybe tougher,

344
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,049
and in a lot of ways, better.

345
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:56,849
I'm a better person because of what I learned about my life.

346
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:00,329
What woke me up was cancer.

347
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:02,470
My balance in life.

348
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:03,690
My family.

349
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,910
Becoming more important.

350
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:09,230
Not being a workaholic to where I want to kill myself.

351
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:17,130
All those things I got more aware of after my cancers that I had,

352
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:20,329
especially the second one with the head and neck.

353
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:24,349
And now I have a raspy voice because of it.

354
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:26,329
But I can live with that.

355
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:33,349
I like talking, but I don't like to talk as much as maybe I did a long time ago.

356
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:39,750
And it also affected your son, Kobe, who's had some challenges with lymph node cancer.

357
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,910
He's following a similar path.

358
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:45,849
He was the successful coach in the G League, and I understand just been recently appointed

359
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,349
as the assistant coach of the Philadelphia 76ers.

360
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:54,869
We love that you've also introduced him into the Leader Connect world that we're passionate about.

361
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:59,150
He's collaborating with a group of other leaders around the globe.

362
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,750
You must be really proud of him.

363
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,269
You have two daughters as well.

364
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:03,329
But to follow in your own path.

365
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:04,990
That must be pretty special.

366
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,769
It's really, really special.

367
00:29:07,069 --> 00:29:15,869
I mean, watching him coach and seeing him evolve, I hope my reputation doesn't hold him back.

368
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,450
Because I think he's a hell of a coach.

369
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:25,269
I know he wants to coach in the NBA, and I think he's going to get a chance to be on

370
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:28,089
the 76ers staff, cross our fingers.

371
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:33,230
But I think, you know what, as a parent, as a father,

372
00:29:33,349 --> 00:29:36,529
you always worry about, are they listening?

373
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,049
Are they learning?

374
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,390
What are they thinking?

375
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:43,150
And there are a lot of years I thought Kobe was not listening.

376
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:45,049
But I'll be honest with you.

377
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:47,130
He's listening very, very well.

378
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:50,029
He's the student of the game.

379
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:54,730
But what I love about him, I think he's the student of life.

380
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:57,490
And he's a great father.

381
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,410
He's a better father than I was.

382
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:02,769
And in a lot of ways, I think he could be a better coach than I was.

383
00:30:03,349 --> 00:30:05,529
He's a great communicator.

384
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:10,029
He's learned from, you know, Rick McHarris was big in his life.

385
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:13,549
Phil Jackson is very important in his life.

386
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:16,670
Dale Harris is very important in his life.

387
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:25,650
He has had a lot of mentors that I, a lot of mentors that I had, but even more than I had.

388
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:33,049
And I just think people are not being aware of a guy that loves coaching.

389
00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:36,650
Phil Jackson is trying to be better at it every day.

390
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,029
And he's pretty good at it when he does it.

391
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,609
Yeah, brilliant to see that passing through the generations.

392
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:48,349
So one of our coaches, George, said to us, success leaves clues.

393
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:52,910
And we've seen these different dimensions of what great leadership looks like in different settings.

394
00:30:52,970 --> 00:31:00,109
And I'm always inspired talking to you today or someone from a completely different background and picking up those clues.

395
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:03,049
And we want to ask you a handful of questions.

396
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:06,049
We want to ask you a handful of questions around what we see as these patterns around great leadership.

397
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:15,170
And starting with this, Coach Carl, sense of self-leadership, we feel like it's very hard to lead someone else unless you understand your own sense of self-leadership.

398
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:18,329
What do you think about when I ask you about self-leadership?

399
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:24,690
Well, you've got to be tough-minded and caring at the same time.

400
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,029
You know, whatever you coach and whatever philosophies you have, they're fundamentals.

401
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:32,529
And how you make them teachable.

402
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:38,809
Acceptable and committed to is the beginning of coaching.

403
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,329
We're teachers.

404
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:42,150
We are mentors.

405
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,809
We are psychologists.

406
00:31:44,329 --> 00:31:46,549
But we are also friends.

407
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:57,210
I don't think the old school of dictator, angry man, angry woman, boot camp type of mentality is going to win anymore in coaching.

408
00:31:57,829 --> 00:31:59,730
Our players today are smarter.

409
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,430
They're wiser.

410
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:01,569
They're better.

411
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:02,829
And they're more.

412
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:07,630
They know more stuff than we know when we started coaching, when we started playing.

413
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:21,910
The window of learning how to motivate, how to inspire, how to connect, how to get out of the way, how to allow the process of a team to come together.

414
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,529
I think the best wisdom I had is what I said at the beginning of the show.

415
00:32:26,589 --> 00:32:28,970
I mean, I've always believed in communication.

416
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,349
But now it's more than communication.

417
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:34,210
It's connection.

418
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:45,529
It's not only connection with the one-on-one between coach and player, but the connection between what you are selling or what you are coaching to the team.

419
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,150
Do they accept your philosophies?

420
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,470
Do you accept your demands?

421
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:53,529
Do you accept your fundamental demands?

422
00:32:54,369 --> 00:32:58,990
And also, do they accept your punishment?

423
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,329
How you push them.

424
00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:02,930
How you push a button.

425
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:09,890
One of my favorite sayings is, a pat on the back and a kick in the ass is six inches apart.

426
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,910
And that is so true in the game of sport.

427
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:16,589
Some guys, they don't want to be kicked in the butt.

428
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,769
Other guys, that's all they want to be, is kicked in the butt.

429
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,109
Everybody likes a pat on the back.

430
00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:31,009
But when they go hard at them, when to be demanding, and knowing when to push those buttons.

431
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,930
Over a six-month period.

432
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:32,970
Over a six-month period.

433
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:33,029
Over a six-month period.

434
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:35,950
That season is probably as important as anything.

435
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:36,849
Yeah, I love that.

436
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,289
Tough-minded and caring in the same sentences.

437
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:46,970
And it is a close relationship, isn't it, to get that right with different personalities and to be able to pull those levers at the right time.

438
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:53,349
We see people are really conscious about positively impacting others in their environment on a daily basis.

439
00:33:53,349 --> 00:33:58,309
That they show up and have a sense that that is how they're going to go about their day.

440
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:02,490
How have you gone about having that positive impact, Coach Carl, on a daily basis?

441
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:07,769
The last 10 to 15 years of my life, I hired people on positive energy.

442
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,030
Positive energy.

443
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:12,690
I did not want negativity in my locker room.

444
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:16,909
I know as a head coach, I wear a black hat a lot of nights.

445
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,289
A lot of days, I'm wearing a black hat.

446
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:30,449
And the guys around me, I want them to be able to take my negativity, my correction, correcting them, and demanding correction.

447
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:32,329
And have guys around.

448
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:35,710
But that pick up players in a positive way.

449
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,530
Off the court, I'm a very positive person.

450
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:45,250
I believe, going back to America, I really believe we're going to figure it out.

451
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,570
Because that's what I wake up every morning.

452
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,449
That's the way I feel.

453
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:55,769
I wake up thinking, what good, what positive stuff, what energy can we bring to it?

454
00:34:56,289 --> 00:34:58,769
My dad said it in a very simple way.

455
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,869
When you don't like being around somebody.

456
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:03,630
Don't be around them.

457
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:10,929
Because if you feel negative energy, it's very difficult to find a positive place.

458
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:15,090
And so, I always like to have fun in basketball.

459
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:17,429
I like practice to be fun.

460
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,090
But there are days it's not going to be fun.

461
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:21,929
You got to do your job.

462
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:23,610
You got to be a pro.

463
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:31,449
But positivity, I think, if I would say anything to anybody, from what I learned,

464
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,469
is hang on.

465
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:33,469
Hang around positivity.

466
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,610
It's a lot better teacher than negativity.

467
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,369
Yeah, I love the way you express that.

468
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:42,809
It's, you know, as you said, in the last 15 years, that was an exclusive part of what

469
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:43,590
you wanted around you.

470
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,250
And you hired people specifically for that.

471
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:46,590
And it's true, isn't it?

472
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:52,469
That one negative force in a team or an environment or workplace, you spend so much time having

473
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,190
to deal with that, isn't it?

474
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:57,150
As opposed to that natural positive energy that you get.

475
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,690
It's incredibly powerful.

476
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:02,449
You've had to create and share a vision for success.

477
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:06,690
And a lot of different environments across your working life as a professional coach

478
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,750
for such a long period of time.

479
00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:13,389
How have you gone about creating a vision for success and sharing that amongst the team?

480
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:17,289
I think the one thing is our job is to get better every day.

481
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:23,489
I want my practice facility to be a place of growth in teaching.

482
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:32,030
And I think the thing players found out is when they came into our culture, they got

483
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:32,309
better.

484
00:36:32,449 --> 00:36:34,469
And they like that.

485
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,630
And getting better, everybody likes to feel like they're better.

486
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:46,730
You know, what we do a lot is the individual talking and learning about what triggers a

487
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,329
player into their best space of learning.

488
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:56,769
So our energy is very much in the individual development of our players, mentally, physically

489
00:36:56,769 --> 00:36:57,590
and emotionally.

490
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,570
And I think the first time a lot.

491
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:10,150
Of culture now in the NBA, in the NFL, somewhat in baseball, is caring about your players

492
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:14,429
off the court, what they are feeling, what they are doing.

493
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:19,010
And I don't think as a head coach, I have much say in that.

494
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:26,909
But I also monitor, I can monitor for them to give them to other people that might know

495
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:32,429
better than I on their mental health, their happiness, their state of health.

496
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:41,429
You know, we have a lot of addictions in our world that when a 19-year-old kid has $5

497
00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:45,690
million, he has the freedom to be who he wants to be.

498
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:52,769
But at 19, he probably still needs a lot of guidance, a lot of holding hand.

499
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:57,550
And a lot of our players in the NBA go the wrong way.

500
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,030
And those are the guys that I want.

501
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,429
I hope in the world of basketball.

502
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:09,230
And sport, in general, is going to understand that mental health is a bigger part of our

503
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,369
game than we think it is.

504
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:15,590
Coach Kyle, curiosity is a word we hear a lot from people when I sit down and talk to

505
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:15,789
them.

506
00:38:15,909 --> 00:38:21,170
And through their curiosity, they're constantly looking to get better and approach their learning

507
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,650
and development through curiosity.

508
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:25,869
Does that make sense to you as well?

509
00:38:26,329 --> 00:38:31,809
Well, I think my favorite question ever since I've been out, when I go hang out with coaches

510
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,429
within five years.

511
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:36,070
Five minutes, I ask the question, where is the game going?

512
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:41,929
You know, the game now is going from sport to entertainment.

513
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:45,489
How is that going to impact coaching?

514
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,530
Because I still think the coach is very, very important.

515
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:53,670
A lot of managements now don't value coaching.

516
00:38:54,389 --> 00:39:02,309
And I think those organizations are going to make mistakes down the line because I think

517
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:10,429
all organizations understand that in an NBA or an NFL season, the coach has the most influence

518
00:39:10,429 --> 00:39:13,889
than anybody else on that group of people.

519
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:18,750
If it's a group of 15 or a group of 50, it does not matter.

520
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,989
That coach speaks to those people every day.

521
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:31,309
My upbringing is the culture of getting better, playing hard, and playing as a team.

522
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,289
That's all.

523
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:33,150
That's all North Carolina.

524
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:41,110
But in today's game, with money and the social networks that we have, the mental health is

525
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:46,510
becoming more and more prevalent in players' daily lives.

526
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:51,409
Coach Carl, I've heard you reference communication a lot through this chat.

527
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:56,130
And we see leaders are really conscious of communicating with clarity.

528
00:39:56,329 --> 00:39:57,550
How have you gone about that?

529
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,829
Well, clarity is the most important word there.

530
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:02,130
I think.

531
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:05,309
There are a lot of coaches that know basketball better than I do.

532
00:40:05,909 --> 00:40:11,630
There are a lot of times in my coaching career, I was somewhat of a complicated coach.

533
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:18,130
But a lot of times in my career, my philosophy was simple and basic.

534
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:27,889
I think Coach Smith told me when I got into coaching that 90% of coaches overcoach.

535
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:30,769
And I was one of those guys when I was a younger coach.

536
00:40:31,489 --> 00:40:32,130
And as I got older, I was one of those guys.

537
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:37,750
And as I got older, I think I got more into letting the players tell me how to coach them

538
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:42,050
rather than me tell them how to be coached by me.

539
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:48,510
I think opening the game up to the creative minds of, you know, now in the NBA, we have

540
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,570
what they call positionless basketball.

541
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:56,769
Well, I played positionless basketball in 1992, you know, with Albany Patroons.

542
00:40:56,769 --> 00:41:02,110
So my history is allow the game to tell you.

543
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,369
Let the game tell you what to do.

544
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,690
Don't dictate what you want to do.

545
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,570
Let the game tell you what to do.

546
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,869
And that's where your curiosity has got to be interesting.

547
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:16,429
The big man is dying in the NBA.

548
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:19,730
But the best player in the NBA is the big man.

549
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:23,949
Now, how does that work?

550
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:27,349
I mean, because five years ago, I was done with the big man.

551
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:32,030
But now, if you give me a Jokic, I got to figure out the big man again.

552
00:41:32,969 --> 00:41:35,409
So the game always changes.

553
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:39,190
It always gives you like pick and roll 25 years ago.

554
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,710
Not many people ran pick and roll.

555
00:41:42,489 --> 00:41:44,730
It was too much of an individual game.

556
00:41:45,489 --> 00:41:47,610
But now everybody runs pick and roll.

557
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,949
So what's the game going to give us?

558
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:55,929
And that comes with coaches that have the courage to be curious, have a lot of curiosity,

559
00:41:56,409 --> 00:42:02,030
but also the courage to take a chance on doing something that some,

560
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:04,010
that no one else is doing right now.

561
00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:08,949
And I'm happy that I did that a little bit more than most.

562
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:15,170
And the number one pick this year is a 7'3 Frenchman who looks like he could revolutionize the game.

563
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:16,409
Would you take him?

564
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:18,269
Yep.

565
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:19,510
You got to take that guy.

566
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,730
Because, I mean, he's a monster.

567
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:25,670
But that doesn't mean he's going to win.

568
00:42:26,389 --> 00:42:27,829
He's going to be a damn good player.

569
00:42:28,409 --> 00:42:30,429
I promise you, he'll be a damn good player.

570
00:42:30,429 --> 00:42:36,469
But winning an NBA championship is a hell of a difficult journey.

571
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:39,369
And will he win an NBA title?

572
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,110
I would not bet against him.

573
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:43,809
But I'm going to tell you, it's going to take time.

574
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:44,969
It's going to take some time.

575
00:42:45,389 --> 00:42:47,110
It'll be a fascinating journey to watch that one.

576
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:51,610
How important has collaboration been for you, Coach Carl, along your coaching journey?

577
00:42:51,929 --> 00:42:59,010
The more I coach, the more I wanted to collaborate with my coaching staff and my players.

578
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:00,409
And now you go,

579
00:43:00,429 --> 00:43:01,210
Now you've got weight coaches.

580
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:03,349
Now you've got physiologists.

581
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,809
You've got analytics.

582
00:43:07,309 --> 00:43:09,250
I'm not anti-anything.

583
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:13,289
But the thing is, every day you only have a certain amount of time.

584
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:21,289
So I think the big thing about coaching in the NBA is prioritizing who to talk to,

585
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:26,210
who to collaborate with, and what to prioritize for that day.

586
00:43:26,949 --> 00:43:30,309
Because we all now have too much information.

587
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:33,150
And it's how you use that information.

588
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,010
It's not that you have it.

589
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:39,469
It's how you use it to get your team to be a better basketball team.

590
00:43:40,469 --> 00:43:43,269
And we love sharing great leadership stories.

591
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:47,170
And to tap into some of your wisdom today has been fantastic.

592
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:49,409
I've enjoyed every moment of it.

593
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:52,309
And I love that you've been prepared to take the time.

594
00:43:52,309 --> 00:43:58,150
And also, we're really appreciative that you are collaborating and learning with a group of coaches

595
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:00,309
in a world that we think is really valuable.

596
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:05,289
It'll bring different people across the globe together in a space we call A Leader Connect.

597
00:44:05,429 --> 00:44:09,389
But I want to ask you, who's, Coach Cole, been the greatest leader in your life?

598
00:44:09,389 --> 00:44:13,889
The greatest leader in my life has probably been Coach Dean Smith.

599
00:44:14,969 --> 00:44:18,590
Coach, well, I had back surgery my freshman year in college.

600
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:20,869
And I was lost.

601
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:24,170
I mean, I thought my career could be over.

602
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:27,289
For some reason, Coach Smith took me under his wing a little.

603
00:44:27,889 --> 00:44:29,269
I got a little more attention.

604
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:34,670
And I realized, I mean, my dad was a hell of a father.

605
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:38,269
And my father is second on that list.

606
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:40,329
But I was blessed.

607
00:44:40,989 --> 00:44:48,670
The decision to go to North Carolina has given me a basketball fraternity that I'll always have.

608
00:44:49,409 --> 00:44:57,190
But I also had a friendship with one of the best men and best basketball coaches of all time in Dean Smith.

609
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:59,369
Legend of North Carolina basketball, isn't he?

610
00:44:59,409 --> 00:44:59,670
And you mentioned the...

611
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:04,409
The North Carolina fraternity, the golf days with Michael Jordan.

612
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:10,989
And it seems like Coach Dean Smith has had that impact, not only on you, but on many across the journey, isn't it?

613
00:45:10,989 --> 00:45:12,710
It's a pretty special legacy, isn't it?

614
00:45:12,929 --> 00:45:14,030
Well, there's not only me.

615
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:16,469
There's Roy Williams there.

616
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:20,250
There are many, many Carolina coaches.

617
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:23,670
Larry Brown and Doug Moe have had big influences on my life.

618
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:29,369
And always having that fraternity to go back to every summer.

619
00:45:30,429 --> 00:45:35,610
It was such a blessing for me as a young coach to be...

620
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:37,329
Doug Moe was my big brother.

621
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:40,750
I mean, he would never let my ego get out of control.

622
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,550
He would always stand up to me and tell me,

623
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:46,789
as you think you're smart, I think you might be stupid.

624
00:45:47,929 --> 00:45:53,949
And, you know, there's always those boundaries that you sometimes need in growing.

625
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:58,909
And my North Carolina boys took care of that almost every summer.

626
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:01,630
It's the beauty of team sport, isn't it?

627
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:05,949
I feel lucky that it's been my life as well, playing team sport here in Australia.

628
00:46:05,949 --> 00:46:10,789
And you go back and you always get that, you know, that beautiful friendship.

629
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,929
But it comes with some pretty clear feedback, doesn't it?

630
00:46:12,929 --> 00:46:15,210
From your old mates and your old alumni.

631
00:46:15,449 --> 00:46:18,210
They don't miss you in a healthy way, isn't it?

632
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:21,130
It's a great gift to be able to have that in your life.

633
00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:23,150
We often say feedback is a gift.

634
00:46:23,309 --> 00:46:28,710
We're a bit obsessed with collaboration, Coach Carl, in the current world around leaders really seeing...

635
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,230
collaboration as a superpower.

636
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:32,349
Has there been, across the journey, have you thought,

637
00:46:32,429 --> 00:46:36,929
God, if I could collaborate with one person in a team or someone you'd like to get,

638
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:38,250
is there a name that springs to mind?

639
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:43,150
Well, the guy I always ran to when I got in trouble,

640
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:49,469
men on basketball IQ, were Rick Majerus and Dale Harris.

641
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:53,710
And they were always open to my questions.

642
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,030
I enjoyed talking to coaching.

643
00:46:56,289 --> 00:46:58,510
I like coaching coaches.

644
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:02,510
I don't like coaching, like, summer camps.

645
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:05,190
I don't like putting on big clinics.

646
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:11,389
I like having a round table of six or ten, maybe eleven, twelve guys.

647
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,969
And we exchange ideas.

648
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:20,329
And it's only by that exchange that something different will come to you.

649
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:23,550
And I did that every summer.

650
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:28,550
Tim Bergerich and I are thinking about...

651
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:34,670
doing it here in America two or three times every winter

652
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:39,150
to get together with a bunch of guys and talk the game.

653
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:41,250
Because the game is always changing.

654
00:47:41,489 --> 00:47:46,090
And Coach Carl has said a few times, we love that you're doing that on an international scale

655
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:50,250
and influencing Australian rugby and soccer in the UK.

656
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:55,349
And, you know, your work with, you know, Coach Matt LeFleur and the Green Bay Packers.

657
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:57,989
To have that wisdom, you spent a lifetime gathering it.

658
00:47:57,989 --> 00:47:58,429
I love that.

659
00:47:58,429 --> 00:48:00,150
You're so open in sharing it.

660
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:02,150
I really appreciate you joining me today.

661
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:02,750
Thanks for your time.

662
00:48:03,469 --> 00:48:07,269
My pleasure, Mikel, the coach at Arsenal is in America right now.

663
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:10,309
So I look forward to seeing his team play.

664
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:13,809
But that group, Matt's put together a great group.

665
00:48:14,949 --> 00:48:19,630
And I hope we continue to do it as long as they all want to do it.

666
00:48:20,809 --> 00:48:23,230
I'm sure that will be a lifetime ahead.

667
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:26,110
There's no shortage of joy and wisdom in that.

668
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:26,610
Thanks again.

669
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:29,170
And I enjoyed it.

670
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:32,170
Good morning, Australia.

671
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:35,730
I've never been to Australia, but I might be coming soon.

672
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:37,369
Well, we're going to make that happen, Coach Carl.

673
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:38,369
Let's put that on the list.

674
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:40,369
We need to get you down here for sure.

675
00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:43,610
It's a welcoming place for you.

676
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:45,289
I think we'd love to catch up.

677
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,289
So make sure you give us a call when you come down.

678
00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:48,489
OK, guys.

679
00:48:48,489 --> 00:48:49,289
Thank you very much.

680
00:48:49,289 --> 00:48:49,789
