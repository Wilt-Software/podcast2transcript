1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,819
Like if someone's caring for a parent or kids, we'll do everything we can to work with them.

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,179
But if someone's a 25-year-old tech bro, like you come into the office, mate.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,980
There's no need, there's no reason why you shouldn't.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,839
It's really easy to hire people who work from home.

5
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:13,900
It's just easier as a manager to say work from home.

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,219
The harder thing to do is let's get in.

7
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:18,239
Let's make sure your mental health's right.

8
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:19,559
Let's make sure your collaboration's right.

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,179
You've got much more chance of being promoted if you're working from the office.

10
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,739
The data came out of Bloomberg a couple of weeks ago, 50% more chance of being fired

11
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:26,440
if you're working remotely.

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:32,320
This week's conversation on the Empowering Leaders podcast is with one of the most clear

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,780
thinking, intelligent, and capable people I think I have ever met, Adam Swobb, the CEO

14
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,820
and co-founder of Luxury Escapes.

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,500
Catching up with Adam for this conversation, it's easy to see in my mind why Luxury Escapes

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,259
has become such a trusted and respected brand.

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,039
You're going to hear Adam talk about the sophisticated way that he and his team look

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,420
after each other, and that has led to Luxury Escapes being one of the most

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,899
sought-after places to work in the country.

20
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,619
Adam Swobb is very passionate about getting people back into the office, and you'll hear

21
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:08,980
him explain why he believes that this is actually a more compassionate and caring thing to do

22
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,920
than allowing people to work from home.

23
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,299
If you're an aspiring entrepreneur or someone who's got a vision and you're wanting to make

24
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:20,579
it happen, then I'm sure you're going to love this conversation with Adam Swobb as much

25
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:21,019
as I did.

26
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,299

00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:25,599

We would love to chat to you today.

34

Huge thank you to the team at Temper Bedding, to Jason Nicholas and his team for their ongoing

support of bringing conversations like this one with Adam Swobb to the table.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,420
Temper is a mattress like no other.

38
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:58,420

I encourage you to check out Temper today.

40
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,439
Adam Swobb is the founder and CEO of Luxury Escapes, an online travel booking platform

41
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,900
that generates more than a billion dollars of luxury travel experiences a year.

42
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,560
Adam started his career as a mergers and acquisitions lawyer at Freehills before embarking on a number

43
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,620
of entrepreneurial pursuits, leading to an incredible success story called Luxury Escapes.

44
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,659
He's the co-host of the brilliant Contrarians podcast, chairman of online art marketplace

45
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:31,759
Bluthumb.com.

46
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,759
I'm a board member of private media and in his spare time runs marathons without shoes

47
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:35,939
on.

48
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,460
Adam, you strike me.

49
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,460
Great to see you, first of all.

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,139
Thanks for joining me.

51
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,020
Thanks for having me, Daz.

52
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,400
You strike me as someone that's got great discipline and focus in everything you do.

53
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:46,199
Is that accurate and where did that come from?

54
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,680
I don't know if I do, actually.

55
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,960
I think I was never a professional sports person like you, so I think that's a different

56
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,460
level of focus you need to compete at that level.

57
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,280
I think I just like to, I'm somebody who's always been satisfied with stuff that's pretty

58
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,639
menial.

59
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,639
I used to work at Colby.

60
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:01,939
I used to work at Colby.

61
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:01,960
I used to work at Colby.

62
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,000
I used to work at Colby.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,020
I used to work at Colby.

64
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,060
I used to work at Colby.

65
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,080
I used to work at Colby.

66
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,139
I used to work at Colby.

67
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:02,199
I used to work at Colby.

68
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:02,699
I used to work at Colby.

69
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,180
I was happy to stack shelves.

70
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,099
I was happy to do whatever.

71
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,639
I worked for my uncle as a lawyer.

72
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,199
He was a lawyer when I was 13, 14, filing the most boring job in the world, but I was

73
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,199
kind of okay with it.

74
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,139
So I've always been someone who's sort of happy with what I'm doing as long as I can

75
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:16,860
get the job done.

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,539
So it's sort of less about super high performance, more about just trying to get as much right

77
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,180
as we can day in, day out.

78
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:29,500
But I see you're inspired to be vegetarian by the Netflix show Game Changers.

79
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,719
It had an impact on a lot of people.

80
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:35,159
You're inspired to run barefoot on the back of the great book, Born to Run.

81
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:38,520
A lot of people are inspired, but they might last six weeks or a couple of weeks.

82
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,460
You stay the course, don't you?

83
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,479
You've been vegetarian ever since and you've run without shoes ever since.

84
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,039
Yeah.

85
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,139
Credit to my wife.

86
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:50,680
She became vegetarian before me and both of us ate heaps of meat and I knew I was eating

87
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,659
too much meat at the time.

88
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,159
And you hear all that.

89
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,039
Things about why meat's not good or good or whatever.

90
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,659
But clearly anything not moderation is not great.

91
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,460
I was eating too much meat.

92
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,000
I was probably getting a bit heavier than I should have.

93
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,300
So I tried a bunch of stuff.

94
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:04,180
This is probably five years ago.

95
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,120
I tried a few different, how am I going to lose weight?

96
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,080
And I was sort of caught 80 kilos at the time.

97
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,219
Wanted to get to 71, 72.

98
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,560
How do I get there?

99
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,240
One thing was I started fasting, which sort of everyone does now.

100
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,520
It was sort of early days of IF.

101
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,439
Started doing that.

102
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,040
Still doing it.

103
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,759
Intermittent fasting.

104
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,259
Yeah.

105
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:18,639
Yeah.

106
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:18,720
Yeah.

107
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,980
So to explain that again to people, tell me what your version of that is.

108
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,160
So my version is I'll generally...

109
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,500
I eat dinner at seven o'clock, six o'clock, seven o'clock, or stop eating by about seven

110
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:27,899
ideally.

111
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,680
Different if you've got something on, you can't always do that, but try and finish by

112
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,720
seven and then probably eat again at 12 o'clock the next day.

113
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:37,259
So I do kind of like a 17 hour, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter.

114
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,199
And the basic idea of that is that you're giving your body all that recuperative time.

115
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,920
You're not putting other fuel in that makes it work harder.

116
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,519
And there's a huge amount of research into why that's a positive thing.

117
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,360
That's worked for you?

118
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:48,959
Yeah.

119
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,240
I think Chris Hemsworth did it in his show when he did those sort of six different episodes.

120
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,139
One of them was on fasting.

121
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,579
And yeah, that's the theory for me.

122
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,800
I just do it just, I'm eating less calories essentially.

123
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:58,980
It's why I started doing it.

124
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,439
I used to be in big breakfast.

125
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,019
I'd had meat at breakfast, always unhealthy stuff at breakfast.

126
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,639
And just cutting that out, I found really helpful.

127
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,699
And also I find I get less hungry now than I did when I ate breakfast or when I ate breakfast.

128
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,939
So I'll try and always do something in the morning.

129
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,620
It might not be a 5k run, whatever, it might be longer, but I'll try.

130
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,360
If I don't do anything in the morning, I should find I get hungrier.

131
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:22,720
If I can run 5k plus, I find I'm easily get to a midday.

132
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:22,779
Yeah.

133
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,579
If I can get to 1.32, you just sort of keep going forever.

134
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:25,959
Yeah.

135
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,040
So I'll generally eat at 12, 12.31, whatever.

136
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,579
When we finish this, we'll do it.

137
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,040
But so it was a combination of that.

138
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,060
I started using MyFitnessPal, which is just gamifying sort of weight loss.

139
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,879
It's a really simple app.

140
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:39,000
The more exercise you do, you get bonus for it.

141
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:40,699
And the more you eat, the more calories.

142
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:42,000
So it's just a simple calorie counting app.

143
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:42,480
They gamify.

144
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,079
Did those two things.

145
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,600
And then watched the game changer stuff and thought, why don't I do the veg as well?

146
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,240
Give it a try.

147
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:51,560
I didn't think I'd last a month or two months to your earlier point.

148
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,139
And it's been a long time.

149
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,459
It's been a lot easier these days to be vegan.

150
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,439
I think a lot of people sort of still look down on vegetarians as not being proper men

151
00:05:59,439 --> 00:05:59,899
or whatever.

152
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,339
Funny enough, like some of the strongest people and fastest, best ultra marathon runners tend

153
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:06,660
to be vegetarian or vegan.

154
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,779
But I find it just being a lot lighter.

155
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:13,420
Like you have a biggish meal, finish the meal, and 10 minutes later, you're feeling light

156
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:13,699
again.

157
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,300
Yeah.

158
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:15,000
Do you have your day?

159
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,459
I'm fascinated by the ability to stick to something, Adam, because that is what the

160
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:21,600
whole weight loss industry is about.

161
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:22,500
People can't do that.

162
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,139
Or the fitness industry.

163
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,560
The fitness industry relies on people not turning up to the gym.

164
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,319
If everyone did, it would be overloaded.

165
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,579
But is it just part of you?

166
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,259
If something works for you, you've got been able to, is there a skill in that?

167
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:36,339
Or is it just because you're in the elite percentage on that?

168
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:37,139
I don't know.

169
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,600
I think it definitely is a habit.

170
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,579
So like my biggest weakness clearly is eating sugar.

171
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,339
Like I eat too much chocolate or sugar.

172
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:48,199
If I eat chocolate one night, I'll open the Pandora's box and eat it every night.

173
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:50,759
If I just say, don't eat it, and I go, I didn't eat it last night, I was fine.

174
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,839
And then I'll try and brush my teeth straight after dinner.

175
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,019
So you just can't eat after that because it just tastes weird.

176
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,639
So you sort of force yourself in a way.

177
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,120
But you also don't want to just take any kind of joy out of life as well.

178
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,060
So there's a bit of a balance.

179
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,480
But I don't want to open that Pandora's box if I can avoid it of just being unhealthy.

180
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:13,860
So I parlay that, Adam, into to create a global travel business in a highly competitive space

181
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,199
and have the success you've had.

182
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:19,560
I suspect the discipline that you've got is a huge part of that.

183
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,639
And then also, I listen to your stuff.

184
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,139
There's a nice.

185
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,399
There's a nice natural self-confidence that comes out of the way you express yourself.

186
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,620
It almost feels a bit like a superpower.

187
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,079
Have you always had that belief in yourself that whatever I put my mind to, I'm going to succeed at?

188
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,699
It's a really good question in terms of looking at founders or entrepreneurs or founders in general.

189
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,579
Do you need to be almost to the point of narcissistic, optimistic, or do you need to be paranoid?

190
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:43,839
And the answer kind of is both.

191
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,939
You need to have the confidence.

192
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,459
So every time you start, anybody who starts a business, everybody's looking at you.

193
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:49,079
You've started a business.

194
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:49,699
You've got plenty of business.

195
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,620
People go, oh, you've got no chance.

196
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:52,540
You're a fool.

197
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:52,720
You're a fool.

198
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,980
If it was good, somebody would have done it, and you're not able to do it.

199
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,759
So nobody ever looks at somebody else starting a business and goes, that person's going to succeed.

200
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,240
There's always reasons why.

201
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:03,079
So you've got to be able to get over that.

202
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,279
Me and my co-founder, best mate from school, Jeremy, started our first business in 2004.

203
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,220
It was a backpacker apartment business.

204
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,360
I was a lawyer at the time.

205
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:11,800
He was a banker.

206
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,339
People thought we were insane for doing that.

207
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,339
So I took a leave of absence, and everybody thought, oh, this guy's a complete moron.

208
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,019
What's he doing?

209
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:22,740
Leaving a blue-chip law firm for this random backpacking thing.

210
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,019
And people probably thought a similar thing of Jez for leaving A&Z at the time.

211
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,060
But we sort of had – and I give Jez a lot of credit for this.

212
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,580
And this is why he's actually a really good investor.

213
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,059
He was early in Bitcoin, all that kind of stuff.

214
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,519
He's completely willing to ignore every bit of noise and just push forward on what he thinks is the right strategy.

215
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,980
It doesn't always work for him, but when it works, it really works.

216
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:48,379
And that is a huge – I'm not as good at him as that, but I've been able to take his lead a bit.

217
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:49,980
So he's really good at that.

218
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,639
So we are – we do have that.

219
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:56,179
We have that confidence that every founder probably needs to have to get over the doubters.

220
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:57,679
At the same time, we're also paranoid.

221
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,399
And we're thinking – and the nature of our business, nature of travel, being competitive, as you said.

222
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:05,299
And we started the business almost like a deal, tactical-based business.

223
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,360
So you're only as good as your next deal, your next whatever you're selling.

224
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,820
We're not a business selling a subscription business that you sort of lock in revenue.

225
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,399
So we've always had that paranoia that if we don't do something real – like a consultant or a lawyer or a banker,

226
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,700
unless you're only as good as your next client.

227
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,460
We were only as good as the next client or next deal.

228
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,100
So if we weren't getting that –

229
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,259
if we weren't getting that next deal, we could go from revenue of a million dollars to zero and be out of business.

230
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:31,740
So there was an unusual mix – well, maybe it's a usual mix of confidence and absolute paranoia.

231
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,539
That's a great way to describe it, isn't it?

232
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:40,120
The extreme end is that narcissistic overconfidence, but that healthy bit of paranoia drives a lot of people at the same time.

233
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,080
And so many points I want to pick up on the back of what you just said, Dan.

234
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,139
And one of them is whenever you start something, you get whacked over the head by people.

235
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,299
Are people close to you?

236
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:52,299
And they go, do you know the stats on how many people fail in small business?

237
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:55,340
And people have tried that before, and there's other competitors out there.

238
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:58,659
And that feels like the 98% of what comes your way.

239
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,360
And so what's your advice?

240
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,120
I love – for someone that's about to embark on that or maybe gone through the hardship times of it, how should they approach it?

241
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,779
Yeah, I often get asked this question.

242
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,100
It's a really good one to ask.

243
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,620
And people come to me, and maybe they ask – maybe the subtext is they want some money or not,

244
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,700
because it's one of the angel stuff that we've done in the past.

245
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,159
But they also – I usually say to people, I'm not investing now, or this isn't my sector.

246
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,919
But I'm happy to give you sort of thoughts on what I think of the business and what I really should do.

247
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:30,480
And there are plenty of businesses that might not be my kind of business, but I might be wrong.

248
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,700
So I might – you come to me and say, Adam, I've got this idea for a podcast business.

249
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,419
I'll say, I'm not sure this is a great business to ask, but go do it, because I don't know.

250
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,600
And if you think you can do it, and if the business model makes sense, give it a crack.

251
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:50,039
If it's a ridiculous business, then I'll be a little bit more sort of pointed.

252
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,659
But that rarely happens.

253
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:53,580
Sort through what they're going to do.

254
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,159
But ultimately, like – so there's a great question that Guy Raz asks every guest he has on How I Built This,

255
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:03,740
is how much of your success is due to luck or hard work or intelligence?

256
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,600
And it's such a great question, because there is no real answer for it.

257
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:10,100
But my view has been there's kind of three different gates.

258
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,159
You've got to be super lucky.

259
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:16,580
You've got to – if you're born a white male in a developed country, you've got huge advantages over everyone else.

260
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,759
So you've got to get that sort of luck.

261
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:21,980
And let's just say if you're not one of those things, you can't succeed, because heaps of people don't.

262
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:22,940
You've got an advantage.

263
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:25,120
And I had a clear advantage there alongside other people.

264
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,879
Born in a country like Australia, where there's opportunity and access to good schooling and education.

265
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:32,080
It's middle-class parents, which is perfect.

266
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,820
You don't want to be too rich, because then you sort of don't understand the value of money.

267
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,919
And if you're sort of right down the bottom, it's really hard.

268
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:39,440
People do it, but it's really hard.

269
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,220
So I had the absolute rails run through that.

270
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:44,940
So that was usually – that's like 99% luck.

271
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,580
And then, yeah, there's the degree of you've got to work hard and have some sort of understanding of customer and empathy and all that kind of stuff.

272
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,659
So, yeah, there's the skill, hard work element.

273
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:54,340
Work 10 years without a day off.

274
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:59,600
So there's clearly hard work, but there are lots of people who work two jobs, who are single mums, who work just as hard.

275
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,200
So, yeah, there's hard work and skill.

276
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:10,059
And then you've got to have another piece called the third gate, which is luck again, where not only do you have that initial luck and you've got your sort of hard work, but you've got to have the right timing.

277
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,360
And we entered sort of e-commerce 2010.

278
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,639
We had a perfect run timing-wise.

279
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:21,720
I think of the 10 richest people of all time, nine of them – this is in Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers book – nine of them were born in like 1830.

280
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,279
Because they all –

281
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,220
They all came of age at that industrial revolution in the U.S.

282
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,700
That was just luck that Rockefeller, Carnegie, all those guys, all white guys, were born at the same time.

283
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,299
So you need to have that second bit of luck where you've just got to get that wave.

284
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,539
And we had that wave alongside – same with the Gabby and Hesham Catch of the Day, same as Rosalind Kogan from Kogan.

285
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:38,360
Like we all –

286
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,779
Amazon, you know.

287
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:45,879
Yeah, and Jeff in 1995 when the internet grew at 14,000% the year after we started or something like that.

288
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,559
So, yeah, you've just got to be right place, right time on top of that other luck.

289
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
Yeah, and you make a really interesting point there.

290
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:58,200
Around the skill meeting, luck meeting, and it's nice to hear the honesty in that approach.

291
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:04,779
But you've also got to have credible resilience and solution focused to be able to – you know, obstacles have come your way.

292
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:08,480
And when you sit across the table with someone who sounds like, God, it's his dream run.

293
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,080
But were there moments where you thought, hey, we're in over our head here.

294
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,799
We might have bitten off a bit more than we could chew.

295
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:17,100
There's two absolute moments that come to mind there.

296
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:22,200
And I think where your point is really good there is probably the most important.

297
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:27,419
The most important characteristic in a founder – take out the luck stuff because you kind of need luck – is – and what a lot of venture capitalists look for is grit.

298
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,179
And you could call it resilience as well.

299
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,100
Same thing.

300
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,940
Two sides of the same coin.

301
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,320
And if you're really gritty – because you're never going to get a perfect run.

302
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,620
Every business has struggles.

303
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,799
Like Amazon almost went under multiple times and now it's one of two truly.

304
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,460
Like Apple almost – like all these great businesses almost did.

305
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,360
But you've got to have that sort of grit and resilience and willing to not take no for an answer.

306
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:46,960
So, I think we did have that.

307
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,159
And I think Jez and I, we had that sort of – we follow – I forget what the actual –

308
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,519
exact comment was from Phil Knight and Nike.

309
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:00,740
But he's got – one of his ten values was obey the law, don't follow the rule, break the rules or something like that.

310
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,159
So, we sort of have a similar concept.

311
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,700
Yeah, you absolutely don't want to break the law.

312
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,639
Laws are there for a reason.

313
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:10,759
But a rule that somebody randomly made, we don't – that isn't necessarily a law, well, that's there to be broken.

314
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,759
And every startup person has to break heaps of rules.

315
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,460
Otherwise, you never have any creative destruction.

316
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,179
You have the same people doing the same thing and never get shifted.

317
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,259
So, the same – if you look at the biggest businesses 50 years ago, almost none of them are the biggest.

318
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,519
Maybe just Exxon.

319
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,740
But you look at the top ten businesses in the States, they're all sort of 30 years old or less.

320
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,440
Microsoft's probably one of the older ones.

321
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,279
Yeah, and all been disrupted at some level.

322
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,700
You've mentioned your co-founder, Jeremy, a number of times already.

323
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,500
I suppose there's another bit of, you know, good fortune, good skill at getting a great partner.

324
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:38,980
Yeah.

325
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,940
How does a great partnership work from your perspective?

326
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,340
I can speak from our perspective in that we just have really complementary skills.

327
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:50,460
And Jez hasn't been super operational or really at all operational in the business for about seven or eight years.

328
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,860
But he will speak every day.

329
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,799
He will message every day.

330
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:55,279
He looks at every number I look at, equal shareholders.

331
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:58,559
But it just worked well because his skill isn't operational stuff.

332
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,039
He still is.

333
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,039
He's a great strategist and he understands stuff.

334
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,179
And he'll help out where we need his help.

335
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,279
And he'll always – he'll never sort of shirk that.

336
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,480
But we had different skills.

337
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,840
And that – especially in the early days when we had our early apartments businesses.

338
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,279
I mean, he was very operational there.

339
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,840
We came into office every day together and all that kind of stuff.

340
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:16,120
Wore suits, even though it was ridiculous.

341
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,720
I don't know why we did.

342
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,460
But we had these really complementary skill sets.

343
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:21,240
And also, we want the same thing.

344
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,740
We both have very similar court morals.

345
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:27,659
I think we both want to do the right thing by other people.

346
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,679
And we're court long-term greedy in a way.

347
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,879
We'll always sacrifice short-term wins for a long-term good result.

348
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,860
It's treating customers well.

349
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,419
It's treating team members well.

350
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,659
So, we're very aligned in – like a marriage.

351
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,820
Really aligned in terms of morals.

352
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:40,740
You kind of have to be.

353
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:41,399
Yeah.

354
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,860
Like you have a super successful marriage.

355
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,399
I think we've got a super successful partnership.

356
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,759
Me and my wife have similar morals in almost everything.

357
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:48,340
So, I think that's really important.

358
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,799
So, I think business partnership is very similar to a marriage.

359
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:51,220
Yeah.

360
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:51,700
Almost every way.

361
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,120
Yeah.

362
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,820
And I love your language.

363
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:56,700
It's a common one that I've heard asking that question around.

364
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,559
If you haven't got shared values in a business partnership, you're almost gone.

365
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,879
And then the complementary skill set is super important, isn't it?

366
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,440
Because you're not – you're adding to each other rather than crossing over with each other.

367
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:13,000
And you mentioned you've invested and, Jeremy, you guys have been angel investors before.

368
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,120
What are you looking for when you – is it the founder?

369
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,000
Is it just the sheer scale ability of the business?

370
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,899
What are the things you look at?

371
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,120
I'm not an amazing angel.

372
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,779
I'm not an angel investor by any chance.

373
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,600
I've probably, again, had a bit of luck, had a bit of bad – good luck and bad luck and probably evened out.

374
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,399
And it probably ends up being similar to what?

375
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,080
If I just chuck it in the next fund in the end.

376
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:34,940
I tend to look for a founder and grit and smart is probably what I'm looking for in a founder.

377
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:39,240
Obviously, the business is relevant, but someone's going to pivot probably multiple times anyway.

378
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,600
So, in our path, I've also found good founders and the business hasn't worked just because for whatever.

379
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,200
So, I'm not sure I can actually got a great pattern recognition there and I haven't invested for about four or five years.

380
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,179
For that reason?

381
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,799
Is that because you've got a heavy investment in what you're doing day to day?

382
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:55,179
Have you felt –

383
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:55,720
Yeah, a little bit.

384
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:56,259
A little bit.

385
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,159
I'm pretty heavily invested in the core business.

386
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,259
Also, because of the way sort of the startup market's been the last few years, this hasn't been as much exits.

387
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,720
So, I had a few but not – there's probably two or three big ones that just haven't exited because they've just been – because of the way the market is.

388
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,940
So, haven't been able to recycle that cash, which is probably the main reason why.

389
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,119
So, famous bet, wasn't it?

390
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,940
Warren Buffett, the greatest investor of all time, challenging the investment bankers to a 10-year bet.

391
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,180
I think the legendary.

392
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,680
The legendary story goes and I'll back my – an index fund.

393
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:31,539
So, for those listening, you're going to be much more articulate on this than me, but an index fund is basically one that's pegged to the top companies on the share market and they roll through.

394
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:32,480
So, it's computerized.

395
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:41,039
There's no skill in it at all in index fund versus these high-profile, highly paid investors and the index fund beats them easily.

396
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,980
I think his bet was against a bucket of hedge funds.

397
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:44,240
Yeah.

398
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,799
So, index versus bucket of hedge funds and it was from – I think it was from 2008 to 2015 or something like that.

399
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,940
And it smashed them.

400
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,279
Like, there was no contest.

401
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,779
But Buffett's been talking about index fund, even though Buffett's obviously an active fund manager, so he picks stocks.

402
00:17:57,019 --> 00:18:01,180
He's been talking about index funds for like 30 years, well before they became fashionable.

403
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:02,680
And now, everybody talks about index.

404
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,339
So, you listen to the Equity Mates guys who run a great podcast, third or fourth best business podcast.

405
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,319
And they also chuck in index funds and a little bit of spraying and prying along the side.

406
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,119
But it's become so mainstream now because basically it's the fees, the active fund.

407
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,160
This is not an investment advice show, obviously, but it's kind of knowing what you're good at.

408
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,180
Yeah.

409
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,480
So, it sort of relates to that.

410
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,319
And ultimately, in terms of me, should I – we probably could have just chucked it in index fund 10 years ago and end up separatist paraphrase.

411
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,259
Yeah, interesting.

412
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,960
I mean, I love, you know, delving into some of the culture that you've built yourself.

413
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,980
If you turn up at Luxury Escape, free Ben and Jerry's ice cream daily.

414
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:40,339
I read daily breakfast team members get access to all expenses paid.

415
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,380
Luxury Escape's trips themselves are recognized for your great work environment.

416
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,059
Tell us about how you built that.

417
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,960
I think we just built a place – I never worked in that.

418
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,240
I worked at a law firm for five years, but only two years as a proper lawyer.

419
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,279
A few years while I was at uni.

420
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:57,980
And so, I don't have a – and I worked at like supermarkets and stuff.

421
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,519
Were you disheartened in a law firm?

422
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:01,440
Did you find that – because a lot of people are.

423
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:01,940
Yeah.

424
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,420
I probably wasn't there quite long enough to be fully disheartened.

425
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,200
It's a pretty terrible job.

426
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:07,960
Like, especially at a junior.

427
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:09,380
When you get senior, it's probably less bad.

428
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,880
But at a junior level, you're basically proofreading documents.

429
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,579
You're putting together files.

430
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,619
It's not really law.

431
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,119
It's more administrative assistant in a way.

432
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:18,980
And you're getting paid like 50 grand a year as I was back then.

433
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,859
Maybe it's like 70K.

434
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:23,240
So, it's not – partners get paid like millions of dollars a year,

435
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:24,440
but the junior people don't.

436
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:27,519
It's kind of a pyramid scheme, which is how it works and whatever.

437
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,700
I remember I wrote this big manifesto, Jerry Maguire style,

438
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,240
when I left for Hills.

439
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,839
And to their credit, like multiple partners spoke to me about it.

440
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:40,180
So, you left them a manifesto and gave it to the partners, did you?

441
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,480
That's a bold thing to do.

442
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,099
Well, it was gone.

443
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,140
So, like it was –

444
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,779
Yeah, free year.

445
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,299
Free year.

446
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,279
And look, picking up on your style, I suspect you wouldn't have held back.

447
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,019
I didn't hold back.

448
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,819
But then they had Greg.

449
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:51,660
So, to their credit, like some of the most senior partners

450
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,640
wanted to speak to me about it.

451
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,680
I don't know how much they actually put into –

452
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,599
I actually did it –

453
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,099
I used to, when I was at Whistler working at a cafe in like 1999 and skiing,

454
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,519
I worked for a guy who owned this sort of –

455
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:02,500
I worked at this cafe basically.

456
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,099
And I worked on it.

457
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,680
And as I was leaving, I sent him just like a three or four page,

458
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,319
like a really bad McKinsey version of that.

459
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:10,400
This is what I think you should do.

460
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:13,019
Like put a post-mix machine in, install a deep fryer,

461
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:14,440
a few things I thought we should do just to –

462
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,019
and he was super grateful for that.

463
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:16,759
And he put –

464
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:19,180
I think he did a good chunk of them, like probably most of them he did.

465
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,839
And he was really –

466
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:22,660
and I actually went back and worked later years for him again.

467
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,980
And he'd implemented some of your strategies.

468
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:26,180
Yeah, we did most of them.

469
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,259
But like he let me work without a visa after a few years.

470
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:29,019
That was actually –

471
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:29,920
worked out for the best.

472
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:30,720
So, what did you –

473
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,359
massive law firm for you.

474
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,579
So, they're now an international giant.

475
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,599
What did you –

476
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,319
what was your advice?

477
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:38,759
I think my –

478
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:42,420
the big piece I talked about that I don't think has ever been picked up was –

479
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,740
so, law firms have sort of different levels, like all these partnerships.

480
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,400
And the big worry was you get to sort of the middle level

481
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,559
where you're doing all this work,

482
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,559
but you're not getting paid like –

483
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:49,839
so, the partnership –

484
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,200
So, you haven't made partner this time.

485
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:51,380
Yeah.

486
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,079
So, you're just below that.

487
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:52,619
It's called senior associate.

488
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:52,920
Yeah.

489
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:53,940
I was saying you need to put –

490
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,299
I think you should put an equity or profit share for that level to lock them in.

491
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,539
I see Gold had handcuffed them in.

492
00:20:58,579 --> 00:20:58,700
Yeah.

493
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,400
That was my main –

494
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,799
and there's a bunch of other stuff I talked about as well.

495
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:00,940
Yeah.

496
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,180
That was the main –

497
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:02,619
and it's actually –

498
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:03,660
I think I also talked about –

499
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,880
they used to have these partners lunches.

500
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,140
So, partners are going to have this fancy lunch.

501
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,359
I said,

502
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:07,660
why don't you give lunch to everybody,

503
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,559
not just the partners?

504
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,480
And we do that at Luxury Escapes now,

505
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,039
finally, and after it took me a little while to get there.

506
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:13,400
But there was stuff like that,

507
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,480
and I can probably dig it out.

508
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:14,940
I've got it.

509
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,440
I've still got it.

510
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,740
I still occasionally refer back to it.

511
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,519
But I was more impressed that, like,

512
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:20,859
several partners actually did engage with me on it,

513
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,140
especially because they're law firm partners.

514
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,599
And I still have a great relationship with people at Freelance.

515
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,400
I still go back there,

516
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,960
and most people have moved on in some respect now.

517
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:32,140
But I still have a great relationship with people who are still there

518
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,940
or who were there.

519
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,359
Well, a lot of the AFL coaches from the era that I played in

520
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,900
played in that era,

521
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,940
and they were born out of just riding this town going,

522
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:40,880
this is insane.

523
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,180
Like, do we need to personally abuse?

524
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,819
Like, people on a daily basis,

525
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,579
does yelling at people actually work?

526
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,500
And so it's created this sort of emotionally intelligent,

527
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,019
you know,

528
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,799
sit across from this judo from Craig McRae

529
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:55,079
and listen to his style of leadership compared to,

530
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:55,480
you know,

531
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:56,740
what we all sort of grew up in.

532
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,960
Is that probably, you know,

533
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:58,880
the daily breakfast,

534
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,759
free ice cream?

535
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:00,480
I mean,

536
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,359
obviously it just makes commercial sense for you.

537
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,980
It's a bit of the Google sort of,

538
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,619
you know,

539
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,019
the Google cult,

540
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:06,559
effectively.

541
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,460
You enter and you never leave.

542
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,640
Is that part of why you've gone that?

543
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:11,660
Because you could see an opportunity?

544
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,000
It's funny,

545
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,259
going back to the Craig McRae point you make,

546
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,480
one thing I did pick up from the law firm

547
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,160
that I've tried to change in my sort of day,

548
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:20,759
I remember you'd work,

549
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,259
you'd do these all night as a law firm.

550
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,940
So you'd literally work all night

551
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,019
and kick on the next one.

552
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,119
I did it a few times.

553
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,059
Or regularly you'd work till 10,

554
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:27,559
11 o'clock.

555
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,579
And you're not getting paid by the hour.

556
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,539
You're getting paid 50 grand a year here.

557
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:31,079
So it's like three bucks an hour

558
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:31,779
whatever you're getting here.

559
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:33,559
And I remember you'd work through the night,

560
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,460
give a partner something.

561
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,779
It may not be a great piece of work,

562
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:36,119
but you give them,

563
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,779
and then three days of it's in on the desk.

564
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,000
And that would drive me crazy

565
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,259
that someone wouldn't respect the person

566
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:41,799
who did that work.

567
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:42,299
It wasn't just me,

568
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,160
it was everyone.

569
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:44,480
So I always make it,

570
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:46,799
it doesn't matter who emails me

571
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,759
or messages me,

572
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,440
it could be someone who started a day ago

573
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,539
or someone who's worked for us 10 years.

574
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,619
I'll try and reply,

575
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,380
as soon as I get a zero inbox,

576
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,200
I'll try and reply to everybody ASAP.

577
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:56,839
And they'll know that no one,

578
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,880
and I don't want to make anybody,

579
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,579
someone's waiting for approvals for ads

580
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:00,880
or whatever they're waiting for me to do.

581
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,619
I never want to make someone,

582
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:02,779
sometimes you have no choice,

583
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,960
but 95% of the time,

584
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:06,200
I don't want to make anybody wait

585
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,359
because I just remember what it was like to wait.

586
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,000
And it was just so inefficient

587
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,200
and so unfair to the person

588
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,400
who's done the work

589
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,440
and who's getting paid a fraction

590
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,859
of the senior person to do that.

591
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,940
So I've always tried to act that way

592
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,140
and try and make sure all our managers that way,

593
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:19,720
not just me.

594
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:21,099
So I don't want managers to sit on stuff

595
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,059
and make someone more junior than wait.

596
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:26,119
And we know there's some horrific research

597
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:28,000
around the big accounting firms,

598
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:29,839
a huge troubles of mental health.

599
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,640
There's been horrible stories

600
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,559
of people literally killing themselves at work

601
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,920
in some of these practices in recent times.

602
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,079
You can't imagine the culture

603
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:41,700
you're describing.

604
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:42,700
You're out early enough

605
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,099
not to probably get stuck there

606
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:45,880
and you found your own path,

607
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:48,059
but could you see how that could

608
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,440
produce problems for people?

609
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,480
I think it absolutely depends on the person.

610
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,119
For me, I sort of,

611
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:53,759
not thrive,

612
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,599
but didn't mind that kind of stuff.

613
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:55,980
Like I go,

614
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:57,339
I only did it for a couple of years.

615
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:57,740
So yeah,

616
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,559
10 years later,

617
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,160
it probably would be pretty bad.

618
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:01,200
I only did it for a few years.

619
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,420
I ran the social club there.

620
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,140
I did heaps of non-legal stuff as well.

621
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:04,859
So for me,

622
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,079
I was completely fine.

623
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:06,680
But yeah,

624
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:09,000
I never was in that zone

625
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,940
that you talk about.

626
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,059
But investment banking,

627
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:11,700
it's even worse

628
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,799
because their hours were like

629
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:13,880
till 2, 3 a.m.

630
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,599
like every day.

631
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,420
So that's like incredibly bad.

632
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:17,839
Law firms and accounting firms

633
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,920
are just one rung below that.

634
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:20,980
But I've got friends

635
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,759
who are investment bankers

636
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,319
and they work 10 years,

637
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:23,920
no day off,

638
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,279
like midnight every night.

639
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,759
And this is the constant,

640
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:27,819
it can't be healthy,

641
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:28,759
not just mentally,

642
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:29,660
but physically as well.

643
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:31,460
You built this brilliant brand.

644
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:32,660
Luxury Escapes to me

645
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,619
is one of the most recognizable brands

646
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:35,539
in Australia now.

647
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:36,880
And you see it

648
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,299
and even if you haven't transacted

649
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:38,920
with you guys,

650
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,819
it is a good feeling about

651
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:42,000
what you guys do.

652
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,119
What's been the secret

653
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:45,640
to get that level of traction

654
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,740
so quickly, effectively?

655
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,619
It's kind of an overnight success

656
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:50,440
14 years in the making.

657
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:51,420
We sort of worked,

658
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:52,920
we started our first e-commerce business

659
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,579
in 2010.

660
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:54,500
Luxury Escapes,

661
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:55,660
we spun off 2013.

662
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,299
So it's sort of like 11 years Lux

663
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:58,680
and three years before that.

664
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,039
Apprenticeship in other brands,

665
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,900
we had deals.com and Kudo

666
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,619
and the like.

667
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,240
We still get a thrill.

668
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,960
I still get a thrill

669
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,460
when somebody,

670
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,299
you say,

671
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,619
that still is thrilling for us.

672
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,799
I don't ever really get recognized.

673
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:11,180
I was in the street

674
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,220
like you probably do every day.

675
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:13,500
But if the odd person

676
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,279
ever recognized me,

677
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:15,200
that's like massively thrilling.

678
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,180
And yeah,

679
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,980
I'm sure Jay's the same.

680
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:18,740
So we still consider ourselves

681
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,579
not successful.

682
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:20,940
Maybe one day

683
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,059
we will think differently,

684
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:23,859
but we still get a kick out of,

685
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:24,599
like,

686
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,059
I speak to somebody in the street

687
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:27,680
and I usually say

688
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,380
I work for a travel business.

689
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,339
They might ask which one.

690
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,000
I say Luxury Escapes.

691
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:32,039
And some people are quite impressed

692
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:32,900
and some people aren't.

693
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,299
But the people who are impressed

694
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:35,960
is like a big thrill for us

695
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,740
because we still think

696
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,220
we're just two average dudes

697
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,480
who don't really know

698
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:39,920
what they're doing.

699
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,279
So,

700
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:41,039
yeah,

701
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,859
for us it's been trial and error

702
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:43,859
for 13 years

703
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:45,079
of trying things.

704
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,619
If it works,

705
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,160
we go hard.

706
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:46,619
If it doesn't work,

707
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,200
we pull back.

708
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,559
Getting an incredible team

709
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,579
to sort of further

710
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:50,319
a lot of this stuff

711
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,500
and try to have that same ethos

712
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,400
of asymmetric bets.

713
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,660
So if we bet on something,

714
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,319
if it works,

715
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,599
it's 20x return.

716
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,059
If it doesn't work,

717
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:57,779
you've lost the 1x.

718
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,059
So how do we get that

719
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,740
sort of entrepreneurial vibe

720
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,279
through the business?

721
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,559
Which I think we still have.

722
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:03,700
Obviously it gets harder.

723
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,660
Like Jeff Bezos

724
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,220
talked about Amazon

725
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,180
being a day one business.

726
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,160
How do we stay day one?

727
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,640
We want to stay day one forever.

728
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,460
It's really hard.

729
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:09,980
Like Amazon,

730
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:10,799
I think,

731
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,779
now it's actually almost day two

732
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:12,359
and I talked about it

733
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,380
on our pod last week.

734
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,160
Jeff's gone two years ago.

735
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,160
Andy Jassy's running it now

736
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,880
who was Jeff's protege

737
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,559
for many years.

738
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,680
But I feel like Amazon's

739
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,480
getting very day two-y.

740
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,839
We don't want to become day two.

741
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:22,440
So eventually every business does.

742
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,859
But how do we keep

743
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:25,079
on the cutting edge

744
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:26,380
of what customers want?

745
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,359
So we've got a really good

746
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,140
marketing team now

747
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,900
who are doing heaps of stuff

748
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,440
around social,

749
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,019
heaps of stuff around

750
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:31,619
influencer work,

751
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,339
heaps of stuff around

752
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:34,240
obviously SEM, SEO,

753
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,059
all that kind of stuff

754
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:36,000
that everybody does

755
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,460
but we've just got to

756
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:36,960
stay ahead of it.

757
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,859
But you're good at it.

758
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:39,140
I've even done some homework

759
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,079
for this conversation.

760
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:40,799
Search engine,

761
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,500
optimization you just mentioned

762
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,920
but you put even the letter T

763
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,480
in for travel

764
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,619
and you guys pop up

765
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:48,640
at the top of the screen.

766
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:49,559
I mean that sort of stuff

767
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,680
obviously you put time.

768
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:52,920
How do you get good

769
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,019
at that for instance?

770
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,960
Hire people who know

771
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,539
a lot more than that

772
00:26:56,539 --> 00:26:56,799
about you.

773
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,380
So we've got our CMO

774
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,079
who's got great background

775
00:26:59,079 --> 00:26:59,559
in that.

776
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,759
He's building a team

777
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:01,539
who's doing SEO.

778
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,480
We had people before that

779
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,559
so our tech team's really good.

780
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,079
Our content team do it.

781
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,019
How heavy do you invest in that?

782
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:08,240
Is that a big expense

783
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,640
for you guys?

784
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,079
It's not huge.

785
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:10,380
Yeah.

786
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:10,799
When,

787
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:11,259
we're not a business

788
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:11,819
that naturally,

789
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:12,599
so SEO,

790
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:13,619
search engine optimization

791
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:14,740
leads itself really well

792
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,599
when you've got lots of content.

793
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:16,799
So marketplaces,

794
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,380
so your classic market,

795
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,160
so booking.com

796
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,220
who's a competitor of ours,

797
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,440
unbelievable SEO

798
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:21,960
because they've got

799
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,900
this huge marketplace

800
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,000
of 500,000 hotels

801
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,640
that have been live

802
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,279
for 20 years.

803
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:27,160
Our original business model

804
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,920
was really incredible value

805
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,140
tactical deals

806
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,220
on amazing hotels

807
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,299
but we only have that deal

808
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:33,799
available for two weeks maybe.

809
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,079
That doesn't lend itself

810
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:35,980
very well to SEO.

811
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
We built a marketplace

812
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,519
four years ago

813
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:39,039
which means we've got

814
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:39,880
a lot more product

815
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,420
on the site now.

816
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,619
It's like a mini booking.com

817
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,039
but with lots of stuff included

818
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:43,960
and a much better

819
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,660
contact center

820
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,500
because booking,

821
00:27:45,619 --> 00:27:46,440
you can never speak to somebody.

822
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,779
It's a great business by the way,

823
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:49,480
booking 135 billion US business

824
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,359
so there are many,

825
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:50,799
many multiples

826
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:51,599
of what we'll ever be but-

827
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,700
135 billion a year

828
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,319
booking.com.

829
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,240
Market value.

830
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:54,680
Market value.

831
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,380
They probably turn over

832
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,160
200 billion plus.

833
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:57,720
Yeah.

834
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:58,920
So like juggernaut.

835
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,140
Yeah.

836
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,299
So they've got incredible

837
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:00,920
SEO advantage

838
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,900
over everybody else.

839
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,099
Yeah.

840
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:03,220
So we're always going to struggle

841
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,279
in a way to compete against them

842
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,579
unless it's like a luxury term

843
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:06,579
which would be better

844
00:28:06,579 --> 00:28:07,279
because of the name

845
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,079
and that kind of stuff.

846
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,140
So we're coming from

847
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,319
a bit way back there

848
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,099
but we've improved

849
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:11,880
in that area

850
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,339
but what we're probably better at

851
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:13,819
is that

852
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:15,700
because of what we do

853
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,579
because we effectively

854
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:18,000
are really good at storytelling,

855
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:19,200
we've got a TV show,

856
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,059
series seven,

857
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,099
maybe even series eight

858
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:21,799
is about to start now

859
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,019
on Foxtel on 10

860
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:23,920
later in the year

861
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,480
working with some great people

862
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,660
who go around the world

863
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,160
and we produce the show,

864
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:29,279
we create the show

865
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,759
in partnership with Foxtel now.

866
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:32,200
We've had a podcast,

867
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:32,940
Electric House podcast,

868
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,720
we're on multiple

869
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,700
different radio stations

870
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,059
with sort of shows essentially

871
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:38,880
so we do a bit of what

872
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,900
I can call a mini Red Bull

873
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,259
in a way.

874
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,019
Red Bull, the masters

875
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,319
will never be as good as them

876
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:43,140
but the way they mix

877
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,039
commerce and content

878
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:45,380
has been an inspiration for us

879
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,779
so we try and do a bit of that stuff

880
00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:47,240
which we can,

881
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:48,500
Booking.com can never do that.

882
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,160
Booking.com can never have a TV show.

883
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,579
We're in a unique position

884
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:52,299
because of what we do

885
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:53,579
to be able to tell incredible stories.

886
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:54,940
And you're playing a space

887
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,799
where there are great stories.

888
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,220
We all,

889
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,200
if a travel show's on,

890
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,980
I can't help it

891
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,460
so I'm not a great watcher

892
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,380
of mainstream TV

893
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,200
but jeez,

894
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,259
I'd love to have gone there

895
00:29:02,259 --> 00:29:02,900
and you know,

896
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,700
if you're telling those stories

897
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,700
the way that you guys do,

898
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:06,099
you can see how powerful it is.

899
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,920
Going back to the brand,

900
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,319
I think there was a time

901
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,000
where Qantas had a look

902
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,839
at maybe going to buy you guys out.

903
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:14,059
Yeah, look at the Qantas brand now

904
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:14,920
and I just,

905
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,640
there's a disdain for Qantas

906
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,799
that it's almost hard to understand

907
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,299
in such a short space of time.

908
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,039
Everyone's had a terrible experience

909
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:23,480
with Qantas.

910
00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:24,420
You mentioned the name

911
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,680
and you can see,

912
00:29:25,819 --> 00:29:26,039
you know,

913
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,220
you've probably not ever been

914
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,779
on a call centre conversation

915
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:29,740
with someone from Qantas

916
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,599
given what you do

917
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:32,539
but you have, yeah.

918
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:32,920
I mean,

919
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,000
you want to have a rough day

920
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,640
to go and do that.

921
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:35,259
I mean,

922
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,720
it's not a given, is it?

923
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:37,579
I mean, you can drop,

924
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:37,859
you know,

925
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,299
they were one of the most

926
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:40,119
prestigious brands in Australia

927
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:40,960
and now they're,

928
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:41,819
in my mind,

929
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,079
one of the most loathed brands.

930
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:43,319
So,

931
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,480
what do you make of that?

932
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:45,500
Yeah,

933
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,799
that could be a whole episode

934
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:47,519
on Qantas, I think

935
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,500
but we are constantly petrified

936
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,779
of damaging the brand.

937
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,859
We overinvest in customer service

938
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:54,980
because we want to make sure

939
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,920
our customers treat it really well.

940
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:56,180
So,

941
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,579
we've got a 24-7,

942
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,920
365-day-a-year call centre

943
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,619
which almost,

944
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,279
forget travel,

945
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:01,119
almost no one in the world

946
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:01,500
has that,

947
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:02,259
let alone travel,

948
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:02,740
like booking,

949
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,599
you can't speak to some expert,

950
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,220
you can't speak to someone,

951
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:05,500
you can't actually

952
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,559
don't have any call centre.

953
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:06,839
So,

954
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,019
having a call centre is unusual.

955
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:09,480
Having a 365-24-7

956
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,359
is like super unusual.

957
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,359
If something goes wrong

958
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,440
on a luxury escapes holiday,

959
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:13,319
I can ring

960
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,500
and someone's going to answer.

961
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:15,980
The opposite of what you get.

962
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,019
Yeah,

963
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:17,039
or call you back in half an hour

964
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:17,460
or something like that

965
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,519
if it's a really busy time.

966
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,500
And we actually want people,

967
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,220
if you go away,

968
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:21,859
you buy a luxury escape

969
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:22,799
and you go to Bali

970
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:23,980
and something's not quite right

971
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,740
and we don't own the hotel

972
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,480
so we don't control

973
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,359
the end-to-end experience.

974
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:27,680
So,

975
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:29,259
5-10% of the time

976
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:31,359
something goes not perfect

977
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,099
and that could be just,

978
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,759
most customers are really good,

979
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:34,559
they'll just roll with it.

980
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,220
Some customers maybe not as good

981
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,059
which is fine,

982
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,720
everybody's different.

983
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:38,880
And sometimes,

984
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,660
the hotel's complete,

985
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,579
sometimes it's misunderstood,

986
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,279
whatever it is,

987
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:43,819
we want to be able to,

988
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:44,859
we can contact the hotel

989
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:45,740
pretty quickly and fix it.

990
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:46,779
It's much easier for us to fix it

991
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:47,799
while day one

992
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:49,240
when you get to Kavinsky, Bali.

993
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,259
They probably wouldn't do

994
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:51,140
anything wrong

995
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,019
but we call the GM and say,

996
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,259
Darth has got a problem,

997
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:54,839
can you help him?

998
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,519
And they'll give you,

999
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,240
they'll fix up and whatever

1000
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,680
and help you.

1001
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,279
If we don't know until

1002
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:58,839
someone gets back,

1003
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,259
much harder.

1004
00:30:59,579 --> 00:30:59,700
So,

1005
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,119
we want someone to contact us

1006
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:01,920
while they're away,

1007
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:02,920
not after they get back

1008
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,779
because once they get back,

1009
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:04,579
the hotel's got the money,

1010
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:05,960
they don't want to hear about it,

1011
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:06,980
we've paid the hotel

1012
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,839
so we're sort of

1013
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:08,359
hamstrung.

1014
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,119
We don't want to lose a customer

1015
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,299
but we can't give you

1016
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:11,220
a five grand refund

1017
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:11,960
when we've paid the hotel

1018
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,440
the five grand.

1019
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:12,640
So,

1020
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,519
we're in a really

1021
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,299
invidious position.

1022
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,339
If you can tell us straight away,

1023
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,599
we'll almost always fix it.

1024
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:16,880
Yeah,

1025
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,380
yeah,

1026
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,240
jump on the phone

1027
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,140
and which is what you want.

1028
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,259
Someone to listen to you,

1029
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:20,839
hear your problems,

1030
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,960
see if they can solve it.

1031
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:23,119
99% of people

1032
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,140
are reasonable

1033
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,519
in that space.

1034
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:26,400
Adam,

1035
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,799
we're fascinated by,

1036
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,440
yours is an incredible story for me,

1037
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:30,980
create something in this space

1038
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,259
as successful as it is

1039
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:33,400
and just the patterns

1040
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,059
of what great leadership

1041
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:34,720
looks like

1042
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,180
and I'll come to that.

1043
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,559
I want to ask you

1044
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,079
one final question.

1045
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:37,960
I meant to ask you

1046
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,339
about the Contrarians podcast

1047
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:42,279
which I love listening to

1048
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,099
and it's,

1049
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,279
a lot of your language,

1050
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:45,180
to be honest with you,

1051
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,140
it goes over my head.

1052
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,220
You know,

1053
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,220
it's rapid fire

1054
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:49,880
but it's brilliant

1055
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,539
and it's entertaining.

1056
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:51,980
There's a natural chemistry

1057
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,599
between you

1058
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:54,119
and your co-host Adir

1059
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,200
but you throw some haymakers

1060
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,700
at two of you.

1061
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:57,819
You're not prepared

1062
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:59,160
which I enjoy.

1063
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,640
In a business community

1064
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,059
where you guys are operating in,

1065
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:02,980
do you ever have that sense,

1066
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:03,220
you know,

1067
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,960
I know the footy industry,

1068
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:04,640
if you go hard,

1069
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,779
you're going to bump into someone

1070
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:06,059
pretty,

1071
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:06,599
you know,

1072
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:06,900
pretty,

1073
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:07,220
you know,

1074
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:07,460
readily.

1075
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:08,140
Has that ever been

1076
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,779
a cause for concern?

1077
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,000
It's pretty topical.

1078
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:12,539
I'm super flattered

1079
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:13,259
that you listen

1080
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:14,039
as someone who's got

1081
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:14,859
huge respect for you

1082
00:32:14,859 --> 00:32:15,980
with everything you've done

1083
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,740
from not just footy

1084
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,839
but in the business world

1085
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:19,900
and obviously in the media world

1086
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,940
so it's hugely flattering

1087
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,099
that you would even listen

1088
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:23,599
but yeah,

1089
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,079
I think part of the show

1090
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:25,640
is you want to be natural

1091
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,079
with each other

1092
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,519
and disagree with each other.

1093
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,819
I've been pretty outspoken on,

1094
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,900
I won't name the business.

1095
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,700
I've been threatened

1096
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,039
to be sued multiple times.

1097
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,140
That gets...

1098
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,900
For those that haven't listened,

1099
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,039
sorry to just jump in.

1100
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:37,359
You know,

1101
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,779
you guys will short a business

1102
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:39,720
or, you know,

1103
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,440
take a position

1104
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,240
and say this business

1105
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,740
is absolutely overvalued

1106
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,019
or,

1107
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:43,940
and doing a,

1108
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,299
you know,

1109
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:45,000
putting your reputation

1110
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,200
and then explaining

1111
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,619
very detailed why

1112
00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:48,680
and it's not a personal attack

1113
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,819
on founders

1114
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:51,220
or it's just saying

1115
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,500
this is how we see the market

1116
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,519
but I know how the world works.

1117
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,559
People think personally.

1118
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:55,940
Yeah.

1119
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,640
And it's happened?

1120
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,140
We,

1121
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,440
I've written business articles

1122
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,319
for sort of 15 years

1123
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:00,839
so while we're running

1124
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:01,480
the apartments business

1125
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,359
I've written for

1126
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,500
everything from Crikey

1127
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,259
to The Age

1128
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:04,720
to AFR,

1129
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:04,920
whatever.

1130
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,160
So I've written heaps of stuff.

1131
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,059
I've wrote a book in 2010.

1132
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:07,319
I've written a book in 2010

1133
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,640
talking about corporate collapses

1134
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,880
so that was a pretty

1135
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,140
like harsh book.

1136
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,420
No one's fully threatened.

1137
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:12,819
Like I'm,

1138
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,000
usually someone says

1139
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,839
take the article down

1140
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:15,500
I won't see it

1141
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,380
and you just take it down

1142
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,720
or sometimes you make mistakes

1143
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,619
and I'm,

1144
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:19,380
I don't,

1145
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,039
last thing I want to do

1146
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:20,559
is make a mistake

1147
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,420
about someone that's,

1148
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,400
especially that's critical.

1149
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,359
I'll always fix it up

1150
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:23,680
straight away.

1151
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,180
If you say,

1152
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:24,779
Adam,

1153
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,720
I didn't have 25 kicks that day.

1154
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:27,240
I had 30.

1155
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:27,720
Fix it up.

1156
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:28,380
Of course I'll fix it up.

1157
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:28,980
Like it's,

1158
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:30,019
you don't want something

1159
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:30,779
that's wrong on it

1160
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:32,039
but you also be able

1161
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:32,700
to delineate between

1162
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,119
when someone's trying

1163
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,140
to take the piss

1164
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,000
and get you to say

1165
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,640
something that's not true

1166
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,599
and I actually stopped

1167
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,359
speaking to companies.

1168
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:38,960
I used to write about

1169
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,319
ABC Learning Centres years ago.

1170
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:41,559
This is before it collapsed

1171
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:42,339
and I was pretty critical

1172
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:43,220
of it before it collapsed

1173
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,819
and I was short

1174
00:33:43,819 --> 00:33:44,519
of it before it collapsed

1175
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,920
and you speak to the PR people

1176
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,059
and they're always nice guys.

1177
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:47,940
They're usually guys.

1178
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,640
They're always nice

1179
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,660
and they convince you

1180
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,819
of stuff that you know

1181
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:51,279
is not true

1182
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:51,940
but you get convinced

1183
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,759
so I actually try not to speak

1184
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:55,160
to the companies I talk about

1185
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,799
because you get very easily

1186
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,319
influenced.

1187
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,420
Someone comes and says,

1188
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,039
Adam,

1189
00:33:59,099 --> 00:33:59,680
here's why you're wrong.

1190
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:00,000
ABC,

1191
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,559
here's the evidence.

1192
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:01,440
Then we'll fix it

1193
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,720
but I try not to practically

1194
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,619
go out to speak to people

1195
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:04,440
because I'm not a journalist.

1196
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,619
It's not my job

1197
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:10,019
to check with the company.

1198
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,000
They're welcome

1199
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,739
to contact me after

1200
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:12,659
but yeah,

1201
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,000
you definitely,

1202
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,760
I've had some angry emails

1203
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,400
but it's rare.

1204
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,460
You said it's topical

1205
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:17,920
at the moment.

1206
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,219
Has there been one close call?

1207
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:20,539
Yeah,

1208
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,420
in recent time

1209
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,019
I've been pretty harsh

1210
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:23,199
on a couple of different businesses

1211
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,239
and Adir is a public company guy.

1212
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:25,900
He's chairman

1213
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,420
of a well-known public company.

1214
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:31,400
He's probably more nice

1215
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,500
about people than I am

1216
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,159
so I run a private company

1217
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,119
so he's always

1218
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,099
a bit my peacemaker.

1219
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:36,980
I'm a bit more probably

1220
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,519
the aggressor.

1221
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:37,900
Not always,

1222
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,659
sometimes we switch roles

1223
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,139
but that's usually the role

1224
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,139
so he's trying to,

1225
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,760
and generally he's usually right.

1226
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,199
So he'd say,

1227
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,380
Adam,

1228
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,119
you don't really need

1229
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:45,679
to go that far.

1230
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,000
Let's tone it down a bit

1231
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,440
and I'll try and tone it down

1232
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:48,940
where he says it

1233
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,119
because he's a very smart guy

1234
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:52,000
and we just try

1235
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,800
and get that nice balance.

1236
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:54,460
Fascinated by,

1237
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:55,599
well,

1238
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,440
we see these patterns

1239
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,380
around what great leadership

1240
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,400
looks like in different settings

1241
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,119
from someone who's

1242
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,679
got an incredible sense

1243
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,639
of the commercial world

1244
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:02,980
like you do

1245
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,420
or someone from the arts

1246
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:04,980
or sport.

1247
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:06,539
And we think self-leadership

1248
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:07,760
and I think this applies to you

1249
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,300
is hard to lead anyone else

1250
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,179
without an idea

1251
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:10,860
of your own sense

1252
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,480
of self-leadership.

1253
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:12,159
What do you make of that?

1254
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:13,539
Yeah,

1255
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:13,820
I think,

1256
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,380
I find it really hard

1257
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,739
to describe my leadership

1258
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:19,099
but what I've always tried to do

1259
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:19,980
is lead by example

1260
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,519
and I can't do everything

1261
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:21,900
in the business

1262
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,019
but I've done most

1263
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:23,639
of the jobs or something.

1264
00:35:23,739 --> 00:35:24,820
So I've written deals,

1265
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,579
I've done customer service

1266
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:26,380
for five years,

1267
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:28,199
I've sort of done finance,

1268
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,099
obviously I was a lawyer.

1269
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:29,840
So I've done,

1270
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:30,820
I do a lot of sales

1271
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,719
where I can.

1272
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:32,780
Yeah,

1273
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,659
the technical roles

1274
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:34,360
probably haven't done less

1275
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,860
because I've never done

1276
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:34,960
anything.

1277
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:35,579
I've never been an engineer

1278
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:36,039
or coder.

1279
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:36,679
So you'll jump in

1280
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:38,199
and sell a holiday

1281
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:38,900
like you've done that

1282
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,360
in the past?

1283
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:39,719
Yeah,

1284
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,199
I'll do the radio,

1285
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,179
like we do radio stuff

1286
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:43,139
where I'll do that stuff

1287
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:44,320
along with some other guys.

1288
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,440
So I've done some sales

1289
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,659
and if I have to,

1290
00:35:46,699 --> 00:35:48,380
I'll get on the customer service issue

1291
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,940
which is a really big customer.

1292
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,019
I'll certainly email customers

1293
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:52,480
if I need to

1294
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,059
and if I really need to,

1295
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:53,519
I'll speak to them.

1296
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:56,380
So I don't want to expect

1297
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:56,900
anybody to do

1298
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,539
what I won't do

1299
00:35:57,539 --> 00:35:59,119
and that's in terms of work hours,

1300
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:00,019
in terms of,

1301
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:01,960
nothing I hate more

1302
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,199
than the fat cat part

1303
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:03,940
of being paid two million bucks

1304
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,039
a year leaving at four o'clock

1305
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:05,119
to pay for a meal

1306
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:05,519
to pay golf

1307
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:06,219
and the poor person

1308
00:36:06,219 --> 00:36:07,019
earning 60 grand a year

1309
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:07,940
having to stay and do all the work.

1310
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:08,760
I'll find that

1311
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,599
just really hard to stomach.

1312
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,079
So as we get more,

1313
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,179
as the business gets bigger

1314
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:14,659
and there's more people

1315
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:15,320
who work there,

1316
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,619
I don't think my job should,

1317
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,099
like yeah,

1318
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:17,659
your job changes

1319
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:18,960
in terms of I'm not handling,

1320
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
I'm not doing content anymore,

1321
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:21,579
I'm not doing customer service

1322
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,940
like I used to every single day

1323
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,940
but I don't think

1324
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,960
you should not do it

1325
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,480
so it becomes a balance

1326
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,139
and ultimately,

1327
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,139
the beauty of a founder

1328
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:30,500
versus,

1329
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:31,820
there's lots of amazing

1330
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,500
hired CEOs

1331
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,320
and hired CEOs

1332
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,019
are great at resource allocation

1333
00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:36,440
it's a really important job

1334
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:36,900
of a CEO

1335
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,900
they're also great

1336
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,880
at managing and building teams

1337
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,460
if you can't do that

1338
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,179
you can't really ever

1339
00:36:41,179 --> 00:36:41,840
lead a big team

1340
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,840
and you have hundreds

1341
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,519
of people who can do that.

1342
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,500
The beauty of what a founder

1343
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,099
can bring

1344
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:46,260
and almost every founder

1345
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:46,940
brings is

1346
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,579
understanding the product

1347
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:49,900
and by product

1348
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,739
I mean product management

1349
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:52,280
which is what

1350
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,099
is sort of a development

1351
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:54,000
technical term

1352
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,780
but the very first product

1353
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,260
we built

1354
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,440
means there's product management

1355
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:57,699
essentially

1356
00:36:57,699 --> 00:36:58,579
we product managed

1357
00:36:58,579 --> 00:36:59,619
for the first five or six years

1358
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:00,920
till we hired product managers

1359
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,280
to do it

1360
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,079
and we got an amazing team

1361
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:02,679
of product managers

1362
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,179
and product managers

1363
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:03,460
are the people

1364
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,059
who sit between

1365
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:04,920
commercial

1366
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,519
and tech

1367
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:06,079
so they've got a bit

1368
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:06,639
of a tech background

1369
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:08,059
but also really commercial people.

1370
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:08,719
So in your world

1371
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:10,400
they're doing the deal

1372
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,280
with the Hilton in Bali

1373
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:11,960
or is that?

1374
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,500
That's a different

1375
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,039
kind of product manager

1376
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:14,780
that's very true as well

1377
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,360
I'm talking about

1378
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,219
so we're building

1379
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:17,500
a flights portal

1380
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,119
on the website

1381
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,460
they're the liaison

1382
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,380
between our flights

1383
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,039
commercial person

1384
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:21,860
who's doing with the airlines

1385
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,079
and our coders

1386
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:24,360
so the product manager

1387
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,039
almost manages

1388
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:26,300
the technical product

1389
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:26,780
on the site

1390
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,800
so that's sort of what

1391
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,579
like Steve Jobs

1392
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,159
is classic that

1393
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,619
and the guys

1394
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:30,960
who run

1395
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,619
so Mel and Cliff

1396
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:32,059
from Canva

1397
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:33,000
they're product people

1398
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,440
they're both super hands

1399
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:34,900
on the products

1400
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,239
still

1401
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:36,219
I'm not sure

1402
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:37,139
if Mike and Scott

1403
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:37,760
still are at Atlassian

1404
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,079
they probably

1405
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,019
absolutely would have

1406
00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:39,719
been in the early days

1407
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:40,840
so their business

1408
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,519
was born out of

1409
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:42,559
their passion

1410
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:43,800
interest in you know

1411
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,599
Canva

1412
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:45,320
incredible story

1413
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,000
but they wanted

1414
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,579
to change

1415
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:47,039
you know

1416
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:47,340
the way

1417
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:47,679
the graphic

1418
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:48,139
design was

1419
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:48,360
yeah

1420
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,119
photo book

1421
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:49,380
business

1422
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,400
and they design

1423
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,179
and they still

1424
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:51,880
like Mel still

1425
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,519
is the main product

1426
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:52,940
person there

1427
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,360
and Cliff is

1428
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,280
kind of the main

1429
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:54,719
product person

1430
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,019
with it

1431
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:55,380
so

1432
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,300
and most products

1433
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:57,699
that we build

1434
00:37:57,699 --> 00:37:58,380
I'm working with

1435
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,239
my CPO

1436
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:00,019
really closely

1437
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:00,780
and I'm checking it

1438
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,840
and most founders

1439
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,860
tend to do that

1440
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,179
because

1441
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:04,320
as a founder

1442
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:04,639
you probably

1443
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:04,900
have that

1444
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,719
customer empathy

1445
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:06,619
bit more than

1446
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:07,480
a hired gun CEO

1447
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,099
like hired gun CEO

1448
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:08,900
can have it as well

1449
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,059
such as Nadella

1450
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:10,800
at Microsoft

1451
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,539
is an unbelievable

1452
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,219
one of the best CEOs

1453
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:12,599
ever

1454
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:13,400
and he wasn't

1455
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,000
he was a product

1456
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,719
person ironically

1457
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:15,179
but he wasn't

1458
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:15,780
a founder

1459
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,880
Gates was obviously

1460
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,199
the founder

1461
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:19,059
so the beauty

1462
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:20,079
of a founder CEO

1463
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:20,559
is you get that

1464
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:21,760
product understanding

1465
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,079
as well

1466
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:22,420
and you probably

1467
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,460
get that salesiness

1468
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:23,900
as well

1469
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,619
because every founder

1470
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:24,960
has got to be

1471
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,519
the head salesperson

1472
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:25,860
as well

1473
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,260
yeah

1474
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,280
closer to home story

1475
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,039
at a very

1476
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:29,880
small level

1477
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,619
but a great friend

1478
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:31,900
of mine

1479
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,440
I've been involved

1480
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:32,940
in this business

1481
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,059
for many years

1482
00:38:34,059 --> 00:38:34,780
learned to swim

1483
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,059
business

1484
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:35,639
it's been around

1485
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:36,380
for 50 years

1486
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,019
called Paul Sadler

1487
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:37,420
Swim Land

1488
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,280
I went to Paul Sadler

1489
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:38,940
did you grow up

1490
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,500
swimming in Paul

1491
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:39,920
Bay Street

1492
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,619
so many kids

1493
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:41,320
unbelievable

1494
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,159
and speaking to

1495
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:43,699
his son Ben

1496
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:44,059
who's second

1497
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:44,579
generation

1498
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,579
they get into

1499
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:47,539
are we getting

1500
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:48,300
enough kicking

1501
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:48,940
in the water

1502
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,719
in a prep class

1503
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:51,820
so founders

1504
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,820
get the detail

1505
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,260
don't they

1506
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,800
and you're right

1507
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,019
that others can't

1508
00:38:55,019 --> 00:38:55,840
because they know

1509
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,239
the history

1510
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:56,780
and they've been

1511
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,079
there

1512
00:38:57,079 --> 00:38:59,320
funny you mentioned

1513
00:38:59,320 --> 00:38:59,659
I didn't know

1514
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:00,039
you were involved

1515
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:00,340
which is

1516
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,320
my kids

1517
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,199
learn at MSAC

1518
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:03,920
and it's not

1519
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,460
a patch on

1520
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:04,719
like

1521
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:05,139
MSAC's

1522
00:39:05,139 --> 00:39:05,420
horrific

1523
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,440
it's a public

1524
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:06,960
government

1525
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,519
funded thing

1526
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:07,860
or whatever

1527
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,219
it's terrible

1528
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:10,739
but Paul

1529
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:11,219
had the

1530
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:12,460
colour certificates

1531
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,199
which is a great

1532
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:14,119
goal setting

1533
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:14,380
thing

1534
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,139
that business

1535
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:16,820
was incredible

1536
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,000
he had one

1537
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,460
at the time

1538
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:19,800
and I went to

1539
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,340
that one

1540
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,760
and now it's

1541
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,079
apartments

1542
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,239
it'll be tough

1543
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:23,880
to hear that

1544
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,599
so many kids

1545
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:25,039
grew up

1546
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:25,679
learning those

1547
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:25,920
lessons

1548
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,360
all our kids

1549
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:26,699
went through

1550
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:27,300
the same thing

1551
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,760
smart about

1552
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,400
incentivising

1553
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:29,780
to get to

1554
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,360
the next level

1555
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,219
it's the one

1556
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:31,920
renewable business

1557
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,239
isn't it

1558
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:32,599
we're all

1559
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:33,619
in a water

1560
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:34,659
locked

1561
00:39:34,659 --> 00:39:35,199
country

1562
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:35,719
we need

1563
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:36,500
to teach

1564
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:36,840
our kids

1565
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,219
to swim

1566
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:38,840
with founders

1567
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,280
and leaders

1568
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,619
like you

1569
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:39,780
Adam

1570
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,420
really conscious

1571
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,119
about impacting

1572
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,039
people positively

1573
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:42,659
every day

1574
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:43,079
and they're

1575
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:44,380
really thoughtful

1576
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:44,980
about that

1577
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,320
how have you

1578
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:45,860
gone about

1579
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,800
impacting people

1580
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,219
in a positive

1581
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:47,539
way

1582
00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:49,219
I think

1583
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:49,599
that's what

1584
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,940
ultimate leadership

1585
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,380
is about

1586
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:51,800
is you're

1587
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,179
working with

1588
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:52,500
people

1589
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:52,980
every day

1590
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,679
people don't

1591
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:54,380
like you

1592
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:54,900
and like

1593
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,239
what you're

1594
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:55,659
doing

1595
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,079
and you're

1596
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:57,519
not creating

1597
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:57,880
a better

1598
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,739
workplace

1599
00:39:58,739 --> 00:39:59,260
or a better

1600
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,039
life for them

1601
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:00,340
then you're

1602
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:00,780
not really

1603
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,460
a great leader

1604
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:01,860
in any respect

1605
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,320
you're kind of

1606
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,519
just forcing

1607
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:03,980
people to work

1608
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,199
because you're

1609
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:04,559
paying them

1610
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:05,380
ultimately

1611
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,880
we want

1612
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,239
and retention

1613
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:08,599
is a really

1614
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:09,179
important metric

1615
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:09,920
for us

1616
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,179
and probably

1617
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:11,159
every business

1618
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,159
we want people

1619
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:12,739
to love to

1620
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:13,280
come to work

1621
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,079
or really

1622
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:14,519
like to come

1623
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:14,800
to work

1624
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,239
and having a

1625
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:15,559
friend at

1626
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:15,900
work is one

1627
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,340
really big

1628
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,659
input in that

1629
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:18,719
but ultimately

1630
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:19,260
if we're not

1631
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:19,900
if you think

1632
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,340
about sort of

1633
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,780
stakeholders

1634
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,400
in our business

1635
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,619
we want to make sure

1636
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:23,320
our customers are happy

1637
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:23,780
obviously we've got to

1638
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,420
think of shareholders

1639
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:24,820
as well

1640
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,300
I don't own

1641
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,000
all the business

1642
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,420
me and Jess

1643
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:26,920
aren't the only

1644
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,460
shareholders in this

1645
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:27,699
business

1646
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:28,800
we've got to

1647
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,219
think of our

1648
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:29,900
shareholders as well

1649
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,860
but our

1650
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,780
teams

1651
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,820
are our most

1652
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,340
important

1653
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,639
stakeholders

1654
00:40:34,659 --> 00:40:36,280
our IP comes

1655
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:36,639
in and out

1656
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:37,380
of that classic

1657
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,280
investment banker

1658
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:38,500
line

1659
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,019
our IP goes

1660
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:39,300
up and down

1661
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:39,519
the elevator

1662
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:40,000
every day

1663
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
so we want to

1664
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,420
make sure our

1665
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,000

to work with us

1668
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,179
or at the very

1669
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:44,719
least really

1670
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:45,440
liking coming

1671
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,119
to work with us

1672
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:47,840
and if we don't

1673
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,920
improve our life

1674
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,300
then what are we

1675
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,199
doing?

1676
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,639
And the next

1677
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:52,179
dimension I want to

1678
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:52,699
talk to you about

1679
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:53,519
is the vision

1680
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,320
for Luxury Escapes

1681
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:54,739
as you said

1682
00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:55,440
started as a

1683
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,920
flash sale

1684
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,300
business

1685
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,659
and doing

1686
00:40:57,659 --> 00:40:58,199
great deals

1687
00:40:58,199 --> 00:40:58,639
looking after

1688
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:00,019
people in

1689
00:41:00,019 --> 00:41:00,500
those windows

1690
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,179
of time

1691
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:01,679
and now you've

1692
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:02,079
built this

1693
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,059
marketplace

1694
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:04,139
that listening

1695
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:04,500
to you

1696
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:04,639
guys

1697
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:05,219
it's got the

1698
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:06,159
potential to be

1699
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,340
a webjet element

1700
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:08,699
to it

1701
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:09,420
insurance element

1702
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:09,659
to it

1703
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:09,980
so it's a

1704
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,320
massive

1705
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:10,780
massive

1706
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,119
vision really

1707
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,079
and again

1708
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:13,460
a highly

1709
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:13,920
competitive

1710
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,199
market

1711
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:14,559
how do you

1712
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:14,920
go about

1713
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,420
sharing

1714
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,519
that vision

1715
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:16,900
with your

1716
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,300
team

1717
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:17,840
so that they

1718
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,119
get it

1719
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:18,400
the way you

1720
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:18,539
do?

1721
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,219
It's actually

1722
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:19,940
a really

1723
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,260
hard thing

1724
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:20,760
to do

1725
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,460
it's

1726
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:21,920
especially

1727
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,219
the whole

1728
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:22,460
team

1729
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:22,960
because you

1730
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,380
want to

1731
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,599
get as

1732
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:24,840
much

1733
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,260
buy-in

1734
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:25,639
as possible

1735
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:26,099
from everyone

1736
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:26,880
but there's

1737
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,159
a lot of

1738
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:27,559
say we're

1739
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:27,880
building a

1740
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,699
wholesale

1741
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:30,059
business

1742
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:30,440
recently

1743
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:30,719
which means

1744
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:31,159
we sell

1745
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:31,900
to travel

1746
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,139
agents

1747
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:32,400
around

1748
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:32,760
Australia

1749
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,179
so we

1750
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:33,460
started

1751
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:33,579
the

1752
00:41:33,579 --> 00:41:33,840
business

1753
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,500
travel

1754
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:34,739
agents

1755
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:35,159
actually

1756
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:35,380
often

1757
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:35,619
hated

1758
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:35,980
us

1759
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,480
because

1760
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,099
we

1761
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:37,280
kind

1762
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,340
of

1763
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:37,599
competed

1764
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:37,760
with

1765
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:37,940
them

1766
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,639
but they

1767
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:38,860
kind

1768
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:38,980
of

1769
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,440
wanted

1770
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:39,739
to sell

1771
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:40,019
what we

1772
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:40,280
had

1773
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:40,860
but we

1774
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,039
just

1775
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:41,159
didn't

1776
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:41,300
sell

1777
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:41,500
to them

1778
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:41,760
so now

1779
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:41,900
we

1780
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,079
sell

1781
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:42,440
to travel

1782
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:42,780
agents

1783
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,380
and we

1784
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:43,900
will

1785
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,079
have

1786
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:44,840
almost

1787
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,019
like

1788
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:45,440
30%

1789
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:45,539
of

1790
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:45,739
travel

1791
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:45,920
agents

1792
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,179
selling

1793
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:46,420
luxury

1794
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:46,820
escapes

1795
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,239
hopefully

1796
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:47,440
in the

1797
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:47,539
next

1798
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:47,699
six

1799
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:48,059
months

1800
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:48,559
so we've

1801
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:48,920
gone from

1802
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,260
travel

1803
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:49,460
agents

1804
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:49,880
hating

1805
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,300
us

1806
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,840
to being

1807
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,000
in

1808
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,340
partnership

1809
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:54,659
with

1810
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:54,860
travel

1811
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,059
agents

1812
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:55,519
and being

1813
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:55,719
able to

1814
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:55,900
pay

1815
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,179
them

1816
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:56,420
for

1817
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:56,719
selling

1818
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:56,940
our

1819
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,219
stuff

1820
00:41:57,219 --> 00:41:58,099
so that's

1821
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:58,380
a really

1822
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:58,900
fun

1823
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,179
product

1824
00:41:59,179 --> 00:41:59,639
to sell

1825
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:00,199
but it's

1826
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:00,480
not really

1827
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:00,900
relevant to

1828
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,219
call it

1829
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:01,460
our

1830
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:01,760
contact

1831
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:01,980
center

1832
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,340
because it's

1833
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:02,639
kind of

1834
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:03,659
tangential

1835
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:05,599
so it is

1836
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:06,039
a bit of

1837
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:06,360
a balancing

1838
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:06,599
act

1839
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:06,880
how do

1840
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,059
we

1841
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:07,760
tell

1842
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:07,980
everybody

1843
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,260
what we're

1844
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:08,480
doing

1845
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:08,659
and what

1846
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:08,900
we plan

1847
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,199
on doing

1848
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:09,519
without

1849
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:10,480
disengaging

1850
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:10,619
them

1851
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:10,780
because it

1852
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:10,940
doesn't

1853
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,139
actually

1854
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:11,440
directly

1855
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,099
involve

1856
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:12,460
that is

1857
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,000
a challenge

1858
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,760
and you

1859
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,000
can only

1860
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,320
have so

1861
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:14,500
many

1862
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:14,880
pillars

1863
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,699
of growth

1864
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:15,920
in a

1865
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,099
business

1866
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:16,380
at one

1867
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:16,719
time

1868
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:17,199
and not

1869
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:17,519
everybody's

1870
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:17,980
working on

1871
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,000
those growth

1872
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,219
pillars

1873
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:19,559
because it

1874
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:19,739
can be

1875
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:19,880
a lot

1876
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,159
of business

1877
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:20,519
as usual

1878
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:20,860
stuff

1879
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:27,559
do our

1880
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:27,780
best

1881
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,119
to try

1882
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:28,619
and engage

1883
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:29,039
everyone

1884
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:29,239
in the

1885
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:29,599
business

1886
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:30,639
as equals

1887
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:31,019
in many

1888
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:31,340
ways

1889
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:31,699
you are

1890
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:32,179
a contrarian

1891
00:42:32,179 --> 00:42:32,440
isn't it

1892
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:32,659
everyone

1893
00:42:32,659 --> 00:42:33,199
wants the

1894
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:33,500
online

1895
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:33,960
business

1896
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,099
and to

1897
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:36,500
take away

1898
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:36,920
from the

1899
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,500
travel agent

1900
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,480
onto online

1901
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,320
and now

1902
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:40,719
you go and

1903
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:41,139
open a store

1904
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:41,619
at Chadston

1905
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:42,780
why?

1906
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,199
we had a few

1907
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:45,760
pop-up stores

1908
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,119
over the

1909
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:46,380
journey

1910
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:46,699
and I

1911
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:47,000
actually

1912
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,219
love

1913
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:47,800
and this

1914
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:47,880
is

1915
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,340
screw

1916
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,320
Turner

1917
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:49,679
who runs

1918
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:50,239
flighties

1919
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,940
who

1920
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,500
obviously

1921
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:51,940
has 300

1922
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,380
stores

1923
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:52,639
and they

1924
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:52,960
still do

1925
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,300
incredibly

1926
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:53,519
well

1927
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:53,760
from their

1928
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:53,920
stores

1929
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,400
people think

1930
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,239
flighties

1932
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:55,840
and travel

1933
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,159
agents

1934
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:56,420
are dead

1935
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:56,679
flight

1936
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:56,940
center

1937
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,079
the

1938
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:57,559
long-term

1939
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:58,440
CEO

1940
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,780
is still

1941
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,219
the CEO

1942
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:00,519
of that

1943
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:01,820
it's a

1944
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,059
huge

1945
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:02,460
business

1946
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,840
travel agents

1947
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,059
are doing

1948
00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:05,219
really

1949
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:05,480
which is

1950
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:05,840
amazing

1951
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,099
to see

1952
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:06,559
they got

1953
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:07,000
smashed

1954
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,199
during

1955
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:07,460
COVID

1956
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:07,699
for

1957
00:43:07,699 --> 00:43:08,239
reasons

1958
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:08,679
that we

1959
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:08,980
know

1960
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,940
and poor

1961
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,179
travel

1962
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:10,440
agents

1963
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,099
if you're

1964
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:11,699
a home-based

1965
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:12,059
travel agent

1966
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:13,559
you were

1967
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:13,860
stuffed

1968
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:14,079
during

1969
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:14,260
COVID

1970
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:14,539
we could

1971
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:14,760
at least

1972
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:14,980
sell

1973
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:15,420
online

1974
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:15,639
to

1975
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:16,059
Australians

1976
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:16,699
we had

1977
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:17,079
revenue

1978
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:17,360
coming

1979
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:17,519
in

1980
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:17,639
but

1981
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:18,119
these

1982
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:18,300
poor

1983
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:18,619
agents

1984
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:18,880
had

1985
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,420
zero

1986
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:19,699
revenue

1987
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:20,039
and

1988
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:20,239
were

1989
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:20,699
spending

1990
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:21,059
all day

1991
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:21,480
refunding

1992
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:21,760
people

1993
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,000
and

1994
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,780
again

1995
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:22,900
the

1996
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,079
mental

1997
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:23,320
health

1998
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:23,639
issues

1999
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:23,820
and

2000
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,139
the

2001
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:24,519
depression

2002
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:24,900
it was

2003
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,079
just

2004
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:25,780
unbelievable

2005
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,380
how bad

2006
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:26,940
they had

2007
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,159
they weren't

2008
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:27,360
getting

2009
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:27,699
handouts

2010
00:43:27,699 --> 00:43:27,860
like

2011
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,079
Qantas

2012
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:28,300
and

2013
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:28,559
Virgin

2014
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:28,800
were

2015
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,000
they

2016
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,420
got

2017
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,019
virtually

2018
00:43:30,019 --> 00:43:30,300
nothing

2019
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,099
so

2020
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:32,360
thankfully

2021
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:32,619
the

2022
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:32,800
people

2023
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:32,920
who

2024
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,300
survived

2025
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:33,519
the

2026
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:33,820
agents

2027
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:33,960
who

2028
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,139
survived

2029
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:34,239
were

2030
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:34,360
actually

2031
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:34,500
doing

2032
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:34,760
really

2033
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:34,960
well

2034
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,079
which

2035
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:35,159
is

2036
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:35,579
amazing

2037
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:35,820
to see

2038
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:35,940
so

2039
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,079
technically

2040
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:36,280
we

2041
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:36,619
compete

2042
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:36,800
with

2043
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:36,900
them

2044
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,019
but

2045
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:37,159
we

2046
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:37,360
want

probably

2275
00:44:57,159 --> 00:44:57,360
pretty

2276
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:57,719
legit

00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:58,579
is

2280
00:44:58,579 --> 00:44:58,719

00:44:59,780 --> 00:44:59,940
nobody

2284
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:00,239

2285
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:00,460
that

2286
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:01,099
so

2287
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:01,320
it

2288
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:01,599
definitely

2289
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:01,900
helps

2290
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,079
for

2291
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,480
trust

2292
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:02,619
and

2293
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:03,019
credibility

2294
00:45:03,019 --> 00:45:03,260
as

2295
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:03,480
well

2296
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,340
fascinating

2297
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,579
curiosities

2298
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:05,880
are where

2299
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,239
we

2300
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:06,900
hear all

2301
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,320
the time

2302
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:07,739
and people

2303
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:08,599
we see

2304
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:09,519
like you

2305
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:09,800
are just

2306
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,159
curious

2307
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:10,420
and they

2308
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:10,920
use that

2309
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,320
curiosity

2310
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:11,679
to just

2311
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:12,079
constantly

2312
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:12,460
want to

2313
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:12,699
learn

2314
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:13,139
and grow

2315
00:45:13,139 --> 00:45:13,300
does

2316
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:13,500
that

2317
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,039
resonate

2318
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:14,280
with

2319
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:14,440
you

2320
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:14,840
yeah

2321
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,139
absolutely

2322
00:45:15,139 --> 00:45:16,239
I think

2323
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:16,440
both

2324
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:16,539
you

2325
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:16,980
and I

2326
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,559
are

2327
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:18,739
always

2328
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:19,420
very

2329
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,840
contrarian

2330
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,059
so

2331
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:21,900
I left

2332
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,699
a bank

2333
00:45:22,699 --> 00:45:23,239
when

2334
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:23,559
everybody

2335
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:23,800
was doing

2336
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:23,960
corporate

2337
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,820
2004

2338
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,340
wasn't

2339
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:25,500
cool

2340
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:25,659
to be

2341
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:25,980
a founder

2342
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:26,320
now

2343
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:26,460
it's

2344
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:26,599
kind

2345
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:26,659
of

2346
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:26,880
cool

2347
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,179
you've

2348
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:27,239
got

2349
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:27,400
Cliff

2350
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:39,500
and

2351
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:39,539
the

2352
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:39,699
new

2353
00:45:39,699 --> 00:45:40,079
world

2354
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:40,440
it's

2355
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:40,559
not

2356
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:40,679
that

2357
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:40,880
long

2358
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,159
ago

2359
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:43,199
Amazon

2360
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:45,820
wasn't

2361
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:46,099
thought

2362
00:45:46,099 --> 00:45:46,239
of

2363
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:46,460
highly

2364
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:46,880
Apple

2365
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,179
was a

2366
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:47,559
disaster

2367
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:47,840
so

2368
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,219
it's

2369
00:45:48,219 --> 00:45:48,440
very

2370
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,019
different

2371
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:49,340
now

2372
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:49,579
now

2373
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:49,820
everybody

2374
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:50,000
wants

2375
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,119
to be

2376
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:50,300
a founder

2377
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:50,480
which is

2378
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:50,820
amazing

2379
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:51,679
I love

2380
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:51,800
it

2381
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,019
back

2382
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:52,260
then

2383
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:52,840
we were

2384
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,099
considered

2385
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:53,340
like

2386
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,199
complete

2387
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:54,739
outliers

2388
00:45:54,739 --> 00:45:55,039
doing

2389
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:55,320
that

2390
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:55,760
so

2391
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,199
we've

2392
00:45:56,199 --> 00:45:56,460
always

2393
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:56,820
we own

2394
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,320
families

2395
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:57,380
so

2396
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:57,880
Sain

2397
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,079
what are

2398
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:58,420
you doing

2399
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:58,840
was it

2400
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,679
my dad

2401
00:45:59,679 --> 00:45:59,980
was always

2402
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,320
my dad

2403
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:00,500
was a

2404
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:00,699
builder

2405
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:01,000
so

2406
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,500
naturally

2407
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,000
entrepreneurial

2408
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,340
really

2409
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:02,619
supportive

2410
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:02,840
mum

2411
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,079
was

2412
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:03,539
semi

2413
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:03,920
supportive

2414
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,260
but

2415
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:04,420
she

2416
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:04,500
had

2417
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:04,579
a

2418
00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:04,719
lawyer

2419
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:05,079
son

2420
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:05,579
like

2421
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:05,820
kind

2422
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:06,360
of

2423
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,460
started

2424
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:07,619
doing

2425
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:07,940
backpacker

00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:08,340
apartments

2427
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:08,519
like

2428
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:08,900
and

2429
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,139
she's

2430
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:09,320
super

2431
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:09,619
supportive

2432
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:10,340
for a

2433
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:10,460
long

2434
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:10,679
time

2435
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:11,000
since

2436
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,260
but

2437
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:12,159
probably

2438
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:13,179
a little

2439
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:13,420
bit

2440
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:13,679
more

2441
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:14,019
skeptical

2442
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:14,639
which is

2443
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:14,780
fine

2444
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:15,659
but

2445
00:46:15,659 --> 00:46:16,219
we were

2446
00:46:16,219 --> 00:46:16,380
still

2447
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:16,599
living at

home

2449
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,079
then

2450
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:17,480
it was

2451
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:17,760
the

2452
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,059
perfect

2453
00:46:18,059 --> 00:46:18,320
time

2454
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:18,599
it was

2455
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:18,699
a

2456
00:46:18,699 --> 00:46:18,920
classic

2457
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,099
two

2458
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:19,300
eight

2459
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:19,539
or

2460
00:46:19,539 --> 00:46:20,139
perfect

2461
00:46:20,139 --> 00:46:20,340
time

2462
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:20,519

2528
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,159

00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:44,619

there

2537
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:51,099
relatively

2538
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:51,460
young

2539
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:51,719

2550
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:54,460
it's

2551
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:54,639
much

2552
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:54,900
easier

2553
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:55,079
then

2554
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:55,280
because

2555
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:55,380

a bit

2639
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:24,019

he

2650
00:47:26,139 --> 00:47:26,239
could

2651
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:26,380
probably

2652
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:26,539
get

2653
00:47:26,539 --> 00:47:26,800

2655
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:27,519
better

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,179
more

2665
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:30,320

00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:36,599
they're

3714
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:36,840
highly

3715
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,159
valued

3716
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:37,420
business

3717
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:37,559
but

3718
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:37,679
just

3719
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:37,780
because

3720
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:37,860
of

3721
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:38,000
the

3722
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,599
franchises

3723
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:38,820
they've

3724
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,059
built

3725
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:39,320
so

3726
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:39,760
we

3727
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:39,940
look

3728
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:40,239
to

3729
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:41,159
maybe

3730
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:41,320
less

3731
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:41,460
from

3732
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:41,820
collaboration

3733
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,179
perspective

3734
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:42,420
maybe

3735
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:42,619
yes

3736
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:42,719
or

3737
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:43,039
no

3738
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:43,820
but

3739
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:44,019
more

3740
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:44,179
so

3741
00:54:44,179 --> 00:54:44,380
like

3742
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:44,940
we

3743
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:45,139
want

3744
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:45,360
to

3745
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,000
emulate

3746
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,420
the

3747
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,099
multi-generational

3748
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:47,460
success

3749
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:47,980
of these

3750
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:48,420
it's very

3751
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:48,800
rare that

3752
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,059
business

3753
00:54:49,059 --> 00:54:49,539
lasts

3754
00:54:49,539 --> 00:54:50,280
you hear

3755
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:50,619
the one

3756
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:50,820
year

3757
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:51,159
stat

3758
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:51,460
then

3759
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:51,980
it's

3760
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:52,099
the

3761
00:54:52,099 --> 00:54:52,860
multi-generational

3762
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:53,219
businesses

3763
00:54:53,219 --> 00:54:53,460
we want

3764
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:53,519
to

3765
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:53,699
create

3766
00:54:53,699 --> 00:54:53,820
a

3767
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:54,400
multi-generational

3768
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:54,739
legacy

3769
00:54:54,739 --> 00:54:55,219
business

3770
00:54:55,219 --> 00:54:55,980
and

3771
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,119
that's

3772
00:54:56,119 --> 00:54:56,239
why

3773
00:54:56,239 --> 00:54:56,420
we

3774
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,079
invest

3775
00:54:57,079 --> 00:54:57,260
so

3776
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:57,380
much

3777
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:57,480
in

3778
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:57,659

we're

3781
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,300
not

3782
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:58,519
thinking

3783
00:54:58,519 --> 00:54:58,780
of

3784
00:54:58,780 --> 00:54:58,880
the

3785
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,079

3786
00:54:59,079 --> 00:54:59,400

3788
00:54:59,619 --> 00:54:59,840

3789
00:54:59,840 --> 00:54:59,940
year

3790
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:00,079
we're

3791
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:00,219
thinking

3792
00:55:00,219 --> 00:55:00,380
of

3793
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:00,480
a

relationship

3799
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:02,079
and

3800
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:02,159
if

3801
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:02,219
you

3802
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:02,320
look

3803
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:02,400

3836
00:55:27,179 --> 00:55:27,280
it

some

3924

Aussies

3928

and

3929
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:54,500
that's

3930
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,000
amazing

3931
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:55,199
and

3932
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:55,900
it's

3933
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:56,179
and

3934
00:55:56,179 --> 00:55:56,260
when

3935
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:56,340
you

3936
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:56,500
have

3937
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:56,719
someone

3938
00:55:56,719 --> 00:55:56,880
who

3939
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,139
said

3940
00:55:57,139 --> 00:55:57,300
I've

3941
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:57,420
never

3942
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:57,559
been

3943
00:55:57,559 --> 00:55:57,880
overseas

3944
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,320
before

3945
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:58,639
I was

3946
00:55:58,639 --> 00:55:58,760
able

3947
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:58,920
to

3948
00:55:58,920 --> 00:55:59,280
go

3949
00:55:59,280 --> 00:55:59,460
to

3950
00:55:59,460 --> 00:55:59,719
Bali

3951
00:55:59,719 --> 00:56:00,000
because

3952
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,840
you

3953
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,019
made

3954
00:56:01,019 --> 00:56:01,099
it

3955
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:01,199
so

3956
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:01,420
much

3957
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:01,980
better

3958
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:02,500
value

3959
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,000
and

3960
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,079
it

3961
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:03,179
was

3962
00:56:03,179 --> 00:56:03,480
the

3963
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:03,639
best

3964
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:03,880
experience

3965
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:03,960
of

3966
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,039
my

3967
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:04,199
life

3968
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:04,420
that's

3969
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,159
incredibly

3970
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:06,019
touching

3971
00:56:06,019 --> 00:56:06,900
and

3972
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:07,360
funny

3973
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:07,500
enough

3974
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:07,659
coming

3975
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:07,800
out

3976
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:07,900
of

3977
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:08,179
COVID

3978
00:56:08,179 --> 00:56:09,579
Bali

3979
00:56:09,579 --> 00:56:09,780
was

3980
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,179
decimated

3981
00:56:10,179 --> 00:56:10,360
as

3982
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:10,500
well

3983
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:10,639
so

3984
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:10,699
you

3985
00:56:10,699 --> 00:56:10,780
have

3986
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:10,960
people

3987
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,239
literally

3988
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:11,500
living

3989
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:11,659
in

3990
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:12,139
poverty

3991
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:12,400
over

3992
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:12,760
there

3993
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,659
such

3994
00:56:13,659 --> 00:56:14,519
a

3995
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:14,739
tourism

3996
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:14,980
based

3997
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:15,260
economy

3998
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:15,500
and

3999
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:15,880
the

4000
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,019
border

4001
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:16,139
was

4002
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:16,320
shut

4003
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:16,639
so

4004
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:16,920
imagine

4005
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,079
the

4006
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:17,739
devastation

4007
00:56:17,739 --> 00:56:18,099
Bali

4008
00:56:18,099 --> 00:56:18,280
Fiji

4009
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:18,440
were

4010
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:18,559
probably

4011
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:18,659
the

4012
00:56:18,659 --> 00:56:18,780
two

4013
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:18,980
most

4014
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:19,139
hit

4015
00:56:19,139 --> 00:56:19,480
places

4016
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:19,960
globally

4017
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:20,300
almost

4018
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:20,500
so

4019
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:20,860
as

4020
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:21,079
bad

4021
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:21,199
as

4022
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:21,360
we

4023
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:21,619
were

4024
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:21,800
at

4025
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:21,960
least

4026
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:22,139
we

4027
00:56:22,139 --> 00:56:22,280
could

4028
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:22,980
job

4029
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:23,159
keep

4030
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:23,239
and

4031
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:23,340
all

4032
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:23,440
that

4033
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:23,699
stuff

4034
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:24,280
poor

4035
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:24,440
people

4036
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:24,579
in

4037
00:56:24,579 --> 00:56:24,780
Bali

4038
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:25,059

4039
00:56:25,059 --> 00:56:25,519
virtually

4040
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:25,820
nothing

4041
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:26,699
the

4042
00:56:26,699 --> 00:56:27,039

4044
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:27,380

4045
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:27,619
funded

4046
00:56:27,619 --> 00:56:27,780
them

4047
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,039
a bit

4048
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:28,179
if

4049
00:56:28,179 --> 00:56:28,280
they

4050
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:28,579
could

4051
00:56:28,579 --> 00:56:28,840
but

4052
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,860
