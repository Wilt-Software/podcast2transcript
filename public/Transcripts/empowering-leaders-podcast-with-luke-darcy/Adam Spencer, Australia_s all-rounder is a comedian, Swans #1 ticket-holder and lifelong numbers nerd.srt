00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:11,359
I hope you enjoyed this chat with one of the great minds of Australian entertainment, Adam Spencer, a legend of Australian Breakfast Radio.

2
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:19,320
In this chat here, Adam gives great insight into the opportunity of artificial intelligence and what it offers to improve our kids' learning.

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:27,140
He talks also around AI-generated misinformation leading into the US election and his fears for what may come as a result of that.

4
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:35,299
How respecting the process and preparing properly has helped him to become the world debating champion and one of the most respected speakers in the world.

5
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,659
And it's people like Adam who inspire the work we do at Alita.

6
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:50,799
Love you to check out our signature Alita Connect program where we're bringing together groups of five or six people from different and diverse backgrounds around Australia and around the globe now to learn and to lead and collaborate,

7
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,020
whether they be from sport or from the arts or unique people like Adam that shared learning.

8
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,119
And he's also a member of the Alita Connect team.

9
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,219
The Alita Connect environment facilitated on a regular basis is something that we're really excited about.

10
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,240
Love you to check it out.

11
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,200
Book a discovery call.

12
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,700
Head to alitacollective.com for that and check out Alita Connect.

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,340
Huge thanks as always to Jason Nicholas and his team from Tempur, Australia and New Zealand.

14
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,379
They are the world's leaders in betting.

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,859
It is a mattress like no other.

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,980
And we've got great respect and thanks for them for helping to bring conversations like this one with Adam Spencer to the table.

17
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,859
People who operate at a level like Adam will understand that sleeping properly and effectively,

18
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:29,400
is one of the great keys to a happy and successful life.

19
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,680
So selecting a mattress like Tempur, a mattress like no other, is a great life decision.

20
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,920
Adam Spencer is one of the most interesting, intelligent, entertaining and unique people that I have ever met.

21
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,599
A genuine math genius, legendary breakfast radio host for more than 15 years,

22
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,459
won the World Debating Championship in 1996,

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,340
a multiple bestselling author of books based on the endless possibility of numbers,

24
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,719
and one of the world's most sought after MCs,

25
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,439
and keynote speakers whose TED Talk, which is brilliant by the way,

26
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:03,500
with the title, Why I Fell in Love with Monster Prime Numbers,

27
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,500
has been viewed more than 2.3 million times.

28
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,479
Aside from that, Adam is genuinely one of life's great people,

29
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,020
and it's always a great pleasure and privilege to spend some time with Adam Spencer.

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,740
Adam, really appreciate you joining me today.

31
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,240
Lovely to be here, Luke.

32
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:18,819
Really good to be on the pod.

33
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,819
Can I just quickly, at the top, very flattering introduction.

34
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:25,539
On behalf of genuine math geniuses,

35
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:26,699
I should put,

36
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:29,939
I should put my mathematical ability in perspective.

37
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,560
I'm a very good popular mathematician.

38
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,139
I did all right.

39
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:35,379
I started a PhD at uni and didn't finish it.

40
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:39,319
The way I like to think of it is in a room of randomly selected people,

41
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:41,580
I'm a math genius.

42
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,139
In a room of maths PhDs,

43
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,020
I'm as dumb as a box of hammers,

44
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,699
but it's not so hard to avoid being in a room of maths PhDs.

45
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:56,280
To use the sort of sporting analogy that you might understand,

46
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,620
just say,

47
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,900
I was a handy club footballer at like University of Sydney level,

48
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,740
and then for some reason the Swans said,

49
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,080
look, come and have a couple of games.

50
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,360
And halfway through my second game,

51
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,400
they had a bit of a look and said,

52
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,639
this guy really can't play at the super elite level, can he?

53
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,860
But now I'm on Fox footy on the weekend commentating,

54
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:23,039
and I'm hilarious explaining what guys who could never,

55
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,180
you know, do what I could never hope to have done,

56
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,599
are really doing.

57
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,400
That's sort of where I fit in the mathematic world.

58
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,919
But maths is so intimidating for some people.

59
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,800
It's very easy to give the impression that you exist on a completely higher

60
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,639
plane to them.

61
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:38,520
Well,

62
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,020
certainly in this conversation,

63
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,460
Adam,

64
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,960
you're a math genius compared to where I sit on that spectrum.

65
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:51,340
And I find what you do quite extraordinary because to me you do exactly that.

66
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,319
You turn numbers and fractions and algebra and stuff that I genuinely have no

67
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,159
interest in.

68
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,419
And then until I hear you talk about it,

69
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,439
and then I'm instantly fascinated.

70
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,580
And to me,

71
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,080
is that the problem with someone who hated maths at school like me?

72
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,219
Is it because it's not taught in an interesting enough way?

73
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:08,819
Is that the problem?

74
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,939
There's a real challenge and I don't beat up on teachers because teachers are amazing and it's a noble and

75
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:15,080
dignified profession,

76
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:22,699
but there's a real challenge having enough qualified teachers who have a passion and real understanding of maths at crucial stages in kids'

77
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:23,259
high school.

78
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,740
I like to say,

79
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,139
you give me your,

80
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,860
kid and make me their French tutor and in six months,

81
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,139
I'll give you a kid who can't speak French.

82
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:38,939
Make me their tennis coach and in six months I will give you a house tennis player because I don't understand how to run the

83
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:42,420
weight up through my back leg so that it's a top spin.

84
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,660
I just don't know how to do it.

85
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,240
I would not be able to teach anyone else.

86
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,199
They estimate up to 40% of kids do a year in high school,

87
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,399
somewhere between seven and 10 year 10,

88
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,000
seven and 10 probably where they're taught by a teacher who's not qualified to teach maths.

89
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,500
That must be so tough for that teacher.

90
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,540
But you hear the stories of just the look,

91
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,399
do all the questions on page 35 mark them in the back of the book yourself.

92
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,399
Get back to me.

93
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,439
We'll be back here tomorrow.

94
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,000
That's just not the way to teach something as beautiful,

95
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,560
but at times challenging as mathematics.

96
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,660
And that's what I love about passion,

97
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:14,879
Adam.

98
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,360
I love how it shows up in,

99
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,699
in unique ways.

100
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,480
And you're a man full of passions that I want to get to,

101
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:23,220
but the love of numbers is obscure.

102
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,339
It was that something that's in your DNA.

103
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:26,139
Did you just,

104
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:27,699
love that from an early age?

105
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:28,319
Where'd it come from?

106
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,240
Yeah.

107
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,279
From the earliest stages I can remember,

108
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:31,920
it just,

109
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,300
it made sense to me.

110
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:33,779
So again,

111
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:34,680
my mates used to say,

112
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,339
you're just lucky.

113
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:36,779
You're just a genius at maths.

114
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,800
And I guarantee you in primary school and I had some natural ability and I was going all right,

115
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,480
but I guarantee you I did more than they did because I loved it.

116
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:46,560
I just,

117
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:46,920
I could,

118
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,079
I used to the teacher and say,

119
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:52,019
do the 10 questions in the book for homework.

120
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,180
Why would you do 10 when they were 50?

121
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,480
What about the other 40?

122
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,019
And I'd just do them and I'd bring them in and occasionally say,

123
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:58,160
look,

124
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,160
I think there might've been a misprint in question 37 because I've done it three times and I'm pretty sure I've got the right answer.

125
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:03,939
But I just,

126
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:08,800
I fed on the stuff and in the same way that if you've got a couple of kids,

127
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:14,240
one who kicks a footy a couple of times a week with a local suburban club,

128
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:24,319
another who trains three hours every day because they love it and guarantee you they're going to be better than the first kid as long as they're getting quality coaching and instruction.

129
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:24,980
So I,

130
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,240
I loved doing it.

131
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,279
I had some natural smarts,

132
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,800
but I did the 10,000 hours or whatever you need.

133
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,939
Just loved doing so.

134
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:33,899
And I think that gave me a real headstop.

135
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:35,779
And I can't remember an age.

136
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,740
I can't remember back in second grade,

137
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,560
third grade saying things that would have teachers stare at me a little bit because it was just,

138
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,259
it was just a world I loved living in.

139
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,560
And Adam,

140
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:54,939
my mind's going as you're saying that to a conversation I had walking my kids to school with another dad in junior school and brilliant guy.

141
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,779
I think he was in the fruit and veg game and he had three boys,

142
00:06:58,779 --> 00:06:59,360
but one of them,

143
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,500
the middle one was just obsessed with coding and he could not understand where it came from.

144
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:05,779
He said,

145
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:09,180
it's beyond any of the DNA of my wife and I,

146
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:16,899
but he asked to become a border because he didn't want to waste time leaving school and the wasted time to get on the train to go home.

147
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:24,680
So they were finding a way to get it when he could be coding and he would be reading these textbooks at him out of love.

148
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,379
And he'd get to page 376 and he'd say,

149
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:27,680
Hey,

150
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:27,879
you know,

151
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,639
that's written by a professor at Melbourne university,

152
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,079
but I think they've got that wrong.

153
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:40,779
And so he'd be firing off emails to said professor just innocently thinking I can help you here.

154
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:54,079
And now that had been picked up by some algorithm at Google and Sergey and Larry had decided that was a good thing to fly this family to Google because they're saying,

155
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:54,579
don't worry,

156
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:56,879
don't worry about this kid's 14.

157
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,480
He's thinking in a way that we need to think about.

158
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:05,779
I wonder if the world had have been Adam Spencer might've trajectory might've been slightly different.

159
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:05,980
Yeah,

160
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,779
I think there was,

161
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:06,980
I mean,

162
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,480
I never,

163
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,680
I never went to any schools where they did enrichment and additional stuff.

164
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,480
So I only ever just loved doing what I was doing and doing all that.

165
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:14,879
I do.

166
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,079
I do wish if in around year seven or eight,

167
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,379
a teacher would come to me and said,

168
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:19,579
look,

169
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:22,579
you're pretty handy at maths at this school.

170
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:24,180
There's lots of other kids made at other schools,

171
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,379
or just as handy as you.

172
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,180
And did you know Adam,

173
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,579
you can actually do maths Olympiads.

174
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:31,879
You can represent Australia in mathematics.

175
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,480
And if someone had said to me at a younger age,

176
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,179
you might have the potential to maybe go close to representing Australia or whatever.

177
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,379
But to be honest,

178
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:41,179
Adam,

179
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:43,379
I don't think you'd have the guts to work hard enough.

180
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:46,279
If somebody just wave that flag in front of me in year seven,

181
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:46,580
year eight,

182
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,980
I'd be fascinated to know where I would have landed with that sort of stuff.

183
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,080
And I think a lot of the time in life,

184
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,379
I would,

185
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:54,080
I would always,

186
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,779
always prefer to have had an absolute best crack at something and lost or fallen short.

187
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:04,679
Or when I started to do my PhD at university,

188
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,279
I realised,

189
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,779
in fact,

190
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,879
because I decided at fairly last minute,

191
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:08,980
yeah,

192
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,080
let's go to that next level of study.

193
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,480
I did not have the tools in the kit bag to do original mathematics or research.

194
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,679
And once I started to realise that and looked around and I stumbled into the radio thing,

195
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:23,279
I genuinely don't know

196
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,580
if from first day,

197
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,580
first year uni,

198
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,480
I'd had a PhD or something on the horizon.

199
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,580
Genuinely don't know if I could have completed one or not.

200
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,679
And I'd much rather know,

201
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:33,879
yeah,

202
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:40,179
you probably wouldn't have quite got there than genuinely not knowing if I would or would not have done so.

203
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:44,980
That sort of frustration of never having really known where your limits were in something.

204
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,279
I do have a little bit of that,

205
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,179
but that's fantastic for your boy.

206
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:51,080
It's like that with these popular books I write,

207
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,279
they appeal to a lot of,

208
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:55,080
it's not high school maths.

209
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,080
It's just beautiful stuff from all over the place.

210
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,379
Some of it's stuff you might not see until second or third year uni or never at uni.

211
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:04,580
They're just little beautiful moments of maths and trivia.

212
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,980
And they appeal a lot to kids on the spectrum

213
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,580
and the parents of kids on the spectrum who just give them one of my books and say,

214
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,480
go away for two months.

215
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,279
I'll see you when you're done.

216
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,580
And I did a book launch once for one of my books

217
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,279
and we went to questions in the audience and all these kids raised the microphones.

218
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,980
This girl who would have only been about 11 or 12 asked this question.

219
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,580
She said, look,

220
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,379
in your last book on page 43,

221
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:28,480
you asked this question and I've done it so many times

222
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,580
and I just keep getting the same answer.

223
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,980
And it's not the answer you've got in the back of the book.

224
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,580
You know, what's going on?

225
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,379
And I said, was it the question about blah, blah?

226
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:36,779
She goes, yeah.

227
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,980
And I said, yeah, back of the book's a misprint.

228
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,879
It's a total misprint.

229
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,379
You're correct.

230
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:43,179
And she stepped away from the microphone

231
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:46,980
and just gave herself a little fist pump

232
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,580
and then just walked back to her seat.

233
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,379
And she wasn't walking around going, look at me.

234
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:52,080
But just this moment of affirmation,

235
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:55,580
because she just could not understand how she hadn't got this right.

236
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,580
And she'd really done the work on it.

237
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,580
And I said, no, you're right, mate.

238
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,279
It's just the book's wrong.

239
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:04,279
And she was walking on clouds for the rest of the event.

240
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:06,480
You know, there's something, the young curious mind,

241
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,580
when it hits a challenge and then realises they were right,

242
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,480
it's just a beautiful moment.

243
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,679
And I love what you just said then around,

244
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,980
you know, there's an ever-growing community of, on the spectrum,

245
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,279
you know, different discussion for another day probably,

246
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,179
but I've got dozens of families,

247
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:26,480
families that I'm connected to that, you know, are dealing with that.

248
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,779
But what you're describing is the beauty of it at times as well.

249
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:31,679
There's, you know, it is a spectrum.

250
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,779
So there are kids that have enormous challenges at one end.

251
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:39,379
And then there's this incredible ability to use the mind in different ways.

252
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:41,879
Is that something we need to celebrate more?

253
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:44,480
You're probably fairly neurodiverse as well.

254
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
Mate, when you and I were in primary school,

255
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,279
those kids were just called the spazzers.

256
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,980
And you had a bit of a laugh at them and you might,

257
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,779
hopefully looking back, weren't part of the group,

258
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,279
but there was a group who just picked on them.

259
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,179
And there certainly wasn't the, you know,

260
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:01,980
you'd have the one in a million case of then the kid would sit down by the piano

261
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,379
and everyone would realise they were the next David Helfgott or whatever.

262
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:11,679
But these kids just didn't get the sort of learning support that they needed to flourish.

263
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:14,480
And which is really unfortunate for them.

264
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,980
And also for us as a society,

265
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:21,679
because when you get into the spaces where these kids grow into young adults and really shine,

266
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,179
they can do things in computer coding and cyber security

267
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:29,080
and the creativity in those spaces in particular,

268
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,080
that a lot of people who aren't on the diverse spectrum just cannot do at all.

269
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,379
And it's really encouraging.

270
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,179
I'm more often these days might go to a school or something

271
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:42,480
and you'll be doing a session and it's moving up towards lunch.

272
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,279
And you'll notice there's a few kids who are already out in the playground with the big headphones on,

273
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,580
being allowed to have a bit of their own rec time because if they have lunch,

274
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,080
when there's 350 kids running around and playing British Bulldog and all that sort of stuff,

275
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,080
it's just a little bit too much for them.

276
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,480
So even that our systems are flexible enough now to realise,

277
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,679
some kids just get a little bit overstimulated or intimidated by massive crowds and noise.

278
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,379
So let's just let them have lunch 15 minutes earlier or later than everyone else.

279
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:14,179
So even that's a small step in the right direction,

280
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:20,279
but the workforces and the communities that harness the potential of everyone are the ones who are going to do best.

281
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,279
And the new,

282
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:26,279
the first community is still a massively untapped resource.

283
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,779
And Adam, I love having conversations.

284
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:32,279
You've met to a couple of topics that I want to ask you about.

285
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:36,779
And you spoke about cybersecurity and coding and stuff that I know when I bounce it off you,

286
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,580
I'm going to have a better understanding myself.

287
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:43,879
And so there's a selfish purpose to this particular podcast.

288
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:46,080
But starting with ChatGBT,

289
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,779
and it's brought for me artificial intelligence straight to the mainstream almost overnight.

290
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:51,379
Microsoft,

291
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:53,480
buy it for $10 billion.

292
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,580
I think for 50% is maybe the numbers that immediately gets this high profile.

293
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,080
We're suddenly playing with artificial intelligence on a daily basis.

294
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,580
Can I ask you,

295
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,779
I want you to put your futurist hat on for a moment.

296
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:09,879
What does artificial intelligence play in our lives going forward in the next 10,

297
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,580
20 and 30 years?

298
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,879
Yeah, it's really interesting and it has been a crazy ride the last six months.

299
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:20,080
I mean, most parents first heard of ChatGBT,

300
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,980
when they got a letter from their kids school saying,

301
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,080
don't panic.

302
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,279
We've banned ChatGBT.

303
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,879
And half of us were thinking,

304
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:28,379
yeah, cool.

305
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:30,480
Is that like some flavor of vape or something?

306
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,879
What is it?

307
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,179
And I okay about it.

308
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:34,379
Well, please explain to me.

309
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:40,879
Yeah, because when they released version four after version 3.5,

310
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,879
it was explosively better in a lot of tests,

311
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:44,879
a lot better than they did.

312
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,980
The jump from 3.5 to 4 was larger than even the people who created the model.

313
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,879
It's expected to be.

314
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,879
That's what got everyone talking.

315
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:58,980
But artificial intelligence in many other forms had been around for a long time before these language models.

316
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,679
So previous to language models,

317
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:04,779
most of us dealt with artificial intelligence when you turned on Netflix and it said,

318
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,080
you watched this,

319
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,279
here's eight other things you might watch.

320
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:12,179
And those things were surprisingly almost unnervingly accurate.

321
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:14,379
When Spotify just throws up a channel and goes,

322
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:15,580
well, if you like these three artists,

323
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,279
you might like this.

324
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,879
That's all artificial intelligence.

325
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:19,679
That's algorithms.

326
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,480
What are you watching?

327
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,679
How long are you watching those things?

328
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:25,779
90% of the people who watched this also watched that and that and watched it,

329
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:26,879
not just for the first few minutes,

330
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:27,879
but to the end,

331
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:32,279
that's a suggestion of those sort of behavior models.

332
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:37,879
And also other things like the algorithm that taught itself chess from scratch,

333
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:41,980
played 5 million games against just parallel versions of itself.

334
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,080
And in four hours,

335
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:49,179
just four hours became better than the world's best dedicated chess,

336
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:51,379
computer that we had designed,

337
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:52,179
right?

338
00:15:52,179 --> 00:16:06,879
That sort of neural network machine learning model is now applying itself to examining how proteins are folded in three dimensions and creating these complex.

339
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:14,279
Chemical substances that used to take an individual an entire PhD or maybe years of their career to work out the shape of.

340
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,480
We're now going to the researchers going,

341
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,980
look, it's going to look pretty much like that.

342
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,080
Why don't you start from there?

343
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,980
It's revolutionized.

344
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,679
The field of protein folding,

345
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,279
for example.

346
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,580
So in areas of medicine and things like that,

347
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,879
new network machine learning models are already fast-tracking the world of medicine.

348
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,580
You won't recognize,

349
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:30,679
you know,

350
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,080
1520 years from now,

351
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,480
the degree of personalization,

352
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,080
the ability for things to scan people and in real time,

353
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,679
give feedback to doctors and practitioners and that sort of stuff.

354
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,679
And then there's the chat GPT language models.

355
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:45,779
They're going to change everything,

356
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,279
but the massive field,

357
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,879
they're going to change the two things I'll give you.

358
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:57,879
Education both on behalf of the teacher trying to assess where 20 people are at until recently.

359
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:02,179
You've had to give them the same exam with the same 10 questions on it.

360
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:02,480
And you know,

361
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,379
the old maths exam,

362
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:04,980
you have five easy questions,

363
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,079
five medium,

364
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,279
five harder,

365
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,980
and then the five I used to run straight to at the end,

366
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,980
the real brain busters,

367
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,980
right?

368
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,480
If a student gets the first three easy questions wrong,

369
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,880
is there any point going on to the medium and the hardest stuff?

370
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,079
Now,

371
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,680
let's stay there and find out.

372
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,279
What's going on?

373
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,579
If someone hits the first three easy questions over the fence in five seconds each,

374
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,680
do we really need to try the medium stuff?

375
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:25,779
Now,

376
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:28,680
let's spend this hour we've got with them probing deeper.

377
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,779
So you'll have a class of kids and no two kids will do the same exam at the same time.

378
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:39,880
They'll all do an exam that hones in on and the teachers will get feedback of following five kids probably shouldn't be in the class.

379
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,480
These kids going.

380
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,380
All right,

381
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,579
these two kids that you're giving 90% to.

382
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:44,680
Well,

383
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,680
she really gets it.

384
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
She's brilliant.

385
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,480
She's just a bit lazy with the working.

386
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,279
He goes,

387
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:49,680
all right,

388
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,180
but to be honest,

389
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,079
I think he's just crammed the formulas into his head.

390
00:17:52,079 --> 00:18:00,279
I don't know if he really understands whether this really nuanced focused learning and on the student side of things,

391
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,480
you'll have a a tutor for life.

392
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:10,779
The sort of thing that you will learn with and do your homework with at home in primary school will stay with you through high school through uni or a trade or whatever.

393
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:17,579
And all throughout your career when you then micro credentialing and and there's something else that you need to learn that you don't even know.

394
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:18,380
You don't know.

395
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,079
Yes,

396
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:25,079
it will be prompting you going with you should really upgrade your skills here and here and it will know how you best learn.

397
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:25,880
Are you visual?

398
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,680
Are you verbal?

399
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,480
Do you like short closed sentences?

400
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,980
Do you need to be told something 50 times before you get it?

401
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,880
Etc.

402
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,880
You'll have these things just walking you through life.

403
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:46,480
And the second big one that no one's talking about my is we must only be a couple of years away from a world without a language barrier.

404
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,279
They just think about that for a second.

405
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,380
But it's it's very soon.

406
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,880
I'm sure between you will just speak into the phone in English.

407
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,680
She will hear you in Icelandic.

408
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,279
She will speak in Icelandic and through the phone or your airpods or whatever.

409
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:04,480
You will hear her in near perfect English.

410
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,480
Imagine a world where our kids can't think of a place in the world.

411
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,779
They wouldn't visit because they wouldn't know what people were saying.

412
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:18,079
Imagine how much humanities been held back because just a language barrier makes someone seem like a natural enemy.

413
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:20,779
Or a weirdo or a wog or whatever.

414
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:27,480
Imagine if you could talk to or work with or whatever anyone in the world at any time.

415
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,480
Large language models are going to evolve quickly to the point where through portable devices in real time.

416
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,980
You'll just have and you can still go and study ancient Greek if you want.

417
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,579
Knock yourself out.

418
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:37,980
That's a great thing to do.

419
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,380
But you will be able to communicate with anyone on Earth.

420
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,880
We've never had a world like that before.

421
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,779
The amazing Adam.

422
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:47,579
I love where your mind goes to on that.

423
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:53,980
I was thinking of a day I had lucky enough to go over to the World Cup Soccer in Brazil doing breakfast radio.

424
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,480
And I had a full day in Chile as the flight connection came.

425
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:58,980
And I got out.

426
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,180
I'm not going to waste this day.

427
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,380
And so I hired a driver.

428
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,680
I'm going to make it a full myself.

429
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,779
I speak Spanish, don't I, in Chile?

430
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:08,680
Or they're speaking whatever it was.

431
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,279
Anyway, Google Translate out.

432
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:12,279
And so I had this driver.

433
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:16,579
And I swear to God, Adam, I said in Google, where can I get a good coffee?

434
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:17,480
It was the first thing I wanted.

435
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,980
I knew it would start the day with a coffee.

436
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,279
He took me to his brother's strip club, Adam.

437
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,680
So I said this to my wife.

438
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,680
And she said, sure, that's what you said to him.

439
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,880
So I'm not sure that was quite working.

440
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,680
But I'm with you.

441
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Imagine in real time being able to just converse.

442
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,980
And that's not far away.

443
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,180
Is that what you're saying?

444
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:36,680
Yeah, yeah.

445
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,980
I don't think so at all.

446
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,980
And I mean, there'll be an interesting gray area.

447
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:46,880
And in the early phases of these technologies, there will be funny and embarrassing.

448
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,579
And embarrassing mistakes and things like that.

449
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:55,279
And you won't instantly be able to argue the semantics of Shakespeare or something like that.

450
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:00,779
But sufficient to be able to say, where can I go and get a coffee and not get taken to a strip club?

451
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:02,480
Or to be able to work with people.

452
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:09,079
If you're in an organization that's got an international footprint and it's actually based in Japan,

453
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:13,779
you'll certainly be able to work with people to the point of, okay, I'll have the report for you by next Thursday.

454
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:15,279
Can you just give me those figures?

455
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,680
I'm pretty sure the March ones.

456
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,480
Are 30% under.

457
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,880
Can you check why there seems to be a gap there?

458
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,980
And you'll absolutely understand what everyone's saying.

459
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,079
And the big implication for people in Australia, for example.

460
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:31,779
I'm sure a lot of people listening have been on that call where there's someone in New York,

461
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:34,180
someone in London and you or whatever.

462
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,380
And it's never the person in New York who says, don't worry, I'll get up at 3 a.m.

463
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,079
for the next call.

464
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:38,880
It's always the port.

465
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,579
We're in a really weird time zone.

466
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:44,180
That's only going to get more pronounced.

467
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,480
Our kids, if they work in an organization with an international footprint,

468
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:54,880
will be expected to be able to work with anyone in that organization anywhere around the world any time of day.

469
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,579
And certainly the sorry, I don't speak Dutch will just won't be an excuse anymore.

470
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:01,880
It's just going to be fascinating.

471
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,079
And you'll be able to at least in a basic way read,

472
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:12,980
you know, the famous novels of any culture that's ever existed.

473
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,980
You'll be able to share stories and tales.

474
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:22,380
You'll be able to understand just the beautiful idiosyncratic sayings that people have in different languages and things like that.

475
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,980
We've never lived in a world where everyone could speak to everyone.

476
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,779
I genuinely think it's coming.

477
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:33,980
And Adam glass half full, which you genuinely are as a person for the entrepreneur

478
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,279
or someone who wants to be ahead of the curve on AI.

479
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:41,880
What are some opportunities for those that are early adopters in this space?

480
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,380
Yeah, well, it's really it's really challenging because it's exploding so quickly

481
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,180
and it can seem like it it's just everywhere.

482
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:57,180
I think the challenge the key is the words you use there about early adoption in whatever way impacts your industry or your work.

483
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,680
You have to be open to trying to find out what that is.

484
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,480
Now, you've got to be careful.

485
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,079
Some of the people online who are talking a big game in this space.

486
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:08,680
If you look back through their social media history six months ago,

487
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,079
they were talking a big game about crypto and five years ago,

488
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,680
they were talking a big game about where you can get discount,

489
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,180
you know,

490
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,480
Viagra and stuff like that.

491
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,079
But others are genuinely informed.

492
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,180
So there's quite a few commentators on Twitter and things like that,

493
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,779
who are fellow who at the end of each week ago,

494
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:27,180
here's the 10 most amazing things I've seen this week.

495
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,079
This famous graphics things been updated now,

496
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:34,079
so you can do X Y Z keeping a pulse on a couple of those things is worthwhile.

497
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,380
If you're an older person in an organization and this really does,

498
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,980
it's just not your natural game.

499
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,480
What I think this changes,

500
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,680
that that traditional power pyramid where you all work to the boundary.

501
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,779
My dad worked literally the one job for 40 years and three days,

502
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:56,180
and he certainly came through a generation and I did to it.

503
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,980
Most of my mates.

504
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,779
I went to your high school with a working at least in the same industry.

505
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:02,079
Now as they do,

506
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:06,579
they might have changed once and then you get to a place and you stay there.

507
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:07,680
And the longer you've been there,

508
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,880
the older you get the gray,

509
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,279
you get the bigger your business card gets the smarter you get you get the really nice office on.

510
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:15,180
The corner.

511
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,779
And then all the kids come around and they just they drink from the chocolate fountain.

512
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:20,079
That is your wisdom.

513
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:25,980
And there's still a role for corporate memory and a bit of wisdom and straightwise and that sort of stuff.

514
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:31,180
But that parent pyramids been inverted or smashed open now by these sort of technologies.

515
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:35,680
When you feel 64 and a half and you're looking at retirement at the end of this year,

516
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,480
you can probably bullshit your way through a lot.

517
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,380
But if you're 35 to 50,

518
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,180
and these technologies don't come naturally to you,

519
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:48,980
but you've still got 10 20 30 years in the workforce.

520
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:54,880
You've got to keep abreast of it surround yourself with the younger people in your organization

521
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,480
because they're the ones for whom this is far more likely to be natural.

522
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,380
If I was a manager in a medium-sized organization,

523
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:06,480
I'd be reaching out to the four or five younger geekier punks who seem to get this

524
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,880
and I'd be saying okay every Thursday 9 to 9 30.

525
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,079
You're coming in you're pitching to me and the other three leaders of the group here.

526
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,180
Just tell us two or three.

527
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,880
Cool things you found.

528
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:21,380
And the other important thing is with so much amazing shiny stuff out there.

529
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,380
Don't make the mistake of seeing some incredible piece of AI going.

530
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:30,880
Wow, my mate who works in financial services uses this.

531
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,880
We've got to use it in my graphic design organization.

532
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,480
No, no, no start by looking at your organization

533
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,579
and ask what's not working here.

534
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:42,480
What are the pain points? What are the opportunities?

535
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,579
What are the challenges?

536
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,880
How can I help us with that?

537
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,079
So start looking in and then look out for the solution.

538
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:52,779
Don't look out into this sea of solutions.

539
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:53,579
Some of which are brilliant.

540
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:59,180
Some of which are dubious and then try and you know shoehorned into your organization.

541
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,180
If it's not really solving a problem in the first place.

542
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,779
So at the other end of the scale and you have Elon Musk and I'll misquote him

543
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:13,980
but along the lines of if we don't have an off switch for artificial intelligence humans have the potential.

544
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,880
To be reduced to the status of a domestic cat.

545
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,480
Should we have some fear in the in the mix as well?

546
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,480
Or is that a wild statement?

547
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:31,680
Looking he's not one to trade on the slightly more nuanced side of a tweet all day long,

548
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:39,680
but he is absolutely onto something the speed at which this accelerated from 3.5 to 4 really caught people by surprise.

549
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:41,880
We can.

550
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:49,480
We can take comfort in the fact that some very smart people are thinking very hard about this

551
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,480
and certainly have flagged it as a bit of an issue.

552
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:59,180
But some of the challenges some of the major challenges around when content is out there.

553
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:07,680
Is it possible to even label it in a way where you can tell if it's AI generated or natural things like watermarking and things like that.

554
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,480
They seem to be actually quite challenging technical problems.

555
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,880
Early on there's the risk of scams.

556
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:22,380
There's the risk of eventually an artificial general intelligence going wild like a Will Smith movie or whatever,

557
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,380
but they're all you know in the future and reasonably hypothetical.

558
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:34,180
But I think at the moment the biggest one of all of them is just the risk of disinformation misinformation people generating stuff.

559
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:41,279
That simply isn't true to try and win a political argument or destabilize a situation deep fake videos.

560
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:48,180
Things like that of all the stuff going down or to be going down in the near future.

561
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:57,180
For me next year's US presidential election is just going to be a misinformation disinformation hit show.

562
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,279
It's you've got you've got the perfect storm.

563
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:06,180
You've got two warring parties many of whom are deeply deeply connected to their own base.

564
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:10,680
They they're naturally easily led and by they want to believe certain things.

565
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,579
They've probably don't have the objectivity dialed up as much as it should be.

566
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:19,180
You've got a new technology that can generate fakes and things like that,

567
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,880
that they haven't really had to test their objective minds with yet.

568
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,680
And you've got the biggest prize in the world up for grabs.

569
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:33,180
Probably be faced off again by two really polarizing figures outside of their own parties.

570
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,680
And it won't be Luke. It won't be like I've said this to someone the other day.

571
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,180
It won't be a video of Joe Biden going.

572
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,180
Well, I'm Joe Biden.

573
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,579
I really like having sex with farm animals or anything like that.

574
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:51,380
But it'll be Joe Biden looking straight down the camera and saying a thousand percent convincingly.

575
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:56,880
Obviously, as we transition to a green economy, there's going to be some pain in traditional coal mining states.

576
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,980
But these are our brothers and sisters.

577
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:04,279
They are our fellow Americans. We'll put our hand out and we will walk with them.

578
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:09,180
And ninety nine percent of American voters will never see that deep fake attack ad. Right.

579
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:16,180
But if you live in one of four swing states and your social media suggests you've never really bought the whole climate change thing,

580
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:21,180
you will be belted, belted with that little bit of misinformation.

581
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,180
And when I guarantee you at the end of next year's president, whoever wins,

582
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:31,180
the other side will just bring forward hundreds of examples of bogus ads and deep fake videos and all that going.

583
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,180
You guys lied and cheated. We just refused to accept the result.

584
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:38,180
Whoever won will then produce twice as many deep fake videos.

585
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:42,180
But the losers produced. Neither side is going to accept the result.

586
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:50,180
And that one really worries me because we're nowhere near mature yet at looking at stuff and thinking.

587
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:56,180
That looks a bit dodgy. I might go and see if there's a second or third source to correct that.

588
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,180
You see it on Twitter. It's true.

589
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:04,180
And you get angry or you get excited. But the disinformation piece really concerns me.

590
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,180
Given that both parties haven't agreed on the last election,

591
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,180
Adam, as we head into this election, your point...

592
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:16,180
At the moment, Ron DeSantis, who's trying to stop Trump get the nomination for the Republicans,

593
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:23,180
he released an ad where he was saying that he thought Trump was too soft on Fauci.

594
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,180
Trump should have just sacked Fauci early on, is Ron DeSantis' position.

595
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:33,180
So there's all these images on the ad of Trump in press conferences and cozying up to Fauci.

596
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,180
It's my understanding that there's one screenshot of that where of the six images,

597
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:40,180
three of them are deepfake video that never happened.

598
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:45,180
It's 18 months out from the election and these two guys are on the same side.

599
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,180
And they're running disinformation against each other.

600
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,180
When it becomes Trump v Biden or whomever it is,

601
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:56,180
you won't be able to believe what you read and see on social media for six months there in the States.

602
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:00,180
Mining for truth is going to be an industry itself, isn't it?

603
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:04,180
How do you actually even get to agree on facts before you can have a debate?

604
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,180
That's already happening, isn't it?

605
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,180
And for a generation of us, it's hard.

606
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:16,180
For kids coming through, education has to realise these large language models are here.

607
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,180
We can't just ban them.

608
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,180
We have to respond and use them creatively.

609
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:25,180
But a portion of that has to be kids being told get your chat or whatever to write you an essay

610
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,180
and then market yourself.

611
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:31,180
Go and look at other independent sources and work out did it get anything wrong?

612
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,180
That critical thinking, that check a second source,

613
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,180
does that really sound right?

614
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,180
That sounds like a pretty amazing claim.

615
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,180
Let's see if there's any more evidence for it.

616
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,180
It's going to be more important now than it's ever been.

617
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,180
I want to ask you about cyber security,

618
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,180
another industry that's just come an enormous way.

619
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,180
I remember the emails you'd get from a Nigerian Prince Adam saying,

620
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,180
I'll guarantee a million dollars.

621
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,180
Just hand over your bank account details.

622
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:02,180
But now it feels like every day we're all getting bombarded with really sophisticated,

623
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,180
smart potential hacks.

624
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:07,180
What do you think is the cyber security industry?

625
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:15,180
Oh, so one stat that Telstra alone blocks something like 300 million dodgy SMSs

626
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,180
and 400 million dodgy emails in Australia every year.

627
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,180
That blocks them even getting through, right?

628
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,180
Add all the other carriers, add the other ones.

629
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:31,180
There are billions of attempts just raining in on the firewall of Australian consumers every day.

630
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,180
You talk to people who work in the big tech spaces.

631
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,180
Our national infrastructure, banks.

632
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:40,180
You saw some of those places that got hacked and data breached last year,

633
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:44,180
just under constant attack.

634
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,180
Excuse me.

635
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:48,180
Some of it by 16-year-old kids in their basement,

636
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,180
but some of it by professional crime gangs,

637
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,180
some of it and a lot of it by state actors.

638
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,180
There are several countries in the world,

639
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,180
and you can probably name most of them,

640
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,180
who just make a profession of this sort of stuff.

641
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,180
And it's become a genuine weapon.

642
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:07,180
There was a chart I saw that when the Russia-Ukraine crisis

643
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:10,180
looked like it was getting very serious,

644
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,180
and they sat down at this negotiating table

645
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,180
to try and find a way out of war.

646
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,180
Ended up not working.

647
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,180
But on the same day,

648
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,180
like at the same time as they're sitting at the table going,

649
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,180
is there anything we can do about this?

650
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:29,180
Russia commenced a gigantic cyber bombardment of Ukraine,

651
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,180
of critical infrastructure,

652
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,180
of banking and finance, of health systems and the like.

653
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,180
So it's become, even between nation states,

654
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,180
an accepted weapon of war.

655
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,180
So it's bigger than it's ever been.

656
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,180
It's more believable.

657
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:48,180
Something like 95% to 98% of all ransomware attacks

658
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:53,180
involve a moment of easily avoidable human error.

659
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,180
So these things do what's called social engineering.

660
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,180
They just encourage you to do something you wouldn't normally do.

661
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,180
Click on a link.

662
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,180
Click on a link or provide a password.

663
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:07,180
And they're getting more and more well put together,

664
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,179
lacking the spelling mistakes.

665
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:13,179
The email looks far more legitimate.

666
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,179
They will trace your other social media

667
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,179
so they'll know what the particular hack is for you.

668
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:19,179
They'll know the sort of advertisement

669
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:21,179
that's more likely to get you to click.

670
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,179
People are going to have to be more and more worried

671
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:24,179
about this sort of stuff,

672
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:26,179
both organisations and individuals,

673
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:29,179
because it's not a problem that's going away anytime soon.

674
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:30,179
It's that traditional arms race.

675
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,179
We're getting better things to defend it with,

676
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,179
but we have to because the attack vectors

677
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:37,179
are getting nastier and more informed all the time.

678
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:40,179
You'd like to think you've got a decent radar yourself,

679
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,179
but you're right.

680
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,179
When a text comes through on your NAB banking feed

681
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:47,179
that's the same line and it's asking you to do something

682
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:49,179
and you're busy and you think,

683
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:51,179
I'll just click on that link.

684
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,179
The thing called spoofing,

685
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:54,179
where they can hijack a phone number

686
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,179
and so it is the same phone number

687
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:59,179
that in the past CBA have sent you an account update

688
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:01,179
or put in this six digit number.

689
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:02,179
Now it's not,

690
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:04,179
but they've managed to fake that it is.

691
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:05,179
You've got to be,

692
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:06,179
it's called zero trust.

693
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:08,179
You've got to have a zero trust mentality

694
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:09,179
unfortunately at the moment

695
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:12,179
and you're better off within your organisation

696
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:15,179
than ringing that person from finance

697
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,179
or popping up to their office and saying,

698
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:18,179
just checking,

699
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:20,179
this was you who asked me to park a million bucks

700
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:22,179
in an account we don't normally put it into.

701
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:23,179
Yeah?

702
00:35:23,179 --> 00:35:25,179
And run the risk of the girl from finance going,

703
00:35:25,179 --> 00:35:26,179
I'm really busy.

704
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:27,179
Yes, it is.

705
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:28,179
An irritating horse.

706
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:29,179
An irritating horse slightly

707
00:35:29,179 --> 00:35:31,179
rather than sliding something across.

708
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:34,179
There was an example last year.

709
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:39,179
A Guardian journalist took an AI voice synthesiser

710
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,179
and she didn't even talk into it directly.

711
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:43,179
She just gave it access to a couple of blogs

712
00:35:43,179 --> 00:35:45,179
and a couple of interviews she'd done.

713
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:47,179
That voice synthesiser faked its way

714
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:50,179
into her Centrelink account.

715
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:53,179
Voice was meant to be your fingerprint.

716
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:55,179
No, not anymore, baby.

717
00:35:55,179 --> 00:35:57,179
That is extraordinary, isn't it?

718
00:35:57,179 --> 00:35:59,179
Changing gear, Adam introduced you

719
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:02,179
as the world debating champion in 1996

720
00:36:02,179 --> 00:36:04,179
and you've got a whole range of other credits

721
00:36:04,179 --> 00:36:05,179
in that space.

722
00:36:05,179 --> 00:36:08,179
I've seen you share the stage with Hollywood A-listers,

723
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:10,179
John Travolta and captains of industry

724
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:13,179
and CEOs and internationally renowned astrophysicists.

725
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:16,179
But I generally think the hardest thing

726
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:18,179
you have ever had to do is

727
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:21,179
emcee the Sydney Swans post-grand final

728
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:26,179
after their loss, 81 points to Geelong in 2022.

729
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:27,179
And for a bit of context,

730
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:28,179
those that don't know Adam Spencer,

731
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:31,179
he's wearing a Sydney Swans beanie as we see.

732
00:36:31,179 --> 00:36:33,179
He's a former number one ticket holder.

733
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:36,179
No one loves the Sydney Swans more than Adam Spencer

734
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:37,179
and their post-game function,

735
00:36:37,179 --> 00:36:39,179
you've got the players, you've got the coaches,

736
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:41,179
you've got the families of the players,

737
00:36:41,179 --> 00:36:44,179
you've got the most emotional room

738
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:46,179
you could possibly imagine.

739
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:48,179
Now, this is something I want to play

740
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:50,179
because the genius of Adam's words

741
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:53,179
and the way he was able to find the right tone,

742
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:55,179
it only goes for a couple of minutes,

743
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,179
but I need to play it back

744
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:58,179
because I want to talk to you about it, Adam.

745
00:36:58,179 --> 00:37:01,179
You hit a note that very few could

746
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:03,179
and I reckon one of the hardest times.

747
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,179
Have a listen to this.

748
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:07,179
Ladies and gentlemen, as Andrew said,

749
00:37:07,179 --> 00:37:09,179
today was tough.

750
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:12,179
But it is important to note that if anyone in this room

751
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:14,179
thinks they're hurting any more than any of the players

752
00:37:14,179 --> 00:37:15,179
or the coaches at the moment,

753
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:18,179
you are kidding yourselves.

754
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:20,179
But as we sit here, I just want you to take a moment

755
00:37:20,179 --> 00:37:22,179
and put all of this in perspective.

756
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:24,179
Because if you told me six months ago,

757
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:27,179
at the start of this season,

758
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:29,179
that in the week leading up to the grand final,

759
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:31,179
we'd be universally agreed to be

760
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:33,179
one of the best two teams in the AFL,

761
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:36,179
I would have broken your hand shaking on that deal.

762
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:39,179
If you told me in 1982

763
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:41,179
that we would celebrate the 40th year

764
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:43,179
of the Swans in Sydney

765
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:46,179
as the nation's most supported

766
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:48,179
sporting club of any code,

767
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:50,179
if you told me in 1993

768
00:37:50,179 --> 00:37:53,179
in the middle of a 26-game losing streak

769
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:55,179
that we were only a couple of years away

770
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:57,179
from a grand final appearance,

771
00:37:57,179 --> 00:38:00,179
and a period of finals and grand finals appearances

772
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:04,179
that would be the envy of any club in the competition,

773
00:38:04,179 --> 00:38:08,179
if you told me the day the momentous deal was signed

774
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:10,179
that nine years later

775
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:13,179
I'd be standing with a childhood friend on the SCG

776
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:15,179
in 2022

777
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:18,179
celebrating with 30,000 fans

778
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:20,179
during a game

779
00:38:20,179 --> 00:38:23,179
while Dane Rampey had a picnic nearby,

780
00:38:23,179 --> 00:38:25,179
I don't think I would have believed

781
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:26,179
any of that.

782
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,179
And while today hurt,

783
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:29,179
it really hurt,

784
00:38:29,179 --> 00:38:30,179
I know one thing,

785
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:32,179
that I'm not going to let the triumphs

786
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:34,179
of the last 40 years,

787
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:36,179
the last 20 years,

788
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:38,179
the last decade

789
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:40,179
and of season 2022

790
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:42,179
be stolen away from me

791
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:45,179
by two cruel hours this afternoon.

792
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:48,179
Tonight, it is our job

793
00:38:48,179 --> 00:38:51,179
as lovers of this great football club

794
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:53,179
to pay our dues.

795
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:55,179
Because if we rejoice in the victory,

796
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:57,179
if we celebrate in the highs,

797
00:38:57,179 --> 00:38:58,179
if like me,

798
00:38:58,179 --> 00:39:00,179
you let a win on Friday night

799
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:02,179
put a spring in your step

800
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:04,179
for the rest of the week,

801
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:05,179
then tonight,

802
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:08,179
we put our arms around the ones we love.

803
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,179
We take our pain,

804
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:11,179
we put it aside,

805
00:39:11,179 --> 00:39:13,179
and we make it known to these boys

806
00:39:13,179 --> 00:39:15,179
how much we love them,

807
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:18,179
how much we are in awe of them,

808
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:21,179
and how proud we all are to say

809
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:23,179
that we are supporters

810
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:24,179
of the 2022

811
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:26,179
AFL Runners-Up,

812
00:39:26,179 --> 00:39:28,179
the Sydney Swans.

813
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:30,179
Adam, that is a gift.

814
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:31,179
Do you see your ability

815
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:32,179
to find the right words

816
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:33,179
at the right time

817
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:35,179
as something profound?

818
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:36,179
Because you generally do it better

819
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:38,179
than most I've ever heard.

820
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:39,179
Oh, thank you, mate.

821
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:40,179
I remember that night clearly.

822
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:41,179
It was, you know,

823
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:42,179
obviously a horrible night.

824
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,179
Some people would think,

825
00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:45,179
why would you have the party?

826
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:46,179
But think about it,

827
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:48,179
you can't at 5.30

828
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:49,179
when you realise you've won

829
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:50,179
the grand final go,

830
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,179
okay, let's organise

831
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:52,179
a celebratory dinner

832
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:53,179
for 1,200 people

833
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:55,179
to start 90 minutes from now.

834
00:39:55,179 --> 00:39:57,179
So this is all booked in in advance.

835
00:39:57,179 --> 00:39:59,179
And it's the great gamble you take

836
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:01,179
as an MC agreeing in advance

837
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:02,179
to do this.

838
00:40:02,179 --> 00:40:04,179
And I've done it more than once.

839
00:40:04,179 --> 00:40:05,179
And I have done one winning time.

840
00:40:05,179 --> 00:40:07,179
I did the mighty 2012 grand final

841
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:10,179
after the Swans dealt with the Hawks.

842
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:12,179
But I've done more than one

843
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:13,179
where we haven't come out

844
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:14,179
on the right side.

845
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:16,179
And there's,

846
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:18,179
yeah, it's immensely sad

847
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:19,179
and downbeat.

848
00:40:19,179 --> 00:40:20,179
And we were even,

849
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:22,179
when I was in the room

850
00:40:22,179 --> 00:40:24,179
minutes before the players arriving,

851
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:25,179
it still wasn't confirmed

852
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:27,179
who was going to speak,

853
00:40:27,179 --> 00:40:28,179
how it was going to go.

854
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:31,179
I'd been told to keep my bit really short

855
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,179
and just get out of it

856
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:35,179
and not even do anything like that.

857
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:36,179
And it was during

858
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:38,179
one of the other speeches beforehand,

859
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:43,179
which was understandably very downbeat,

860
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:46,179
but was really downbeat

861
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:48,179
in a room of 1,200 people

862
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,179
who were then going to sit around

863
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:51,179
feeling pretty glum about themselves.

864
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:53,179
And it just came to me

865
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:57,179
that obviously that really hurt.

866
00:40:57,179 --> 00:40:58,179
But two things.

867
00:40:58,179 --> 00:40:59,179
One, if you think you're hurting more

868
00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:00,179
than any of the players,

869
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:02,179
you're fooling yourself.

870
00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:05,179
And two, why did it hurt?

871
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:07,179
It hurt because we love these guys so much.

872
00:41:07,179 --> 00:41:08,179
And it hurt because we know

873
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:12,179
how much happiness they can also bring us.

874
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:14,179
And so if you're going to take the happiness

875
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:15,179
and if you're going to walk around on clouds

876
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:18,179
for a week when you win and all that,

877
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:20,179
then you have to accept sometimes

878
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:21,179
you're going to take the biggest bumps of all.

879
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:22,179
And it did.

880
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,179
It wasn't like we all then just went off

881
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:26,179
and partied like nothing had happened.

882
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:28,179
But I do think it probably managed

883
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:31,179
to put a bit of a more positive spin on the night.

884
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:33,179
But what meant a lot more to me was

885
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:37,179
I know having spoken to some of the players since,

886
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:39,179
those who were able to focus

887
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:41,179
and listen on what I was saying,

888
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:45,179
it did mean something to them.

889
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:47,179
It did come across as genuine.

890
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:49,179
It put in some small way

891
00:41:49,179 --> 00:41:51,179
how bad they were feeling

892
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:53,179
in a slightly more positive perspective.

893
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:55,179
And that was the most important part, I think.

894
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,179
I had the past players hat on there, Adam,

895
00:41:57,179 --> 00:42:00,179
and I always just imagined being in that room

896
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:03,179
and thinking that's what you want someone to say.

897
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:06,179
And so for you to be able to do that in real time,

898
00:42:06,179 --> 00:42:07,179
you can't prepare that speech.

899
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:10,179
That one comes post the result.

900
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:13,179
And so I just think it's brilliant

901
00:42:13,179 --> 00:42:15,179
that you're able to capture that

902
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:16,179
in the moments that you have.

903
00:42:16,179 --> 00:42:18,179
Has there ever been someone that's intimidated you?

904
00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:21,179
Have you ever sat down on a stage and thought,

905
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:24,179
wow, this person's thinking in a way

906
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:25,179
that I'm in trouble here?

907
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:26,179
Has that ever happened to you?

908
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:29,179
Oh, that can happen reasonably regularly.

909
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:34,179
But I'm lucky in that the role I'm normally playing

910
00:42:34,179 --> 00:42:38,179
is not that the audience are also just as expert

911
00:42:38,179 --> 00:42:40,179
and I'm the one who's out of my depth.

912
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:45,179
I'm normally trying to tell that person's story

913
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:47,179
to an audience of lay people

914
00:42:47,179 --> 00:42:49,179
where I'm quite possibly the person

915
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:52,179
who understands this subject matter or story

916
00:42:52,179 --> 00:42:55,179
second best in the entire room anyway.

917
00:42:55,179 --> 00:43:02,179
If I had to interview a world-class astrophysicist

918
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:06,179
at a world astrophysics convention

919
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:08,179
about their latest research,

920
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:10,179
I'm in all sorts of trouble

921
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:12,179
because I'm the dumbest guy in the room

922
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:14,179
by a long, long way.

923
00:43:14,179 --> 00:43:17,179
But if I'm interviewing a world-class astrophysicist,

924
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:20,179
in a room of people,

925
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:23,179
practically none of whom are world-class astrophysicists,

926
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:26,179
then as long as I listen,

927
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:29,179
anything I don't understand

928
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:31,179
is probably something that most of the room

929
00:43:31,179 --> 00:43:32,179
don't understand.

930
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:34,179
If I've done my basic homework,

931
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:36,179
where I'm lucky, I think,

932
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:40,179
is the questions that naturally pop into my mind

933
00:43:40,179 --> 00:43:42,179
tend to be the sort of questions

934
00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:44,179
that the average person in the room

935
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:46,179
would quite like the answer to.

936
00:43:46,179 --> 00:43:48,179
One of the skills sometimes,

937
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:51,179
if it's an area you know a little bit more about

938
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:53,179
than the average person,

939
00:43:53,179 --> 00:43:58,179
sometimes the skill is to put your whatever away

940
00:43:58,179 --> 00:44:00,179
and not try and show,

941
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,179
I'm pretty much as smart as this guy

942
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:04,179
because one, you're not,

943
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:07,179
and two, that's not the purpose of this exercise.

944
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:10,179
It's to take people with you on the journey.

945
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:15,179
A mate of mine was recently on a podcast in the States

946
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:16,179
with a gentleman,

947
00:44:16,179 --> 00:44:18,179
a gentleman called Preet Bharara.

948
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:21,179
Preet was a former New York Attorney General

949
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:24,179
and he's now got this politics and podcast.

950
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:26,179
He interviewed an old uni mate of mine

951
00:44:26,179 --> 00:44:27,179
about the American,

952
00:44:27,179 --> 00:44:28,179
Aussie guy,

953
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:30,179
but a world-class economist

954
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:32,179
about America pushing towards the debt ceiling

955
00:44:32,179 --> 00:44:34,179
and whether that was going to blow their budget

956
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:35,179
and all this sort of stuff.

957
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:37,179
And I got in contact with my mate afterwards

958
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:40,179
and said that sounded fantastic.

959
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:43,179
And gee, Preet was good at asking questions

960
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:45,179
but gave the impression

961
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:47,179
that he had absolutely no idea what you were talking about

962
00:44:47,179 --> 00:44:49,179
and needed it explained to him.

963
00:44:49,179 --> 00:44:52,179
But I'm pretty confident Preet knew a lot more than he let on.

964
00:44:52,179 --> 00:44:54,179
And my mate said, yeah, absolutely he did.

965
00:44:54,179 --> 00:44:58,179
But he asked perfect questions on behalf of the average listener

966
00:44:58,179 --> 00:45:00,179
who doesn't know much about the debt ceiling

967
00:45:00,179 --> 00:45:02,179
and can you bail people out with super bombs

968
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:03,179
and things like that.

969
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:09,179
So sometimes there's a bit of just not really feeling

970
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:13,179
you could keep up with how the interview subject's mind works

971
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:15,179
isn't necessarily the problem.

972
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:18,179
Bigger issue is if they just don't want to be there.

973
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:20,179
And you used to get that more,

974
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:23,179
you had a handful of interviews back in the old Triple J radio days

975
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:25,179
and all that where halfway through you're thinking,

976
00:45:25,179 --> 00:45:28,179
well mate, I don't particularly want to talk to you either

977
00:45:28,179 --> 00:45:29,179
if you don't want to be here.

978
00:45:29,179 --> 00:45:31,179
I don't understand why either of us.

979
00:45:31,179 --> 00:45:34,179
I did have one train wreck interview with Macy Gray,

980
00:45:34,179 --> 00:45:36,179
the soul singer,

981
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:40,179
where I'd done breakfast that day.

982
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:42,179
They were in town

983
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:44,179
and they were going to perform for us in the afternoon.

984
00:45:44,179 --> 00:45:47,179
So I'd come back in to interview her

985
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:50,179
and she came in and sat down at the microphone

986
00:45:50,179 --> 00:45:53,179
and they got her to do a quick sound check

987
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:57,179
and she went, you know, one, two, three, one, two, three,

988
00:45:57,179 --> 00:45:59,179
one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, five.

989
00:45:59,179 --> 00:46:01,179
And I just said, you're awesome at counting.

990
00:46:01,179 --> 00:46:02,179
You're not just a great singer.

991
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:03,179
You're really good at counting.

992
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:04,179
She goes, counting's great.

993
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:05,179
I love counting.

994
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,179
And we just had this awesome chat.

995
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:07,179
It's wonderful.

996
00:46:07,179 --> 00:46:09,179
Jokes flying everywhere.

997
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:11,179
Then the interview's about to start

998
00:46:11,179 --> 00:46:14,179
and she insists on one of her bandmates coming and joining her.

999
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:15,179
You know, I didn't know who he was.

1000
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:16,179
He didn't want to...

1001
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:19,179
And it was just an absolute train wreck.

1002
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:21,179
And I remember just thinking during it,

1003
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:24,179
like, you clearly don't want to be doing this.

1004
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:25,179
That's fine.

1005
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:27,179
Don't put us both through it.

1006
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:28,179
But also, please don't turn up

1007
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:31,179
and just be unbelievably engaging and lovely

1008
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:33,179
and really funny and a bit of a smart-ass

1009
00:46:33,179 --> 00:46:36,179
in a great way for a few minutes beforehand

1010
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:38,179
to show me what you can do

1011
00:46:38,179 --> 00:46:41,179
before then going into rock star,

1012
00:46:41,179 --> 00:46:43,179
difficult-to-handle status.

1013
00:46:43,179 --> 00:46:44,179
Brilliant.

1014
00:46:44,179 --> 00:46:46,179
I had a second listen to your TED talk,

1015
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,179
which is brilliant.

1016
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,179
I encourage everyone to do it.

1017
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:50,179
And you quote Galileo in that,

1018
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:52,179
amongst other brilliance,

1019
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:55,179
that the universe is written in the mathematical language

1020
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,179
is one of the quotes that you use.

1021
00:46:57,179 --> 00:46:59,179
And I was reflecting on that

1022
00:46:59,179 --> 00:47:01,179
and given your knowledge and understanding of that,

1023
00:47:01,179 --> 00:47:04,179
how likely is it that there is other life

1024
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:06,179
on other planets in the universe?

1025
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:08,179
Can you put that into some context for us?

1026
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:10,179
It's a really good question, mate.

1027
00:47:10,179 --> 00:47:12,179
That there is other life in the universe,

1028
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:13,179
I think,

1029
00:47:13,179 --> 00:47:16,179
almost absolutely guaranteed.

1030
00:47:16,179 --> 00:47:19,179
You only have to look at how quickly

1031
00:47:19,179 --> 00:47:21,179
life arose on Earth

1032
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:25,179
once the conditions were possible for it to happen.

1033
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:29,179
But basic life doesn't seem to be

1034
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,179
that much of a ridiculous fluke

1035
00:47:31,179 --> 00:47:33,179
once you've got certain temperature

1036
00:47:33,179 --> 00:47:34,179
and a bit of liquid water

1037
00:47:34,179 --> 00:47:37,179
and certain elements in the atmosphere.

1038
00:47:37,179 --> 00:47:40,179
And those conditions of planets in that temperature zone

1039
00:47:40,179 --> 00:47:42,179
and what we can tell about their atmosphere

1040
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:45,179
and the distribution of elements throughout the universe,

1041
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:46,179
those sort of preconditions

1042
00:47:46,179 --> 00:47:48,179
should exist on a lot of planets.

1043
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:50,179
I think there's been countless times

1044
00:47:50,179 --> 00:47:52,179
in the life of the universe so far

1045
00:47:52,179 --> 00:47:56,179
where you've got some basic microbial life.

1046
00:47:56,179 --> 00:47:57,179
But the interesting thing was

1047
00:47:57,179 --> 00:48:00,179
that on Earth we had that microbial life.

1048
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:01,179
Now the Earth's,

1049
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:04,179
let's say the Earth's four billion years old

1050
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:06,179
and within a couple of hundred million years

1051
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:07,179
you look like you're starting

1052
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:09,179
to get the beginning of something.

1053
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:11,179
But that lasts for billions and billions of years.

1054
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:15,179
Before it then becomes

1055
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:18,179
what you might think of as interesting.

1056
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:20,179
So it seems as though

1057
00:48:20,179 --> 00:48:23,179
the really basic microbial stuff

1058
00:48:23,179 --> 00:48:28,179
that seems to happen fairly readily.

1059
00:48:28,179 --> 00:48:31,179
But even if you found a universe,

1060
00:48:31,179 --> 00:48:32,179
a planet in the universe

1061
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:34,179
where there were trees

1062
00:48:34,179 --> 00:48:37,179
and evolution had got as far as say

1063
00:48:37,179 --> 00:48:39,179
the equivalent of fish,

1064
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:41,179
that would be mind-blowing.

1065
00:48:41,179 --> 00:48:44,179
But places in the universe

1066
00:48:44,179 --> 00:48:46,179
where there are other beings

1067
00:48:46,179 --> 00:48:50,179
sitting around asking each other,

1068
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:53,179
do you think in the vast expanses of this universe

1069
00:48:53,179 --> 00:48:54,179
there are other people out there

1070
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:55,179
who could think the sort of things

1071
00:48:55,179 --> 00:48:56,179
that we're thinking?

1072
00:48:56,179 --> 00:48:59,179
That's a completely different ball game.

1073
00:48:59,179 --> 00:49:02,179
And the unfortunate thing there is that

1074
00:49:02,179 --> 00:49:06,179
however likely it is that that exists,

1075
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:08,179
I think it's massively more likely

1076
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:10,179
that we'll never encounter it.

1077
00:49:11,179 --> 00:49:16,179
Because the universe is just too big, too far.

1078
00:49:16,179 --> 00:49:18,179
The sort of distances you'd need

1079
00:49:18,179 --> 00:49:21,179
to get to anywhere else

1080
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:23,179
are so far to traverse,

1081
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:24,179
there's not much incentive

1082
00:49:24,179 --> 00:49:26,179
to try and do it in a bizarre way.

1083
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:28,179
I think it's conceivable

1084
00:49:28,179 --> 00:49:29,179
that your SETI,

1085
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:31,179
search for intelligence,

1086
00:49:31,179 --> 00:49:33,179
will one day hear something

1087
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:35,179
that suggests

1088
00:49:35,179 --> 00:49:37,179
there's communication going on there

1089
00:49:37,179 --> 00:49:39,179
and we could even communicate that.

1090
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:40,179
We might one day,

1091
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:42,179
with incredibly precise instruments,

1092
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:45,179
scan you and see a planet

1093
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:47,179
and see what's happening in that atmosphere

1094
00:49:47,179 --> 00:49:49,179
and go, wow, that sort of stuff,

1095
00:49:49,179 --> 00:49:51,179
those elements don't occur naturally.

1096
00:49:51,179 --> 00:49:54,179
They only occur when you burn certain things or whatever.

1097
00:49:54,179 --> 00:49:57,179
Wow, there must be some sort of industrial problem.

1098
00:49:57,179 --> 00:50:00,179
There could really be something smartish out there.

1099
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:02,179
But whether we'll actually ever

1100
00:50:02,179 --> 00:50:05,179
have the aliens on a slab

1101
00:50:05,179 --> 00:50:07,179
with the US government operating on them

1102
00:50:07,179 --> 00:50:08,179
and keeping it all secret

1103
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:10,179
because the UFOs have crashed on Earth,

1104
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:15,179
that's such a massive step beyond

1105
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,179
do those things exist

1106
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:18,179
and even could we ever have

1107
00:50:18,179 --> 00:50:20,179
basic communication with them,

1108
00:50:20,179 --> 00:50:21,179
that the odds start getting,

1109
00:50:21,179 --> 00:50:23,179
unfortunately, witheringly small.

1110
00:50:23,179 --> 00:50:24,179
But I think within our lifetime,

1111
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:27,179
we will detect some sort of life,

1112
00:50:27,179 --> 00:50:28,179
quite possibly,

1113
00:50:28,179 --> 00:50:30,179
within even our own solar system.

1114
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:31,179
Underwater lakes

1115
00:50:31,179 --> 00:50:33,179
or under methane lakes

1116
00:50:33,179 --> 00:50:36,179
on some of the moons in our solar system,

1117
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:39,179
we could well find something really basic there.

1118
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:42,179
And what would be super, super exciting would be

1119
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:44,179
if there was a degree of similarity

1120
00:50:44,179 --> 00:50:45,179
between those things.

1121
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:47,179
Now, one of the questions people ask is,

1122
00:50:47,179 --> 00:50:48,179
if we did find life elsewhere,

1123
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:51,179
how much does it have to be like us?

1124
00:50:51,179 --> 00:50:53,179
And some people think, to be honest,

1125
00:50:53,179 --> 00:50:57,179
if you look at the way that animal life developed

1126
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,179
on lots of different continents

1127
00:50:58,179 --> 00:50:59,179
that were completely separate,

1128
00:50:59,179 --> 00:51:02,179
a lot of the animals came out looking very, very similar.

1129
00:51:02,179 --> 00:51:05,179
That's like running lots of experiments at the same time.

1130
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:07,179
You may well get things,

1131
00:51:07,179 --> 00:51:08,179
it may well be quite natural

1132
00:51:08,179 --> 00:51:11,179
for advanced life to have arms and legs

1133
00:51:11,179 --> 00:51:12,179
so it can move around.

1134
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:14,179
It probably has things

1135
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:17,179
so it can interpret things visually.

1136
00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:19,179
Once you start getting into those specs,

1137
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:22,179
I don't really care if the alien's got six arms

1138
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:26,179
or is shorter and fatter or whatever,

1139
00:51:26,179 --> 00:51:28,179
but it's quite possible other life forms

1140
00:51:28,179 --> 00:51:32,179
are not incredibly dissimilar to what we've got here.

1141
00:51:32,179 --> 00:51:34,179
But whether we ever meet them

1142
00:51:34,179 --> 00:51:35,179
is another thing altogether.

1143
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:36,179
But somewhere in the universe,

1144
00:51:36,179 --> 00:51:38,179
if we find on another planet somewhere,

1145
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:41,179
some really basic microbes or bacteria or whatever,

1146
00:51:41,179 --> 00:51:43,179
and lots of that DNA is similar

1147
00:51:43,179 --> 00:51:45,179
to what we've got here on Earth

1148
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:46,179
and in species here on Earth,

1149
00:51:46,179 --> 00:51:48,179
that's really interesting

1150
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:50,179
what it says about the commonality of life.

1151
00:51:50,179 --> 00:51:51,179
If it's a completely different form,

1152
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:52,179
it's really interesting again.

1153
00:51:52,179 --> 00:51:53,179
I think we could,

1154
00:51:53,179 --> 00:51:54,179
fingers crossed,

1155
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:55,179
we could well find something like that

1156
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:57,179
in our solar system,

1157
00:51:57,179 --> 00:51:59,179
but we're far more likely to find

1158
00:51:59,179 --> 00:52:00,179
what most people are just going,

1159
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:01,179
oh yeah, come on,

1160
00:52:01,179 --> 00:52:03,179
you're calling that life,

1161
00:52:03,179 --> 00:52:05,179
in our own backyard

1162
00:52:05,179 --> 00:52:07,179
than advanced life anywhere else

1163
00:52:07,179 --> 00:52:09,179
in the infinity of space.

1164
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:10,179
As always,

1165
00:52:10,179 --> 00:52:13,179
I love your answer to a question.

1166
00:52:13,179 --> 00:52:14,179
You frame it in a way

1167
00:52:14,179 --> 00:52:17,179
that has me engaged every single time.

1168
00:52:17,179 --> 00:52:19,179
Passionate about leadership

1169
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:20,179
and what it looks like, Adam,

1170
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:21,179
in different settings.

1171
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:23,179
And I've had great pleasure on this space

1172
00:52:23,179 --> 00:52:26,179
of talking to people from the world of arts

1173
00:52:26,179 --> 00:52:27,179
or sport or from industry

1174
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:29,179
and a range of different people.

1175
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:30,179
And yours is such a unique story, Adam.

1176
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:31,179
I love it.

1177
00:52:31,179 --> 00:52:32,179
I'm going to call you a math genius

1178
00:52:32,179 --> 00:52:34,179
because you are in this conversation

1179
00:52:34,179 --> 00:52:36,179
and you're one of the most articulate people,

1180
00:52:36,179 --> 00:52:38,179
but your brain works in a unique way.

1181
00:52:38,179 --> 00:52:39,179
So I'm fascinated to ask

1182
00:52:39,179 --> 00:52:41,179
these set of questions to you.

1183
00:52:41,179 --> 00:52:43,179
The idea of self-leadership for me, Adam,

1184
00:52:43,179 --> 00:52:44,179
is something we're a bit obsessed with.

1185
00:52:44,179 --> 00:52:45,179
It's hard to have an impact

1186
00:52:45,179 --> 00:52:46,179
on someone else as a leader

1187
00:52:46,179 --> 00:52:47,179
or in any space

1188
00:52:47,179 --> 00:52:48,179
if you don't have a sense

1189
00:52:48,179 --> 00:52:50,179
of your own leadership.

1190
00:52:50,179 --> 00:52:54,179
Does that term resonate with you?

1191
00:52:54,179 --> 00:52:55,179
Yeah.

1192
00:52:55,179 --> 00:52:56,179
And an awareness of your own strengths

1193
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:57,179
and weaknesses

1194
00:52:57,179 --> 00:52:59,179
that you bring to any situation

1195
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:02,179
is a really powerful thing to have.

1196
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:05,179
And, you know,

1197
00:53:05,179 --> 00:53:06,179
in some ways,

1198
00:53:06,179 --> 00:53:07,179
as an athlete,

1199
00:53:07,179 --> 00:53:09,179
when you're being constantly measured

1200
00:53:09,179 --> 00:53:10,179
and prodded and probed,

1201
00:53:10,179 --> 00:53:11,179
you as an athlete could say,

1202
00:53:11,179 --> 00:53:13,179
OK, look, I know my strengths are

1203
00:53:13,179 --> 00:53:14,179
I can run really long distances

1204
00:53:14,179 --> 00:53:16,179
and I don't get tired.

1205
00:53:16,179 --> 00:53:17,179
I can catch the ball

1206
00:53:17,179 --> 00:53:18,179
very high above my head.

1207
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:19,179
My weaknesses,

1208
00:53:19,179 --> 00:53:21,179
not as fast as I'd like to be

1209
00:53:21,179 --> 00:53:22,179
over 15 metres.

1210
00:53:22,179 --> 00:53:24,179
If someone punches me really hard,

1211
00:53:24,179 --> 00:53:26,179
I tend to retreat out of the game.

1212
00:53:26,179 --> 00:53:28,179
Those sort of physical parameters

1213
00:53:28,179 --> 00:53:30,179
are quite easy to measure.

1214
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:32,179
Knowing how you perform

1215
00:53:32,179 --> 00:53:33,179
as an individual,

1216
00:53:33,179 --> 00:53:34,179
as a leader

1217
00:53:34,179 --> 00:53:35,179
or the impact

1218
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:37,179
that your behaviours

1219
00:53:37,179 --> 00:53:39,179
and demands have on other people

1220
00:53:39,179 --> 00:53:41,179
is probably a lot,

1221
00:53:41,179 --> 00:53:43,179
almost by definition,

1222
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:44,179
it's a lot harder

1223
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:47,179
to get data and a read on.

1224
00:53:47,179 --> 00:53:49,179
But it's really important

1225
00:53:49,179 --> 00:53:50,179
to try and have.

1226
00:53:50,179 --> 00:53:53,179
And I think people's willingness

1227
00:53:53,179 --> 00:53:57,179
to search for their own deficiencies

1228
00:53:57,179 --> 00:53:59,179
and educate themselves on those

1229
00:53:59,179 --> 00:54:00,179
and try and improve them,

1230
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:01,179
whether you're leading

1231
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:02,179
in a business situation

1232
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:04,179
or even just in a caring relationship,

1233
00:54:04,179 --> 00:54:05,179
with a partner

1234
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:06,179
or good friends

1235
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:07,179
or anything like that,

1236
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:08,179
is crucial.

1237
00:54:08,179 --> 00:54:09,179
Self-awareness

1238
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:10,179
and self-leadership

1239
00:54:10,179 --> 00:54:11,179
can only happen

1240
00:54:11,179 --> 00:54:12,179
once you have that self-awareness.

1241
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:14,179
I think that's a big part of the puzzle.

1242
00:54:14,179 --> 00:54:16,179
And we see people really conscious

1243
00:54:16,179 --> 00:54:18,179
in the space that we're in,

1244
00:54:18,179 --> 00:54:20,179
in the community of growing leaders

1245
00:54:20,179 --> 00:54:22,179
around how they impact people

1246
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:23,179
on a daily basis,

1247
00:54:23,179 --> 00:54:24,179
how they go about having

1248
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:25,179
a positive impact.

1249
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:26,179
Is that something

1250
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:27,179
that you've thought about

1251
00:54:27,179 --> 00:54:29,179
or something you do daily?

1252
00:54:29,179 --> 00:54:30,179
Yes.

1253
00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:32,179
Back when I was host

1254
00:54:32,179 --> 00:54:33,179
of a breakfast radio show,

1255
00:54:33,179 --> 00:54:35,179
especially my second incarnation,

1256
00:54:35,179 --> 00:54:38,179
which was on the grown-up adult ABC,

1257
00:54:38,179 --> 00:54:41,179
and I was the sole announcer there

1258
00:54:41,179 --> 00:54:42,179
for eight years,

1259
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:44,179
and I had a team of three producers

1260
00:54:44,179 --> 00:54:47,179
with me on air at any day.

1261
00:54:47,179 --> 00:54:48,179
Now, a pretty core group of three,

1262
00:54:48,179 --> 00:54:49,179
but there were probably

1263
00:54:49,179 --> 00:54:50,179
about five or six people

1264
00:54:50,179 --> 00:54:51,179
on replacements on holidays

1265
00:54:51,179 --> 00:54:53,179
and all that sort of stuff.

1266
00:54:53,179 --> 00:54:54,179
Very small team.

1267
00:54:54,179 --> 00:54:55,179
At any given day,

1268
00:54:55,179 --> 00:54:57,179
working with three of them.

1269
00:54:57,179 --> 00:55:00,179
In really interesting circumstances

1270
00:55:00,179 --> 00:55:01,179
where everyone,

1271
00:55:01,179 --> 00:55:02,179
as you would know,

1272
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:03,179
permanently exhausted

1273
00:55:03,179 --> 00:55:04,179
really physically

1274
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:06,179
and mentally challengingly.

1275
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:07,179
The situation of working,

1276
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,179
getting up and working

1277
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,179
when you're tired,

1278
00:55:09,179 --> 00:55:11,179
and not just a little bit,

1279
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:12,179
but when you're really tired

1280
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:13,179
on some of those days.

1281
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:15,179
And the challenge for producers

1282
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:18,179
who aren't the stars of the show

1283
00:55:18,179 --> 00:55:19,179
who get all the plaudits

1284
00:55:19,179 --> 00:55:20,179
and everyone rings up

1285
00:55:20,179 --> 00:55:21,179
and wants to talk to, et cetera,

1286
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:22,179
but their role

1287
00:55:22,179 --> 00:55:23,179
and their performance

1288
00:55:23,179 --> 00:55:25,179
is absolutely crucial

1289
00:55:25,179 --> 00:55:28,179
in the show being any good.

1290
00:55:28,179 --> 00:55:29,179
And the willingness of a producer

1291
00:55:29,179 --> 00:55:30,179
who would have every right

1292
00:55:30,179 --> 00:55:32,179
to go home if they wanted,

1293
00:55:32,179 --> 00:55:33,179
because they've done that

1294
00:55:33,179 --> 00:55:34,179
in their hours,

1295
00:55:34,179 --> 00:55:35,179
to go,

1296
00:55:35,179 --> 00:55:36,179
eh,

1297
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:37,179
I could do one more edit of this.

1298
00:55:37,179 --> 00:55:38,179
I could tighten this up

1299
00:55:38,179 --> 00:55:39,179
a little bit more.

1300
00:55:39,179 --> 00:55:40,179
And it would go from being good

1301
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:42,179
to being really good.

1302
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:43,179
Now,

1303
00:55:43,179 --> 00:55:45,179
how big is their incentive

1304
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:47,179
to put in that extra work

1305
00:55:47,179 --> 00:55:48,179
when they're really tired,

1306
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:50,179
just to essentially make me look like

1307
00:55:50,179 --> 00:55:51,179
I'm better at doing the interview

1308
00:55:51,179 --> 00:55:53,179
than I was at the time

1309
00:55:53,179 --> 00:55:54,179
that I did it?

1310
00:55:54,179 --> 00:55:55,179
You're only going to get

1311
00:55:55,179 --> 00:55:57,179
that sort of buy-in from people

1312
00:55:57,179 --> 00:55:59,179
if you have a really healthy,

1313
00:55:59,179 --> 00:56:00,179
good relationship with them

1314
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:01,179
in the first place

1315
00:56:01,179 --> 00:56:02,179
and where they both

1316
00:56:02,179 --> 00:56:05,179
buy into the concept of the show

1317
00:56:05,179 --> 00:56:06,179
or whatever the business is

1318
00:56:06,179 --> 00:56:07,179
and want to do that

1319
00:56:07,179 --> 00:56:08,179
as well as possible.

1320
00:56:08,179 --> 00:56:09,179
But also,

1321
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:10,179
there has to be a degree of

1322
00:56:10,179 --> 00:56:12,179
respect for you as a person

1323
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:15,179
to also make them want to make

1324
00:56:15,179 --> 00:56:16,179
that sort of commitment.

1325
00:56:16,179 --> 00:56:17,179
You don't have to be

1326
00:56:17,179 --> 00:56:18,179
their best friend.

1327
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:19,179
It doesn't have to be,

1328
00:56:19,179 --> 00:56:20,179
you know,

1329
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:21,179
I'll do anything for Adam

1330
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:22,179
because he's my buddy.

1331
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:23,179
But it has to be,

1332
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:24,179
yeah,

1333
00:56:24,179 --> 00:56:25,179
he's the sort of person

1334
00:56:25,179 --> 00:56:26,179
who I would happily

1335
00:56:26,179 --> 00:56:29,179
do that bit of extra work for.

1336
00:56:29,179 --> 00:56:30,179
I think one of the big determinants

1337
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:31,179
of how,

1338
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,179
you can engender

1339
00:56:32,179 --> 00:56:33,179
that sort of relationship

1340
00:56:33,179 --> 00:56:34,179
with people

1341
00:56:34,179 --> 00:56:35,179
is absolutely

1342
00:56:35,179 --> 00:56:37,179
the way you treat them

1343
00:56:37,179 --> 00:56:39,179
and the respect you show

1344
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:41,179
for them as individuals.

1345
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:42,179
If you don't do that,

1346
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:43,179
I think it's,

1347
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:45,179
you cannot,

1348
00:56:45,179 --> 00:56:46,179
you know,

1349
00:56:46,179 --> 00:56:47,179
you hear stories of people

1350
00:56:47,179 --> 00:56:48,179
in some of those

1351
00:56:48,179 --> 00:56:49,179
intense work environment,

1352
00:56:49,179 --> 00:56:50,179
creative work environments

1353
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:51,179
who do just bully people

1354
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:52,179
into getting results.

1355
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:53,179
Sometimes it works

1356
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:54,179
for a period of time.

1357
00:56:54,179 --> 00:56:55,179
It can't be great

1358
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:57,179
for anyone to be involved in.

1359
00:56:57,179 --> 00:56:58,179
Healthy,

1360
00:56:58,179 --> 00:57:00,179
respectful relationships

1361
00:57:00,179 --> 00:57:01,179
are the only way

1362
00:57:01,179 --> 00:57:02,179
I could ever imagine

1363
00:57:02,179 --> 00:57:03,179
doing that sort of stuff.

1364
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:04,179
Yeah,

1365
00:57:04,179 --> 00:57:05,179
my mind,

1366
00:57:05,179 --> 00:57:06,179
Adam,

1367
00:57:06,179 --> 00:57:07,179
brilliant to hear you

1368
00:57:07,179 --> 00:57:08,179
share that by the way,

1369
00:57:08,179 --> 00:57:09,179
but we share

1370
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:10,179
a great mutual friend,

1371
00:57:10,179 --> 00:57:11,179
Will Anderson,

1372
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:12,179
who you did Triple J Breakfast

1373
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:13,179
with for six years.

1374
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,179
And I worked on Breakfast Radio

1375
00:57:14,179 --> 00:57:15,179
with Will

1376
00:57:15,179 --> 00:57:16,179
for a couple of years

1377
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:17,179
and I,

1378
00:57:17,179 --> 00:57:18,179
coming out of an environment

1379
00:57:18,179 --> 00:57:19,179
where feedback

1380
00:57:19,179 --> 00:57:20,179
is just something

1381
00:57:20,179 --> 00:57:21,179
that's given and received

1382
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:22,179
daily

1383
00:57:22,179 --> 00:57:23,179
in professional sport

1384
00:57:23,179 --> 00:57:24,179
and you don't have time

1385
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:25,179
to,

1386
00:57:25,179 --> 00:57:26,179
to think about it

1387
00:57:26,179 --> 00:57:27,179
on the field

1388
00:57:27,179 --> 00:57:28,179
or,

1389
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:29,179
and it tends to flow

1390
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:30,179
into your life afterwards,

1391
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:31,179
in some ways,

1392
00:57:31,179 --> 00:57:32,179
positively.

1393
00:57:32,179 --> 00:57:33,179
But when you then go

1394
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:34,179
into other environments

1395
00:57:34,179 --> 00:57:35,179
where people aren't used

1396
00:57:35,179 --> 00:57:36,179
to that,

1397
00:57:36,179 --> 00:57:37,179
I remember

1398
00:57:37,179 --> 00:57:38,179
that was my default position.

1399
00:57:38,179 --> 00:57:39,179
If I saw something

1400
00:57:39,179 --> 00:57:40,179
I didn't think

1401
00:57:40,179 --> 00:57:41,179
we were going well at,

1402
00:57:41,179 --> 00:57:42,179
I would confront it

1403
00:57:42,179 --> 00:57:43,179
straight away.

1404
00:57:43,179 --> 00:57:44,179
And I remember

1405
00:57:44,179 --> 00:57:45,179
having a chat with Will

1406
00:57:45,179 --> 00:57:46,179
and he was like,

1407
00:57:46,179 --> 00:57:47,179
mate,

1408
00:57:47,179 --> 00:57:48,179
that's pretty confronting

1409
00:57:48,179 --> 00:57:49,179
what you do.

1410
00:57:49,179 --> 00:57:50,179
It's,

1411
00:57:50,179 --> 00:57:51,179
I come from a world

1412
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:52,179
of comedians

1413
00:57:52,179 --> 00:57:53,179
where we talk

1414
00:57:53,179 --> 00:57:54,179
behind each other's backs,

1415
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,179
you know,

1416
00:57:55,179 --> 00:57:56,179
regularly,

1417
00:57:56,179 --> 00:57:57,179
but no one's going to,

1418
00:57:57,179 --> 00:57:58,179
and I respect

1419
00:57:58,179 --> 00:57:59,179
what you're doing,

1420
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:00,179
mate,

1421
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:01,179
but you need to

1422
00:58:01,179 --> 00:58:02,179
come a bit too,

1423
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:03,179
mate,

1424
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:04,179
you need to.

1425
00:58:04,179 --> 00:58:05,179
And I remember,

1426
00:58:05,179 --> 00:58:06,179
I remember Will telling me about,

1427
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:07,179
because for people

1428
00:58:07,179 --> 00:58:08,179
who aren't familiar

1429
00:58:08,179 --> 00:58:09,179
with the show,

1430
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:10,179
it was yourself

1431
00:58:10,179 --> 00:58:11,179
and Eddie McGuire

1432
00:58:11,179 --> 00:58:12,179
and Will,

1433
00:58:12,179 --> 00:58:13,179
and Will was the comic foil

1434
00:58:13,179 --> 00:58:14,179
and Eddie is,

1435
00:58:14,179 --> 00:58:15,179
yeah,

1436
00:58:15,179 --> 00:58:16,179
Eddie has a very sharply

1437
00:58:16,179 --> 00:58:17,179
defined,

1438
00:58:17,179 --> 00:58:18,179
distinctive character

1439
00:58:18,179 --> 00:58:19,179
and in a show

1440
00:58:19,179 --> 00:58:20,179
like yours,

1441
00:58:20,179 --> 00:58:21,179
as the comic foil,

1442
00:58:21,179 --> 00:58:22,179
there's going to have

1443
00:58:22,179 --> 00:58:23,179
to be times

1444
00:58:23,179 --> 00:58:24,179
when Will

1445
00:58:24,179 --> 00:58:25,179
has a go at Eddie

1446
00:58:25,179 --> 00:58:26,179
just because

1447
00:58:26,179 --> 00:58:27,179
Eddie's got to be

1448
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:28,179
the butt of that joke

1449
00:58:28,179 --> 00:58:29,179
or Eddie's just

1450
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:30,179
in a position

1451
00:58:30,179 --> 00:58:31,179
where he's the one

1452
00:58:31,179 --> 00:58:32,179
to take the pot shot at.

1453
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:33,179
And if you're going

1454
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:35,179
to make a living

1455
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:36,179
doing something,

1456
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,179
a portion of which

1457
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:38,179
is seeming

1458
00:58:38,179 --> 00:58:39,179
to be taking

1459
00:58:39,179 --> 00:58:40,179
the piss out of someone

1460
00:58:40,179 --> 00:58:41,179
or hitting them

1461
00:58:41,179 --> 00:58:42,179
in bits where they're

1462
00:58:42,179 --> 00:58:43,179
a little bit uncomfortable

1463
00:58:43,179 --> 00:58:44,179
and really,

1464
00:58:44,179 --> 00:58:45,179
you know,

1465
00:58:45,179 --> 00:58:46,179
not backing off,

1466
00:58:46,179 --> 00:58:47,179
then that person's

1467
00:58:47,179 --> 00:58:49,179
got to respect you

1468
00:58:49,179 --> 00:58:50,179
and,

1469
00:58:50,179 --> 00:58:51,179
and respect

1470
00:58:51,179 --> 00:58:52,179
your right

1471
00:58:52,179 --> 00:58:53,179
to do that

1472
00:58:53,179 --> 00:58:54,179
and know that it comes

1473
00:58:54,179 --> 00:58:55,179
from a place of

1474
00:58:55,179 --> 00:58:56,179
this is how we do

1475
00:58:56,179 --> 00:58:57,179
this show the best,

1476
00:58:57,179 --> 00:58:58,179
Eddie.

1477
00:58:58,179 --> 00:58:59,179
This is not me

1478
00:58:59,179 --> 00:59:00,179
trying to humiliate you

1479
00:59:00,179 --> 00:59:01,179
otherwise,

1480
00:59:01,179 --> 00:59:02,179
that's not going

1481
00:59:02,179 --> 00:59:03,179
to last long

1482
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:04,179
at all.

1483
00:59:04,179 --> 00:59:05,179
And so absolutely

1484
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:06,179
in,

1485
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:07,179
in,

1486
00:59:07,179 --> 00:59:08,179
in that sort

1487
00:59:08,179 --> 00:59:09,179
of environment

1488
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:10,179
that,

1489
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:11,179
that,

1490
00:59:11,179 --> 00:59:12,179
that,

1491
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:13,179
that connection

1492
00:59:13,179 --> 00:59:14,179
and respect

1493
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:15,179
for each other

1494
00:59:15,179 --> 00:59:16,179
has to be there

1495
00:59:16,179 --> 00:59:17,179
even though you can

1496
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:18,179
then go on

1497
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,179
and do stuff

1498
00:59:19,179 --> 00:59:20,179
that's pretty full.

1499
00:59:20,179 --> 00:59:21,179
I mean,

1500
00:59:21,179 --> 00:59:22,179
you know,

1501
00:59:22,179 --> 00:59:23,179
if,

1502
00:59:23,179 --> 00:59:24,179
if feedback

1503
00:59:24,179 --> 00:59:25,179
is coming

1504
00:59:25,179 --> 00:59:26,179
from the right place,

1505
00:59:26,179 --> 00:59:27,179
then it,

1506
00:59:27,179 --> 00:59:28,179
it,

1507
00:59:28,179 --> 00:59:29,179
it can be uncomfortable.

1508
00:59:29,179 --> 00:59:30,179
It,

1509
00:59:30,179 --> 00:59:31,179
it can be,

1510
00:59:31,179 --> 00:59:32,179
it can be a little bit

1511
00:59:32,179 --> 00:59:33,179
more difficult

1512
00:59:33,179 --> 00:59:34,179
than you think.

1513
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:35,179
But,

1514
00:59:35,179 --> 00:59:36,179
but I,

1515
00:59:36,179 --> 00:59:37,179
I,

1516
00:59:37,179 --> 00:59:38,179
I,

1517
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:39,179
I,

1518
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:40,179
I,

1519
00:59:40,179 --> 00:59:41,179
I think

1520
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:42,179
I think

1521
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:43,179
it's,

1522
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,179
it's,

1523
00:59:44,179 --> 00:59:45,179
it's,

1524
00:59:45,179 --> 00:59:46,179
it's a,

1525
00:59:46,179 --> 00:59:47,179
it's a,

1526
00:59:47,179 --> 00:59:48,179
I think that's

1527
00:59:48,179 --> 00:59:49,179
a good question

1528
00:59:49,179 --> 00:59:50,179
to answer.

1529
00:59:50,179 --> 00:59:51,179
I think that's

1530
00:59:51,179 --> 00:59:52,179
a good question

1531
00:59:52,179 --> 00:59:53,179
to answer.

1532
00:59:53,179 --> 00:59:54,179
Um,

1533
00:59:54,179 --> 00:59:55,179
I,

1534
00:59:55,179 --> 00:59:56,179
I,

1535
00:59:56,179 --> 00:59:57,179
I,

1536
00:59:57,179 --> 00:59:58,179
I think

1537
00:59:58,179 --> 00:59:59,179
I think

1538
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:04,039
oh it was the speakers oh the footy was on in the other room when you're just dying with the pigeon

1539
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:07,380
joke for the fourth night in a row and no one's got the courage to go mate that either needs a

1540
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:13,559
lot of work or it just doesn't make any sense oh that sort of honesty and feedback in something as

1541
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:20,800
public as as broadcasting and and the creative arts is absolutely crucial yeah brilliant and

1542
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:25,420
you're right the fine line isn't it when you're in that environment of the respect and and the

1543
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:29,980
prodding part it's a it's a delicate dance but uh when it with my with my producers because

1544
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:33,800
they're always coming back to me with ideas and all that sort of stuff and there used to be a sort

1545
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:39,900
of unofficial uh moment with a new producer where they'd say look i'm thinking of you know this

1546
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:46,360
thinking of doing xyz and i would just say mate i don't care now if you first hear that that's

1547
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:51,000
i don't care it was my way of saying all yours mate you don't need to bother me with those

1548
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,960
details i'm back that you'll get this right and it was a sort of little badge of

1549
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:55,400
you

1550
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:59,659
you've made it the first time you've got an i don't care from adam now anyone else listening

1551
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:04,860
in you just go well of course you should care mate it's your show no no no i don't care was

1552
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:09,880
my way of saying you don't need my endorsement or authority to do this mate i absolutely back

1553
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:15,440
that you've got this off you go no need to bother with me anymore and if it's not up to

1554
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,380
scratch it's my fault for trusting you at this stage but i'm sure it'll be fine

1555
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:24,260
that needs a bit of clarity though around it too doesn't it otherwise it can be misinterpreted

1556
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:24,960
i

1557
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:34,159
i like it uh creating and sharing a vision we see people really conscious about how they do that

1558
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:40,360
uh those that are consistently successful how have you gone about that in your many different

1559
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:50,940
areas um when you're leading a team like a creative team that's a really important part

1560
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:56,260
of the process and it yeah it's it sounds so obvious but it is true first of all you have

1561
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,420
to have some concept of what that vision is and how you're going to do it and how you're going to

1562
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:58,940
do it and how you're going to do it and how you're going to do it and how you're going to do it

1563
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:05,579
yourself and i think a lot of people when they arrive in a new gig for example not certainly

1564
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:11,619
when i started on set i came on the 702 which was called now abc sydney after a period of real

1565
01:02:11,619 --> 01:02:17,900
um an announcer i've left in the middle of the year before and by the time they appointed me

1566
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:24,099
as the full-time replacement in the seven or eight months since 10 different people had sat

1567
01:02:24,099 --> 01:02:27,860
in that chair some of whom were just filling in for the next couple of weeks

1568
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:32,940
some of whom were auditioning for the spot some of whom thought they were auditioning for the spot

1569
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:38,539
and actually probably weren't they gave the position to someone who then when they realized

1570
01:02:38,539 --> 01:02:43,179
they have to do their own paneling on the desk didn't have the skill set to do that so

1571
01:02:43,179 --> 01:02:50,260
would remove themselves from the position after only three weeks it was really shambolic um

1572
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:56,800
and so when i got there and they threw me in it was just early on a case of let's just

1573
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,400
let's just get

1574
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:02,300
through to the end of this shift without the wheels entire and also i've come from triple j

1575
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:07,119
so i've gone from being the sort of young punk who was probably a bit young to be on triple j

1576
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:12,480
sorry a bit old to still be on triple j to this crazy young kid who'd listened to rap music and

1577
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:19,260
hip-hop and was on 702 so there yet for the first few weeks it was just seat of the pants stuff and

1578
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:25,219
i was learning really really quickly but the moment we got a bit of a feel for who i was and

1579
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:28,280
how it would work yeah we absolutely had to

1580
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:34,800
um come up with a concept and a vision and and communicate with each other about what we thought

1581
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:41,559
that show was um once we had got through those first couple of weeks and it wasn't a debacle

1582
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:46,800
then we had to actually ask you what is this show how does it work what are my strengths what do i

1583
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:51,179
bring to it and yet you sort of have to do that in the creative arts because it's default the show

1584
01:03:51,179 --> 01:03:56,900
was defined by me so we had to have a vision for how it works and what we could do best but you're

1585
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,420
right that it's important for any

1586
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:04,000
organization and you would have said this in sporting teams as well core principles and what

1587
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:10,039
this organization stands for if people buy into that then you can get little things wrong

1588
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:15,880
occasionally in the execution of some little plan or someone can make a mistake but if everyone's

1589
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:21,380
pointing in the one direction of what it actually means to be doing what we are doing at the moment

1590
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:28,159
that's that's absolutely critical in a group of people moving in one common shared direction and

1591
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:38,559
then you can get some great wins in the short term but if you want if you want something to last

1592
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:44,559
when it's challenged when it's difficult when people have their own other issues outside of

1593
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:48,900
work etc to deal with as well you've you've got to have clarity around what you're doing and why

1594
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:55,659
you're doing it yeah brilliantly said uh curiosity is a word that we speak about a lot and through

1595
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:57,900
curiosity it's how we find people approach their

1596
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:03,719
activities and what makes it best for us and what we do better is that we can use it in general

1597
01:05:03,719 --> 01:05:05,840
to help others and learn and develop and learn and improve and that goes back to the physical

1598
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,719
quality that we want to have in our business and that in the gaming community yeah that's

1599
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:11,800
absolutely critical and I'd say that's why i think that's really critical that you've got

1600
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,860
it right there's not much that we can do in our team and so i guess we've got time for themes

1601
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:20,559
that we want to make sure that we go through and i think it's really important that we make sure

1602
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:24,199
that we make sure that we're really focused on the things that we are going to berahed

1603
01:05:24,199 --> 01:05:27,559
by so that you are able to have very clear and consistent learning and improvement is that something

1604
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:28,400
that you've thought of

1605
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:34,199
What I don't understand about you, Adam, is you can walk out on stage

1606
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:39,219
in front of 2,000 people with a script that deep down you know

1607
01:05:39,219 --> 01:05:44,500
is probably not ready to go or without full faith in the tech around you

1608
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:47,820
and an event that's being held together by tape,

1609
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:51,619
and you just walk out confidently and you'll take that

1610
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:54,000
and everything will go fine and you're one of the best people

1611
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,260
they could have doing that thing.

1612
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:59,619
But if your daughter says she was going to get on the 4.15 bus

1613
01:05:59,619 --> 01:06:06,500
and she ends up on the 4.22 bus, you wig out and you just stress out

1614
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:11,400
in a way that is totally disproportionate to the situation.

1615
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:16,699
And she's so much too control freakish and a much too –

1616
01:06:16,699 --> 01:06:20,260
we're going out to the World Cup football on the weekend

1617
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:24,340
and we're bringing our kids from – and it's a little bit confusing

1618
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:24,940
as to how we –

1619
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,900
there's a few options, buses, trains,

1620
01:06:27,619 --> 01:06:31,340
but I've just gone too far into the matrix of –

1621
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:33,579
well, if we park – now, if we park the car there,

1622
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:34,860
we could all get on that bus.

1623
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,920
If my daughter brings her other car, which holds more,

1624
01:06:37,179 --> 01:06:39,119
we could transfer to that car, get back,

1625
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:40,719
we'll miss the first couple of legs of the train

1626
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:42,719
because that's where the traffic blockage is going to be.

1627
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,199
We can then rendezvous with the bus.

1628
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,000
That should get us back to where the first car is parked,

1629
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,380
swap cars.

1630
01:06:50,019 --> 01:06:52,940
That could be eight minutes more efficient than just getting the train.

1631
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:59,420
That's an algorithm unfolding before our very eyes, Adam.

1632
01:06:59,420 --> 01:06:59,940
I love it.

1633
01:07:00,019 --> 01:07:00,480
I love it.

1634
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,280
I can see that happening.

1635
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:06,539
We talk about communicating with clarity as a dimension of leadership

1636
01:07:06,539 --> 01:07:09,500
and I'm talking to the world-domating champion,

1637
01:07:09,699 --> 01:07:11,039
one of the most articulate people.

1638
01:07:11,579 --> 01:07:14,519
But the genius for me is you, is the way you use your words.

1639
01:07:14,679 --> 01:07:15,559
Do you think about it?

1640
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:17,940
Is it something you communicate for a living?

1641
01:07:18,219 --> 01:07:20,000
Is it a strategy that you've put together

1642
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,860
or is it just the way it unfolds for you?

1643
01:07:23,059 --> 01:07:24,860
I do think –

1644
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:27,579
my mind works fairly quickly with words.

1645
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:28,880
It can find words

1646
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,880
and I am starting to plot out often an answer to a question

1647
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,760
when the question's halfway through.

1648
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,460
It does sort of race like that.

1649
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:38,760
But the amount to which communication

1650
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,760
and effective communication is practice

1651
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:45,280
is really undervalued and misunderstood by people.

1652
01:07:46,579 --> 01:07:49,019
People talk about the nervousness of public speaking.

1653
01:07:49,719 --> 01:07:52,920
I genuinely believe when you're nervous public speaking,

1654
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,780
most of the time,

1655
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:59,920
it's not the eyes looking at you that are making you nervous.

1656
01:08:00,219 --> 01:08:02,840
It's the fact that for the next six or eight minutes,

1657
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:07,239
you're going to hear nothing but your own voice.

1658
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:09,860
And that doesn't happen all that often.

1659
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:11,380
Even in this conversation we're having here,

1660
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:13,260
we're constantly jumping in on each other.

1661
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:19,500
It's very rare that you just speak for seven minutes uninterrupted.

1662
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:23,560
I think that is a big part of what makes people nervous.

1663
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:24,680
And if someone before,

1664
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,479
before an event and I say,

1665
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,939
have you got the script?

1666
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:27,199
They go,

1667
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:27,420
mate,

1668
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:29,680
I've read it 10 times.

1669
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:30,420
Right?

1670
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:31,840
Have you read it out loud?

1671
01:08:32,439 --> 01:08:34,119
Have you read it out loud from go to woe?

1672
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:35,640
And without being facetious,

1673
01:08:35,939 --> 01:08:38,279
I'm really comfortable with the sound of my voice.

1674
01:08:38,659 --> 01:08:40,319
It doesn't make me feel weird.

1675
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:42,159
I don't feel self conscious.

1676
01:08:42,899 --> 01:08:47,140
And I'll do events where if I'm hosting an awards night,

1677
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,039
and obviously the awards section is unique.

1678
01:08:50,079 --> 01:08:51,220
I've never done this night before.

1679
01:08:51,699 --> 01:08:54,560
But my opening joke about this is a non-smoking venue,

1680
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,840
blah, blah, blah.

1681
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:56,640
It, trust me,

1682
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,920
is the best non-smoking venue joke on the corporate circuit in Australia.

1683
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,300
I'd suggest the world,

1684
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:02,640
right?

1685
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,319
I've done that joke 50 times.

1686
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:07,800
When I,

1687
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,359
the night before any event,

1688
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:11,819
I will read through the entire script out loud.

1689
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,560
And I will read through that joke again.

1690
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:19,520
It's just the muscle memory that accumulates from saying words,

1691
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,579
from looking at the page and seeing words that gives you the ability to

1692
01:09:22,579 --> 01:09:24,600
look up around the room and come back and,

1693
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,039
and know where you were on that page,

1694
01:09:26,039 --> 01:09:30,659
because you've seen that very page in front of you multiple times.

1695
01:09:30,859 --> 01:09:33,300
But if you're going to be speaking where they're going to be putting prompts up

1696
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,500
on a screen below,

1697
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:38,399
get copies of what those prompts are and practice talking to them.

1698
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,979
Now there are some people are more shy than others.

1699
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:44,000
Some people have voices that are easier to listen to than others.

1700
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:45,979
Some people are more intelligent,

1701
01:09:45,979 --> 01:09:47,880
might have a better vocabulary and the like,

1702
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:52,920
but to become the best communicator you can,

1703
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:54,479
requires,

1704
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:55,079
practice.

1705
01:09:55,079 --> 01:09:57,479
The number of times a big corporate events I'll see,

1706
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,720
and this is not just the monthly sales,

1707
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:04,560
this is the big one for the year and it's full of 2000

1708
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:04,859
people.

1709
01:10:04,859 --> 01:10:06,699
And if this event goes well,

1710
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:11,439
the sales that might flow through from these pipelines are in the millions or

1711
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:13,020
tens of millions of dollars.

1712
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,220
And you see one of the C-suite 20 minutes before they go to

1713
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:18,020
present,

1714
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:19,479
walking out of the tech group going,

1715
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,979
I want to make a couple of changes.

1716
01:10:20,979 --> 01:10:22,239
It's on this memory stick now.

1717
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:23,560
Now,

1718
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:29,560
unless that presentation needs time sensitive stock market information by law,

1719
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:33,060
you have to say what the share price was at five o'clock yesterday,

1720
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:34,159
or you're going to jail.

1721
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:41,060
Then in what circumstances have you not locked that thing away a week ago or

1722
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:46,680
fortnight ago and performed it six or eight times in exactly the version it's

1723
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:52,899
going to be to a group of close friends and EAs and other C-suite around you to

1724
01:10:52,899 --> 01:10:55,380
make sure you're ready to absolutely smash this.

1725
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,420
Now you're busy.

1726
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,119
I know you're busy,

1727
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:58,880
but you're going to try and do it anyway.

1728
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:03,600
Do it in advance and give this the best it can be.

1729
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:09,319
The number of times I've just seen people not respect the process as much as

1730
01:11:09,319 --> 01:11:09,760
you have to,

1731
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,359
if you want it to be the very best you can do.

1732
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:15,560
I think you've just given people a great insight,

1733
01:11:15,699 --> 01:11:15,880
isn't it?

1734
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,800
You listen to someone at your level and you think,

1735
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,000
oh,

1736
01:11:19,079 --> 01:11:19,260
wow,

1737
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:19,600
what a,

1738
01:11:19,979 --> 01:11:22,439
to be able to do that with ease and just turn up and,

1739
01:11:22,439 --> 01:11:22,800
and,

1740
01:11:22,899 --> 01:11:24,619
and find a way they're underestimating.

1741
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:25,680
Uh,

1742
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:28,340
you mentioned buddy Franklin with your swans beanie on it.

1743
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:29,880
He's one of the great goal kickers,

1744
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,460
but he does more goal kicking practice than anyone as well.

1745
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:35,000
And it doesn't just turn up and happen.

1746
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:38,460
It's why you go to a wedding and you often see a car crash because someone's

1747
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:42,479
written a perfectly good speech that was appropriate and fine.

1748
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:46,079
And then they maybe have a couple or they see someone being funny and they

1749
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:49,920
think I can overreach here and go for more.

1750
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,840
And then the car crash happens because you're going off.

1751
01:11:52,899 --> 01:11:55,319
And you've got no idea where it's going to end up.

1752
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,460
It's amazing.

1753
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:57,939
And within that,

1754
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:58,159
I mean,

1755
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:58,340
yeah,

1756
01:11:58,399 --> 01:11:59,760
a bit of humor never hurt or anything,

1757
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,979
but if you're not a naturally hilarious person,

1758
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:06,380
but you've really connected with the subject matter and a couple of people

1759
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:08,479
have given you a couple of tips of things that are bagging.

1760
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:10,479
If you just speak with passion and,

1761
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:11,439
and,

1762
01:12:11,439 --> 01:12:11,659
and,

1763
01:12:11,659 --> 01:12:12,319
and show that,

1764
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:12,760
you know,

1765
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:16,399
this organization and you're the right person that they,

1766
01:12:16,539 --> 01:12:19,460
these people should do what you're suggesting because you know what this

1767
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:20,239
place is about.

1768
01:12:20,739 --> 01:12:22,619
That's going to win you as many friends,

1769
01:12:22,619 --> 01:12:22,880
uh,

1770
01:12:22,899 --> 01:12:27,319
as a couple of hilarious gags in a presentation that otherwise you didn't

1771
01:12:27,319 --> 01:12:28,800
really seem comfortable with in this.

1772
01:12:28,939 --> 01:12:31,180
And you fell out of order and didn't have a,

1773
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,359
an overarching now practice,

1774
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:33,880
practice,

1775
01:12:33,979 --> 01:12:34,279
practice.

1776
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:35,340
It's amazing.

1777
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:36,640
The difference that can make.

1778
01:12:37,159 --> 01:12:39,939
And how important is collaboration been for you in your life?

1779
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,060
That's interesting because some,

1780
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:43,100
some of the stuff I've done,

1781
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:44,699
I really have done by going alone,

1782
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:47,119
but when I've had to collaborate,

1783
01:12:47,479 --> 01:12:47,880
I've,

1784
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:48,159
I've,

1785
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:48,920
I've loved it.

1786
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:52,420
Like the breakfast radio with Will and I was entirely collaborative.

1787
01:12:52,899 --> 01:12:53,260
Uh,

1788
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:53,539
and,

1789
01:12:53,539 --> 01:12:54,579
and there was a real,

1790
01:12:54,819 --> 01:12:55,840
there was a real sort of,

1791
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:56,180
uh,

1792
01:12:57,100 --> 01:13:00,140
it was a real art to giving the impression that was all just on the fly.

1793
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:03,720
Or we were two people who had a lot of fundamental differences with each other.

1794
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,380
And in some ways almost didn't get on.

1795
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:09,619
And will was remarkably good at giving the impression.

1796
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:12,899
He was not as bright as his subsequent career,

1797
01:13:12,899 --> 01:13:14,739
hosting multiple television shows and all that.

1798
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:15,579
Any,

1799
01:13:15,579 --> 01:13:15,880
any,

1800
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:19,100
anyone who got the impression that I was the science genius and he was the

1801
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:19,600
dumb,

1802
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:20,319
Hey,

1803
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:22,020
see the yokel who,

1804
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:22,420
you know,

1805
01:13:22,539 --> 01:13:22,800
did,

1806
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,720
didn't understand what physics was or whatever,

1807
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:25,319
uh,

1808
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:25,579
you know,

1809
01:13:25,579 --> 01:13:28,039
fell well and truly into our trap.

1810
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:28,680
Um,

1811
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:29,880
can I just jump in and say,

1812
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,960
they're sorry to do that because I've had the pleasure of being around you and

1813
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,199
will and Mick Malloy and,

1814
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:40,140
and the guys that are like you consistently funny are almost the most intelligent

1815
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:40,739
people you meet.

1816
01:13:40,739 --> 01:13:42,279
I think the skill to do that,

1817
01:13:42,279 --> 01:13:45,039
you look at the great creative gene to do that regularly.

1818
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:46,399
There's an intelligence behind that.

1819
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:46,680
And we'll,

1820
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,840
Anderson's got that as Mick Malloy does.

1821
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:49,619
And the others have worked with,

1822
01:13:49,619 --> 01:13:49,819
sorry,

1823
01:13:49,819 --> 01:13:51,680
I just needed to jump in because you're right,

1824
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:51,979
isn't it?

1825
01:13:51,979 --> 01:13:52,680
There is a skill to make,

1826
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,359
making it look off the cuff,

1827
01:13:54,359 --> 01:13:56,260
but it takes a lot of intelligence to do that.

1828
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:56,960
Well,

1829
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:57,680
And it's also,

1830
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,560
it's funny that when you get,

1831
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,640
and I think Mick's a profound comic talent,

1832
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:01,479
but when you get,

1833
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:04,500
that's why I love the people like Mick who play the every man.

1834
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,000
And it is,

1835
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,060
he is in some ways,

1836
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:07,859
absolutely an every man,

1837
01:14:08,359 --> 01:14:10,460
but I think in a lot of circumstances,

1838
01:14:10,619 --> 01:14:12,920
it's not in Mick's interests to let people know.

1839
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:15,140
That he was ducks of his school,

1840
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:15,500
you know,

1841
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,460
that not many people will understand.

1842
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:22,640
Remarkably intelligent individual that he is.

1843
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:23,520
I've been lucky.

1844
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,239
My life's been a great balance of collaboration and doing my own solo stuff,

1845
01:14:27,239 --> 01:14:28,260
writing the books,

1846
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:28,800
you know,

1847
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,479
the people help with graphics and all that,

1848
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:34,560
but those Matt's books were essentially me picking up the ball and running with

1849
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:34,800
it,

1850
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,960
but the television shows and the right essence.

1851
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:37,800
So to do a radiation,

1852
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:41,100
you obviously collaborating with your producers when you're putting stuff together,

1853
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:42,600
but to have done two radio shows,

1854
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,880
one of which was in a genuine time.

1855
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,439
I'm one of which is made.

1856
01:14:46,439 --> 01:14:46,979
This is,

1857
01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:47,640
this is,

1858
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:48,840
this is a lot of,

1859
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:51,000
this is going to rest with you and you alone today.

1860
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,359
I've quite enjoyed the balance.

1861
01:14:52,359 --> 01:14:53,020
The balance of that.

1862
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:57,119
And how about the greatest leader in your life?

1863
01:14:57,119 --> 01:14:57,800
Adam,

1864
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:58,479
who's that been?

1865
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:03,819
The greatest leader in my life.

1866
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:07,000
That's a really good question.

1867
01:15:08,439 --> 01:15:10,500
If I went around and thought about it in depth,

1868
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,739
I might come up with someone else,

1869
01:15:11,739 --> 01:15:18,880
but I was lucky enough to be at the ABC when a guy called Mark Scott was the managing director.

1870
01:15:19,359 --> 01:15:20,199
And Mark did,

1871
01:15:20,199 --> 01:15:22,000
I think he did a couple of five year terms.

1872
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:35,380
And then moved on and he gave a great speech at his farewell event where he reflected on when he started at the ABC and he sat down and drew himself up this sort of five year plan and the 10 big items that you had to,

1873
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:37,460
he had to really focus on and he said,

1874
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:39,279
I was looking back at it and it wasn't a bad plan.

1875
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:40,239
You know,

1876
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:44,319
there were a couple of things I didn't have on my list that turned out to be reasonably important.

1877
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:50,000
Then he spent the iPhone streaming.

1878
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,539
He took over the ABC.

1879
01:15:51,539 --> 01:15:59,399
And within moments we just jump into the new digital age of smartphones and connected devices and things like that.

1880
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:02,779
He was the first one to make a call of we need something like iView,

1881
01:16:02,779 --> 01:16:04,739
something where people can just stream.

1882
01:16:04,739 --> 01:16:06,539
Why would you,

1883
01:16:06,539 --> 01:16:10,439
why would you make it easy for people not to watch the seven o'clock news at seven o'clock?

1884
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:12,659
Because the seven o'clock news is at seven o'clock.

1885
01:16:12,659 --> 01:16:14,579
That's why it's called the seven o'clock news.

1886
01:16:14,579 --> 01:16:15,180
Why would I,

1887
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:17,020
why should I be able to watch it the next day?

1888
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:21,239
He was the first visionary to see that sort of stuff.

1889
01:16:21,239 --> 01:16:22,520
And the amount of stuff that he,

1890
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:28,680
the amount of change that he helped that organization navigate in the time that he did.

1891
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,279
And with the ABC in particular,

1892
01:16:30,279 --> 01:16:33,899
because it's such a national treasure of an organization,

1893
01:16:33,899 --> 01:16:36,479
when you're walking around being him,

1894
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:46,619
you're just as likely to get a question from Senate estimates about some budget item as you are some kid complaining about the new announcers on Triple J,

1895
01:16:46,619 --> 01:16:48,920
as you are some 75 year old woman going,

1896
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:51,079
I can't find the second episode of,

1897
01:16:51,079 --> 01:16:53,000
of heartbeat from the other night on the app,

1898
01:16:53,000 --> 01:17:04,279
what's going on and he's his ability to be across enough stuff that he could at least maintain a conversation on every one of those leaders.

1899
01:17:04,279 --> 01:17:06,680
I've seen in those hybrid organizations,

1900
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:10,039
something like a national broadcast that you have to run as a business,

1901
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:13,100
but as a clearly defined role outside of that,

1902
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,560
you would notice that the people who run footy clubs,

1903
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:17,319
they're running a footy club is like running a,

1904
01:17:17,319 --> 01:17:19,100
a listed company,

1905
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:20,979
but one that has an AGM,

1906
01:17:21,079 --> 01:17:27,399
well in fact has 23 AGMs every Saturday afternoon at 4pm for the space of six months.

1907
01:17:27,399 --> 01:17:29,600
And it's really clear at the end of each AGM,

1908
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,020
whether you won that AGM or not,

1909
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:32,760
but it's,

1910
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,960
it's in the business of winning football,

1911
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:38,579
but it's a multi million dollar business at the same time.

1912
01:17:38,579 --> 01:17:43,640
Universities where your essential role is to teach and create knowledge and research,

1913
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:44,359
but you've got an annual,

1914
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:46,319
I was on the Senate of the university of Sydney for a few years,

1915
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:48,260
but now annual budget was well,

1916
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:49,880
well over $1 billion.

1917
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:50,119
Yeah.

1918
01:17:50,119 --> 01:17:50,180
Yeah.

1919
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:50,239
Yeah.

1920
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:50,300
Yeah.

1921
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:50,359
Yeah.

1922
01:17:50,359 --> 01:17:50,420
Yeah.

1923
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:50,460
Yeah.

1924
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:50,479
Yeah.

1925
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:50,539
Yeah.

1926
01:17:50,539 --> 01:17:50,560
Yeah.

1927
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:50,619
Yeah.

1928
01:17:50,619 --> 01:17:50,659
Yeah.

1929
01:17:50,659 --> 01:17:50,680
Yeah.

1930
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:50,720
Yeah.

1931
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:50,779
Yeah.

1932
01:17:50,779 --> 01:17:50,800
Yeah.

1933
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:50,819
Yeah.

1934
01:17:50,819 --> 01:17:50,859
Yeah.

1935
01:17:50,859 --> 01:17:50,880
Yeah.

1936
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:50,899
Yeah.

1937
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:51,560
Yeah.

1938
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:51,899
Yeah.

1939
01:17:51,899 --> 01:17:51,960
Yeah.

1940
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:51,979
Yeah.

1941
01:17:51,979 --> 01:17:53,180
Yeah.

1942
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:53,220
Yeah.

1943
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:53,279
Yeah.

1944
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:53,319
Yeah.

1945
01:17:53,319 --> 01:17:53,359
Yeah.

1946
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:53,380
Yeah.

1947
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:54,439
Yeah.

1948
01:17:54,439 --> 01:17:54,479
Yeah.

1949
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:54,520
Yeah.

1950
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:54,539
Yeah.

1951
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:54,579
Yeah.

1952
01:17:54,579 --> 01:17:54,739
Yeah.

1953
01:17:54,739 --> 01:17:54,840
Yeah.

1954
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:54,880
Yeah.

1955
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:54,899
Yeah.

1956
01:17:54,899 --> 01:17:54,960
Yeah.

1957
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,399
I'm in awe of people who can keep their eye on,

1958
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:58,859
you know,

1959
01:17:58,859 --> 01:18:00,939
two North stars at the one time.

1960
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,439
So I'd say Mark Scott,

1961
01:18:02,439 --> 01:18:04,000
I'd say a guy called Gavin Brown,

1962
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,560
who was the vice chancellor of the university of Sydney when I was there and took it from

1963
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,600
really being in the doldrums to being a world-class institution.

1964
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,600
Again,

1965
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,399
they'd be the first couple who pop in.

1966
01:18:13,399 --> 01:18:17,380
What Andrew Pridham's doing at the Swans and the team there and Tom Harley and all that.

1967
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:17,779
It's,

1968
01:18:17,779 --> 01:18:19,960
It's really interesting stuff to watch.

1969
01:18:20,699 --> 01:18:21,640
And I love hearing it, Adam.

1970
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:25,500
I love asking that question because I could tell you really took some think music there,

1971
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:30,159
but to recognise people that have been that in your life and you're the maths ambassador

1972
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:34,460
for the University of Sydney and you've been a great contributor there and incredible

1973
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,800
contributor to the ABC and the Sydney Swans.

1974
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,920
So it's great to take the time, isn't it, and see the respect for great leaders who

1975
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:42,500
have that impact.

1976
01:18:42,739 --> 01:18:44,000
We love celebrating that.

1977
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:46,500
Also obsessed with collaboration.

1978
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:48,939
I love that, you know, I know that you've worked in isolation.

1979
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:56,460
I've also seen you on stage with Karl Krasinitsky or doing incredible tours with visiting other

1980
01:18:56,460 --> 01:19:02,779
academics and astrophysicists and amazing hosting sessions where you've been able to

1981
01:19:02,779 --> 01:19:03,579
collaborate brilliantly.

1982
01:19:03,579 --> 01:19:08,159
Has there been one person that you thought, good, that's the person I'd love to just sit

1983
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:08,340
there?

1984
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:13,159
And any of your passions, any context, is there a name that you'd love to collaborate

1985
01:19:13,159 --> 01:19:13,420
with?

1986
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:16,279
I was really lucky a few years ago.

1987
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:20,460
I got to do a session with Gary Kasparov, the world's greatest chess player.

1988
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:24,579
I'm an absolute mug chess player, but I love the game.

1989
01:19:25,159 --> 01:19:28,720
And Gary Kasparov, when we was talking to him about the burgeoning field of AI, because

1990
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:32,000
he was the first world champion to lose to a computer.

1991
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,359
He was in that age where computers got to that level.

1992
01:19:34,939 --> 01:19:40,079
And when we'd finished the chat, they then set up six chess boards and a group of us

1993
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:41,260
got to play against Gary.

1994
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:45,699
So I got to play chess against the greatest chess player of all time, right?

1995
01:19:45,779 --> 01:19:46,380
Now, the result.

1996
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:53,579
The game is not the important part of the story, but just to, to, to just be there while

1997
01:19:53,579 --> 01:20:01,840
like the greatest ever was doing his thing was just like, you know, hair on the back

1998
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:06,220
of your neck, goose bump, tingling, just watching the, the master.

1999
01:20:06,359 --> 01:20:08,279
He crushed me in 15 moves.

2000
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:14,260
It wasn't important, but just, just to watch his cognitive processes rolling forward as

2001
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:16,479
he just walked down the line and just played.

2002
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:22,560
All of us was just, there was just a, there was just an electricity about being there

2003
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,199
while that happened.

2004
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:29,180
And he'd have six games going and his decision-making could look at the board and, and with not

2005
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:31,560
even like a reflex action.

2006
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,779
What was interesting was he occasionally would stop at your board and sort of stare at it

2007
01:20:35,779 --> 01:20:36,039
a bit.

2008
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:41,140
And there's part of you thinking, wow, like I've got him in a position where he's thinking

2009
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:41,319
of it.

2010
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:42,220
That's pretty cool.

2011
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:46,479
And I spoke to him about it afterwards and he was actually more likely to be asking me

2012
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:50,560
and asking himself, what's the earliest in my chess playing career I can ever remember

2013
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,439
seeing exactly that position on a board.

2014
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,460
Would that be when I was eight playing that?

2015
01:20:55,479 --> 01:20:58,359
What was that guy's name playing back in Moscow 47 years ago?

2016
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:05,859
Like these, the photographic memory these people have is, is the very, very limits of

2017
01:21:05,859 --> 01:21:06,760
what humans can do.

2018
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:10,340
And it's just, that in itself is absolutely fascinating.

2019
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,479
And I find spending any time with you incredibly fascinating as well, Adam.

2020
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:16,260
There were so many areas to cover.

2021
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:20,199
I could go on for another couple of hours because it's always interesting to get your

2022
01:21:20,199 --> 01:21:23,119
thoughts on anything that's unfolding in any discipline.

2023
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,579
Really appreciate you taking the time today.

2024
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:29,960
It's been something that I've loved and enjoyed and appreciate it as always.

2025
01:21:30,039 --> 01:21:30,380
Thanks, Adam.

2026
01:21:30,859 --> 01:21:33,659
Man, it's been a pleasure and congratulations on what you're doing here.

2027
01:21:33,779 --> 01:21:38,840
You're bringing together a really interesting community of people and there's just, there's

2028
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:43,920
something that's really exciting about having your thoughts challenged a bit, having questions

2029
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,239
answered that you might not even have thought to have asked.

2030
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:50,199
The number of times I've listened to this pod, I'll hear you ask a question and my head's

2031
01:21:50,199 --> 01:21:52,100
already running like, oh, I think I'd answer this.

2032
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:53,100
What's that person?

2033
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:58,100
There's something, there's something you've got here that's really, I think, timely and

2034
01:21:58,100 --> 01:21:59,939
it's been a pleasure to be part of it.

2035
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:01,640
Very kind of you to say, Adam.

2036
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,119
Thanks again for the time.

2037
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:07,739
Thank you for listening to the Empowering Leaders podcast, powered by temper, a mattress

2038
