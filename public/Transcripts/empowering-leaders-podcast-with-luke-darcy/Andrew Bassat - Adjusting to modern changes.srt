A Listener Production.

2
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:09,279
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

3
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:13,179
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,939
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,859
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,600
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,760
in education, sport, industry and the arts

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,739
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

9
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,199
where everyone has a voice.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,759
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

11
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:52,729
In 1997, Andrew Bassett alongside his brother Paul

12
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:54,729
and partner Matt Rockman founded SEEK.

13
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,530
SEEK quickly became the market leader in the online employment space,

14
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,009
expanding operations across the Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions.

15
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,049
The concept being to make it easier and quicker for candidates

16
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:09,870
and hirers to connect by moving print newspaper job ads online.

17
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:13,069
In the 22 years that Andrew served as SEEK's CEO,

18
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:15,530
it grew into one of Australia's top 50 listed companies,

19
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:18,810
employing more than 3,000 people across the globe.

20
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,129
SEEK's clear purpose is helping people live more fulfilling and productive lives

21
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:25,090
while helping organisations to succeed.

22
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:28,489
SEEK has exposure to more than 900 million people

23
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:31,430
and a market capitalisation now in excess of $10 billion.

24
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,750
Andrew Bassett is also currently the president of the St Kilda Football Club.

25
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,469
Andrew, it's great to meet you in person.

26
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:38,269
Thanks for your time today.

27
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,250
Thank you.

28
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,769
The legend has it that SEEK was born out of the frustration of your brother Paul

29
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,010
trying to buy a house.

30
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,069
Can I go back and find out if that's true

31
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,790
and how did that happen?

32
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,409
Did the story begin?

33
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,150
No, that's right.

34
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,650
I can barely remember it,

35
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,849
but that's Paul was looking for a house,

36
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,129
finding the process frustrating.

37
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,730
And yeah, definitely felt that online was the way

38
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,689
that houses would be searched for in time.

39
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:04,469
Spoke to me that night and we spent six months considering it.

40
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,409
So why then did you go down the employment path

41
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:09,810
rather than real estate path,

42
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:11,330
given that was the origin of the story?

43
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,009
Yeah, we started doing a business case

44
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:15,590
and I think the plan was always each of real estate,

45
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,650
employment and cars.

46
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,669
We just never got to the other two thirds of our business.

47
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:18,689
So we just went with the plan.

48
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:18,770
So we just never got to the other two thirds of our business.

49
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:21,289
And we just decided employment first.

50
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:22,729
Partly it was a bigger market.

51
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:25,409
Partly we felt it was more amenable to online.

52
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,990
We probably got that part wrong.

53
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,650
And partly, to be honest,

54
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:30,710
we just liked the idea of helping people find jobs

55
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,849
a little bit more purposeful

56
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:33,689
than helping people find houses.

57
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:36,990
So that was why we decided jobs first,

58
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,509
not jobs only, as I said.

59
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,669
Well, that's fascinating.

60
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:40,930
So in your original business case,

61
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,810
you picked it all effectively.

62
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,930
You realised that the online real estate market,

63
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,990
which became a massive, massive business

64
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,669
and car sales, we know,

65
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,590
that brand extraordinarily well.

66
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,490
So you always intended to go back.

67
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:54,650
Perhaps your success in the employment space

68
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,169
was so good you didn't get around to it.

69
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:57,169
Is that how you feel about it?

70
00:02:57,389 --> 00:02:59,590
Yeah, no, I think for probably four or five years,

71
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,509
we still thought we'd go to the other categories.

72
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:03,909
But then we just saw so much growth in employment

73
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:05,710
and also the logic of them being together

74
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,550
and the classifieds started to fall apart a little bit.

75
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:11,210
Once you went online,

76
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,289
because you can go much more deep into the value chain

77
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:15,530
and the deeper parts of the value chain of employment,

78
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:17,289
cars and real estate is actually quite different.

79
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:18,629
So we started going,

80
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:19,750
going to things like education

81
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,090
rather than going to things like cars and real estate.

82
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,569
I want to talk to you about education at some stage,

83
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,569
but I read that when you started

84
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:28,430
and founded Seek back in 1997,

85
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,689
that you self-confessed

86
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:32,050
that I had very little knowledge of the internet.

87
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:32,830
Is that true?

88
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,030
Yeah, no, it's all true.

89
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:34,569
I think we,

90
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,889
I'd never used the internet

91
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:37,069
when Paul approached me that night.

92
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:38,870
So I only really started to use the internet

93
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,750
and learn about it as part of the business case,

94
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,270
to be honest.

95
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,030
And Paul, Matt and I,

96
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,830
none of us really had any tech experience.

97
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,789
None of us really had any proper business experience.

98
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:48,569
So we were all sort of making it up as we went along.

99
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,090
It's an extraordinary story to me

100
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,650
to create a business model

101
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,349
and to have the foresight

102
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:54,750
for someone that I hadn't even used.

103
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:56,370
And people listening to this will,

104
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,849
it's not that long ago, 1997,

105
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:59,490
when you think about it,

106
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,430
that the internet was this thing.

107
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,330
No one really knew it was going to end up,

108
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:05,370
but somewhere deep within that partnership,

109
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,930
you guys had a sense that you're on the edge

110
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,030
of being able to disrupt.

111
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:11,169
Yeah, foresight might be generous.

112
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:13,330
I think there's a fair bit of naivety

113
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,029
and a fair bit of sort of youthful exuberance

114
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,850
in terms of let's have a crack at this thing

115
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,649
rather than certain,

116
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,709
it would make the thing work.

117
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,410
But yeah, we just,

118
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,689
the concept that actually,

119
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:23,970
once I understood online,

120
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,170
that this stuff would move online over time

121
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,370
was pretty clear.

122
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,730
So the hard question was,

123
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:30,089
how would we win?

124
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:32,889
And how could we be successful against Fairfax,

125
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,529
against News,

126
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:34,889
against the international competition?

127
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,750
That was the tough part.

128
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,290
Yeah, you took some risks, didn't you?

129
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,449
And you just mentioned then,

130
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:41,250
you know, you're taking on the giant that Fairfax,

131
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,730
and in honest,

132
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,509
they're a massive, massive organisation.

133
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:45,910
News Corp is Rupert Murdoch,

134
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:48,649
plays for keeps Rupert from what we understand.

135
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:51,670
And they weren't going to be overly fond of,

136
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,370
you know, a couple of upstarts disrupting.

137
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:55,490
And that was,

138
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,230
they called it the rivers of gold in newspapers,

139
00:04:58,389 --> 00:04:58,610
didn't they?

140
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:59,209
They classified.

141
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,050
So what sort of pushback did you get

142
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,189
from those competitors?

143
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:04,509
Yeah, look,

144
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:06,709
we, just coming back to the decision,

145
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:07,910
which just sort of started with,

146
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:10,230
it's the,

147
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,170
we knew it was a winner tax all market.

148
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,629
We knew that one person would do very,

149
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:14,089
very well.

150
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,009
Sometimes in classifiers,

151
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:16,970
there's a second prize,

152
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:17,930
but usually there's not.

153
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,910
And there's almost never a third prize.

154
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,310
So the tough thing was we knew we had to beat the newspapers,

155
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,290
not just come third.

156
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:25,250
If that made sense.

157
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,410
They were the thing that got us over the line and fair to say,

158
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,569
we weren't sure we'd win,

159
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:32,870
but we thought we could have a crack at it was all we needed to,

160
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:38,930
to have take the chance was the view that getting it right in terms of

161
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,990
the disruption as a newspaper play would be pretty tough.

162
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:43,949
Cause one thing to talk the language of,

163
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:45,310
if we don't cannibalise ourself,

164
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,170
somebody else will.

165
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,850
But the timing of when you,

166
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,009
you actually pull the ball at the nature of how you do it,

167
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,430
moving from a world where,

168
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:51,790
as you say,

169
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,769
the rivers of gold were enormous revenue stream and knowing that online would

170
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:57,329
mean the revenue stream was probably much smaller.

171
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,170
That's a tough game to play as a newspaper when you've got,

172
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:01,529
you know,

173
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:05,850
shareholders or public or otherwise who care a lot about the annual profit.

174
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,769
So it was always going to be tough for them to manage that transition.

175
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,589
Whereas we turned up to work every day thinking,

176
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:13,649
how do we use the technology to make the most efficient marketplace?

177
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,750
They turned up to work every day thinking,

178
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,810
how do we stop the technology damaging,

179
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,730
our rivers of gold,

180
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:19,990
very different set of problems.

181
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,069
So it's not surprising that we solved it better than they did.

182
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:22,629
So,

183
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,389
so why in a competitive market like that,

184
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,750
other classified online sites were emerging everywhere.

185
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:29,870
There were competitors everywhere.

186
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:30,970
When you look back,

187
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:33,069
why did you and Seek succeed?

188
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:33,810
Yeah,

189
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:34,449
there's a few things.

190
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,689
I think we probably had a hundred competitors when we started.

191
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:37,629
So the logic,

192
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,269
when we went to people with that business plan,

193
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,110
it definitely needed a bit of a leap of faith is you've got the newspapers

194
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,290
already online monster.

195
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,290
That was the global leader.

196
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,810
Certainly the leader in the U S was already in Australia.

197
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:47,670
Um,

198
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,829
and then,

199
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:47,910
you know,

200
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,490
about a hundred other competitors say,

201
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:49,889
um,

202
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:51,149
we certainly weren't the first.

203
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,129
I think the,

204
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:53,250
we got right.

205
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,750
The balance between taking advantage of the technology,

206
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,750
but recognizing this was not a small game that we had to win.

207
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:00,970
This wasn't just about,

208
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,329
um,

209
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,110
building with a little bit of capital and getting a bit more money than

210
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,689
going from there.

211
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:05,370
We had to sprint.

212
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:06,850
We had to raise a lot of capital,

213
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,389
have any chance of being in the newspapers.

214
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,269
We had to be really focused on the marketplace and building the

215
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:11,670
marketplace,

216
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,629
getting all the job seekers,

217
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:16,170
getting all the job ads rather than on trying to make money in the short

218
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:16,470
term.

219
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:17,709
And I think we've got a lot of,

220
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:18,370
a lot of things wrong,

221
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,889
but we've got those broad concepts,

222
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:20,149
right?

223
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:21,189
Of needing to sprint crap,

224
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:23,769
the marketplace first being the first to have a viable marketplace.

225
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:25,990
And then you can keep people and get momentum.

226
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,449
Whereas if you're trying to bootstrap and it goes small,

227
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,290
you won't get there.

228
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,449
And the other piece is if you just really like it with the

229
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:31,689
people,

230
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:32,750
we had just really passionate,

231
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,670
committed people who fought no less ownership than the three of

232
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,329
us,

233
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:37,709
worked just as hard for it to parent,

234
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:38,529
to be frank,

235
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:39,949
a fraction of the rewards and success.

236
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:41,290
So we're very fortunate with that people.

237
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:41,949
You,

238
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:42,250
uh,

239
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,490
you mentioned the need to sprint as a competitive advantage there,

240
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,550
and you needed to inject some capital to,

241
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:47,790
to,

242
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,930
to get it viable.

243
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,310
And you went to one of the wealthiest families in Australia,

244
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,009
the Packer family took a,

245
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:54,990
a stake of 25%.

246
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,829
I think it was 2003 for $33 million.

247
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:00,449
James Packer takes a seat on the,

248
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:01,529
on the seat board.

249
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:03,889
Tell us about that process.

250
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:04,350
You know,

251
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:06,810
obviously that's a big sell to a family like that,

252
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,730
who are sophisticated investors.

253
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,709
And what was it like having James on your board?

254
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:10,870
How,

255
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,129
how did that relationship evolve?

256
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:12,509
Yeah,

257
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:13,310
that came a bit later.

258
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,389
So John threw to about,

259
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:14,649
geez,

260
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:16,470
I think that was about a third or fourth round.

261
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,069
And,

262
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:17,509
um,

263
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,550
so we had a few high net worths on the way through a few

264
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,050
VCs.

265
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,069
And then James came in about a third or fourth round.

266
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,490
And there was a bit of scepticism,

267
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,490
but there's all sorts of stories,

268
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:26,790
of course,

269
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,730
about the Packer family.

270
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:27,949
But,

271
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:30,790
but we met James and it was quite a disarming conversation

272
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,669
because what had happened a few years earlier is PBL had

273
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,429
been our partner,

274
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,610
but they then went and did a JV with Monster who at the

275
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,289
time was our most serious competition.

276
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,210
So we'd been fiercely in competition with the,

277
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,370
with PBL and with Monster.

278
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,149
Um,

279
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,169
James called us and said,

280
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:47,009
I think you're going to win.

281
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:48,009
Um,

282
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:49,409
I want to work with you rather than them.

283
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,669
And he was very disarming.

284
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:51,029
Um,

285
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:52,350
in terms of I think you're going to take the rivers of

286
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,669
gold and I'd like to be part of that.

287
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:54,389
Um,

288
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,090
and so he really probably was the first person we'd met

289
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:00,990
who had a more ambitious version of where our business could

290
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,830
get to than we did.

291
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:03,870
Most of them spoke to people who wanted to invest,

292
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,070
who wanted to buy a part of the business.

293
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,830
We thought the business would grow very,

294
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,470
very fast and they were more sceptical.

295
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,409
James was almost the other way around.

296
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,850
And the more we spent time with James,

297
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,509
the more we liked him.

298
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:14,690
And he was terrific on the board and he was really good.

299
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,629
He was not only on the board,

300
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:16,950
he was our chairman for a couple of years.

301
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:18,690
And he's highly enumerant.

302
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,110
He was very passionate about the business.

303
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,230
He was really good at sort of pushing us to be as

304
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,250
ambitious as we could be,

305
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,750
go as hard and as fast as we could be.

306
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:25,649
So he was terrific.

307
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,309
And a good win,

308
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:27,730
uh,

309
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,409
a serious win.

310
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:28,789
I think,

311
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:29,190
uh,

312
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,549
you know,

313
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:30,870
the numbers that you read that,

314
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,289
that the eventual stake that was 33 million turned into 440.

315
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:34,909
And I suppose that,

316
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:36,009
that helps your relationship.

317
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:36,029
Yeah.

318
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:37,029
So you see,

319
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,309
I think James still likes us.

320
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:38,889
So yes,

321
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:39,149
um,

322
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:39,389
you,

323
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:40,169
you always get on,

324
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:41,909
it's always easier when you make money for people than when

325
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:42,889
you lose money for people.

326
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:43,129
And I,

327
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:45,629
I still see James from time to time,

328
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:46,710
obviously he lives overseas,

329
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,950
but,

330
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,190
um,

331
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,870
he's still going on very well and he's been a very good

332
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,350
supporter.

333
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,029
Um,

334
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,929
that's continued even beyond his investment.

335
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:55,009
So the reputation you had Andrew as a CEO,

336
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:55,289
from,

337
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:57,870
from what I hear from people that have worked at Seek was

338
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,769
that you built a culture that people loved coming to work,

339
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,570
that there was something special about,

340
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:04,269
you know,

341
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:06,350
you use the word luck and it's interesting.

342
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:08,710
A lot of the leaders have great success stories like you,

343
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,049
the humility comes through.

344
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,850
They mentioned luck and good timing and,

345
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:14,889
but I suspect there was a fair bit of sophistication in the

346
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:15,950
culture you built at Seek.

347
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,289
When you,

348
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:16,889
when you look back,

349
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:17,450
back at it,

350
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,450
what did you get right?

351
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,389
Yeah,

352
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:19,529
look,

353
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:20,250
it's a good question.

354
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:20,450
We've,

355
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:20,909
we've been,

356
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,289
um,

357
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:22,070
at times,

358
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:22,230
you know,

359
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,129
fortunate with our people,

360
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:24,649
but we have tried to set the coach right.

361
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,210
And I think when we looked at the likes of,

362
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:26,509
um,

363
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:27,649
I think it's our nature anyway.

364
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:30,330
And I think Paul and Matt and I had some different approaches on

365
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,129
certain things,

366
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,169
but on people were all pretty aligned and the importance of people

367
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:35,490
and the importance of people and people,

368
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:35,909
um,

369
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,730
treating people right and caring for people.

370
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:41,730
But we also recognise at a strategic level that our competitors,

371
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,590
Fairfax News had every possible advantage.

372
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,450
They had all the job ads,

373
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,509
they had all the job seekers,

374
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,110
um,

375
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,769
they had all the money.

376
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:47,570
Um,

377
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,649
and if we were going to beat them,

378
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,129
that would only happen if our people were more passionate,

379
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:51,809
more committed,

380
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:52,590
um,

381
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:53,190
than theirs.

382
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,470
And that involved just bringing people on board,

383
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:55,629
um,

384
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:56,649
empowering people,

385
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:56,830
um,

386
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,289
caring for them and doing it the right way.

387
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:01,769
And I think we probably just went straight to the point that we

388
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:04,110
needed these people and we needed to look after them.

389
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,429
We needed them to love coming to work.

390
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:06,730
We weren't necessarily able to pay them.

391
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,850
They needed to believe in the vision because we're giving people options

392
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,730
rather than the salary.

393
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,990
And we were well and truly rewarded by the faith that we had in

394
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,309
people by what we got back from those people.

395
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:16,470
So it became very self-reinforced.

396
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:17,889
And in terms of,

397
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:18,389
um,

398
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,149
genuinely valuing people rather than pretending to value in people,

399
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:21,649
um,

400
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:24,210
recognizing the settings that we needed to put in place to make sure

401
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,990
people did feel empowered and supported.

402
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:26,850
I think,

403
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,149
you know,

404
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:29,250
I don't tend to highlight things that we're proud of stuff,

405
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,210
but in terms of stress,

406
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,909
including most recently in the COVID,

407
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:32,429
um,

408
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:34,429
in times of the dot-com crash and other times,

409
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,350
we've gone straight to care for our people at time when other

410
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,210
organizations perhaps go to a different point.

411
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,690
And I think that's really served in good stead in terms of

412
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:43,049
loyalty,

413
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:44,970
in terms of people feeling good about how they're valued and

414
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,330
treated.

415
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,710
I'd like to delve into that a little bit more,

416
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:47,889
Andrew,

417
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:48,549
if that's okay.

418
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:48,750
I mean,

419
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,009
I've,

420
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:49,590
um,

421
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:50,649
spoken to Jeff Harris,

422
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:51,809
who founded Flight Center,

423
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:52,389
um,

424
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:53,710
on this podcast and,

425
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,889
and it was almost a cult of Flight Center in the end.

426
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:58,169
They were really detailed,

427
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,470
the Flight Center balls,

428
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,330
the regular get together.

429
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,529
I mean,

430
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:01,990
a lot of it,

431
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:02,850
you know,

432
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,850
the Friday night drinks,

433
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,889
it's not as though,

434
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,309
you know,

435
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,950
you're reinventing the wheel on connection and bringing people

436
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:08,529
together,

437
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:10,269
but there was some systems they were really,

438
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,409
um,

439
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,230
well aware of the size of their teams and they learned and

440
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,029
experimented.

441
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:15,250
And they,

442
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:15,309
um,

443
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:15,950
they kept their,

444
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,570
their franchises,

445
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:18,070
uh,

446
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,909
even though they own most of them at a smaller level.

447
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:21,649
I spoke to Brian McNamee from CSL,

448
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,690
that business grew to 40,000,

449
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,330
uh,

450
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:24,909
employees.

451
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:28,009
And he walked the floor to speak to every range of

452
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:29,429
people he could every single day.

453
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:29,750
I mean,

454
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,309
were there specific things that,

455
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:32,610
that you did at Seek that you look back on?

456
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,210
there were,

457
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:33,710
you know,

458
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:34,070
um,

459
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,370
I was going to perhaps talk,

460
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,309
we did different things and I was going to talk to them,

461
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,570
but I,

462
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:37,850
you know,

463
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,389
for me,

464
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,350
and I,

465
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,909
I view this parenting the same way,

466
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:41,090
right,

467
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,970
that people have got different philosophies and different

468
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,590
practices in terms of how they do it.

469
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:45,289
But the,

470
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,690
85% to being successful or unsuccessful is the

471
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,309
genuine care.

472
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:49,929
So if you,

473
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:51,929
if you're genuine about your care for people rather

474
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:53,070
than pay lip service to it,

475
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,590
um,

476
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,809
if you continue that through good times and bad,

477
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,350
it will usually come through,

478
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,929
um,

479
00:12:57,929 --> 00:12:59,509
in terms of a happy workforce and a,

480
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:00,330
and a good culture.

481
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,129
If you're,

482
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:01,649
um,

483
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,230
it doesn't matter what you do in terms of the

484
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:03,649
practices,

485
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:05,269
the Friday night drinks and all the,

486
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,210
all the benefits of your care is not genuine.

487
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:07,990
Um,

488
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:08,529
and if it,

489
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:10,429
it goes up and down depending on what the

490
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:11,210
business is doing,

491
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:11,850
um,

492
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,529
you find that those practices don't work.

493
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,809
So there's a bunch of things we did with,

494
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,269
particularly with the,

495
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,830
the company was small.

496
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:17,250
Everyone knew everyone would have drinks together

497
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:17,830
the whole time.

498
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:19,850
We'd play soccer in the halls and throw things

499
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:20,250
at each other.

500
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:22,110
It was a fun culture as well as being one that

501
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,490
was,

502
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:22,789
um,

503
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,090
focused on the work.

504
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,309
But as I said,

505
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,169
it's less in the practices,

506
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:26,789
more in the,

507
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:29,190
the genuineness of the caring about people and

508
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,350
the,

509
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,929
um,

510
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,610
valuing people.

511
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:31,110
That,

512
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,830
that theme comes across a lot,

513
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:33,210
Andrew,

514
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:35,789
from leaders I speak to in a range of different

515
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:38,490
areas that genuine care is the term.

516
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:38,669
And,

517
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:41,610
and it's interesting because I think the genuine

518
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,509
part is the uncommon part because people

519
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,929
understand,

520
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:44,110
geez,

521
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:45,230
I've got to probably have this,

522
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:47,169
this perception that looks like I'm investing

523
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:47,509
in it.

524
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,450
But if the authenticity is not there,

525
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:51,350
we see it with the sporting coaches now more

526
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,309
than ever that the really good ones buy into

527
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:57,450
their players in a way that is proper and,

528
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:57,649
and,

529
00:13:57,649 --> 00:13:58,269
and authentic.

530
00:13:58,309 --> 00:13:58,710
And,

531
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:00,070
and as that served you,

532
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:00,289
I'm,

533
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:00,590
I'm,

534
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,470
I'm jumping around,

535
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,850
but you're the,

536
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,629
the president of the St Kilda Football Club at

537
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:05,009
the moment.

538
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:05,470
Have you,

539
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:07,789
the lessons from Seek,

540
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:09,389
are they applying well into that role?

541
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:10,210
Yeah,

542
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:10,409
I'm,

543
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:10,950
I'm trying,

544
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,169
I'm,

545
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:12,129
I'm sort of finding my feet.

546
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,049
It's been three years now.

547
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:13,450
I've sort of,

548
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:15,250
I've started to find my feet in the football

549
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:15,590
environment.

550
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,929
It's a little bit different in terms of what's

551
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:20,129
tough about a football environment.

552
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,309
You would have known this as a player,

553
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:21,669
of course,

554
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,129
and you've known this from your exposure is,

555
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:23,450
gee,

556
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:23,870
there's,

557
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,330
there's only so many people you can employ.

558
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:26,070
You've got a hard cap,

559
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:26,990
you've got a soft cap.

560
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:28,649
And if people come in,

561
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:29,690
other people need to leave.

562
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,070
And in fact,

563
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,690
the whole system is designed to have people

564
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,190
turn over.

565
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:35,549
So some of the things around the care and the,

566
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:37,570
the long-term positioning that you,

567
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:37,950
you know,

568
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:38,470
you've got a job,

569
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,169
Seek long-term,

570
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,610
if you do it,

571
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:39,990
if you do it,

572
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,429
if you do well and you're pushing hard,

573
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,629
it's only playing football.

574
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,950
It's much more worth this industry.

575
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,269
So how you can get the same level of positivity

576
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:48,929
in terms of the culture when you can't,

577
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:49,950
you can't afford to,

578
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:51,590
or you're not allowed to treat people quite as

579
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,570
well has been one of the challenges for me.

580
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:55,149
But a lot of the other principles apply.

581
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,029
A lot of the other principles,

582
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:56,929
open communication,

583
00:14:57,049 --> 00:14:58,490
authenticity that you talk about,

584
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,370
making good decisions rather than terrible

585
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,049
decisions in the process that lead to good

586
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:03,370
decisions rather than poor decisions.

587
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:05,330
All those sorts of things I think are very

588
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:05,990
transferable.

589
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:07,090
Andrew,

590
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,409
you've connected millions of people looking for

591
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,750
jobs with the right employers.

592
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,970
And I think anyone who's built anything

593
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:13,610
understands,

594
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:13,929
and I think anyone who's built anything

595
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:15,129
and it comes through in your language,

596
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:15,570
you know,

597
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,610
we've got the team right.

598
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,610
We cared for our people,

599
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:17,850
right.

600
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:18,470
We built the team.

601
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,070
I mean,

602
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,389
you must've had some failings and success and

603
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:23,470
effectively seek is the business of bringing

604
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,549
those people together to try and get that better

605
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,710
than your opposite.

606
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:27,330
What,

607
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,950
what lessons did you learn from getting the

608
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,350
right people?

609
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:31,250
Someone listening to this,

610
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:33,230
that's trying to bring teams together.

611
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:34,470
What's the secret to it?

612
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:34,929
Yeah.

613
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:37,230
I'm still learning.

614
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,289
So I tend not to,

615
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,710
I tend to struggle with things like secret

616
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,149
success,

617
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:41,409
secret success so far.

618
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:41,830
And then I'll,

619
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,250
I'll fall on my face in five minutes.

620
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:43,789
But the,

621
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:45,309
I look particular,

622
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:46,389
you asked about the people.

623
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,970
So we had a few learnings all the way through

624
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:48,769
on the people side,

625
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:49,629
probably a little,

626
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:50,549
a little bit this from that.

627
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,090
I,

628
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:56,309
I tended to not trust my instincts as much as

629
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:56,570
I should.

630
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:59,029
We tended to be too quick to say we're deaf,

631
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:01,450
we're desperate for this person or this person

632
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,289
has great skills and we're going to overlook

633
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:05,389
poor behavior or overlook some of our,

634
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:05,950
you know,

635
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:08,929
our instincts in the hiring process or how we

636
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:10,330
feel or some of the feedback we're getting

637
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,149
through beyond the hiring process.

638
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:13,629
And,

639
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:15,129
and hang on to people too late,

640
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:16,509
allow bad behaviors too late,

641
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,289
hire the wrong people,

642
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:19,009
those sorts of mistakes you make as a startup

643
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:20,830
when you perhaps don't have as much choice in

644
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,370
who you hire,

645
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,809
when you're scrambling so much that it's hard to

646
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:24,429
make a change,

647
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:25,629
even when you feel somebody is wrong,

648
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:26,690
all those sorts of things.

649
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,289
We've really learned getting the right people on

650
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,110
board's worth waiting however long you need to,

651
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,450
to make sure you've got the right person.

652
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,190
You don't ignore your instincts when you see the

653
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:34,870
wrong behaviors,

654
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,850
you deal with them early and hard and all those

655
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:37,370
sorts of things.

656
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,110
We've got so much better at doing than we did in

657
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,669
the early days.

658
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:41,909
And that came from a succession of one by one

659
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,210
stuff ups and,

660
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:43,710
and,

661
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,429
and lessons that we learned on the way through

662
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:47,230
that were very painful for us and for others.

663
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:48,710
So you think in the end,

664
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,250
if there's an instinctive feel that maybe someone's

665
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,269
not the right values and you're seeing some of

666
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:54,610
those behaviors that,

667
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:56,710
that may be moving them on and,

668
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:57,210
and,

669
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,929
and doing that quicker would have been more

670
00:16:58,929 --> 00:16:59,470
beneficial.

671
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,730
Is that something that you do now?

672
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,029
Yeah.

673
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:01,470
Actually,

674
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,409
we learned relatively quickly that the easiest

675
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:04,210
people in some ways,

676
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,950
although really we didn't always get it right,

677
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,869
but people who are bad at their work and bad

678
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:09,430
people are really,

679
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,329
really easy of course.

680
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:10,630
Yeah.

681
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,190
It took us a little bit longer to deal with

682
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,150
people who are really good at their job.

683
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:13,170
Yeah.

684
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,089
But bad people,

685
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:16,049
but we learned that we absolutely have to deal

686
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:16,910
with those people early.

687
00:17:17,509 --> 00:17:19,390
The ones we still struggle with are people who

688
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,650
are bad at their work and good people.

689
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:20,890
That's,

690
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,410
that's the hardest category if you're trying to

691
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,710
be a care and kind organization.

692
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:32,130
So you're incredibly well placed.

693
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:32,509
I mean,

694
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:32,950
this,

695
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:33,450
uh,

696
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,589
this podcast is about empowering leadership and

697
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:37,769
we're seeing what we think is a trend now

698
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:39,390
towards really self-reflective,

699
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,049
self-aware,

700
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,109
constant learners in leadership.

701
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:42,990
I mean,

702
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:43,309
you've,

703
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:43,750
uh,

704
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:44,109
you,

705
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:44,349
you,

706
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:46,190
you've seen thousands and thousands of people

707
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,210
in every discipline category.

708
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:47,490
You've,

709
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:48,849
you've got the data on,

710
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:49,269
on people.

711
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:49,529
What,

712
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,230
what in your mind makes great leadership?

713
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:52,369
Yeah.

714
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:52,589
Yeah.

715
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,049
Again,

716
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:53,390
I,

717
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:53,710
I,

718
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,329
I,

719
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:54,390
I,

720
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:54,430
I,

721
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,930
as I said to you in the lead up to this,

722
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,109
I,

723
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,750
I don't talk about this very often.

724
00:17:57,829 --> 00:17:59,069
I think about it not much more,

725
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,829
but you used to with self-awareness,

726
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:01,569
which is interesting.

727
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:03,609
And that's the one thing I've actually found,

728
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,410
not just with leaders,

729
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,309
but with people generally,

730
00:18:05,329 --> 00:18:07,750
that it doesn't matter how well performed people

731
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,009
are,

732
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:09,210
if they're more self-aware,

733
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:10,490
they're able to take feedback.

734
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:12,789
They tend to be,

735
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,470
and they're passionate and you have always got

736
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,069
to start with passion.

737
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,009
They tend to,

738
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:16,390
um,

739
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,369
learn and grow.

740
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:18,730
And there are,

741
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,690
there's a chance to be successful.

742
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,730
Those people that perhaps aren't,

743
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,390
aren't self-aware or won't take feedback almost

744
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,329
get worse.

745
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,369
They get more successful,

746
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:27,829
but they get more assured of themselves,

747
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:28,230
more,

748
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,589
more,

749
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,470
more certain that if anyone gives them feedback,

750
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:32,609
it's out of jealousy or they don't need to listen

751
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:32,990
to it.

752
00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:35,549
So people kind of do this and go backwards when

753
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:36,309
they're not that capable.

754
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,289
So I think that self-awareness feedback piece

755
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:38,769
is important.

756
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,710
And the other thing for me that I care about a

757
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,849
lot,

758
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,630
when we wanted to reset the attributes of people

759
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,650
for hiring and for performance management,

760
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,470
I wanted one thing in there and one thing only,

761
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:48,109
which was passion.

762
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:48,710
Um,

763
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,369
and I was told that you can't just have passion.

764
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:52,009
You also need good judgment and decision-making.

765
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,690
You need other things such as leadership skills

766
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,230
and so on.

767
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,150
But passion is so important that somebody's

768
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,490
passionate,

769
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:58,869
but it spills over sometimes for inappropriate

770
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:01,730
behaviors or some things you can deal with that

771
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,009
very hard to turn somebody doesn't give a shit

772
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:04,730
and somebody does.

773
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:07,029
And that's the piece that I really care about

774
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,450
the most.

775
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:08,009
Yeah.

776
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:09,470
I wanted to speak to you about passion because

777
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,089
I have read that that is,

778
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,569
you know,

779
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,049
a key ingredient in your world.

780
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:15,269
And I love it because it aligns with,

781
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:15,930
uh,

782
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,470
the way I see the world too.

783
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:17,710
And I,

784
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,069
and I think,

785
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:19,710
and I think there are a lot of people out there

786
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:19,950
that,

787
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,150
that,

788
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,670
that linger in a space that is not full of any

789
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,529
passion at all.

790
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:23,750
And,

791
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,470
and we get,

792
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:25,289
you know,

793
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,170
the need to support a lifestyle in our families.

794
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,430
But from your experience,

795
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,910
if you can marry passion with work,

796
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,210
that that's a sweet spot.

797
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:33,609
Is that?

798
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:33,910
Yeah.

799
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:34,670
Passion with some,

800
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:35,630
some basic skills.

801
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:35,890
Yes.

802
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,809
Passion without skills.

803
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,309
We've seen a bit of that or particularly without

804
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:39,750
judgment can be problematic,

805
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,450
but yeah,

806
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:40,690
it's,

807
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,490
it's for me,

808
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:41,789
as I said,

809
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:42,589
you can work with that.

810
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:43,150
Yeah.

811
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,650
And someone who genuinely cares,

812
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:45,069
you can,

813
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:47,230
they're also going to try to make themselves better.

814
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:47,970
They're also going to,

815
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,029
they're trying to do what they need to do the

816
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:49,730
best they can be.

817
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,910
If somebody doesn't care,

818
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:51,109
it's,

819
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:51,750
as I said before,

820
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,069
it's not,

821
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,109
not that easy to fix.

822
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:56,109
You've gone through your own succession planning

823
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:56,890
in recent times,

824
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,009
handed the reins over to Ian Narev,

825
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:00,970
who was the former CEO of the Commonwealth Bank.

826
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:01,990
So you,

827
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,509
you've had the foresight after an extended period,

828
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:05,849
22 years.

829
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:07,230
How was that process?

830
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:09,089
I read that he asked you several times,

831
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:10,910
are you sure you want to do this?

832
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:12,390
Oh,

833
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:12,529
no,

834
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:13,029
it's kind of busy.

835
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,190
At some point it's the,

836
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,289
it's the responsible thing to do to think about

837
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:17,450
succession planning first.

838
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:17,890
And as,

839
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,410
it's been on my mind for some time.

840
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,670
I always wanted to make sure that,

841
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:24,710
I think the test for me is I'm only going to hand

842
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,890
over when I feel good about keeping most of my

843
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,390
shares and feel more excited about the prospects

844
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,210
of the business than ever,

845
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:32,130
rather than wanting to hand over at a time when I

846
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,769
was nervous about the prospects of the business.

847
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:35,750
And Ian's terrific.

848
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,309
So Ian,

849
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:36,630
you know,

850
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:38,970
Ian joined me in a CRO role effectively.

851
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:40,750
We got on while he was at the CBA.

852
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:41,829
We had a few conversations.

853
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:43,869
We maintained contact in between.

854
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,930
He was extremely impressive bloke.

855
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:46,210
And I,

856
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,750
I kind of knew that he was a guy.

857
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:47,930
And,

858
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,869
and through all the CBA stuff was doing everything

859
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:50,809
he could to fix things.

860
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,369
Albert didn't do a 10 out of 10 job,

861
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,609
but did all he could to fix things.

862
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,049
Extremely high integrity guy,

863
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,509
extremely smart guy,

864
00:20:58,009 --> 00:20:58,690
and a very,

865
00:20:58,769 --> 00:20:59,289
very good leader.

866
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,349
And I probably had,

867
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,769
when we appointed him in the original role,

868
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:03,130
I probably had 60 or 70 people,

869
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:03,930
some of whom I knew,

870
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:05,130
but many of whom I didn't know,

871
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,349
saying that's the greatest appointment I've ever seen.

872
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,970
It probably was one of the best things I've done.

873
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,069
And then once you start working alongside someone

874
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,269
like Ian and you realise that 80% of the job that

875
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:13,569
you're doing,

876
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,829
he can do so much better than you,

877
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,410
succession planning becomes very,

878
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:16,910
very easy.

879
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,329
Again,

880
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:18,950
I love the humility,

881
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:19,589
great leadership,

882
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,410
always feel like they can hire someone that's,

883
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,750
that's better and smarter and use that language.

884
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,170
Clearly you handed him a fairly established.

885
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:29,670
It's easier for me to find people who are better

886
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:29,970
than me,

887
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:31,410
smarter than me than for somebody else.

888
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:34,170
I suspect that's not the case at all,

889
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,849
but I also fascinated him around,

890
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:37,470
so seeks this huge,

891
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,849
you know,

892
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:40,190
business that's operating,

893
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:40,609
as we said,

894
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,250
with over 3000 employees on a global scale,

895
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,809
but you've carved out a space that you wanted to

896
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:48,849
separate out from the seek business in the venture

897
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:49,750
capital world.

898
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,109
And you mentioned this,

899
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,230
there's some specific pillars you're going after online

900
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,910
education is one of them.

901
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,390
And you want to get back to supporting founders that

902
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,349
were like you and,

903
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,029
and,

904
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,230
uh,

905
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,789
and your brother and Matt back in 1997.

906
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:03,430
Tell us why that's so important for you.

907
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,049
Yeah,

908
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:04,210
look,

909
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:04,829
I think,

910
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:05,170
um,

911
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:08,170
once we sort of worked on the succession path and I

912
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,910
had some really good conversations and there was a

913
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,589
bunch of assets we've been investing in,

914
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:12,009
um,

915
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:12,809
in education,

916
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:13,490
in HR,

917
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:13,869
SAS,

918
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:15,069
in contingent employment,

919
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:16,750
originally with the view,

920
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,970
that some of those assets would fit with sake over

921
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:19,329
time.

922
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,549
The more we pushed down that path,

923
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,990
the more we saw there was some synergies in there,

924
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,930
but this was just a separate pool of assets.

925
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,750
It probably didn't make sense for sake longterm.

926
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,869
Some of the shareholders were getting frustrated with,

927
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:31,509
um,

928
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:32,410
the losses growing,

929
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,809
which makes sense for these business because we believe they

930
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:35,890
should continue to invest,

931
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:36,490
um,

932
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,470
in a bright future as we lost money for a long

933
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,250
time in sake.

934
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,549
So it kind of made sense for sake to think about

935
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:42,130
them separately.

936
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:42,509
And for me,

937
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:42,769
yeah,

938
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:44,049
I really enjoy working with founders.

939
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:46,390
I really enjoy working with perhaps more early stage,

940
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,569
dynamic businesses facing more strategic challenges than some of the

941
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,069
operational challenges of big business,

942
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,029
like seek faces,

943
00:22:52,349 --> 00:22:52,569
um,

944
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:55,269
which is so much better suited to generally than I am.

945
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:56,950
So it kind of just worked for sake.

946
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,390
It worked for me and I've enjoyed it.

947
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,690
It's been,

948
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:58,809
uh,

949
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:00,009
I think it's been good for all of us.

950
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:00,569
Um,

951
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:01,509
and I'm starting to enjoy it.

952
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:03,369
And if people out there listing that,

953
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:04,089
um,

954
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:04,329
you know,

955
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:07,390
I want to start a business or want to get

956
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,730
into the entrepreneurial space.

957
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,170
So what's your advice?

958
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:13,029
Lots of people will give the data and tell you how

959
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:13,990
many of them fail.

960
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,670
But I mean,

961
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,269
clearly you're backing people,

962
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:17,170
to do what,

963
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,190
what you've created.

964
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,349
What,

965
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:19,750
what would you say to someone who wants to go

966
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,170
down this road?

967
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,930
It's a tough question because it's,

968
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,210
um,

969
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,589
I think the thing that tends to separate people that

970
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:27,130
do take the plunge from those that don't,

971
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:27,769
um,

972
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,369
it's in particular things about assessment of risk,

973
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:30,630
right?

974
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,670
So I think entrepreneurs tend to be aware of risks,

975
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:36,509
but they're willing to take them and recognize there's a

976
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:37,069
fair chance.

977
00:23:37,069 --> 00:23:37,589
In our case,

978
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:39,410
there was probably a very hard chance that business would

979
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,069
fall over,

980
00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:41,289
but we thought we'll survive.

981
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:42,930
We'll go back to our job with our tail between the

982
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:43,150
legs,

983
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:43,809
but we'll survive.

984
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:44,609
We're okay with that.

985
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:46,269
So I think that there tends to be a,

986
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,069
for some people who don't take the plunge,

987
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:50,569
this fear that if this goes wrong,

988
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:51,009
my life,

989
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:51,210
you know,

990
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,950
life will be horrible and I won't be able to deal

991
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,230
with it.

992
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,190
So you can't necessarily change that,

993
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,190
but if you're on the fence,

994
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,809
usually I'd just encourage people to just do it and

995
00:23:58,809 --> 00:23:59,470
have a crack,

996
00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:00,069
try.

997
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:02,349
If you try and fail and get up again and have a

998
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:02,890
second try,

999
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,509
I think Australia is very accepting of that,

1000
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:05,069
um,

1001
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,069
give you a chance.

1002
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,829
And so typically just if you're thinking about it,

1003
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:09,190
do it,

1004
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:09,670
um,

1005
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,869
provided you've got a good idea.

1006
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:10,990
And,

1007
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:11,150
you know,

1008
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,769
I do challenge people when they come to me for

1009
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:13,269
investment,

1010
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:13,549
you know,

1011
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:15,609
you need to be solving a real problem.

1012
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:16,269
You need to be doing it,

1013
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:17,650
for the right reasons if you're doing it to make

1014
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,670
money and then can work.

1015
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,150
Um,

1016
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,410
if you're doing it because you really think there's

1017
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,269
this problem that you're passionate about solving

1018
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,309
and you've got a,

1019
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:26,589
a good thought to take that forward or,

1020
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:27,430
and the rest of it,

1021
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:27,950
great.

1022
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:28,670
Um,

1023
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,849
so it's doing it for the right reasons and being

1024
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:31,650
aware of the risks.

1025
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,430
Going back to your original partnership,

1026
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:34,690
um,

1027
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:35,269
did you,

1028
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:36,690
did you get some great advice?

1029
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,549
Was there a particular great mentor and probably a

1030
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:40,630
supplementary part to that?

1031
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,069
You're in business with your brother.

1032
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:42,970
So the family part,

1033
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:43,829
uh,

1034
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:44,890
crosses over,

1035
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:45,390
um,

1036
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:45,950
and,

1037
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,150
and,

1038
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,890
and Matt Rockman obviously as well.

1039
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,630
Was there moments that partnership had,

1040
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,170
had challenges or did it just gel straight away?

1041
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:52,390
And,

1042
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,250
and did you get any specific great advice?

1043
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:54,910
Um,

1044
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:55,269
no,

1045
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:55,410
look,

1046
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:55,750
we,

1047
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,549
we never really had great mentors.

1048
00:24:57,549 --> 00:24:58,450
I think when we started,

1049
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,230
it was really early.

1050
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,029
So I think it was starting to happen in the US

1051
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:02,650
in terms of people leaving their job to these,

1052
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:03,730
do these sorts of things.

1053
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,150
But,

1054
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:04,569
um,

1055
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:05,869
really in 97,

1056
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:07,369
there wasn't too much of that in Australia.

1057
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:09,549
Probably the one example actually was Paul might give

1058
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,349
a different answer here because he had a relationship

1059
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:13,250
with Evan Thornley who started Look Smart,

1060
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,230
which perhaps opened Paul's eyes to the opportunity a

1061
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:15,529
bit.

1062
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:16,569
In my case,

1063
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:16,849
no.

1064
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:17,289
And in fact,

1065
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:18,109
everyone I spoke to,

1066
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:18,410
you know,

1067
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:18,849
yeah,

1068
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:20,089
but why the hell would you,

1069
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:21,650
why the hell would you leave a secure job to do

1070
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,490
something like this?

1071
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,789
So there wasn't so much in the mentoring space on the

1072
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:25,289
partnership.

1073
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:25,410
Look,

1074
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,849
we were lucky because I think none of us were,

1075
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:30,049
I think it's fair to say the other two might not

1076
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:30,809
like me saying it,

1077
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:33,589
but none of us were anywhere near equipped to run

1078
00:25:33,589 --> 00:25:34,670
something like this on our own.

1079
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:35,390
Um,

1080
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,750
we all have quite different skills,

1081
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,970
but we had all had quite big gaps in our skillset.

1082
00:25:39,349 --> 00:25:40,730
The three of us between us,

1083
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:42,170
I think made a good leader.

1084
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,769
And then we learned from each other and we learned

1085
00:25:43,769 --> 00:25:44,569
from the experience.

1086
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:45,410
I think we all got better.

1087
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,490
As leaders in our own right.

1088
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,109
So I think the fact that we had high degree of

1089
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:48,589
trust,

1090
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:49,730
which is important,

1091
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:50,230
obviously,

1092
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:53,269
and complimentary skills made it far easier than

1093
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:54,970
would have any of us try to do it on our own.

1094
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:55,549
Yeah.

1095
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:57,650
I've heard this ringing my ears again.

1096
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,690
I love the opportunity to speak to people like you

1097
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,269
because the lessons are so profound,

1098
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,789
but the great partnership,

1099
00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:04,589
shared vision,

1100
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:07,970
got to have that complimentary capabilities and shared values

1101
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,529
without those things.

1102
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:11,269
You're probably in trouble when it sounds like you've

1103
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:11,630
got that.

1104
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:11,990
Right.

1105
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,150
Yeah.

1106
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,609
And the shared values I left off,

1107
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:14,450
but it is important.

1108
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:14,690
You've,

1109
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,390
you're doing a better job.

1110
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,509
I've managed for my question than I am.

1111
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:18,210
So thank you very much for that Luke,

1112
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,230
but the you're right.

1113
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,029
And that's where the trust comes in because you knew

1114
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:21,750
the values were high.

1115
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,130
We had a high degree of confidence in that.

1116
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,150
So people look at,

1117
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:24,609
you know,

1118
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:25,890
started in 97 and seek,

1119
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:26,549
as I said,

1120
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:27,150
you know,

1121
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:30,630
$10 billion business and an extraordinary success story

1122
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,829
on every level.

1123
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:32,630
But you know,

1124
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,069
you go back to 2011,

1125
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,990
the emergence of LinkedIn and I read with interest,

1126
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,849
I think I'll quote some of your language.

1127
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:42,089
We had to change everything about our business to survive.

1128
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:43,890
If we didn't move fast,

1129
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,369
we would have been stuffed.

1130
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:49,109
That that's probably an untold story in my mind.

1131
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:49,289
I,

1132
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:50,910
I was a bit surprised when I read it.

1133
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,150
Man,

1134
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:51,509
how,

1135
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,410
how big a challenge was that?

1136
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:52,769
Yeah,

1137
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:52,890
no,

1138
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:53,549
it was pretty tough.

1139
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:53,910
Cause I look,

1140
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,529
that was actually extremely well done.

1141
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,849
Paul is clearly smarter than me,

1142
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,289
but that was just after Paul left.

1143
00:26:58,349 --> 00:26:58,890
Um,

1144
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,410
and so Paul left effectively the end of 2010.

1145
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,009
This is your brother,

1146
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:02,369
Paul.

1147
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:02,730
Yeah.

1148
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,210
Paul left.

1149
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:03,789
And so I was,

1150
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,089
I became so CEO and probably I was spending more of my

1151
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:08,490
time outside the core business.

1152
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,269
And I sort of refocused on the core business.

1153
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:12,390
And what became obvious early in 2011,

1154
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:13,170
um,

1155
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,509
is that LinkedIn had,

1156
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:15,150
um,

1157
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,369
many more people than us in employment,

1158
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:18,269
registered employment,

1159
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,369
that we had much more data about those people and was

1160
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:21,750
working hard to get the ads,

1161
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:22,410
um,

1162
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:25,170
indeed had many more job ads than us through scraping and

1163
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,789
was working really hard to get the people.

1164
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:28,049
When you say scraping,

1165
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:28,710
what does that mean?

1166
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,009
Scraping basically means putting the ads on the site for

1167
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:31,410
free.

1168
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,890
I'm extracting the data.

1169
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,289
I actually don't even know the technical,

1170
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:35,549
I don't even know how it works technically.

1171
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:36,490
That's not my skillset,

1172
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,670
but pulling data off,

1173
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,890
off company websites and putting on their own website

1174
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:41,910
effectively for free.

1175
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,650
So they had all the free ads and more than us.

1176
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,369
We always thought that our moats were,

1177
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,710
once you have all the job ads,

1178
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,750
you can't get all the job seekers and vice versa.

1179
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,750
But what each of LinkedIn indeed have done and taken one

1180
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:55,049
piece of that without the other that made them very threatening.

1181
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:57,029
The other thing we found was we started to realize that

1182
00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:00,130
product and tech was going to become the new battleground.

1183
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:02,410
If these guys are outspending it through a scale of 30

1184
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:02,910
to one,

1185
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:04,009
and we were to be frank,

1186
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:05,769
three out of 10 in product and tech at best,

1187
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:08,009
and these guys were really good at massively bigger.

1188
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:10,650
So we really had to solve that problem from a low

1189
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:11,009
base.

1190
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:12,390
We really had to take on the fight,

1191
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:13,009
um,

1192
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:13,950
pretty directly.

1193
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,450
We could have,

1194
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:15,390
we could have run,

1195
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,670
from the fight and there were ways we could have run

1196
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,269
from the fight,

1197
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:19,710
but it wasn't really our nature.

1198
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,009
So we,

1199
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:21,029
we took the file up directly.

1200
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:21,650
It'd be Frank.

1201
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,190
I spent the first six months,

1202
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,329
um,

1203
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:27,089
thinking that we were going to struggle to win.

1204
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:28,650
And so I thought we were stuffed.

1205
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:29,150
Um,

1206
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,250
so I've said it later,

1207
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:31,869
but I couldn't tell him when I thought we were stuffed to

1208
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:32,069
that.

1209
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:32,970
I can now say it.

1210
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,529
So my job in the company was,

1211
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:34,730
yeah,

1212
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:34,990
we're,

1213
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,910
we're going to find his,

1214
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,609
how we're going to fight.

1215
00:28:36,609 --> 00:28:37,150
I'm going to win.

1216
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,069
I was pretty,

1217
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,750
I was not that confident to be frank.

1218
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:40,730
So when,

1219
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,450
in those moments as a leader,

1220
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,210
you've got a lot of people then under your care.

1221
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,529
So there was a chance in your mind,

1222
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:46,910
if you didn't get that right,

1223
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,369
seek is no longer a viable option.

1224
00:28:49,369 --> 00:28:49,970
I think it's,

1225
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:50,809
I think it's a,

1226
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:52,789
it becomes a $3 share price run.

1227
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:54,470
The $30 share price was to be frank,

1228
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,009
the risk.

1229
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:55,789
Um,

1230
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:56,390
and to be honest,

1231
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,529
I was so focused on doing whatever we could.

1232
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,390
It became clear after about three months,

1233
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,349
how we should respond and what we needed to do.

1234
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,369
The execution challenge was enormous.

1235
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,349
We knew what we had to do.

1236
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:08,450
So the overwhelming focus for all of us in my job

1237
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,650
was to never show that doubt was to just fight that

1238
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,009
fight.

1239
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,549
And I couldn't be prouder.

1240
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:14,069
It was,

1241
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:14,170
it was,

1242
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:14,190
it was,

1243
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,250
it was much more other people.

1244
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:15,470
I don't,

1245
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,190
we'd still know nothing about product and tech and

1246
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,789
all those sorts of things with a bunch of people

1247
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:21,950
who led those areas and did it beautifully and

1248
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,490
delivered,

1249
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:22,789
you know,

1250
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:23,329
beyond,

1251
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:24,869
beyond all my expectations.

1252
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:25,369
But,

1253
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:25,789
um,

1254
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:27,450
we're so focused on fighting that fight.

1255
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,890
You can't worry too much about losing it.

1256
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,289
Just to digress a bit from that.

1257
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:32,369
And you said something,

1258
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:32,609
you know,

1259
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:34,589
you said a lot of very profound things,

1260
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:35,009
but one of them,

1261
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:36,930
when people come to you and an idea to make money

1262
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:37,289
for money,

1263
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:38,950
say not interested,

1264
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,289
you're solving a world problem.

1265
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:41,809
You're solving an issue,

1266
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:43,069
which is effectively,

1267
00:29:43,109 --> 00:29:44,150
if you read the values of,

1268
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:44,930
of seek,

1269
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,490
which I mentioned a little earlier,

1270
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,450
that that's where you guys started out wanting to

1271
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,690
solve a problem.

1272
00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:54,470
Why then education and online education as a,

1273
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:54,670
as,

1274
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,509
as one of the pillars that you're focused on now,

1275
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:56,690
what,

1276
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,309
what are you trying to solve there?

1277
00:29:58,309 --> 00:29:58,609
And what,

1278
00:29:58,609 --> 00:29:59,569
what are some examples of it?

1279
00:29:59,589 --> 00:29:59,990
Yeah,

1280
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,230
it's,

1281
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,470
um,

1282
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:01,309
I'll come to that.

1283
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:02,829
So your first point is really important.

1284
00:30:02,829 --> 00:30:03,190
Profound.

1285
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,210
We haven't got to before,

1286
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,829
which is around the focus on other stuff rather than

1287
00:30:06,829 --> 00:30:07,390
making money.

1288
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,609
And even as a business,

1289
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:11,190
every time we felt shareholder pressure or some other

1290
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,890
reason why we should focus on money and stopped focus

1291
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,029
on the,

1292
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:15,470
on the fundamentals of the business and building the

1293
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,230
marketplace.

1294
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:17,630
Firstly,

1295
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,970
the fundamentals went backwards.

1296
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:19,490
And secondly,

1297
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,490
we didn't make any more money.

1298
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,869
And every time we corrected ourselves and reinforced that

1299
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:24,109
focus on the fundamentals,

1300
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:26,630
we found the fundamentals grew and we made money quicker

1301
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,309
than we expected.

1302
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:27,650
And so,

1303
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,170
so really this focus on whatever the fundamentals of your

1304
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,910
business are and then revenue,

1305
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:32,809
and then from there,

1306
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:34,809
profit at the output of that labor,

1307
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:36,410
rather than the focus for me,

1308
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,589
it's just an essential business.

1309
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:39,170
And I think that's one of the things we bring to the

1310
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:43,369
new businesses that we invest in specifically in education.

1311
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:43,490
Yeah.

1312
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:43,789
We sort of,

1313
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:45,109
we stumbled in there to be frank,

1314
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:45,230
you know,

1315
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,690
we stumbled in there because a lot of education providers,

1316
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,710
once we grew our audience,

1317
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,970
we're knocking on our door saying that we would love to

1318
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,509
get access to your audience because it's a very relevant context.

1319
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:54,529
Um,

1320
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,470
and we set up an area of the site that allowed people

1321
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,089
to connect with education providers.

1322
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:00,509
It was so buried.

1323
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:01,910
I couldn't even find the damn thing,

1324
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,549
but somehow we were driving decent volumes to these education

1325
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:05,089
providers.

1326
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:08,109
And we sort of started to realize the connection between

1327
00:31:08,109 --> 00:31:10,730
employment and education as being a very strong one.

1328
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:13,789
We realized that education had all sorts of problems.

1329
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:17,450
That needed to be solved that we actually had some unique

1330
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,069
insights in.

1331
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,069
So we still know,

1332
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:19,569
for example,

1333
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:20,329
better than anyone,

1334
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:22,309
where all the shortages are for candidates,

1335
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:23,150
where there's roles,

1336
00:31:23,329 --> 00:31:25,490
but no candidates and where there's a skill gap.

1337
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:28,430
And therefore what education need to fill that skill gap and

1338
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,269
all sorts of similar aspects that we bring,

1339
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,390
we felt we had a right to play in that space.

1340
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:34,369
And education has been very successful for us.

1341
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,210
And you link that back,

1342
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,869
you're a father of four and I I'll make that link now.

1343
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:40,069
And,

1344
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:42,029
and your philosophies in,

1345
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:43,029
in SEEK and,

1346
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:43,289
and,

1347
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:44,190
and your values.

1348
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:44,569
I mean,

1349
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,609
I love asking the parenting question as a father of four as

1350
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:48,009
well.

1351
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:49,289
Are they the same?

1352
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:51,410
Do they cross over in to the way that you've,

1353
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,069
you've parented?

1354
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,170
Oh,

1355
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:53,470
you,

1356
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:53,730
you,

1357
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:55,650
I think my,

1358
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,130
I think my,

1359
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,009
my employees are probably more kind about me than my children

1360
00:31:59,009 --> 00:31:59,529
at the moment.

1361
00:31:59,529 --> 00:32:00,269
So my kids,

1362
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,609
my kids say,

1363
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,890
so they might have some more,

1364
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:03,890
they probably see more,

1365
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:04,549
more the,

1366
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:06,450
the more warts and all version of me,

1367
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:06,890
but the,

1368
00:32:07,109 --> 00:32:08,670
my kids are between 22 and 15.

1369
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,250
It's a mixed view,

1370
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:09,569
but yeah,

1371
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:10,069
you try to,

1372
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:11,289
you try to parent the same way.

1373
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:11,789
And I'm probably,

1374
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:12,930
I'm probably too,

1375
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,269
you know,

1376
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:14,869
you try to just do what,

1377
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:15,549
be who you are.

1378
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:17,589
And I think SEEK has mostly,

1379
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,069
you talked about authenticity before.

1380
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:22,089
We've done our best to just be honest with people,

1381
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:25,750
focus on the things that are important and discard the things

1382
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,410
that are less important.

1383
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,029
We've tried with our kids to do the same,

1384
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:28,230
you know,

1385
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,369
certainly plenty of love,

1386
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,490
plenty of attention and time.

1387
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:33,410
And they're a work in progress to whether we've done a good

1388
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:33,670
job.

1389
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:34,430
Yeah.

1390
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:34,910
It's a,

1391
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:36,430
it's always a work in progress.

1392
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:36,789
I,

1393
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:40,190
I love asking that question because I think it's a discussion

1394
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,029
that we don't have enough.

1395
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:43,210
It certainly gets some feedback from mine too.

1396
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:43,450
Andrew,

1397
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,730
I think they are pretty harsh on me.

1398
00:32:45,849 --> 00:32:48,190
We've been identifying through that conversations,

1399
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,529
Andrew,

1400
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,970
with what we think dimensions of great leadership look like.

1401
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:55,809
And so please be expansive on this or as condensed as you

1402
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:56,109
like,

1403
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,529
but we see great leaders have a concept of self-leadership

1404
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:00,049
first.

1405
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,849
Does that term resonate with you?

1406
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,390
And what does it mean when I say that to you?

1407
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,690
Looking after myself and doing that stuff,

1408
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,410
probably I don't do as well as I should have.

1409
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:10,049
I tend to be kind of task focused on doing the,

1410
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:12,849
what I need to do for the business and then family focused.

1411
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:13,269
And then,

1412
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,529
then the other stuff and football football club comes in there as well.

1413
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,789
But yeah,

1414
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:20,670
there's definitely something about setting the right example.

1415
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:20,970
I think,

1416
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:21,170
you know,

1417
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:25,130
we've mostly done this reasonably well at SEEK and when in 2011,

1418
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,009
late 2011,

1419
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:29,730
we sort of re-articulated the values and we had a fresh cut at it.

1420
00:33:30,089 --> 00:33:32,910
It was really important to us that there was the,

1421
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:37,769
we were sort of describing the behaviors of the exec as well as what we were

1422
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:40,349
asking for from the staff and the worst thing you can possibly do.

1423
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:43,250
And I saw it in my two previous employers is the values of,

1424
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,589
one thing or what you're espousing is one thing and the behaviors of the

1425
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:47,009
leaders is something quite different.

1426
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:48,569
People aren't stupid.

1427
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,269
People pick that up and it becomes a,

1428
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:53,890
it's worse than not having it if the leaders aren't living those values and,

1429
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,150
and exhibiting those behaviors.

1430
00:33:55,289 --> 00:33:55,650
So we've,

1431
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:57,329
that's sort of,

1432
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:57,970
as I said,

1433
00:33:58,009 --> 00:33:58,309
I'm not,

1434
00:33:58,609 --> 00:34:00,309
perhaps not fully understanding the term.

1435
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:01,450
That's what you're getting at.

1436
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:02,130
We do pretty well.

1437
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:04,849
I was looking after myself so I can be the best I can be.

1438
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:05,049
No,

1439
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:05,970
I do a poor job at that.

1440
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:06,250
Well,

1441
00:34:06,269 --> 00:34:08,070
I think your humility is just so extreme,

1442
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:09,170
Andrew,

1443
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:12,250
that you're probably not allowing yourself to reflect on that because,

1444
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:12,789
you know,

1445
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:13,349
as I said,

1446
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,369
in doing some research,

1447
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:14,889
you know,

1448
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:18,530
I spoke to some people that have worked under your leadership and they say it

1449
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:21,909
is an extraordinary place to work because you've created that environment.

1450
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:22,989
It's fascinating to hear that,

1451
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:23,429
you know,

1452
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:24,550
you did work as a consultant,

1453
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,989
you have worked in professional firms before.

1454
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:31,590
Did you see that gap between leaders not living values?

1455
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:35,050
Was that a conscious thing for you when you became the leader of a big

1456
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:35,389
organization?

1457
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,090
I did.

1458
00:34:36,329 --> 00:34:36,989
I probably,

1459
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:38,570
I should probably be careful with that.

1460
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,050
There were some good people at my former employers and some bad people.

1461
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:41,949
That's always the case.

1462
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,409
But yeah,

1463
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:46,329
there were quite a few examples of people saying one thing and doing another

1464
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:52,550
that really struck me and the hypocrisy really struck me a lot in terms of I knew

1465
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,769
how demotivating that was for me.

1466
00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:55,230
I knew how frustrating that was for me.

1467
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:58,269
And perhaps I had the advantage or disadvantage,

1468
00:34:58,389 --> 00:35:01,070
but probably as an advantage in hindsight and going from being very low on the

1469
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:05,949
totem pole to overnight becoming one of the leaders in the organization and not

1470
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:06,489
having any,

1471
00:35:06,489 --> 00:35:11,789
any perhaps retraining through middle management where moving from behaving like

1472
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:12,389
this and seeing,

1473
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:14,769
seeing things like that to that get retrained out if you,

1474
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:15,309
whatever it is,

1475
00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:15,949
something similar.

1476
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:16,670
But I am,

1477
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,050
yeah,

1478
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,650
some of the things that struck with me with a negative example that I said,

1479
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,650
I just don't want to be the leader that's doing that.

1480
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:23,909
And I want to be,

1481
00:35:23,909 --> 00:35:24,650
if I say something,

1482
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,730
I want to be trying to do it.

1483
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,130
If I,

1484
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,489
if I'm asking something from somebody,

1485
00:35:27,489 --> 00:35:28,530
I want to be doing it myself.

1486
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:35,329
So perhaps the small time gap between being on the bottom and being on the top

1487
00:35:35,789 --> 00:35:38,130
assisted me to be a less hypocritical leader.

1488
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:38,570
Yeah,

1489
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,829
that's a unique perspective.

1490
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:40,730
And that to me is,

1491
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,369
is a really great form of self leadership.

1492
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:42,869
As,

1493
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:43,610
as,

1494
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,610
as we started that,

1495
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,230
that question,

1496
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:45,530
what we,

1497
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,829
we see leaders in other dimension,

1498
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:47,110
Andrew,

1499
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:47,909
are really,

1500
00:35:47,909 --> 00:35:51,949
they're really conscious of how they positively impact others in the environment that they're

1501
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:52,949
around.

1502
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:54,449
Is that something you go,

1503
00:35:54,449 --> 00:35:58,550
go thought to along the way in terms of the impact of the environment in terms of your

1504
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:01,610
impact on other people around you in a positive way?

1505
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:02,610
Yeah.

1506
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,610
I sort of,

1507
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,610
I probably underestimated it for a long time.

1508
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,610
And so,

1509
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:06,610
you know,

1510
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:07,610
I've,

1511
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:08,610
I've,

1512
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:09,610
I've been fortunate to be surrounded by some good people who,

1513
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,610
which is a lucky,

1514
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,610
lucky piece who will be honest with me.

1515
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,130
Hey,

1516
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,130
you know,

1517
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,130
and you,

1518
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,130
you're always better off having people to be honest with you and those who weren't.

1519
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:19,489
And I'm probably part of the feedback I've got that I've now appreciated much better

1520
00:36:19,489 --> 00:36:20,489
is,

1521
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:21,489
you know,

1522
00:36:21,489 --> 00:36:23,809
I have a bigger impact than I realized I had in terms of what I say and what I do or

1523
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:25,309
the conversations I might have with people.

1524
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:26,309
So I've tried to,

1525
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,710
I still don't probably maximize that,

1526
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,150
but I now understand it better than I did.

1527
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,150
And so,

1528
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,250
and therefore trying to use whatever power I have more effectively for good,

1529
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,250
of course,

1530
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,250
not for evil.

1531
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,250
And I've heard that a lot about you,

1532
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,250
Andrew,

1533
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,250
over,

1534
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,449
over the journey and even in your role at St Kilda.

1535
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:41,449
Footy clubs are unique places.

1536
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:41,949
Yeah.

1537
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:42,949
As well,

1538
00:36:42,949 --> 00:36:43,949
but that you very much,

1539
00:36:43,949 --> 00:36:44,949
uh,

1540
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:47,949
collaborative people feel like they get a voice in the environment.

1541
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:48,949
You,

1542
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:49,949
you celebrate people who,

1543
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:50,949
who,

1544
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:51,949
who work closely around you and that it,

1545
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:53,949
it sort of comes naturally to you.

1546
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:54,949
It's not,

1547
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:56,949
I've got all the answers and I'm sitting at the top of the hierarchy,

1548
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:58,949
which we see as sort of the old version of leadership.

1549
00:36:58,949 --> 00:36:59,949
Is it,

1550
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:01,949
it's a bit easier when you don't have many answers to,

1551
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:02,949
to,

1552
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:03,949
to get help in getting the answer.

1553
00:37:03,949 --> 00:37:04,949
But I think,

1554
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:05,949
yeah,

1555
00:37:05,949 --> 00:37:06,949
I think I've experienced,

1556
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:07,949
you know,

1557
00:37:07,949 --> 00:37:08,949
the smartest people sometimes that I've,

1558
00:37:08,949 --> 00:37:10,949
I've seen on the journey because they're so smart.

1559
00:37:10,949 --> 00:37:11,949
Sometimes,

1560
00:37:11,949 --> 00:37:16,949
sometimes don't realise the benefit of just the debate and the challenge that they can get.

1561
00:37:16,949 --> 00:37:17,949
And therefore they know all the answers.

1562
00:37:17,949 --> 00:37:19,949
Therefore they don't have to listen to anyone else.

1563
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:24,949
And so many of the careers of those people I've seen get derailed relative to the people,

1564
00:37:24,949 --> 00:37:25,949
perhaps who aren't as smart,

1565
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:27,949
who perhaps don't have as many of the answers,

1566
00:37:27,949 --> 00:37:28,949
but are willing to listen.

1567
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:30,949
And you're seeing that in a football environment.

1568
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:31,949
You're seeing that with things like coaches,

1569
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:32,949
the coach that listened versus the,

1570
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:33,949
you know,

1571
00:37:33,949 --> 00:37:34,949
the old all powerful coach.

1572
00:37:34,949 --> 00:37:37,949
You're starting to see it's more of a team solution than a,

1573
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:39,949
an individual person solution.

1574
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:41,949
And we see leaders are really conscious,

1575
00:37:41,949 --> 00:37:43,949
about their ability to create and,

1576
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:44,949
and share a vision.

1577
00:37:44,949 --> 00:37:45,949
I mean,

1578
00:37:45,949 --> 00:37:46,949
SEEK was,

1579
00:37:46,949 --> 00:37:47,949
was a big vision.

1580
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:52,949
You said a hundred competitors taking on some of the most powerful cash,

1581
00:37:52,949 --> 00:37:53,949
full organisations,

1582
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:55,949
as we mentioned with Fairfax and,

1583
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:57,949
and Rupert Murdoch's News Limited.

1584
00:37:57,949 --> 00:37:58,949
I mean,

1585
00:37:58,949 --> 00:37:59,949
how did you go about creating and,

1586
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:01,949
and sharing that vision consciously?

1587
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:02,949
In terms of the,

1588
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:03,949
how we compete?

1589
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:04,949
Yeah,

1590
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:05,949
it's,

1591
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:06,949
it's sort of one step at a time,

1592
00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:07,949
you know,

1593
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:08,949
a competitor doesn't move.

1594
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:10,949
It's funny because we look back with fondness at competing with Fairfax and News,

1595
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:12,949
we're now competing with Google and,

1596
00:38:12,949 --> 00:38:13,949
Microsoft and,

1597
00:38:13,949 --> 00:38:14,949
and,

1598
00:38:14,949 --> 00:38:15,949
and some other organisations.

1599
00:38:15,949 --> 00:38:16,949
So I,

1600
00:38:16,949 --> 00:38:17,949
I,

1601
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:18,949
I long for the day to compete with Fairfax and News,

1602
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:19,949
if that makes sense.

1603
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:20,949
But,

1604
00:38:20,949 --> 00:38:21,949
you know,

1605
00:38:21,949 --> 00:38:22,949
it's just,

1606
00:38:22,949 --> 00:38:23,949
it's just focusing on what you do.

1607
00:38:23,949 --> 00:38:24,949
And,

1608
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:25,949
you know,

1609
00:38:25,949 --> 00:38:26,949
we tend to,

1610
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:27,949
we do tend to obsess,

1611
00:38:27,949 --> 00:38:28,949
I tend to obsess about the defensible and sustainability of businesses,

1612
00:38:28,949 --> 00:38:29,949
you know,

1613
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:30,949
recognising that people are going to come after you as you,

1614
00:38:30,949 --> 00:38:31,949
as you get bigger,

1615
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:34,949
and there's going to be some of the things that you're doing can become commoditised.

1616
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:35,949
And what are going to be our barriers?

1617
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:37,949
What's going to be the things that protect us?

1618
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,949
And I think we've always felt particularly in our space,

1619
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:40,949
and probably 2011 or so,

1620
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:41,949
I won't go back over the detail of that,

1621
00:38:41,949 --> 00:38:42,949
but that was a worrying period.

1622
00:38:42,949 --> 00:38:43,949
Since probably about 2013,

1623
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:44,949
2014,

1624
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:45,949
when we knew that,

1625
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:46,949
um,

1626
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:47,949
we were starting to win the tech battle.

1627
00:38:47,949 --> 00:38:48,949
Winning and losing feels like it's in our hands.

1628
00:38:48,949 --> 00:38:49,949
And Ian,

1629
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:50,949
Ian and I have expressed it very well.

1630
00:38:50,949 --> 00:38:51,949
If we,

1631
00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:52,949
if we win our A-game,

1632
00:38:52,949 --> 00:38:53,949
there's no doubt,

1633
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:54,949
if we play our A-game,

1634
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:55,949
there's no doubt we'll be successful.

1635
00:38:55,949 --> 00:38:56,949
But we have to play our A-game.

1636
00:38:56,949 --> 00:38:57,949
So we're a little bit more able to focus on ourselves rather than worrying about competitors.

1637
00:38:57,949 --> 00:38:58,949
And did you always say it,

1638
00:38:58,949 --> 00:38:59,949
uh,

1639
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:00,949
John,

1640
00:39:00,949 --> 00:39:01,949
that,

1641
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:02,949
that,

1642
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:03,949
that,

1643
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:04,949
that,

1644
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:05,949
that,

1645
00:39:05,949 --> 00:39:06,949
that,

1646
00:39:06,949 --> 00:39:07,949
that,

1647
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:08,949
that,

1648
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:09,949
that,

1649
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:10,949
and even jumping off there,

1650
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:11,949
for a moment,

1651
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:12,949
as,

1652
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:13,949
this business that was,

1653
00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:14,949
uh,

1654
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:15,949
a lifelong business,

1655
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:16,949
I mean,

1656
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:17,949
most people would have had the,

1657
00:39:17,949 --> 00:39:18,949
the temptation Andrew,

1658
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:19,949
along the way too,

1659
00:39:19,949 --> 00:39:20,949
there would have been some significant,

1660
00:39:20,949 --> 00:39:21,949
uh,

1661
00:39:21,949 --> 00:39:22,949
offers to,

1662
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:23,949
to,

1663
00:39:23,949 --> 00:39:24,949
to cash out.

1664
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:25,949
What,

1665
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:26,949
was that a conscious decision?

1666
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:27,949
No.

1667
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:28,949
No.

1668
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:29,949
Not at all.

1669
00:39:29,949 --> 00:39:30,949
Not at all.

1670
00:39:30,949 --> 00:39:31,949
I think,

1671
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:32,949
you know,

1672
00:39:32,949 --> 00:39:33,949
when we originally jetted,

1673
00:39:33,949 --> 00:39:34,949
I wouldn't,

1674
00:39:34,949 --> 00:39:35,949
it was something that we thought was,

1675
00:39:35,949 --> 00:39:36,949
you know,

1676
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:37,949
and those,

1677
00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:38,949
that was what internet businesses were when we started.

1678
00:39:38,949 --> 00:39:39,949
And I think I,

1679
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:41,550
more than the next three to five years.

1680
00:39:41,969 --> 00:39:45,349
But at every single stage, there's either been challenges like the LinkedIn

1681
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,690
indeed or some of the other challenges we had that I thought there's no,

1682
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:51,349
I couldn't possibly step off at this point other than fight that battle.

1683
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:54,289
Or there's been fun ahead of us because we've fought the battle,

1684
00:39:54,369 --> 00:39:57,690
we've won the battle and we've got the next set of growth or something similar.

1685
00:39:57,809 --> 00:40:01,230
So there's always been enough excitement to keep me engaged for a long period

1686
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,170
of time until more recently.

1687
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:05,329
Having said that, I've still remained very close to CEC.

1688
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:06,230
I still remain on the board.

1689
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:08,190
And I, to be frank, work more in partnership.

1690
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:11,610
He runs the much harder, much bigger business and I'm running the thing

1691
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,130
off the side.

1692
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:18,949
When we see leaders regularly talk about curiosity as a means to how they

1693
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:24,110
continue to learn and improve, does curiosity ring true with you

1694
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,230
and the way you've approached things?

1695
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:25,889
Yeah.

1696
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:32,150
On that dimension, I probably would rank a lot lower than many of the CEOs

1697
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:35,510
I know, you know, who read a lot or network a lot or the rest.

1698
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:38,150
But I tend to be a bit more disciplined.

1699
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,329
I'm just task-focused in dealing.

1700
00:40:39,429 --> 00:40:41,650
When I say task-focused, that's usually thinking about the strategy

1701
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,929
and you usually think about the business.

1702
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:48,369
And perhaps the strength and weakness of CEC is we're really always charting

1703
00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:51,909
our own path and we really haven't sought the advice of others or looked

1704
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:53,869
at other companies and said, what have other companies doing?

1705
00:40:53,949 --> 00:40:55,070
This is going to be how we do things.

1706
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:58,250
We try to solve problems a little bit from the ground up and with our own view.

1707
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:02,190
But probably as a result of that, I've missed out on some learning

1708
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,869
that we might have got by being more out there.

1709
00:41:03,909 --> 00:41:05,429
So it's never really been my strength, to be honest.

1710
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:06,670
I love that.

1711
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,889
You know yourself so well.

1712
00:41:07,889 --> 00:41:11,309
And you can articulate it so well and so matter-of-factly.

1713
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:16,170
Yeah, I've had plenty of time to come to terms with my weaknesses.

1714
00:41:16,489 --> 00:41:16,750
So, yes.

1715
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:21,030
I'm into celebrating the success story, which is one of the great success

1716
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:23,090
stories in Australian business history.

1717
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,369
In my mind, we see leaders are really conscious about how they communicate

1718
00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:29,590
and really strategic about communicating with clarity.

1719
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,030
How have you gone about that?

1720
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:36,969
Yeah, again, probably not the most polished, as you're picking up now,

1721
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:37,869
or elegant.

1722
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:41,449
I think we've just tried to be pretty direct.

1723
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:45,849
So I think the one thing that has served us in good stead is internally,

1724
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,409
externally, you can't always talk about everything.

1725
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,789
There's some things that are off the table.

1726
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,269
But within those realms of what's off the table, we always try to be honest.

1727
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,829
I always try to avoid spin.

1728
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:56,590
I always try to run to promise and open deliver.

1729
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:00,369
And if you get those things right, I think it's probably similar to what we

1730
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:03,690
talked about before about the 85% or whatever number I gave you.

1731
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:07,610
If you get those things right, you're not going to be too badly off.

1732
00:42:07,889 --> 00:42:13,309
So despite the lack of polish and eloquence and general communication skills, and

1733
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:17,590
sometimes we get wrong, the frequency of communication, if you get those things

1734
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,409
wrong, it's a bit harder.

1735
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,590
But you can see your values always come through in every area of dimension we've

1736
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:28,329
talked about, honesty and integrity and giving people the best option they can

1737
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:29,170
along the way.

1738
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:33,610
We see leaders are really valued collaboration maybe more than ever in

1739
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:34,429
recent times.

1740
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:36,309
I mean, how have you thought about collaboration?

1741
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:36,829
Yeah.

1742
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:36,969
Yeah.

1743
00:42:36,969 --> 00:42:37,030
Yeah.

1744
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,110
Yeah.

1745
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:37,170
Yeah.

1746
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:37,190
Yeah.

1747
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:37,230
Yeah.

1748
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:37,250
Yeah.

1749
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:37,269
Yeah.

1750
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:37,289
Yeah.

1751
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:37,309
Yeah.

1752
00:42:37,309 --> 00:42:37,349
Yeah.

1753
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:37,369
Yeah.

1754
00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:37,389
Yeah.

1755
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:37,869
Yeah.

1756
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:37,949
Yeah.

1757
00:42:37,949 --> 00:42:37,989
Yeah.

1758
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:38,230
Yeah.

1759
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:38,269
Yeah.

1760
00:42:38,269 --> 00:42:38,409
Yeah.

1761
00:42:38,409 --> 00:42:38,429
Yeah.

1762
00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:40,630
It's kind of funny because I'm sort of thinking back and I'm going back

1763
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,230
sometime.

1764
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:46,050
We're probably a bit slow because when you're small and it's really easy,

1765
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,309
communication's really easy because everyone knows everything and

1766
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:50,610
collaboration's really easy, but it's small, so I think.

1767
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,170
I'm going to give a much worse answer.

1768
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,869
This is one of the many examples where someone like Ian really thinks about

1769
00:42:56,869 --> 00:43:00,590
this in detail and we've got this massive unification project, which is

1770
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:03,750
bringing together our technology in Australia, which is quite different

1771
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,309
from technology in Asia.

1772
00:43:05,309 --> 00:43:07,530
In fact, there's two different technologies in Asia.

1773
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:08,389
We're bringing it all together.

1774
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:10,250
We're sort of moving towards one organisation.

1775
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:13,389
There's a massive amount of collaboration needed in terms of the actual

1776
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:16,829
techniques to deal with it.

1777
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:17,570
That's someone else.

1778
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:20,829
So what I've realised is some of the things around communication, I used to

1779
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:21,570
hate the word process.

1780
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:26,010
I still do, but what I've learnt is that these things are important once you

1781
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:29,190
get bigger and I've been able to hire people who understand how to actually

1782
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:29,829
execute on that.

1783
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:31,190
That's about all I can really say to you.

1784
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:33,190
I'm sorry, but I've got no more for you.

1785
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:33,949
It's a brilliant answer.

1786
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:37,389
I'll be interested in your final two questions I've been asking.

1787
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:41,769
All the leaders I've had the privilege of speaking to and I've thoroughly

1788
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:43,190
enjoyed the experience today.

1789
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,250
Who's been the greatest leader in your life, Andrew?

1790
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:47,590
Oh, gee.

1791
00:43:48,969 --> 00:43:53,010
You know, it's kind of, I get tripped up on this all the time in terms of

1792
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,409
who's the role model, who do you look up to?

1793
00:43:54,429 --> 00:43:58,030
And it's kind of the snippets that you see of someone that you say is,

1794
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:01,429
okay, that's remarkable, that's impressive.

1795
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:04,550
But then there's other aspects of their personality that you sort of say

1796
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:05,510
that's less impressive.

1797
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,809
So you, you know.

1798
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:08,809
The extreme version is Elon Musk.

1799
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:10,909
I don't think he's an impressive person at the 80%,

1800
00:44:10,909 --> 00:44:12,570
but some of what he does is unbelievable, right?

1801
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:15,809
And so I tend to more look at bits and pieces of people and say,

1802
00:44:15,869 --> 00:44:17,929
okay, that's a really impressive trade or what they've done in this

1803
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:19,710
particular circumstance impresses me.

1804
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,949
There's not too many people I've looked to and said,

1805
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:22,929
this is the perfect leader.

1806
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:25,889
And I think, again, that's the insularity, not insularity is the wrong

1807
00:44:25,889 --> 00:44:30,369
word, but that's the not being too obsessive and curious and focused on

1808
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:32,909
other people versus focused on what I'm doing, if that makes sense.

1809
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:33,969
Yeah, it does make sense.

1810
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:34,909
I have to draw back.

1811
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:35,929
That's not an answer to be clear, yes.

1812
00:44:35,929 --> 00:44:37,510
No, it's a great answer because it's authentic.

1813
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:40,670
You know, you're not, you weren't going to say someone for the sake of

1814
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:41,130
saying someone.

1815
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:41,590
I'd be making up.

1816
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:42,250
I don't have anyone.

1817
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:43,010
And I love it.

1818
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:43,150
Yeah.

1819
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:43,829
And I love it.

1820
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:44,650
I have no candidates.

1821
00:44:44,929 --> 00:44:48,710
And I love that success takes different paths and, and, and clearly you've

1822
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:51,829
treaded your own path, but put people around you and in other areas that,

1823
00:44:51,929 --> 00:44:52,949
that fulfill the things.

1824
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:54,789
You've clearly got an incredible skill.

1825
00:44:54,869 --> 00:44:57,610
I've got to ask you, Elon Musk, 80% doesn't impress you.

1826
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,889
What, what, what, what are the things about him?

1827
00:44:59,889 --> 00:45:01,429
Oh, I just, I just put it back.

1828
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:04,989
I regret saying anyone, but I've got, I've got absolutely no one at the top

1829
00:45:04,989 --> 00:45:05,389
of my list.

1830
00:45:05,389 --> 00:45:07,090
And I think I was just trying to make the point to be honest.

1831
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:07,349
So.

1832
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,050
I chose a poor example.

1833
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:13,170
I was trying to make the point that mostly leaders have got some good things

1834
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,630
and bad things, myself included.

1835
00:45:14,889 --> 00:45:18,250
And so picking a leader and saying they're perfect, there's no one I've seen

1836
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,369
that I've elevated to that level.

1837
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,769
He has to be a fascinating person though, doesn't he?

1838
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:22,530
In what, in what he's doing.

1839
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:22,789
Yeah.

1840
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:26,230
The reason I'm trying to, again, give you a non-answer and move away from the

1841
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:28,610
question you asked is, is I just don't know enough.

1842
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:30,530
But he's been in the, he's been in the news a little bit lately.

1843
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,050
So it's sort of front of mind with the Twitter.

1844
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:33,489
He's a fascinating person.

1845
00:45:33,489 --> 00:45:37,510
And he's a person you start to wonder whether, whether Hubis has got,

1846
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:40,150
you know, yeah, we'll find out, we'll find out at the time of the track.

1847
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:42,289
But he's been, he's changed the world in a big way.

1848
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:44,449
And so he's, he's got to earn some respect for that.

1849
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:48,130
Clearly in the, in the tech sector and, you know, front of mind for a lot of

1850
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:51,789
reasons, including, you know, buying Twitter with cash in recent times is an

1851
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:52,590
interesting thing.

1852
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:55,750
And this will be interesting because I suspect I might get a similar answer

1853
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:59,710
from you, but we, if you could collaborate with one person, I mean, you've

1854
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:00,789
brought in a CEO.

1855
00:46:00,949 --> 00:46:03,829
So clearly you think about that on any area of your life.

1856
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:06,989
I mean, football, Sikh, family.

1857
00:46:06,989 --> 00:46:09,409
Is there any one that you've looked at and thought, God, that'd be a great

1858
00:46:09,409 --> 00:46:09,909
collaborator?

1859
00:46:09,969 --> 00:46:10,170
Yeah.

1860
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:13,369
And again, again, I'm going to, you know, like I'm loving working with Ian.

1861
00:46:13,489 --> 00:46:16,190
There's a bunch of people I've loved working with in the past that, so I'm not

1862
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,730
going to, I'm not going to replace them with anyone else.

1863
00:46:17,769 --> 00:46:18,590
I'm sorry to keep that.

1864
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:22,610
I think you're going to cut this down to about two minutes given I've avoided

1865
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:26,070
all of your questions, but yeah, there's no one I'm going to really pick up.

1866
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,429
And I've been fortunate to meet some really interesting people.

1867
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:31,429
I've been fortunate to work with some incredible people.

1868
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:32,949
So there's not too much.

1869
00:46:32,949 --> 00:46:35,670
I've sort of learned, I've given up on my FOMO many years ago.

1870
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:36,289
That makes sense.

1871
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:39,110
There's not too much I'm feeling, geez, I wish I could work with that person

1872
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:40,269
instead of the people I'm working with.

1873
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:42,909
Well, it's a great answer, Andrew, and it's authentically yourself.

1874
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:46,409
And, you know, the space that you guys have created is unique.

1875
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:47,269
It's a brilliant story.

1876
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:52,010
It's been hard prizing out of you because we see great leaders as incredibly

1877
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:56,730
humble as well, and your humility is quite almost at the next level.

1878
00:46:56,849 --> 00:46:58,449
So I appreciate your time.

1879
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:59,210
Thanks for the lessons.

1880
00:46:59,309 --> 00:47:01,570
There's been many out of it, and good luck.

1881
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,170
I can see the passion for St Kilda.

1882
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:05,769
My passion lies.

1883
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:08,650
It's at a club at another level, but I can see if you can get that one

1884
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:11,070
to achieve, that might be as fun a day as you can have.

1885
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:12,809
So good luck with that, and thanks for your time today.

1886
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:13,570
No, thank you.

1887
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:14,070
That's been great.

1888
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:14,769
Really enjoyed talking.

1889
00:47:14,909 --> 00:47:15,429
So thanks, Luke.

1890
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:15,929
Thanks, Andrew.

1891
00:47:15,949 --> 00:47:16,130
Cheers.
