A Listener Production.

2
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:09,300
G'day, it's Luke Darcy.

3
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:13,179
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,939
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,859
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,600
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,760
in education, sport, industry and the arts

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,739
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

9
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,199
where everyone has a voice.

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,780
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:53,299
Andrew Cohen is the Executive Chairman of J.P. Morgan Global Wealth Management.

12
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,600
He oversees J.P. Morgan's private bank's institutional wealth management practice

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,939
and leads the partnership between the firm's investment bank and private bank.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,939
In this role, Andrew focuses on the private bank's largest

15
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,040
and most sophisticated clients globally.

16
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,640
Prior to this, Andrew was the Chief Executive Officer

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,959
for J.P. Morgan's International Private Bank

18
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,120
which represents businesses in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,099
before relocating to Hong Kong in 2010

20
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:18,439
as the Chief Executive Officer

21
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:18,959
for J.P. Morgan's International Private Bank

22
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,480
For the Asia private bank, he was head of the Southern Californian region

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,500
based in Los Angeles

24
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,599
and previously worked with ultra-high net worth families

25
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:29,760
in Northern Europe and Eastern Mediterranean regions

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,000
based in London and Geneva, respectively.

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,959
Andrew holds a Bachelor of Economics

28
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,280
from Monash University in Melbourne, Australia

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,840
and attended the Executive Program of Global Leadership and Public Policy

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,260
for the 21st Century at Harvard University

31
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,500
in John F. Kennedy's School of Government.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,739
Outside of his senior leadership position at the world's biggest bank,

33
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:48,939
Andrew sits on the board.

34
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,040
Andrew is the Director of Directors at the Serpentine Galleries,

35
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,859
the Board of Governors of Tel Aviv University

36
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:56,700
and is an alumni of the Young Global Leaders Forum.

37
00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:00,239
Andy, it is an incredible life of leadership and success

38
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,900
and I really appreciate your time.

39
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,560
I'm really grateful to be joining you here in your London office today.

40
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,419
Absolute pleasure and what an honour to be sitting in front of you, mate.

41
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,319
Now, Andy, I'm reliably told at 20 years of age,

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,479
your first job, you went to your first boss

43
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,719
and negotiated your wage down.

44
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,819
Now, is this true? Can you share that story with me?

45
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:20,180
I did it by accident.

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,819
I was moved, I was actually 21, I was moved to Germany

47
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:27,020
and I thought it was a yearly salary

48
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,879
and then they told me it was weekly but it was actually monthly.

49
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,840
So I actually deluded myself but fortunately I came back.

50
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,020
Well, Andy, I'm told that you're being pretty humble here

51
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,879
and I understand that's a huge part of you

52
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:40,800
but that you were, you know, a passionate rower,

53
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,080
went on to row for Australia

54
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,259
and that my side of the story that I've been told

55
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:47,939
is that you really wanted to commit to your rowing and your work

56
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:48,860
and you didn't want to...

57
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,780
over-negotiate, that you wanted that balance of life.

58
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,780
Now, that's an incredible set of values at a young age.

59
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,479
Is that close to the truth?

60
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,740
Yeah, I think like young athletes, your son and daughter included,

61
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,219
who are superstars in their own right,

62
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,919
you have this passion for sport and you want to go to the top.

63
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,460
You also often have other interests in life,

64
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,000
whether it could be family, it could be philanthropy,

65
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,979
it could be running a small business or it could be banking.

66
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,340
I had an opportunity to get into banking

67
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,439
and I was trying to tussle in my mind between the two.

68
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,039
I was a good rower.

69
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,740
I'm lucky to represent the country but, you know,

70
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,000
to go on to the Olympics, which is every young rower's dream,

71
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,419
was going to be a huge challenge.

72
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,060
Maybe there was a tiny little glimmer but I couldn't do both

73
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,199
and, you know, I took that decision.

74
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,740
It's a tough decision at a young age

75
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,719
because, you know, my life from about 14 was all about the river,

76
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:37,060
the Yarra River in Melbourne.

77
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,520
I spent, you know, the majority of my life on that river

78
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,879
and that's all I thought about, that's all I dreamt about

79
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,879
but made that decision and, you know,

80
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,159
fortunately the banking worked out

81
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,719
but we've just come off Henley where your daughter was victorious

82
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,699
and, you know, you get a little flutter in the heart

83
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,740
and you think, if only, because rowing is something

84
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,680
that never leaves you, I think, like most sports.

85
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,939
Yeah, fresh from experiencing the Henley Royal Regatta

86
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,520
and I've loved sharing some stories with you

87
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,419
and we're a quite proud moment as a father

88
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:07,860
to see our daughter and her crew win at Henley

89
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,919
and it's been an amazing time here in London.

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,300
As I said, I feel really grateful to spend some time

91
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,919
with you here today in London.

92
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:16,240
There's another great story that I love about you, Andy.

93
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,139
I get the feeling I'm going to have to prize these out of you

94
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:18,740
because you're...

95
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,600
Humility's going to be so strong

96
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,740
but I'm told you started at Merrill Lynch in Australia.

97
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,040
You went to take a holiday after working incredibly hard

98
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,980
for several years.

99
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,519
You arrive overseas to think, I'll put a face to the name.

100
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:34,180
This is, you know, pre-internet and, you know, pre-Zoom, clearly

101
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,339
and as you walk into the office, your colleagues overseas

102
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:38,379
are saying, bad luck, Andy,

103
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,040
and you're thinking, what the hell's going on?

104
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,819
They've closed the Merrill Lynch Australia office

105
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:44,279
and you haven't got a job

106
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,680
and so the first you know about it is walking into that office

107
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,939
but you look on the notice board,

108
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,540
there's a role in Germany and you think, I can do that.

109
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,920
So you jump on a plane to Germany,

110
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,160
you get into the German office, it's an internal role

111
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,639
and you sit there first thing in the morning

112
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,879
and you wait the entire day and someone comes out and says,

113
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:02,899
are you still sitting here?

114
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:03,980
Come and see me.

115
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,720
Is that sort of where your career took off?

116
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,699
Yeah, I know where that came from.

117
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,519
It's kind of true.

118
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,620
Being a fifth generation Melbournian,

119
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,220
I didn't want to leave Melbourne.

120
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,600
I did have a position in Sydney and I thought,

121
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,939
if I'm going to leave home and all of my family and friends,

122
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,120
I'm not going to go to Sydney.

123
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:24,620
So in New York, when I did find out that Melbourne was going to be shut,

124
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,620
I went to Germany and I don't think I waited the whole day

125
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,360
but I kind of took that great Aussie candour and said,

126
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:34,160
look, I'm never going to see this boss again if he says no

127
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,860
and if he's going to be my boss, I'll be successful.

128
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:38,220
So, you know, it also comes from sports.

129
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,699
You know, you're going up in a race for a crew that may be better than you

130
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,220
and you think, I'm never going to have this other chance

131
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,300
so I'm just going to give it all I've got.

132
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,720
I had the RM Williams pair of jeans.

133
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,899
I remember buying a shirt for 28 Deutsche,

134
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,699
which is about $14 a day.

135
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,459
It was probably an expensive shirt for me at that time

136
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:57,000
and the great blue Aussie blazer with a little bit of beer

137
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,860
and other food on it and somehow, the funny part of the story, Luke,

138
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,639
is that in Germany you do what's called a practicum or an internship

139
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,879
and you have the option to leave and they have the option not to take you on

140
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,120
so three months in they say, right, you're good to go.

141
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,519
So the boss, who was Dutch, who was a great guy,

142
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,399
takes me to lunch and says, congratulations, we want to take you on.

143
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,199
You've passed the practicum.

144
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,339
We want to give you a formal role and I said, okay, that's great.

145
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:19,939
He said, do you know why we hired you?

146
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,899
And I said, well, you know, did pretty well at school and university.

147
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,560
No.

148
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,939
I did very well in the training program.

149
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,680
No.

150
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,240
I said, I'm very international.

151
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,980
He said, very international?

152
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:31,240
You're from Australia.

153
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,639
And I said, yeah, my dad's American.

154
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:35,060
I've travelled, you know, for sport.

155
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:36,660
He said, sport is not work.

156
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,600
Now, there's one very clear reason we hired you.

157
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,959
Nobody else wants to come to Berlin to work.

158
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,720
We couldn't find anybody for the slot.

159
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,680
So that was the position.

160
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,579
Put you back in your spot.

161
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:45,959
Exactly.

162
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,240
But I love that, you know, determination

163
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,819
and the front to sit in an office

164
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:51,740
and I'm assuming you've got basic German

165
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:57,399
so you're not necessarily going to have the answers to the questions

166
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:00,259
but is that something you look for now in your leadership position

167
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:01,860
to see someone with that sort of...

168
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,399
I am and my team knows this.

169
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,839
So I actually didn't speak German then.

170
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,839
I'd done German at school and probably was pretty miserable at it.

171
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,800
I fortunately now speak fluent German.

172
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,819
I had to force myself because Berlin in those days,

173
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,439
East and West Berlin were open.

174
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:18,160
The wall had just fallen for younger people.

175
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,279
People on the call won't sort of really understand that, right?

176
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:22,519
That, you know, there was two cities

177
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,500
and nobody in East Germany spoke a word of English

178
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,600
so you had to learn German and all of the foreigners did.

179
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:30,639
I think I take that huge opportunity I had.

180
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,439
I took some initiative but I had a great opportunity.

181
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,319
So anybody that writes or calls or approaches at any time,

182
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:40,480
could be verbal, it could be physical or it could be an email,

183
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,079
you respond and you give them their 10 or 15 minutes

184
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,740
and we've hired a lot of great people.

185
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,220
In fact, there's part of our core team here who I met in a jazz bar

186
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,240
late at night in Hong Kong in the middle of the summer,

187
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,819
both in jeans and t-shirts.

188
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,899
He had no idea who I was and he happened to be born in Australia.

189
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,459
So my ears picked up.

190
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,860
He'd gone to a very good school in the US

191
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,019
and the story 12 years later, he's one of our superstars in the bank.

192
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,120
Amazing.

193
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:05,180
I love it.

194
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,939
You're in one of the biggest leadership positions

195
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:10,399
in the global world of finance.

196
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,519
How would you, incredible reflection on you and your story for a start,

197
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,560
but how would you describe your leadership style?

198
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:17,720
Yeah.

199
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,199
Look.

200
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,399
It's very much curated from two things.

201
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,860
One is my father, my late father who passed away two and a half years ago

202
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,360
and was just an incredible man and my best mate.

203
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:28,680
And secondly, is sport.

204
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:32,039
And in all sports, particularly team sports,

205
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,919
I can't talk to individual sports, but team sports,

206
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:38,039
you don't rely on yourself as much as you rely on your teammates.

207
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,100
And if you're not helping somebody who's flailing a little bit,

208
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,740
maybe having an off day, maybe they're ill, maybe they're injured,

209
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,100
whatever it is, then you are going to have a worse performance yourself.

210
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:47,919
Banking is no different.

211
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,419
Banking is no different.

212
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:54,120
So I think to have a really solid team and have the rapport is, you know,

213
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,080
this is a tough job and it's demanding intellectually,

214
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,419
it's demanding emotionally, it's demanding physically.

215
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,759
And when you notice that somebody's a little bit off,

216
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,600
rather than giving them a hard time, pull them aside, say what's going on,

217
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,779
often they'll open up, often they won't.

218
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:10,419
And it's when they don't that you have them pivot and do other things.

219
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:14,759
But I think if you build that, the second thing that happens in this is that,

220
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:17,539
you know, for us older guys, life goes like that.

221
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:19,539
And in five years' time, they're more senior.

222
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:22,220
And in 10 years' time, they're probably very senior.

223
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,139
And in 15 years' time, they're at the same level as you.

224
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,620
So you want to keep those people in the team, right?

225
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,740
And it's important.

226
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,299
I think there's different styles, but at J.P. Morgan, we're very,

227
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:35,059
very focused on our younger people because they're going

228
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:36,159
to be the future leaders of tomorrow.

229
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,960
Yeah, it's what we, and I'm really passionate about,

230
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,740
is seeing that style of leadership now is really becoming what we would describe

231
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,419
as 21st century style leadership, where you have care in general,

232
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:50,559
genuine empathy for those around you, and in doing that and collaborating

233
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,779
together, and that the old model of, you know, the big corner office and hierarchy

234
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:59,399
and command and control is bankrupt, and that the next generation really aren't

235
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,440
interested in that style.

236
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,320
And I mean, we're seeing sporting coaches that are so much more collaborative and

237
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,500
open and caring and empathetic.

238
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,679
You know, does that come naturally to you, or did you just learn that with the culture

239
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,580
that you were involved in?

240
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,120
Yeah, I go back to sports, but my dad, I grew up in a big household of four kids,

241
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,460
and he treated everybody fairly.

242
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:17,519
Yeah.

243
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:20,139
We were different genders, we were different ages, and we had different skill sets,

244
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:24,419
but he just treated us for our entire lives as his four kids.

245
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:28,860
My mother, of course, as well, but it was my dad that sort of inspired us,

246
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,740
that everybody you meet, a bellhop, a waiter, a guy at the gas station,

247
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,320
is as important as, you know, I remember my first day of work, he said,

248
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,620
everybody you meet in that bank is going to be important, and make sure you show it.

249
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,320
So, you know, the security guard when you pass the front desk, and then the secretaries,

250
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,240
and the receptionists, so I was lucky I had that as a backbone.

251
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:50,299
But then you get trained and curated in a certain way.

252
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:55,820
Now, there are times when you have to show seniority and leadership.

253
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,500
We're right now in a global economic crisis, I think it's my fourth, right?

254
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,139
So, obviously, I have that backstory that can be really valuable to the team, whereas

255
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:08,539
people that started in this business in 2017 or 2018 haven't really looked, so they may

256
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:13,220
be nervous, they may be fearful, you know, you can watch any array of news, either socially

257
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,299
or on the, you know, the terrestrial networks, and think, oh, my God, the world's falling

258
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:18,299
apart.

259
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:21,059
Yeah, it's a very difficult time, and we are going to go through a lot of volatility.

260
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:24,940
It's one of the worst periods we've had, but we've had bad periods before, and we have

261
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,940
a job to do.

262
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,840
So, that's when you use the seniority to give that maturity and leadership, and mentorship

263
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:38,759
is anecdotal in my view of what happened before, and how you can partake that, give it to the

264
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:42,179
next generation so that, because I had that benefit, you know, a long time ago when I

265
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:43,179
was starting off.

266
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:46,059
Andy, we're sitting here in the magnificent office overlooking the world.

267
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:47,059
Yeah.

268
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:52,299
We're looking at the Thames, and it's a business that's got, from what I read, over 270,000

269
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:53,299
employees.

270
00:11:53,299 --> 00:12:01,019
It is a huge, huge machine, revenues of $120 billion per annum in JP Morgan, but the culture

271
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:06,039
and the championing and diversity is really synonymous with you and with the group that

272
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,039
you work with.

273
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,299
How do you achieve that with such scale?

274
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:15,059
Yeah, it's a great question, and we are privileged to work for this company and this bank, but

275
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:16,059
when I started, there was 14,000 employees.

276
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:17,059
Yeah.

277
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:22,460
We're now, you know, multiples of that, and we've merged pretty significantly twice, and

278
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,240
then some other companies we've acquired, but we've also grown organically, but one

279
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,059
thing that we've kept, particularly since Jamie Dimon, our current chairman and CEO,

280
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:34,379
has been on board, he's kept the old values of the firm that's a couple of centuries old,

281
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:40,259
and that is that when you put on, you know, go back to the sporting metaphor, when you

282
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,419
put on the jersey, right, doesn't matter which jersey you put on, as long as you're playing

283
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:44,419
in the team.

284
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:45,299
So, you may have somebody coming from another industry, another business.

285
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:46,299
Yeah.

286
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:50,899
Another industry, another bank, or another firm, or another part of the firm, and you're

287
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:54,720
just going to make sure you curate them, and the great thing about diversity is that the

288
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,580
one metric you look for is the intellectual capital to be able to do this job and service

289
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,159
the bank's clients, right?

290
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,159
That's the one metric.

291
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:05,399
Color of your skin, your religion, your race, your gender identity, your sexual identity,

292
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,460
any disability you may have, is just irrelevant, right?

293
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,539
What's relevant is the intellectual capacity, so if we have a young person who says, I'm

294
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:15,700
desperate to go and work in Paris because I love Paris, and they're from Melbourne.

295
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,340
Say, well, how's your French?

296
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,539
Now, I gave a bad example because what I was doing in Berlin required English, right?

297
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:24,240
So, it had been a regular German banking job.

298
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,460
I wouldn't have got the job, but what I was doing was something different.

299
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,460
But that person wants to go to Paris.

300
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,360
If they don't speak French, they're not going to go, or if they want to go to Shanghai,

301
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,200
they better speak Mandarin because the business is conducted in that language.

302
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,919
Outside of that, all bets are on, and you can do whatever you need, whatever you want.

303
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,740
Going back to the diversity, though, I had a funny occurrence on Friday night.

304
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,700
I was running to a meeting in Mayfair, not far from here.

305
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,480
And two gentlemen were approaching, and one had a cane.

306
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,679
And the other gentleman had his arm, holding his arm, and I went for the hug.

307
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:58,460
And the other guy, the guy on the left, pushed his hand out like a shirt front to stop me.

308
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,700
He said, he's blind.

309
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,940
And I said, I know.

310
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,080
And the gentleman, his name is Ashish, he's a dear friend of mine, hugged me, right?

311
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,879
And the guy was looking and said, oh, you know each other.

312
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,460
He is so talented, this guy.

313
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,240
He could just from one word or two words, I know, recognize.

314
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,460
He was our number one FX trader here in the bank.

315
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:21,039
He's now gone on to a hedge fund, blind, completely blind, but he could see until he was 14.

316
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:25,059
And he got a disease, got blind, ended up going to university in Delhi, and then went

317
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:26,059
on to Wharton.

318
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:28,840
And then JP Morgan hired him, and he was so good.

319
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,139
He could hear more quickly the text being translated than you or I could read.

320
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,659
I just give that as an example, right?

321
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:40,000
We aspire to have people of that individual self-capacity.

322
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And guess what?

323
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,379
He did a fantastic job for the firm's clients, so much so that he thought he could do better

324
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:45,379
in a hedge fund.

325
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:47,139
But we lost him, but we've remained great friends.

326
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:53,059
Andy, we hear organizations now, you put diversity out there as a box tick, and it's something

327
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:57,639
that organizations now are really shamed into in some ways.

328
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:02,419
You mentioned Jamie Dimon's got an international reputation as a leader.

329
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:05,360
Everything starts at the top, I suppose.

330
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,419
You work closely in that executive team.

331
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:12,620
As you just said in that beautiful example, you actually get the best skills and you get

332
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,980
the best opportunity by opening up the world to everyone.

333
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,059
Regardless of your color, your sexual identity.

334
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,879
Is that where that is driven from?

335
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:20,879
Is it performance?

336
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:21,879
Yeah, I think there's a couple of things.

337
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,779
It's diversity of people that makes for a better team environment because you actually

338
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:31,879
get to learn and understand obviously different cultures and different religions and different

339
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,220
places that you grew up in.

340
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,320
But also diversity of identity is incredibly important.

341
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,740
And we are very, very focused on obviously gender diversity, which we'll come to in a

342
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,740
minute.

343
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,740
The LGBT community.

344
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,000
It's fantastic in London to see the 50th anniversary of Gay Pride here in London.

345
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,980
It was just a carnival atmosphere for the whole weekend, as you probably saw when you're

346
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,980
coming back and forth to London.

347
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,820
Apart from the traffic was completely fucked up, but no one cared because it was fun.

348
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,639
People of color in the US, Asian Americans and Latino Americans.

349
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,179
But then also the things like disabilities, right?

350
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:06,159
I mean, you've got to make sure businesses have wheelchair access.

351
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:08,940
It's just the common human dignity to do that.

352
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,940
And you've got to make sure that the younger generation, particularly what we've been through

353
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,539
for the last few years, the mental health issues, right?

354
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:20,000
The fact of having work-life balance and of having wellness as a genuine objective of

355
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,700
the firm, to be fit, to be healthy, to take a walk, to take a run, to do whatever type

356
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,039
of sport is really key.

357
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:29,399
But on gender, it's really interesting.

358
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,360
Half of Jamie's operating committee is female and 44% of our board.

359
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,159
And we're really proud of that because we get a different diversity.

360
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,860
But what it means at the end of the day, when we face across a table like we're sitting

361
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,539
at against the client, if you're five men, you're not sitting at the same table as five

362
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:44,539
men.

363
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:46,620
You're sitting across from five white men.

364
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,799
You normally have sitting with women or people from somewhere else around the world.

365
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,039
And you've just got to be ready for that.

366
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:57,320
So I think we're intrinsically focused that the world has changed so much.

367
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,559
We don't just do it as a tick the box.

368
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,519
We do it because we have better outcomes.

369
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,700
And all the data suggests that diverse organizations, whether they're political, whether they're

370
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,359
business, whether they're sports, are going to be better off by having a level of diversity

371
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,779
that is a reflection of the global world we live in.

372
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:14,079
And Andy, in your own life, you live it every day.

373
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:21,319
As a Jewish Australian based here in London, but married to a Lebanese Muslim, and congratulations,

374
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:25,460
one and a half year old child, I think today, you told me just before we started.

375
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,140
Tell me about that in your personal life.

376
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,259
You're bringing together families from different backgrounds.

377
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:33,759
What's that been like, bringing that world together from the extended family point of

378
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:34,759
view?

379
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:38,740
Yeah, to get personal for a minute, my wife and I met on an island in a holiday setting,

380
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,960
which a lot of people meet that way, and sometimes they work out and sometimes they don't.

381
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
Yeah.

382
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,720
Our resumes couldn't have been more different.

383
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,059
There's a relatively large age gap, not enormous, but a relatively large age gap.

384
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:51,059
She lived in Dubai.

385
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:52,559
I lived in Hong Kong.

386
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,440
She'd grown up in Beirut in a very secular Muslim family.

387
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,400
I'd grown up in Melbourne in a very secular Jewish family.

388
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,079
But what we realized after a few days was we had exactly the same set of values.

389
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,039
Everything about us is around our families.

390
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,579
Our families come first.

391
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:13,119
And secondly, both of our fathers and mothers absolutely said education is a must.

392
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,680
Doesn't matter what else you do.

393
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,500
So take sport.

394
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,279
I happen to have a passion for sport, but that didn't matter as much as getting educated

395
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:22,839
and taking advantage of the opportunities that befell themselves.

396
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,400
She was exactly the same.

397
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,019
And now I'm very fortunate to have such an amazing wife.

398
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:30,779
I can see through her eyes what we're doing with our son.

399
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:36,440
He's already learning French and Arabic and having an experience of Lebanese cooking,

400
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,440
which is, as much as I love Australia, it's a way better cuisine.

401
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
And those things.

402
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,440
So we make it work.

403
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
And hopefully, that's what we do.

404
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,440
Hopefully, that's a beacon for others, because we're both very passionate about the regions

405
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
that we come from.

406
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,740
I'm very passionately Australian, even though I've been away a long time.

407
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,259
She's very passionately Lebanese, and we bring that together and try and make it a better

408
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,259
environment.

409
00:18:55,259 --> 00:19:00,940
And you donate a lot of your time to philanthropy and an incredible reputation in that space.

410
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,940
You're on the board of the Tel Aviv University.

411
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,859
I think you're on the board of the Los Angeles Police Department in your time in LA.

412
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:12,200
Can you talk us through where you drive that inspiration from?

413
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,440
For example, the Tel Aviv University.

414
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,700
What's the motivation there for you?

415
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,700
Yeah.

416
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,960
So much to what I just said before, Lebanon's the neighbor of Israel, and they're not officially

417
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
friendly.

418
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:28,740
That being said, I have a passion for the region, and again, going back, tying in education.

419
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,180
Think about it from this standpoint.

420
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,799
The more educated people get, the more they're going to be able to have a consensual debate

421
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:34,799
and understand each other.

422
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,200
Tel Aviv University is a phenomenal institution that has a larger percentage of Israeli-Arabian,

423
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Israeli-Arabian people.

424
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Yeah.

425
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,200
It has more Arab undergraduates than the general population, and it also has an incredible

426
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
faculty of Israeli-Arabs.

427
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,700
And that was something that I felt was just wonderful.

428
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,819
I didn't know about it until I joined the board, the board of governors.

429
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,720
But the educational side of it, to me, is what's so important, and there's a lot of

430
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,220
scholarships for people from all over the world.

431
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,519
And same with the Hebrew University, the other big university.

432
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:08,160
But I balance that because I'm also on the American Turkish Society board, and Turkey's

433
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,960
another country that I'm incredibly passionate about.

434
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Yeah.

435
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
Yeah.

436
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,640
I'm incredibly passionate about Turkey and its history.

437
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,339
Like a lot of Australians, I unfortunately lost family members in 1915 in Gallipoli,

438
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:21,339
and I always had an interest in Turkey.

439
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:25,500
And once I started going there, I realized that they also lost people fighting Australians,

440
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,380
which they had no qualm with us, and we had no qualm with them.

441
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,519
So I got more and more involved through business, and now was very lucky to be asked to join

442
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:33,519
this.

443
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,339
And you take those two things together, and you learn a lot about business, education,

444
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:41,960
philanthropy coming together, just to try and have a better dialogue.

445
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,140
You had the great privilege, Andy, on the centenary of Anzac, being there, that dawn

446
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:52,460
service, as the sun rose over that beautiful peninsula, and the history and understanding.

447
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,640
And you couldn't help but be emotional and moved by the stories you'd heard growing up.

448
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,839
And then you look up at that cliff face, and you think, my God, the 15 and 16-year-old

449
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,960
young boys, as they were in some cases.

450
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,640
And then you learn about it, the history of Ataturk, and the respect between the Turkish

451
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
and Australians.

452
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,640
Yeah.

453
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
Yeah.

454
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,700
And to keep that going in the future seems like such a worthwhile thing.

455
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,400
Well, I was going to raise Ataturk.

456
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,599
I mean, when you think about maybe the leadership issues that we're currently facing around

457
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:23,799
the world, a lot of people comment on great leadership.

458
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,259
This is a way more complex world.

459
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:29,039
But he was really, truly one of the great leaders of the world.

460
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,400
He did a number of things after Turkey lost the first war, and then managed to hold onto

461
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,160
what we call the tongue of Turkey.

462
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,380
But he took away the fez, this sort of sultanic red hat that the people wore, because he wanted

463
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,619
people to look Western.

464
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:47,259
He changed the language overnight from Sanskrit to Latin.

465
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:50,839
And there's a great book about this, where his advisors came and said, it'll take 10

466
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:52,259
to 12 years for the population to change.

467
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:54,200
And he said, you've got 24 hours.

468
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,019
And they talked about printing the newspaper in both typefaces.

469
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:02,380
He said, no, just put it in Latin, that if they're going to learn European languages,

470
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,000
they need to learn the Latin letters.

471
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,440
He also emancipated women to a great extent, and had a lot of female input in a very traditional

472
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,380
part of the world.

473
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,380
Yeah.

474
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,920
And he did other things that were just remarkable.

475
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,140
And one of the most important is he wrote a letter to the Australian mothers, where

476
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,779
he said, here in Turkey lay the bones and souls of your Australian boys, intertwined

477
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,039
with the souls and bones of the Turkish boys, and the bosom of Turkey will take good care

478
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,039
of their souls.

479
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,559
I just think, what a beautiful moment for those young mothers in Australia in 1915,

480
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:37,039
1916, that lost an 18 or 19-year-old boy, and they received that poem.

481
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,900
So one of the great men of history.

482
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,339
Incredible leadership story.

483
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:41,339
And you articulate it so brilliantly.

484
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,380
Absolutely, Andy.

485
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,380
And as you said, it's education, isn't it?

486
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,380
When we understand more history, it allows us to be more compassionate, more empathetic.

487
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,380
Totally.

488
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,579
And it comes back to the qualities that you can clearly see in your leadership.

489
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:58,440
I wanted to ask you, as someone who's worked in an industry where you've dealt with the

490
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,700
highest net worth people around the world, is there a level of success and happiness

491
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,259
that financial security brings?

492
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:09,259
How much is enough?

493
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:10,259
A hard question to answer.

494
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:11,259
Yeah.

495
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:14,259
It's a hard question to answer, but you're probably uniquely placed to answer it.

496
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:17,900
It's a great question, and we have a real privilege, the client base that J.P. Morgan

497
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:24,380
entertains and works with across the spectrum globally, Luke, but I would say it like this.

498
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,539
Just like any person with any level of wealth, there are happy and unhappy people.

499
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,519
That may be due to the wealth or not.

500
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:34,019
What it does do is allow you to provide outcomes, and I think one of the great things is what

501
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:39,259
Gates and Buffett have done around the Giving Pledge, and this is a US-focused idea, but

502
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:40,259
many global people are doing it.

503
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:45,880
Where you say at a certain age, 40 or 50 or 60, I'm giving 50% of my net worth, and you

504
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,700
actually sign a document and say, I'm going to do this, that inspires others to do likewise.

505
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,940
You've always had wealthy people that are great philanthropists.

506
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,319
You probably need more, because you're right, there is a certain level of wealth that you

507
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,279
can't buy more boats, planes, art, or whatever, but you can make change.

508
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:05,380
That could be change for people less well-off than yourself or who have great needs, but

509
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,140
also it could be the environment, which is obviously a huge impact on the life of our

510
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,140
children and future generations.

511
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,759
It could be mental health.

512
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:14,359
It could be just civil service.

513
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:19,319
We've just hired somebody here who spent 25 years basically in finance here in the city

514
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:25,500
of London, a competitive firm, and then he spent two years working for the government

515
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,380
to fix the problems of Brexit and fix the problems of COVID for a tiny salary, but he

516
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,279
says the best two years he ever spent working, because he actually could provide change.

517
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,220
So if you take that, that's not one of our clients, that's one of our employees, but

518
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,640
imagine him talking to a client who says, I don't know what to do with all this money.

519
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,319
We don't have enough to offer, so we should give him a lot.

520
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,460
That is definitely theיט girl.

521
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,180
Go on, and we'll do it together one day.

522
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,200
Oh my goodness.

523
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,559
But he said they were going to tell us how to work with our manager on an uncomfortable

524
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,559
state for a few years.

525
00:24:51,559 --> 00:25:05,740
So yeah, and think about why they should put on

526
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,680
on my job.

527
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
I can eat well.

528
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
I can doctor my whole life.

529
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
This is what I do.

530
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:09,759
Right.

531
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,000
and families, maybe not what's right to do, but definitely what's wrong to do.

532
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:25,140
Andy, I had the privilege of interviewing Peter Singer on this Empowering Leaders podcast,

533
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,839
who the effective altruism movement is one of Australia's great philosophers and has been

534
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:35,759
really influential with the Giving Pledge behind Warren Buffett and Bill Gates and high net wealth

535
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,779
people, you know, effectively, as you said, signing that pledge. I love one of the quotes

536
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:44,220
of Buffett, I'm going to give my children enough so that they could do anything, but not too much

537
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:49,259
that they can do nothing. I mean, does that ring true to you in terms of that sort of sense of,

538
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:54,619
you know? Yeah, there are two schools here. Some people, particularly if an individual man or woman

539
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:58,480
has made the money themselves, or maybe collectively as a partnership, there's probably

540
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,220
more of a reluctance to give a lot because, well, I got educated and I did it so they can do it. And

541
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,440
we know that's incredibly hard to do in the second. And then the other spectrum is I'm going

542
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,240
to give everything and hopefully they'll keep the corpus and make it grow somewhat. Somewhere in the

543
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,680
middle is probably correct. I sat with a client last week for lunch.

544
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:19,700
Who has 67 different foundations around the world. He comes from an area of the world that's

545
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,180
in conflict. He's been incredibly successful. And he said, I'm buying a house for each of my

546
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:28,720
three children. I'm giving them the best education that they can attain, whatever school they get

547
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,720
into. And that's it. They're not getting a cash stipend. They have to pay for the house costs of

548
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,539
running a house themselves, but they'll have the backbone. So that's a pretty aggressive tactic.

549
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:43,819
And he aims in his lifetime to give away the very, very substantial wealth he's made. So you have a

550
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,519
difference. The other part of that, though, is he really provides for great family unity. And

551
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:52,859
another great Australian, for those listening, if they don't know him, read up on Jim Wolfensohn.

552
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:58,400
He was just a remarkable Australian. He was an immigrant to Australia, fought in the Olympics

553
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,259
doing fencing, was a concert celloist at Carnegie Hall, and then probably became in the 70s and 80s,

554
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:07,400
went to Harvard Business School. In the 70s and 80s, the greatest investment banker,

555
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,140
the Wolfensohn & Associates was his company, sold to Bankers Trust, which became Deutsche Bank.

556
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,720
He was inspired by philanthropy so much that he became the head of the World Bank when he retired

557
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:24,059
from banking. But their family unit is very focused on collectively figuring out issues that

558
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:28,079
they want to solve and doing it as a family. And I've always thought about that when others have

559
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:33,839
asked me, it doesn't matter if they're 15, get the kids involved. Because the young woman from

560
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:40,500
Sweden, Greta, she's incredible, 16. And she had 80-year-olds listening to her intently. It doesn't

561
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,920
matter what age you are, you just don't have the tools yet. She happened to have a voice box.

562
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,920
But as a family unit, that's a really important thing.

563
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,220
Yeah, and they're great messages to tell and great stories to tell, Andy. I appreciate you

564
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,359
being so open about all of that. We are identifying, Andy, that the next generation

565
00:27:55,359 --> 00:28:00,819
of leaders have these common traits that are sort of cues and dimensions of what we think

566
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:04,559
great leadership looks like. So I was going to ask you around these dimensions of leadership,

567
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,559
and please expand as much or as little as you like. But we think great leaders start with a

568
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:13,380
sense of self-leadership. Andy, when I ask you about your sense of self-leadership,

569
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,200
what do you think of?

570
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:22,960
Um, I try and be incredibly focused on the individual, whether it's a client or one of the

571
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,420
team. You know, I noticed when I was younger that, you know, somebody's doing something else when

572
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:33,319
you're talking to them. And now we have, you know, everybody has a smartphone, you know, put it away.

573
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,599
You may have 10 minutes to change the direction of a colleague's life. They may be having a bad

574
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:42,579
day, you don't know it. But if you're doing this, and I'm looking down and typing, you know,

575
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:44,200
the attention span, and there's all the data.

576
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,119
So I'm going to suggest that you, particularly us guys, right, we can't do two things at once,

577
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,400
right? So we're not listening. I think the other gender may be better served at that,

578
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,799
but I'm being serious. Show the intention, look in the eyes, and be empathetic. And empathy

579
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:02,519
is everything. It's just like the story of the bellhop at a hotel or a waiter. I mean,

580
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,000
we've all sat with people, the waiters come, put the food down, and the person's kept talking,

581
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:10,039
and you look at them and say, well, what about thank you? Well, how does a waiter feel? You

582
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,539
know, they may be studying at MIT and are going to be one of the great physicists or entrepreneurs

583
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:14,059
of the world.

584
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,980
And, you know, they're not going to come back to do that. So in our firm, we spend an

585
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:23,579
inordinate amount of time from 22 years old, all the way up to people we have in their

586
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:27,900
80s, in being one-on-one. And it's really interesting, actually. So the highlight of

587
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,059
my year, every year, is talking to our new inbound analysts. They're people that have

588
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:37,319
just graduated college, university, all over the world. They're between 21 and 22. And

589
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:40,779
they sit in a room in Brooklyn, where we have something called the Metro Tech. And this

590
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,200
year, it'll be 412. Now, you can, the sky's quite blue out there.

591
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,339
Yeah. Out today, out of this London window, you can tell them the sky's red, and they're

592
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:52,119
going to believe you, because it's their first, you know, first weeks on the job. But what's

593
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:56,099
amazing is you have your small opportunity to empathetically shape them about the values

594
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:59,099
of the firm, whether it's diversity, whether it's about doing the right thing, and the

595
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:02,440
culture of making a mistake, and how do you deal with a mistake? Because we may, I mean,

596
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,279
I make more mistakes than probably anybody in the bank. But you put your hand up, and

597
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:11,579
you ask for help. And that's a core quality of being a great business person, is accepting

598
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:12,880
that you made a mistake.

599
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,160
Right.

600
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,180
Right.

601
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:13,200
Right.

602
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,220
Right.

603
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:13,279
Right.

604
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:13,299
Right.

605
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:13,319
Right.

606
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:13,339
Right.

607
00:30:13,339 --> 00:30:13,359
Right.

608
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:13,380
Right.

609
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:13,440
Right.

610
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:13,460
Right.

611
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:13,519
Right.

612
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:13,539
Right.

613
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:14,539
Right.

614
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:15,539
Right.

615
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:16,539
Right.

616
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:16,579
Right.

617
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:16,640
Right.

618
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:16,680
Right.

619
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:16,700
Right.

620
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:16,720
Right.

621
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:16,799
Right.

622
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:16,900
Right.

623
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:16,920
Right.

624
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:16,940
Right.

625
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,039
Right.

626
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:17,099
Right.

627
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:17,119
Right.

628
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,000
If you try and hide the mistake, it will go wrong. If you put your hand up, somebody else

629
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,400
is there to say, no problem, got the answer, we can fix it. Right? So those two things to

630
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,000
me. Now, at the other end of the spectrum, we've got an array of people that have been

631
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,839
great servants of this firm, some of them 20, 30, 40, 50, one person for 68 years has

632
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:40,500
worked at this company. I spoke to him last night, because we did a favor for him and

633
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,519
his family. He took the time to write a beautiful note and say, you did a great job, and I'm

634
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,079
sure you don't, he's in his 90s. He said, you don't realize what you've done for my

635
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:52,599
family. It was nothing large, right? But because you invest in these people on both ends, you

636
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:54,079
actually come to better outcomes.

637
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,180
Yeah. I love your, you know, put the hand up and own the mistakes. It's a trait we love

638
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:02,339
sharing. My mind, you know, changes direction and thinks of the great Shane Warne, who we

639
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:08,839
lost recently, who owned everything that he did as, and we loved him for it. And it was

640
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:13,240
a superpower. I always felt when you're around him, you know, he was legendary and

641
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,359
successful.

642
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:13,400
Yeah.

643
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:13,440
Yeah.

644
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:13,460
Yeah.

645
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:13,480
Yeah.

646
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:13,500
Yeah.

647
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:13,519
Yeah.

648
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,700
He was successful, but never, ever shied away from any of the things that went wrong.

649
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:22,480
It leads really nicely, Andy, to sort of positively impacting people around. I can tell that just

650
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:29,019
oozes out of you. I think you're a godfather to more than a dozen young people. Is it 14

651
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:29,480
am I looking?

652
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,140
No, 17.

653
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:35,700
17. I mean, that is an extraordinary impact for one to have so many families around the

654
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,380
world that you're, you know, impacting their children going forward. How do you consciously

655
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,140
think about that? We see leaders are really conscious now about how they positively impact

656
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,339
everyone.

657
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:46,160
Well, on the godchildren, I think I could be a better godfather. There's a lot to spread,

658
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:50,039
but I think people also didn't get married till later in life. So people thought, oh,

659
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:53,259
he's never getting married. So he'll be the good guy to look after them with their teenagers

660
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:56,660
and whatever. But I try and do whatever. And in fact, just this weekend, one of them graduated

661
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:01,200
from Cambridge here in London and, you know, couldn't be happier for the success. Another

662
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,059
one graduated from Yale a few weeks before that. So it's great to see, you know, see

663
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:12,019
the success of the next generation. But it's a people issue and not all people want to,

664
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:13,319
you know, not all people.

665
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:18,180
People want to engage with you and not all individuals want to be, you know, so socially

666
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:24,319
available, right? I think coming from a big family and having always an open door, my

667
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:29,079
parents always literally had an open door on Friday nights. People could walk in. We've

668
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:32,880
continued that tradition, my wife and I, we love entertaining and having people over and

669
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,299
you carry that through to work. It goes back to this point of somebody emails, somebody

670
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:41,579
calls, you can't give them an hour because if you do that, then you're going to get nothing

671
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:42,279
else done for the day.

672
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:42,480
Yeah.

673
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:42,839
Yeah.

674
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:42,859
Yeah.

675
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:42,880
Yeah.

676
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:42,900
Yeah.

677
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:42,920
Yeah.

678
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:42,940
Yeah.

679
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:42,960
Yeah.

680
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,019
Yeah.

681
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:43,039
Yeah.

682
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:43,059
Yeah.

683
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:43,079
Yeah.

684
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:43,140
Yeah.

685
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:46,420
I'll tell you this. I'll go back to Jamie again. Jamie returns every single email,

686
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:51,660
every single day. It's not a pool of people behind him doing it. It's Jamie, right? Now,

687
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,119
a lot of people won't email Jamie Diamond because there's some intimidation involved

688
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:59,140
with that. But if you do, you get a response, maybe one word or maybe one line, it may be

689
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:05,779
longer. But I also watch Jamie closely at our client events, how he engages people,

690
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,259
but more so his team. He's passionate about this bank. So when it comes from the top,

691
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,500
Luke, it's really powerful.

692
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:12,700
Yeah.

693
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:12,740
Yeah.

694
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:12,759
Yeah.

695
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:12,980
Yeah.

696
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,380
in New York, which is being reconstructed at the moment to be the most sustainable building in the

697
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,380
United States, one of the most sustainable in the world, so we're proud of that, is on Park Avenue.

698
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:24,619
And for those that don't know Park Avenue, it's this double thoroughfare, a bit like St. Kilda

699
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:29,400
Road, massive tall skyscrapers everywhere. And around seven o'clock, most people are leaving.

700
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,140
And I'd often be waiting for a car there to go somewhere to a dinner or whatever. Jamie would

701
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,140
walk out at the same time. And he wasn't talking to the senior people like myself. He's talking to

702
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:42,380
the security guards. And there's two things to that. One is, as the CEO of 270,000 people,

703
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,279
his first concern is the health and safety of J.P. Morgan employees, right? I mean, there is

704
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:51,400
always those concerns for any CEO in any company. But secondly, how big does that security guard

705
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,259
feel? That the CEO of J.P. Morgan is saying, how's your day? What's going on? Is there anything we

706
00:33:55,259 --> 00:34:01,740
should be worried about? And it's just a powerful thing that if you notice that and see it,

707
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:06,299
hopefully you're going to do likewise. It's a great line that I may not get right. Judge people

708
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:11,360
on how they treat others that can have no influence around them. And it's not a bad way,

709
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
is it? You can't mention...

710
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:17,219
They can't fake that, can you? That genuine care when you interact with people that really

711
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:22,360
can't do you any probably thing in return. It's a small thing, isn't it? But you can impact people

712
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:27,980
so positively. We see leaders like you with this incredible sense of clarity around creating and

713
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,500
sharing their vision. How have you gone about doing that in your context, creating and sharing

714
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,119
your vision? Yeah, well, we were given a gift a couple of years ago. I came back from Hong Kong

715
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,360
to London to take on this global executive chairman role of building out a university.

716
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:50,719
And that was a game changer in terms of your 30-year career because it was a blank sheet of paper.

717
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,960
There's no 100-page manuscript. That's how you go and build a new business. So we built a new

718
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,460
business within the walls of J.P. Morgan and could shape it in our own way. So it was shaped on

719
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:04,860
two key principles. People had to be intellectually committed to the project, right? So they had to

720
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:09,219
have the skill set. So that is a certain set of skills. But secondly, the type of character had

721
00:35:09,219 --> 00:35:11,260
to be involved where, to your point, the 22-year-old, the 22-year-old, the 22-year-old, the 22-year-old,

722
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:11,440
the 22-year-old, the 22-year-old, the 22-year-old, the 22-year-old, the 22-year-old, the 22-year-old,

723
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,639
the 22-year-olds, and the one person who's in their 70s, right, are equally important. And

724
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:19,639
every single time we have a team meeting, we try and stress that. Of course, the juniors aren't

725
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:24,039
going to talk as much as the seniors, but we encourage them to. The second thing is just be

726
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:28,559
open to everything. So the digital world that is facing everything we do, whether it's education

727
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:33,239
or sports, you know, I understand, I hope I'm right in this, AFL is the most digitalized watched

728
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:37,880
sport in the world in terms of the components of the great game of AFL. Take that into a business

729
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,420
context. We are rapidly digitalizing. We're one of the biggest spenders in the world. We're one of

730
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,800
the biggest spenders on technology. This business unit is completely digital, right? And we're

731
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,659
trying to be ahead of the curve, but it's not coming from old guys like me. It's coming from

732
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:53,559
our juniors who are two or three years out of school who say, well, did you look at this? And

733
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:57,900
yeah, here's Python programming, and here's how we can do things. And I'm inspired by that because

734
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:04,019
the, you know, the technology is much closer to them than us that left university in the 90s.

735
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,820
You don't achieve that, Andy, unless you give a voice to that next generation. You just make

736
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:11,340
them feel as though they can put their hand up in a meeting. And then, you know, the genius flows

737
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:16,039
from there. We see leaders, another dimension is that curiosity is a word that comes up all the

738
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:20,280
time, Andy. Leaders are really curious. And through that, they approach their own sense

739
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,000
of learning and development. I think you just articulated that with the voice of the young

740
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,440
generation. I mean, how do you feel about curiosity? It's a fabulous word. One of my

741
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,340
dearest friends in the world is somebody here in London, incredibly successful multi-generational

742
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:40,340
business in every aspect you can imagine, industrial, technology, real estate, transportation.

743
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:46,539
But he's the most curious person I know. And he's fascinated about, you know, people's different

744
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:50,480
backgrounds, different businesses, and he will grill them. And you feel he doesn't need to do

745
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,179
that. His wealth is set up. He has all the attributes of a very successful person, but he is

746
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:59,960
intensely focused. And so I learned from him, right? And then he learns, and then he'll pick up

747
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,239
some innocuous piece of information, go and buy a book and read it. And then you say, how did you

748
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:09,739
know that? Well, I read the book. And so he's very open. He also has six children, and those six

749
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:11,320
children have been inspired, I think, by the way he's been taught. And so he's very open. And so

750
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:16,260
curiosity and doing likewise. What a great story. Communicating with clarity,

751
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:21,559
we see is a really common dimension of great leadership. And you can see that you're clearly

752
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:28,079
a great communicator. And in your role, you know, getting that communication right is pretty

753
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,000
paramount in the industry that you're in. How have you gone about that? Yeah, again, it comes through

754
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,920
mentorship and learning. And, you know, I've been privileged to work at this firm for three decades,

755
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:41,019
and you get a lot of guidance when you're younger. There are very difficult times in this business.

756
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,619
And it can get scary. It can get frightening. And it can get very, very difficult because the

757
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:49,760
markets, the capital markets are incredibly volatile, particularly at the moment. So you

758
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,900
learn things about communication. One is obviously being transparent and clear, right? As soon as you

759
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,199
lack transparency, clients know it, and that builds a problem. So if I'm going to deliver

760
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:04,159
you look bad news, I'm going to make that the first call of the day, because every other call

761
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:07,340
is going to be easier. Obviously, that's one of the first things you learn. But secondly,

762
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,320
even though you may be very disappointed with the clarity, you're going to be very disappointed with

763
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:16,800
my message, you're actually hopefully going to sit back, digest that and say, well, at least he

764
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:23,519
called, right? At least he showed up to say, this is bad. Now, it's very easy to deliver good news.

765
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,920
We all love doing that. It's really hard. But when you have a team around you, I'll give you a great

766
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,860
example. In the middle of the last crisis, the big crisis, 08, 09, one of our most senior people,

767
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:39,199
who's probably the best and most articulate knowledge maker of markets, he's basically

768
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:44,460
our chairman of strategy, and a wonderful speaker, and has a following that goes back four

769
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:50,179
decades. He had committed to come to Los Angeles to talk to 150 of our largest clients. And we

770
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:54,079
didn't have all the answers. We were talking to clients every day, but we thought this would be

771
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,900
a great thing that we could give some clarity. This is probably a month after Lehman Brothers,

772
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,340
so we're talking October of 2008. And it was on the Tuesday, 150 people responded for lunch,

773
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:08,599
Beverly Hills Hotel. And he rings me on the Sunday night in LA and says,

774
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,400
I got bad news. The bank is asking me to go to Washington. I've got to talk to the Fed,

775
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:16,000
and I have to cancel your meeting. And I went into a panic. I can't give the presentation

776
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,260
because they talk to me all the time. They wanted something different. My boss,

777
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:25,880
I called her straight away. I've been under her for three decades. She said, what time is the lunch?

778
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:32,139
I said, 12. She said, where is it? Beverly Hills Hotel. Okay, I'm getting back to you. The next

779
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:36,500
thing I got was an email of the flight times. So she was taking the flight out first thing in the

780
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,079
morning, made the lunch. I think she got there at 11.15.

781
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:45,099
LAX, did the lunch, went straight back to New York. That's not communicating verbally. That's

782
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:51,079
communicating by actions. So as busy as she was with all of this crisis going, she realized that

783
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:56,019
there was no fault here. The other individual had to go on and do something else. You learn from

784
00:39:56,019 --> 00:40:01,300
that, and you realize that prioritization is communicating. Yeah, beautifully said, Andy.

785
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:05,579
So much wisdom and knowledge in that story. Final dimension I want to ask you about,

786
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:09,179
we see leaders now value collaboration more than they ever have done in any,

787
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:15,840
in any year and seek it and go after it. Does collaboration form a big part of your leadership

788
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:21,219
style? Oh, absolutely. We have teams all over the world and thousands of people, even in our

789
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:27,599
division that work, I wouldn't say for us, but with us, right? They're partners. And again,

790
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:30,659
it goes back to this learning curve of the different ages, but more importantly,

791
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:34,840
the different experiences people have. So to understand current conflict in Russia and

792
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,019
Ukraine, we have hundreds of Ukrainian employees. We also have hundreds of Russian employees.

793
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,239
The firm has done everything we possibly can to make sure they, they're part of the team. They're

794
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:47,860
wearing the jersey, right? Same as when something happens in the Middle East or what's going on in

795
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:53,019
Asia and think about our Asia business. I spent nine beautiful years in Hong Kong. We can't go

796
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:57,840
to Hong Kong and they can't come here. It's only just opening now. But there are people we work

797
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,659
with every day. There are people we've grown up with, there are people we've hired, trained and

798
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:07,000
developed. So I think that, that, that idea of collaboration, thank God for technology. If you

799
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,639
go back to March of 20,

800
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:14,019
I think, you know, lockdown in London happened about March 12th was when we first realised this

801
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:19,000
was going to happen. We didn't even have, very senior people used a different type of video

802
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,079
transmitter. We didn't have Zoom then. We overnight moved to 150,000 people onto Zoom

803
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,880
within about a week. We can't imagine life without that now. So one, you've got to pivot

804
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,320
and two, you've got to understand the necessity. That being said, as good as Zoom is, there's

805
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,840
nothing like sitting in front of the great Luke Darcy, because if we were doing this by Zoom,

806
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,000
it would be a different conversation.

807
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:44,460
And that, that transpires itself or transcends itself, I should say, to our internal meetings,

808
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,280
but more importantly, our external meetings. So we've been pushing people, talk about

809
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:53,280
collaboration. Doesn't matter, you know, as long as you're safe to travel, fit to travel,

810
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,780
get out and see our clients in person. And we tried to get there as quickly as we could

811
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,980
all over the world. And sometimes I couldn't make the meeting, so somebody else would go,

812
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:04,519
or they couldn't make the meeting, I went instead. So this idea of collaboration is

813
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:06,860
absolutely critical to making sure this business works.

814
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,179
Any final two questions? Very great.

815
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:14,619
Again, for your precious time, but asking these two questions of a range of leaders,

816
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,260
who has been the greatest leader in your life?

817
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:24,360
My father, definitely my father. And he wasn't a big international businessman. He ran a business

818
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:31,920
in Australia and did very well, but just his concepts, his ideals, maybe in a different

819
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,679
generation. He was an immigrant kid to the US. His parents were immigrants actually,

820
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,980
and he grew up in a different environment.

821
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:46,579
Well-educated and came to Australia, met my mother. That's one. The other is both my current

822
00:42:46,579 --> 00:42:53,480
boss and the boss before who retired, passionate about doing the right thing, passionate about

823
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:59,000
youth, passionate about diversity and inclusion, but mostly passionate about, you know, we're in

824
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,619
a very privileged position, enjoy it, digest it, and then make sure you carry that on. And,

825
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:09,179
you know, like great athletes in relay races, make sure you pass the baton in the relay in a,

826
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:10,519
you know, better shape than you've received it.

827
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:15,719
Do you know what I love, Andy? Those that mention a parent, they don't hesitate. You know, it's a,

828
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:20,559
you know, that instantly comes to your mind when you know the gift of how lucky you were. I had the

829
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:26,820
same experience with my dad. It's just, you know, my beautiful mum turned 70 just before I came to

830
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,960
London, but yeah, you know, so lucky on both fronts. But when you know that you had that gift

831
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,199
of someone who was incredible in your life from a parent point of view, it comes out, you know,

832
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:38,420
instantaneous. I could see that. In the final question,

833
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:42,059
in the sense of collaboration, you've got a diverse range of interests and friends

834
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:46,400
all around the globe. And clearly what you've done here for 30 years is an incredible story.

835
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,400
But if you could collaborate with anyone on any part of your life, is there someone that

836
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,460
springs to mind? Yeah, there's a gentleman that you and I both know who's down in Melbourne. He's

837
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:00,440
actually in Europe at the moment. Very special individual. And, you know, we're childhood

838
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,719
friends like a lot of you have. And I'm still very close friends with all the guys I went to

839
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:08,480
high school with and university and rowing. But this is a different relationship because

840
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:13,400
he started sending me cassette tapes when I first moved to Berlin. And you got to understand for

841
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,420
those that are younger listening in 1991, when I moved to Berlin, there was no internet. There was

842
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:22,039
no cell phone that you could use. No one had a cell phone and it was expensive to dial from Germany

843
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:28,159
back home. And so we either communicated by fax, postcards or letters, but he would send me weekly

844
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:33,139
a tape and he put in a cassette recorder tape for those that don't know is a plastic little box with

845
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:37,280
a tape on it. Then it's gone. Why don't we have to explain a cassette recorder now. A voice on the

846
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,119
other side. And, and, and he'd do things.

847
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,739
Like the tram in Melbourne, just making sure you know where your roots are, mate, or the footy,

848
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:50,039
right? With the roar of the MCG or the pub, whatever it was. And my heart melted because

849
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:54,780
I felt like I was home and I had something we've continued that for 30 years. And it's called the

850
00:44:54,780 --> 00:45:00,219
Friday call. It could be 30 seconds. It could be six minutes. And that is something. And we

851
00:45:00,219 --> 00:45:05,460
pretty much, we probably do 90% of Fridays. I'll be in a cab. He'll be walking into a dinner Friday

852
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:09,099
call, bang, bang, bang, everywhere, everywhere. That, that type of,

853
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:15,239
um, um, relationship gives you confidence and strength that you can go out and do other things,

854
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:20,039
knowing that you've got these solid foundations. And I would carry that on to many other friends

855
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:24,659
I grew up with and obviously family. But, um, if there's, if there's one thing that I think about,

856
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:27,900
that's very special. Yeah. And I'm going to name Andrew Sutherland, who you're talking about,

857
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:32,460
because, uh, I feel the same way. I feel so privileged to, uh, and those listening will,

858
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:38,159
will know when he's in your corner and you get a call from him. It's like you have your whole life,

859
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:39,099
your battery. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

860
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:45,219
And you're on fire and he's so kind and generous and kind enough to, uh, to connect me with you

861
00:45:45,219 --> 00:45:49,539
here today, along with so many other people. Selfless and just so giving. Yeah. Incredible

862
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:53,900
to learn from. And, uh, and Andy, I feel, you know, you feel like his twin brother in some ways,

863
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:57,559
you know, sitting across and, uh, he said, mate, give Andy a hug. Um, you know, you'll,

864
00:45:57,579 --> 00:46:01,420
you'll love the experience. I've loved every bit of it, Andy. I've got four hours more questions,

865
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:05,119
but I know that's not possible. So thanks for, uh, for your time today. It's been a great pleasure.

866
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,800
Terrific being part of it and amazing. Yeah. I, uh, for those listening, I'm,

867
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,019
I am out of the country for a long time, but massive AFL fan, not your team, unfortunately,

868
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:19,699
but, uh, got you a couple of weeks back. Uh, watch, uh, my wife knows, uh, there's a two and

869
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:23,039
a half hour period every single week, depending on where the game is, win or lose, watch every

870
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,300
single minute. And, uh, we'll be back one day, but it is fabulous to sit next to such an AFL

871
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:33,480
legend. Thanks Andy. Really appreciate it. Empowering leaders was presented by me, Luke
