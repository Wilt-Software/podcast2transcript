00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,830
Andy Friend is one of the world's most respected rugby coaches

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,289
with a career spanning more than three decades.

3
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:13,070
Andy shares his really clear vision for what it takes to be successful

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,970
in a team environment and the clear boundaries he sets up

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:16,809
to make this happen.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,750
My message to all the young coaches when I'm working with the coaches

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,969
that I'm working with now is, you know, when they say we've got

8
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:23,570
a big event on, I say, go home, mate.

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,489
Oh, no, no, I've got to, no, no, no, go home.

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,629
The loneliness of leadership is something we hear often in this podcast

11
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:32,229
and Andy Friend shares his passion for setting up support networks

12
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,210
and trusted friends that you can count on.

13
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:37,250
Yeah, it can be very lonely because there is a perception

14
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,609
that leaders have all the answers.

15
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:41,090
People often leave them alone.

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,570
They go, oh, it's probably too scary to go and have a chat to that play.

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,270
This is where I reckon leaders have to have their critical friends

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:48,750
around them.

19
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:51,530
They've got to have three or four people that normally aren't even

20
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,049
in the building.

21
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,450
So my wife is one, a really good mate who I'll pick up the phone

22
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,369
and I'll ring him if ever I'm battling through with something.

23
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,909
So you need to have three of them.

24
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,890
My father's probably the other one.

25
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,930
Australian rugby has fallen behind the other codes despite its proud history.

26
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,209
Andy Friend shares his thoughts on what needs to change.

27
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,950
We put a lot of games on at 7.30 in the evening.

28
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,530
Tickets became very expensive.

29
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,650
We lost the generation of kids wanting to come through and play it

30
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,829
and kids can't just turn on the telly and watch their heroes.

31
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:22,790
So that's a real simple, simplistic version to us.

32
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:26,030
There's a lot of other things going on that need to be addressed

33
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,150
and there are some good people in the building there trying

34
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,569
to address those things at the moment.

35
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:30,870
It's been a great privilege for us.

36
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,230
It's been a great privilege to collaborate with Andy Friend

37
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,769
in our Elita Connect program.

38
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:39,450
Andy has in his group Scott Selwood, AFL legend, Cam Serrato from the NRL,

39
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:43,370
Matt Nielsen of San Antonio Spurs and Jonas Edevale from Arsenal,

40
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:46,590
a group of elite coaches getting together to learn, to connect

41
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,329
and to collaborate.

42
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,090
You don't need to be an elite coach to be part of Elita.

43
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,629
Head to elitacollective.com today, book a discovery call.

44
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,790
We'd love to connect with you.

45
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:57,849
Big thanks to the team at Temper Bedding, a mattress like no other.

46
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:00,730
Appreciate their support of bringing conversations like this

47
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,290
to the table.

48
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,689
Investing in a brilliant temper mattress is a decision you won't regret.

49
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:11,979
For nearly 30 years, Andy Friend has been one of the most respected coaches

50
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:12,699
in world rugby.

51
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,919
Former head coach of the Brumbies, Australian men's rugby sevens

52
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,080
and successful stints over many years in Japan and Ireland,

53
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,919
having himself represented Australia as a schoolboy in the late 80s.

54
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:26,740
Andy has recently launched Performance Friend, his consultancy business

55
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,840
supporting leaders to unlock their potential and find balance

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,719
in often highly stressful and scrutinised roles.

57
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,080
Andy?

58
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,500
It's great to meet you today.

59
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,099
Thanks for joining me.

60
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,819
No, lovely to meet you too, Darcy, and thanks for having me on.

61
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,300
Andy, 30 years of coaching at the elite level, I'm assuming you gather

62
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,180
a fair bit of expertise.

63
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,580
I want to ask you, if you could go back and start again,

64
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,680
what would you tell yourself as a then 23 or 24-year-old that you might do

65
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,620
if you're starting out again?

66
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,000
I would have said slow down.

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,879
I was always in a hurry, mate.

68
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,139
Most young people are.

69
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,460
You look back now, like when I was 24, when I started my career,

70
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,159
or 25 actually.

71
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:04,900
I didn't feel like I was young.

72
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,919
That was as old as I'd ever been, so I felt like I was pretty experienced.

73
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,560
As you get older, you do realise that with time comes experience,

74
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,099
and probably like everything in my life, I've always been in a hurry

75
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:17,879
to be the best version of myself.

76
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,979
So I would be telling myself just to chill, slow down, still work hard.

77
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:26,319
I do believe in working hard, and I do believe in stretching myself,

78
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,000
but probably not be in the hurry that I was in.

79
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,400
So when you say slow down, do you mean just take some more time,

80
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,879
is there more balance in it, that perhaps you delegate more?

81
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,180
What sort of detail would you go into with that?

82
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,780
I've actually been a good delegator, and I believe I'm a good delegator.

83
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,340
Back in the day, like when I first started at DARS, I was a skills coach.

84
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,659
I was a coaching coordinator.

85
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,360
I had a young family, though, and I'm thankfully still married.

86
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,060
I've got two beautiful boys, so we've got a great family.

87
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,520
But it's probably because of the patience of my wife, Kerry,

88
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,560
and the fact that she allowed me to be or chase this career.

89
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,520
But if I do look back on it now, I mean, I gave up a lot of things that,

90
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:16,879
you know, birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, watching games of footy,

91
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,680
that if I could have my time again, I attempted to be the best father

92
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,420
I could be as well, and there are sacrifices, I think,

93
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,379
in any job that you do.

94
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,939
But my message to all the young coaches when I'm working with the coaches

95
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:31,240
that I'm working with now is, you know, when they say we've got a big event,

96
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,100
I say, go home, mate.

97
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,040
Oh, no, no, go home.

98
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,100
I need you to go home.

99
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,579
Now, I didn't have that voice on my shoulder telling me to do it.

100
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,060
Certainly, you know, when I started coaching in rugby union,

101
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,639
the game had just gone professional.

102
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:47,439
I think everyone was trying to work out what does this new professional game

103
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,660
look like, what does it mean?

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,500
And I think the answer everyone came to, we've got to be busier.

105
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,279
You know, we've got to fill our days.

106
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,360
So I was definitely a part of that.

107
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,779
But the longer you're involved in the game, you realise that, yes,

108
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,459
you need to work hard, but there needs to be good balance and there needs

109
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:02,500
to be a good balance.

110
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,939
There needs to be time spent at home with family.

111
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:08,819
There needs to be time spent on your own to make sure that you're getting

112
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:10,319
what you need to fill your cup.

113
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,800
I know I didn't do that as well as I could have done.

114
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,040
That's a great message, is not to miss the important occasions along the way.

115
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:20,459
What's been the biggest shift you've seen in three decades of coaching?

116
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,500
We've gone from what was an amateur game, and only just recently I learnt

117
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,060
the Latin definition of amateur, and the Latin definition

118
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,459
of amateur is I will love.

119
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,060
And I think that's brilliant.

120
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,540
I'm an amateur sportsman.

121
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,620
I will love my sport.

122
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,139
And we've gone into professional sport.

123
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:39,819
Well, what does that mean?

124
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:41,180
Well, you get paid for what you're doing.

125
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,180
But if we ever lose the love and the passion for what we're doing, in my opinion,

126
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,560
we've lost the ethos of the game.

127
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,959
We've lost why we actually started playing the game.

128
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:56,860
So over time, I've seen that the I love, I will love version of the game drop off

129
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,399
because we now get into, well, how much is he getting?

130
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,660
And why aren't I getting that much?

131
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,300
And where else can I jump over to, you know, to get back into the game?

132
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,500
Yeah.

133
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
And where else can I get the next thing?

134
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,800
And that's been the biggest disappointment for me is we all start playing whatever sport

135
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,860
it is that we play.

136
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,199
We start because we absolutely love it.

137
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,899
And as soon as, and so in my mind as a coach, I want to encourage that and I need to keep

138
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:18,899
pushing that.

139
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:21,160
I need to keep reminding people that's what we're doing.

140
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,199
I do understand that there is times when you'll want to earn more money.

141
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,199
That's fine.

142
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,199
I've got no issue with that.

143
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,879
But don't lose the passion for what it is that we're doing.

144
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,300
And I think over time, that's probably what I've seen.

145
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,180
I've seen that drop off a little bit.

146
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,740
Andy, I think that's the saddest thing you see is, as you said, someone starting out

147
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,220
who loved their sport or loved their chosen profession, that suddenly the stress and the

148
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,540
anxiety or the pressure to perform takes that joy away and you can see it in them, can't

149
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,540
you?

150
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,620
It seems to me that's happening more and more in professional sport that day.

151
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,620
Has that been your observation?

152
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,620
Yeah, it has.

153
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,600
And, you know, I think back when I started, it was all about how skillful you were and

154
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,300
how fit you were, basically.

155
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,100
Were you fast, strong and erratic?

156
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,540
Were you aerobically fit?

157
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,540
And did you have a skill set?

158
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,279
And, you know, I now work on three big pillars in my coaching, body, craft and mind.

159
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,180
The mind never came into it.

160
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,920
But to me, we've always worked on body and craft.

161
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,699
But the mind, as we all know now, Darce, is such a massive part of our game.

162
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:23,079
So because of the influence of social media and because of the pressure that our young

163
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:27,740
sports people are under, and everyone has an opinion on how they're going, the way we

164
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,060
can work with our athletes to control that mind and to make sure that...

165
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,300
They've got the right mentors around them and the right messages are getting to them.

166
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,540
And they don't need to listen to the outside noise, then the better they're going to perform.

167
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,079
But that in itself is a massive task.

168
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,819
Performance friend, as I mentioned, the consultancy that you're up and running and passing on

169
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:52,040
the lessons you've learned over three decades of elite coaching.

170
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,240
If someone's listening and they may be an aspiring sporting coach or a school teacher

171
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,540
or an entrepreneur and wanting to have success, what's the main message you would distill

172
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,720
for them?

173
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,139
This little business kicked off, my wife and I were traveling around Europe and I'd said,

174
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:07,800
listen, I'm going to finish coaching.

175
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,300
I'm back in coaching now, just quietly, so you don't stay away for too long.

176
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,420
But my big message to Kez is, listen, I'm not leaving Canberra again, so we're parked

177
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,420
here.

178
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,420
So I've kept my promise in that one.

179
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,839
But when we were traveling around Australia, with all that experience, and you probably

180
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,839
don't...

181
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,199
I probably didn't recognize that I was picking up experience because I don't think too much

182
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,540
beyond what's in front of me at the moment.

183
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,540
But...

184
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,860
When you talk to people, you realize, actually, I have picked up a lot of experience over

185
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,860
time.

186
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,299
When we were traveling around Europe, we said, well, if I was to start a business, what would

187
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,299
it be?

188
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:44,120
And it would be to help leaders unlock potential, exactly what you said at the front end of

189
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,120
the show.

190
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,360
But we said, well, how do you do that?

191
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,539
And there were five key pillars which we focused on.

192
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:50,860
The first one was purely a rugby one.

193
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,080
So it's around tactical, technical stuff within the game of rugby union.

194
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,720
My other key message before I go further with that, Darcy, I'm not here to tell anyone what

195
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
to do.

196
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
That's not my job.

197
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,899
It's their own way, their own style.

198
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:03,299
But I will challenge your thinking.

199
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:06,320
I will support your thinking if I think it's good, but I'll challenge your thinking if

200
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
I think...

201
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,500
And I challenge it through a range of deep questions.

202
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,500
That's all.

203
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,080
So the first thing was around rugby technical, tactical knowledge.

204
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,960
The second one was around leadership.

205
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
What is leadership?

206
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,200
What type of leader are you?

207
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,759
Do you know what type of leader you are and what you currently are and what you aspire

208
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,759
to?

209
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,519
And how do you get either to where you're aspiring to get to or how do you be the best

210
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,600
version of that leader that you believe you are?

211
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Yeah.

212
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,200
many different types of leadership my third pillar was around behaviors and values so what are my

213
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,440
values and am i living those out and if i'm not what do i change my values or my behaviors the

214
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,620
fourth one was around building a safe sustainable culture of probably environments probably the word

215
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,940
i prefer but how do we do that as leaders and then the fifth one which is probably the biggest one

216
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,779
which answers your question is self-awareness self-reflection so what makes me as a leader

217
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:06,559
the best leader that i can be what do i need to have to make sure that i'm at my best thinking

218
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:12,399
at my optimum getting the right balance in my life because it's only when you're right you know it's

219
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,620
the classic put the oxygen mask on yourself before you help your kids on the plane do the same in

220
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,120
life put the oxygen mask on yourself get the stuff that you need to make your function and when you

221
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,779
can do that you'll be the best version for for what it is you're attempting to do so they're the

222
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:28,700
five pillars but that

223
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:34,399
last one seems to be the one that's resonating the most with people and um it's probably the

224
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,720
one i'm working the most on yeah it's interesting that is the question i want to ask you in a moment

225
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,639
what you do to for your cup essentially i'll come back to that in a moment but i'm interested

226
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,860
we had a lot of people i've spoken to on this podcast who have spoken about the loneliness

227
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,100
of leadership you know especially the elite coaches that i think i've spoken to is that

228
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,960
is that something you felt along the way that it can be lonely yeah it can be very lonely it can

229
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,700
be very lonely on lots of different fronts

230
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:04,240
i think um there is the perception if you're the leader that um you have all the answers no one has

231
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,980
the answers no one has all the answers um i heard john birch and i was on a one of the elite master

232
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,519
classes with him just recently and i loved he said the only thing i know is that i don't know

233
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,179
and i love that i reckon that was brilliant i've stolen that and i've used it a few times because

234
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:24,960
the only thing i know is that i don't know so i will have an idea on some some things so one of

235
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,759
the things that i like to think i am i'm considered i will consider everything that i know and i'm

236
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:34,779
more than happy to listen to opinions but i'll i'll either make my own mind up or if i don't know

237
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:41,039
i'll seek further guidance and advice because there is a perception that leaders have all the

238
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,179
answers people often leave them alone like i was probably too scary to go and have a chat to that

239
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:49,820
bloke the second part about it is you know you make some pretty tough calls when you're sitting

240
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:55,179
at the top of the tree you're you're employing people or you're letting people go you're renewing

241
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:58,759
contracts or you're not renewing contracts you you know you make some big calls and you're not

242
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:04,360
on on how we're going to do certain things that that won't appease everybody you make selections

243
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,039
every single week that virtually two-thirds of your squad are going to have the the you know

244
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,960
they're going to have the year it's with you because you haven't selected them so there's a

245
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,919
lot of things that your decisions that you're making that have the potential to alienate you

246
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:22,019
from others but that's part of the job you know leadership's a it's a it's an action it's not

247
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:27,080
it's not just a title so you've got to be able to live those and because of that it can be a lonely

248
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,139
place but

249
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:34,120
this is where i reckon leaders have to have their critical friends around them they've got to have

250
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,080
three or four people that normally aren't even in the building so my wife is one for example

251
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,360
i've got a really good mate who i'll pick up the phone and i'll ring him if ever i'm i'm battling

252
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,500
through with something i actually did have one of my one of my last staff was it was a very good

253
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,720
critical friend for me it was actually my ceo and i could just pick up the phone and give give willie

254
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,259
a call and he'd give me his view on something so you need to have three of my father's probably

255
00:12:58,259 --> 00:12:58,759
the other one you need to have three of my father's probably the other one you need to have

256
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:04,340
three or four that depending upon the pain you're having at the moment you can reach out to these

257
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,539
certain people and they can they can guide you and say no listen you're from everything i've

258
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:13,100
known mate you you're on the right track or yeah red flag there friendly i'd avoid that one

259
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,100
and uh you mentioned uh leader connect we've been really privileged to cross over with you and

260
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,720
um your group understands that a fantastic connection janice edervale from arsenal and

261
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,419
cam serrato from canterbury in the nrl scott selwood uh from the collingwood football club

262
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:32,720
nelson from the san antonio spurs can you tell us about that experience how's it been for you

263
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,139
collaborating with a group like that oh it's been brilliant darce and and and you know stacy leads

264
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:42,419
it really well for us as well so yeah just uh i mean it was actually eddie jones that told me about

265
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:46,299
it when i was having a chat to eddie he said listen i actually a bigger part it wasn't it was

266
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:49,620
neil craig craig he said to me listen i've got a duck on this elite of course and i said what's

267
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,779
that he said oh you know he shared he shared it really briefly he said give eddie a call mate and

268
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,379
he'll send you the information so i gave eddie a call he said mate it's brilliant so he gave him

269
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:05,019
and um uh i had a chat to matt and then yeah we we linked up with our group and and we've just

270
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:11,179
gone into the meeting once every five six weeks and it feels feels distant like it was really

271
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:15,279
cool when we're meeting every fortnight and we've all sort of said jesus can we can we hurry this

272
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:21,039
thing up can we not be a little bit early because you you what you realize in in that in the group

273
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:26,799
darce is you've just got everyone's got the same sort of pains right everyone's got whatever the

274
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,659
issues are you've either had the pain or you're

275
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:33,460
currently going through the pain or you're or actually it's like oh this is coming then um and

276
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:39,240
it's just a great sharing which and it probably goes to show the fact that back to your point

277
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,919
leadership and head coaching and at the top end it can be very lonely because people don't share

278
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:49,059
and certainly people within the same sport don't tend to share because everyone feels that they've

279
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:54,500
got the secret you know we're going to hold it pretty tight um my observations of that the more

280
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,399
you share the better you become if you don't share you become an island and you miss out on a lot of

281
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:04,220
so um i share everything i allow anyone to come into our practice you're welcome to come in and

282
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,220
have a look if you're prepared to write to me and say you want to come and observe us come through

283
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,919
the door the only thing i need from you tell me one of three things as you leave or tell me three

284
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:17,200
things as you leave what was the thing that was most impressive to you what was the thing you

285
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,820
thought you would see but you didn't see and what was the thing you saw but you've seen it done

286
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,100
better and you wouldn't mind telling us about it and so not only when we get people coming through

287
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,620
the door

288
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:32,759
more than happy to to share everything we're doing but i need to get some growth out of it too and

289
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,539
with those three simple questions we tend to get a bit of growth yeah i love it i love the openness

290
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:42,600
to learn and as you said take some feedback along the way you mentioned your wife carrie who had

291
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,240
a significant accident in 2010 and on the back of that you organized and completed

292
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,200
a nearly 5 000 kilometer bike ride from cooktown in queensland to canberra and raised

293
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:58,039
170 000 at the time for awareness and support of people with brain injury it's a great achievement

294
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:01,720
and yeah i'm happy to tell them about that and i'd like to thank them for that and i'd like to tell

295
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,779
them a little bit about that experience yeah uh happy to actually funnily enough this week i was

296
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:08,340
meant to be finishing that ride um i'll come back to that in a tix but but yeah so when

297
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:14,779
carrie had had the accident and uh it happened in may and and i continued coaching with the

298
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:18,759
brumbies and the second game into the next season i got the sack and at the time it was my second

299
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:24,200
sack in as a as a head coach but honestly darce shy of when it when you know the surprise of oh

300
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,679
hang on, looks like there's a bit of trouble here. When they sacked me, I had not an ounce

301
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:32,600
of regret around it or disappointment with it. I was disappointed with a few people, but

302
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,200
it was great. Now I can spend some time with my wife because again, one of those balanced things,

303
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,139
I was a head coach. So I was going to keep talking to, you know, doing my job and probably at the

304
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:48,320
detriment, although we still did very much managed care, she'd had a severe brain injury. So there

305
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,259
was a lot of work that we needed to do to rehabilitate her. But when I lost my job,

306
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:58,960
I chose to take a year off to work with Kerry. And one of the things, Kerry and I had both been

307
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,200
outward bound instructors. And when you work, or the more I read about people with brain injury,

308
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:10,000
there's two things they say you should try and do. One is avoid the clutter of the world. So

309
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,480
go into nature where we don't have the lights and the noises and the crossover conversations

310
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,759
and the phones and all these different things, because that allows the brain to recoup.

311
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
And the second thing they said,

312
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:29,579
is try and allow the person recovering to achieve something and ideally go back to something they

313
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:34,319
were very strong at. So the bush was really comfortable for us. Kerry was, she's always

314
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:40,339
been known as the backup queen. So she was always, again, as a wife and as a mother and

315
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:43,259
outward bound, she was always in the background trying to support things.

316
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,500
Yeah, it's those sliding door moments, the weird moments where I get this thing in the mail saying

317
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,339
there's this bicentennial national trail, the longest horse trail in the world.

318
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:52,240
Why don't you try?

319
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:57,880
And it starts in Cooktown and it finishes in Healesville. And then my silly brain says,

320
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:04,339
geez, I could do that. And Kez could join me. And we get Kerry out in the bush, in the nature.

321
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:08,900
Every day we'll leave from point A, but because I'm on a horse trail, she can't

322
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:14,079
follow me in a vehicle. So she needs to navigate and get her way to wherever we decided point B

323
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:21,579
was going to be. And that will give her a sense of purpose and achievement. And over 93 days,

324
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:28,440
we did it. And we got to Canberra and we had a brilliant response from the local community

325
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,380
and supporters and raised the amount of money that we did. I've always had it in the back of

326
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:39,980
my head though, I needed to finish this ride, right? So we landed back in Canberra on the 26th

327
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:46,599
of December, I think it was. I tried to ride in January the next year, but we got rained out. We

328
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:51,299
had three days of rain. I got to Tom Groggan and we couldn't cross the creek there. So a ranger

329
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:54,799
pulled us out and then I had to go to Japan and coach. And I've pretty much been away ever since.

330
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:59,400
So this week was to be the week that a mate of mine and I were going to do it, but unfortunately,

331
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,000
his mother needed an operation. So we pulled out, but we will complete it. We'll get down to

332
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,039
Hillsville, mate. I've got about 600K to go and we'll get that done just as a bucket tick. But

333
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:15,019
yes, listen, that ride itself, we call it the friendly ride. Amazing in so many ways, but the

334
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:21,000
most important thing that we did was rehabilitated my wife. And, you know, she's

335
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,819
incredible lady and she's very, very strong now off the back of that. And, you know, she's a

336
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:30,779
survivor of a brain injury. What a great story and appreciate you sharing it. You did mention

337
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:36,660
just briefly that, you know, that happened, which would have been a life-changing moment for you and

338
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,039
Kerry. And then you get sacked shortly afterwards. It's a brutal sport at times, isn't it? You didn't

339
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:46,000
have regret at that time. I mean, how have you dealt with the inevitable highs and lows of

340
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,579
coaching and getting sacked? Well, yeah, I said there before, mate, that was the second sacking

341
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,099
I had. But along the way, I've had some other tragedies, like real life tragedies where I've

342
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:04,259
lost a player in South Africa or where Kerry had had her accident and we nearly lost her.

343
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:10,099
So those things, whilst you never want those things to happen, they do happen. That's life.

344
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:14,480
And it just puts everything in perspective. So certainly my first sacking from the Waratahs in

345
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,980
2004, I was broken. I couldn't work out what had happened and why would this happen to me?

346
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,880
And I always felt like I'd worked really hard and been very honest with what I'd done. But

347
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,099
the head coach made a decision and I was the one that suffered from that.

348
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:37,440
The second one, when that came around, I said I'd had these other tragedies occur within my life.

349
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:44,359
And I honestly, it just paled into insignificance into anything else that had taken place. So

350
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:49,400
I think ever since the heart, the real heartache things that go on in your life,

351
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,980
you do get real perspective on things.

352
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,420
I want to win. I want to be successful. I want to win every game we go and play,

353
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:01,900
but reality is you can't. And if you can't, oh well, next. I'm not going to get too caught up on

354
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:06,980
that. Whereas previously I would have been caught up on that. Because again, I've seen the real

355
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,519
tragedies of what life can throw at you and losing a job is not one of them now.

356
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:16,140
And Australian rugby's had incredibly proud history and its place in the Australian sporting

357
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,359
landscape has over time been enormous. But as an outsider,

358
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,880
watching the sport that you love and you've spent your life in it, it appears to be a sport

359
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,900
struggling to keep up with the other codes. Why do you think it's fallen so far behind?

360
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,279
Yeah, it's a great question, Darson. It's one that a lot of people are trying to answer at the

361
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:41,119
moment. We definitely are falling behind on lots of fronts. I think the game at a base level is

362
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:46,859
still very strong, but certainly our national team and the top version of the game, the Super,

363
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:50,799
is nowhere near as popular as the AFL or,

364
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,359
NRL is at the minute. A big reason for that is it's not on free-to-air. It's very hard to access

365
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:03,039
that. I think the bigger reason is when the game went professional, the focus was on the top

366
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:10,619
1% of people. And the game is, it only survives on grassroots. The bigger you make that foundation,

367
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:18,799
the base, the better it is. I grew up in Melbourne, so a mad AFL supporter. So my team's the

368
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,980
bombers. Why? Because as an eight-year-old, I grew up in Melbourne, so I grew up in Melbourne,

369
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,460
ran out onto Waverley Park, and I touched Paul Van Der Haar, and he signed my autograph book,

370
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:30,519
and I've rusted on ever since. And people say to me still, who's your footy team,

371
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,960
Freddie? Bombers. Who are they? They don't play rugby. No, they don't. They're AFL, mate. But

372
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,900
he was my hero back in the day because I could go and touch him. And we don't have that in rugby,

373
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:46,160
sadly. Well, we lost that. We lost that. Why? Because we put a lot of games on at 7.30 in the

374
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,960
evening because of the Super program that was running at the time. Tickets became

375
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,579
very expensive. We lost the generation of kids wanting to come through and play it. And kids

376
00:22:55,579 --> 00:23:01,400
can't just turn on the telly and watch their heroes. So that's a real simple, simplistic

377
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,940
version to ask. There's a lot of other things going on that need to be addressed. And there

378
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,980
are some good people in the building there trying to address those things at the moment.

379
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:15,220
I do think the women's space, which is the space I've just got myself into, I think that's a great

380
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:20,759
target for us because I think our female athletes in this country are phenomenal. And we do have a

381
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:27,279
home World Cup in 2029. I was in Europe traveling when the Tillys did what they did in 23. But the

382
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,279
only time I said to Kez that we need to pull up in a caravan park is when the Tillys were playing

383
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:35,299
because I just wanted to watch them. Now, I don't mind soccer, but I'm not a mad soccer

384
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:40,819
supporter. But I had to watch that because they captured the nation. And I reckon our girls could

385
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:47,920
do the same in 29 if we get the funding and the support that is needed between now and 2029 to

386
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,420
get them on a home World Cup. We could do that. So

387
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:55,359
I still hold hope for the game. I love my AFL. I love my league. I love every sport,

388
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,640
to be honest with you, mate. But I'd love to see rugby genuinely because of the good reasons,

389
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,500
not the bad reasons. Fill up a front page of a newspaper or the back page of a newspaper and

390
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,420
people go, it's a great sport. Let it continue. I love you sharing that story, isn't it? The one

391
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:16,319
moment with Paul Vanderhaar, the great Vander, and that you forget, don't you, the impact that

392
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:20,059
an athlete, just one moment can be someone rusted on for life. And

393
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:25,759
it's a powerful thing to remind everyone. We mentioned these patterns of leadership that

394
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:29,359
we're fascinated in. I'm interested that you went there yourself when I asked you about,

395
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,059
you feel as though the most important pillar you teach people is this idea of self-leadership.

396
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,000
I wanted to ask you, how do you make time for you to feel your best so that

397
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,259
you can lead others? What do you do on a self-leadership front?

398
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah, I'm an early riser. I've always been an early riser, but that's the time when I can have

399
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,720
my time. So between about 5.30 and 7.30, that's pretty much my time. Now,

400
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,920
my 5.30 to 6.00 always starts with making quesacapa because I are with that at least.

401
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,940
But after that, mate, I love my bushwalking, my mountain biking, my cycling,

402
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:07,039
heading to a gym and just being in my own little world. And if I'm walking, I've got podcasts on

403
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:13,839
or I've got my books on. I'm a big listener to audio books. If I'm cycling, I'm just in the zone

404
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:18,980
knowing that I'm helping myself get fit and stay at the level that I want to be at.

405
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,519
Similarly, if I'm in the gym.

406
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:26,400
That first hour, hour and a half of the day is where I fill my cup. If I don't do it,

407
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,119
and sometimes you can't because you're traveling or you can't do it, I get through the day. I'm

408
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:37,500
fine, but I'm nowhere near as good as I could be. And then the last thing I do is certainly when I

409
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:43,319
was in the head coaching role, I would never come home back to Cares without having completely

410
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:48,680
decompressed and solved the things that I needed to solve through the course of the day. And then

411
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,740
when I got home, I turned my phone off. So that's the first hour and a half of the day.

412
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:56,640
And again, in Galway, where we just came from at Connett, I always walk to work. That was part

413
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:03,140
of my routine of getting my listening in or talking to loved ones back in Australia. Coming

414
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:07,799
home, but that walk is 25 minutes. Coming home, it could be 25 minutes, but it could be two hours,

415
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,859
depending upon the day I'd had. But I had to have that time to decompress and maybe make phone calls

416
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:19,619
and maybe make texts and just deal with the things. So when I walk through the door, that's all done

417
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:25,799
now. I'm sorted. And I got into a really good routine and space of doing that. But I know that

418
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:30,680
I've got to fill those cups before I can be anywhere near the best version of myself or others.

419
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:34,140
What's the one piece of leadership advice that you pass on the most?

420
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:41,079
It's not a popularity contest. So you're going to have to make tough decisions and don't be afraid

421
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:45,220
of that. In fact, I never go looking for trouble. I honestly don't go looking for trouble. But

422
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,960
when I see it straight away, I jump on it straight away,

423
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,460
because here's a great chance to learn. And here's a great chance to lay down some markers.

424
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:58,859
So I hear a lot of people say, I struggle with tough conversations. I don't call them tough

425
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:02,539
conversations. I call them real conversations, because no one wants to do anything tough, right?

426
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,599
But I'm happy to do things that are real. So I'm happy to have a real conversation. I'm happy to

427
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:10,579
tell you exactly what I think. And if you've crossed a line on something, I'm happy to pull

428
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:14,599
you up on that. In fact, I said, I'm not going to go searching for it. But as soon as I see it,

429
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:18,059
I do not turn a blind eye to that. I jump onto that straight away.

430
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,700
But you've got to make sure as a leader, you're prepared to make those real decisions that may be

431
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,940
uncomfortable for some people. But for others, they shine a light and they give them the direction.

432
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:35,140
Yeah, I love that concept of real conversations. We're interested in vision and setting a vision

433
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:40,180
is one thing. But how could you pass on some advice on how you deliver a vision to a team?

434
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:42,460
That's something you've been doing for a long period of time.

435
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,460
Yeah, and it's probably something that I've always, up until recently,

436
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:52,299
I've struggled with. That word vision, what is it? But in my last contract with Connett,

437
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,599
so I had a three-year contract and then they offered me a two-year extension. And

438
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:00,619
Kerry and I discussed it at length. And I went back to the CEO and I said,

439
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,819
Willie, I'm happy to sign a two-year extension. And he said, and what's your vision, friendly?

440
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:11,420
And I went to rattle something off really quick. And he said, no, no, pause. He said,

441
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:15,180
I want you to look over your shoulder now and imagine you're driving down

442
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,440
away from the spot. And I said, no, no, pause. And he said, no, no, pause. And I said, no, no,

443
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,400
college road. The sports ground was on a road called College Road. You're driving down the

444
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,140
sports ground at the end of your two-year tenure and you look over your shoulder. What do you want

445
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:30,160
to see? And again, I went to race into something. He said, no, no, no, go and have a think and come

446
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,859
back and tell me. It was a great question. So I went away and I thought about actually,

447
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:40,220
what do I want to see? And that became the vision. The great Stephen Covey started at the end and

448
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:46,259
worked back towards that. So that's now exactly how I set my visions is I start with,

449
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:50,440
what it is that I want to see at the end of it. And then I start to share that with people.

450
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:57,880
So I can have the vision, but how they can influence that and their input into that is

451
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:03,599
really important too. So I make sure that it's a vision that, for example, one of the key part,

452
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,380
I want this to be a really safe place to work. I want you to be able to walk through the door

453
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,019
and just be you. Is everyone comfy with that? Friendly, that'd be brilliant if we could do it.

454
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:16,079
Sweet. So how are we going to do it guys? And then we start to layer on the steps that we need

455
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,140
to do to make sure that's going to happen. What do you need for me for that to work? What do I need

456
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,720
from you? What do you need from the other staff? What does it need to look like when we win? What

457
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,559
does it need to look like when we lose? What does it need to look like when we're 40 points down

458
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:31,279
after 20 minutes? What's it need to look like there that you're still safe? And we just have

459
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,619
these conversations and we build it ourselves. It's not, you know, it's friendly's vision

460
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:40,779
potentially, but it's a collective vision that we've agreed to. But how are we going to live

461
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:46,059
this out? Everyone has input into that. And over time, that's when I've learned that the best vision's

462
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:50,519
are actually, they come to reality. We love the quote, the cost of leadership

463
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:56,579
is time. And how do you juggle your workload and your demands while still promoting a culture that

464
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:00,660
fosters collaboration in the work you do? Well, I think the first thing that we talked

465
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:06,960
about before, I make sure that I'm getting what I need. So the start of every day, and quite often

466
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,819
when most people are asleep, I'm making sure that I'm getting my fill. Yeah, that allows me to do

467
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:16,019
it. The other thing is, and I haven't always been great at this, but

468
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,880
recognizing that family time is family time. I've stopped watching the news. I've not watched

469
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,140
the news for over 10 years now. And so I'm actually really ignorant with what's going on

470
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:33,160
in the world, but happily so. So I'm terrible to have on a trivia pursuit night or on a trivia

471
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,740
quiz. I just can't, I might be able to tell you a grand final team in the late eighties or early

472
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,259
nineties, but, and scores on footy games. I can tell you all that, but in terms of what's going

473
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:46,000
on in the world, I have no idea. And the reason I stopped is because

474
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:51,400
I want to live with my feet. I can't control any of that other stuff. I don't like some of the

475
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,299
stuff I hear. And that's one of the reasons I'll turn it off too. They're never telling you good

476
00:30:54,299 --> 00:31:01,259
stuff, but I can't control it. And as much as the stories are sad, if I let it fill my head,

477
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:05,460
then I can't be the best version of myself for my family and for the people I'm working with.

478
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,599
So that's one of the big things that I've done over the last decade anyway, which

479
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:15,779
it's given me a lot more space to work with the people who are directly in front of me.

480
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:21,279
And to actually listen intently to what it is that they're saying and to try and support them

481
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,519
in the best manner that I can without these other little noises going on in the background or for me

482
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:31,720
wasting my time on someone's Twitter account or whatever other accounts go on, like they're time

483
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,740
wasters, mate. And again, as you said there before, for leaders, we don't have a lot of time.

484
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:43,180
We don't have a lot of spare time. And if I am going to have time that is not in my business,

485
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,880
I want it to be in the business of whoever I'm talking to. So,

486
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:52,839
that's been a real asset or a real strength that I've adopted over the last bit of time.

487
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,200
Talk a lot about communication in this space as a leader. Do you have a mantra

488
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,720
you live by when it comes to how you communicate?

489
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,160
I'm considered, I said it before, but also like the Stephen Covey quote of,

490
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:10,039
you know, seek to understand before being understood. So, I think we're all quick to

491
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:16,059
jump to a conclusion without really getting to know. So, I ask, I call them deep questions,

492
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:20,799
I ask a lot of deep questions. So, if I meet somebody and we start talking,

493
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,880
if the first five things that come out of my mouth are a question, I'm happy with the fact

494
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,380
that I've done that. And it's really just to learn a little bit more and to learn, you know,

495
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:36,980
where they're coming from. So, that would be certainly one thing, mate. I believe I listen

496
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:42,680
actively. I really listen to what they're saying. And the thing that gives me the indication that

497
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,980
I'm listening is because I can ask a deep question after that.

498
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,779
Because I have listened. I'm not there to tell them. You know, as part of my business thing,

499
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:54,539
as I said at the front end, I'm not here to tell you what to do. It's not my job. You know,

500
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,359
it's your life. You can do what you want. And with that, actually, you know, I found that to

501
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:05,140
be really, really powerful because I have a view on the way I may do it. And I always use a simple

502
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:09,279
analogy, Das, like eight plus two equals 10. That's how I would get to 10. Das, you might

503
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,000
get there five plus five. Brilliant. I wouldn't have done that. You might get there seven plus

504
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,920
one plus two. Sweet. It still gets me to 10, but I wouldn't have thought of that.

505
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:20,839
But if I just kept pushing down, go the eight plus two route, then I'm not seeing all these

506
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:25,019
other ways that we could get to that 10. As long as you get me to 10, I'm real happy as a leader.

507
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:31,559
I'm real happy. And I learn as well. So by sitting back and giving people space to explain

508
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:37,240
how they're getting there and why they've chosen that route, I pick up so much knowledge and so

509
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:44,299
many insights. It's really powerful. So I attempt to listen really deeply. I attempt to ask questions

510
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:49,960
before I answer anything. Yeah, I think by giving people space, you get to learn a lot more.

511
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,900
Andy, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

512
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:59,720
Probably my father. He would argue that. But just in the way that he talks to people and the way

513
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:06,480
that he conducts himself. Thankfully, he's still around. He's still with us. But he's a very

514
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:14,280
special man who he has a lot of knowledge, but he sits back and he waits until the right moment.

515
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:19,000
It is to deliver that. Sometimes you won't say a thing. You just sit in the corner and someone

516
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,480
says, what are you thinking there, Brian? What are you thinking there, Pop? You go, I'm thinking

517
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,219
this. And I've always admired that leadership style. And Andy, we're a bit obsessed with this

518
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:32,639
idea of collaboration when you bring unique and interesting people together and you've got a clear

519
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,500
passion and your life's been dedicated to the world of coaching elite rugby. Have you thought

520
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,579
of someone you'd love to collaborate with them on that passion or another passion?

521
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,840
Well, again, our leader,

522
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:50,280
Connect Course, it's been brilliant. Everyone in that group, I absolutely admire the way they're

523
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,820
doing stuff. And that's why I said I miss when our calls are longer than two weeks, you sort of

524
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:00,679
miss what's going on. I watch all the games that are going on and there'd be so many, I reckon.

525
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:08,420
There's probably no one person. Nelson Mandela, I was a huge fan of what Nelson Mandela went more

526
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:13,460
just because of his ability to stay on task and to get through real adversity.

527
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:21,300
I've read a few of his books and so I've got a real fascination for the leader that he was and

528
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:27,159
what he stood for. In the sporting world, Sir Alex Ferguson, I've watched a lot of his stuff.

529
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:32,619
Anyone that can survive as long as he did and have the success that he did had to be pretty special.

530
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,139
So he's probably another one that really stand out. But yeah, listen, anyone who's

531
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:43,019
at the top of their game and prepared to share, I've got a real fascination with them.

532
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:44,059
And Andy, that feels like...

533
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:49,179
I think a great moment to end on, your openness and willingness to share. It sounds like a real

534
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:53,179
cornerstone of who you are. And as you said, people are welcome in your environment, but you

535
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:56,980
want their own learning experience yourself. I certainly found chatting to you a great learning

536
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:00,619
experience. You're such a clear thinker and I'm not surprised you've got the reputation

537
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:03,960
that precedes you. Thanks for joining me. I really enjoyed it.

538
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,000
No, thanks, Dars. Thanks for the questions too, mate. Really good.

539
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:11,099
Thanks for listening to another episode of the Empowering Leaders Podcast. Huge thanks,
