1
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,809
A lot of what they're good at is knowing what the vision is

2
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:12,050
and constantly referring back to it, and is this the right path?

3
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:15,070
Whereas we don't, I think generally, in music, we don't do that.

4
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:17,870
We're like, far out, man, let's just hang on to the tail of this tiger

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,710
and hope for the best.

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,969
Andy Kelly is one of Australia's leading music label directors

7
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:25,649
and managers and is this week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast.

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,649
Sometimes, often, when people are at the absolute peak

9
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:33,689
of their, let's call it, externally perceived success,

10
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:38,369
it's often the peak of their unhappiness and dysfunction.

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,009
He talks about guiding Australia's biggest bands

12
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:43,049
as they rise to the highest of heights.

13
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:46,450
You've been spending your whole life trying to get to this situation

14
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,570
and then all of a sudden, you know, a band like The Vines, for example,

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,630
and it was all brand new to us as managers.

16
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,670
So you've got management trying to work it out really quickly,

17
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,250
trying to help bands that are trying to work it out really quickly.

18
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,810
And the euphoria that fuels the music industry,

19
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:10,010
the combination of hard work and sheer luck involved in finding success.

20
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,569
Jet come along, young guys who just loved rock and roll,

21
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:17,530
and then the kismet of Apple launching the first iPod

22
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,209
and that being the song that was used in that ad,

23
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:21,950
and then Boomba.

24
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,730
It's like a runaway train because they got exposed to so many people

25
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,090
and it is an incredible song.

26
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:28,950
Andy is a generous and passionate leader,

27
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,250
intrigued by things in life that make people bigger than themselves.

28
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,810
I would have this feeling when I go for a kick

29
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,530
with a whole bunch of guys every Sunday.

30
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,090
I'll be driving home or I'll be driving there

31
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,989
and it's one of the best parts of the week.

32
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,049
You look around and I've got this thing in my head,

33
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:44,329
it's like, they don't know.

34
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:46,349
They don't, no one knows how good this is.

35
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,670
There's only a few of us that know that feeling,

36
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:52,730
like that meditation, getting lost in something.

37
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,349
People like Andy who inspire the work we do at Alita.

38
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:58,450
We have genuinely loved having Andy collaborate with us

39
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,650
in our Alita Connect program.

40
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,849
We curate groups of five to six people

41
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,989
around the globe to come together, to learn, to share, and to collaborate.

42
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,989

45
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:13,509
A big thanks as always to Jason Nicholas and his team from Temper Bedding,

46
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:16,250
the best mattress in the world, NASA approved.

47
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:18,569
We know great leaders like Andy Kelly value sleep

48
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:21,710
and investing in a mattress like Temper is a decision you won't regret.

49
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:25,830
Andy Kelly is one of Australia's most successful record label directors

50
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,469
and entertainment managers.

51
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,750
As the founder and manager of Winterman and Goldstein Management

52
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,889
and Ivy League Records,

53
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,430
he has successfully launched and worked with some of the biggest bands in the world.

54
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:41,710
Think The Vines, Jet, Empire of the Sun, Paul Dempsey, Youth Group,

55
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,650
The Avalanches, Something for Kate, The Living End, and many, many more.

56
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,449
Andy's lifetime of success in the music industry

57
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:51,449
has been credited to his ability to write his own rules

58
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:54,069
and to challenge the existing structures within the industry.

59
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,330
Andy's reputation is enormous.

60
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,770
He was described to me like this,

61
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:01,669
Andy is a dead set legend, a people person,

62
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:03,650
thoughtful, curious, and caring.

63
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:06,969
His two superpowers of his would be his empathy and curiosity.

64
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,229
He understands how to utilize strengths and create a team culture.

65
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,270
Andy, great pleasure to spend some time with you.

66
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:14,009
Thanks, Das.

67
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,650
Should we just cut it there?

68
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,610
That's good for me.

69
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:18,889
That's it, we're done.

70
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,469
I also heard you, Andy, described as someone

71
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:26,750
who'd dive in front of a speeding train to save the bands you represent.

72
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:29,210
How did you end up being that person?

73
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,629
We know it's an industry that can be pretty cutthroat,

74
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,509
the music industry.

75
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,770
How did you become the person that would throw themselves under a bus?

76
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,090
Wow.

77
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:38,490
Oh, that's so kind.

78
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:38,909
Wow.

79
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:41,389
I'm a bit overwhelmed by that description.

80
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:46,229
It feels a bit much, but hopefully we never have to test it out.

81
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:51,590
Must remember not to do any bus or train tours from here on.

82
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:55,750
I think it's just, I really love music

83
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,389
and I really love being close to people who are creative.

84
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,550
And I think, you know,

85
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:01,650
the reason I'm here is because I'm a musician.

86
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,949
The reason that we get into whatever we're into,

87
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,810
whether it's, you know, like broadcasting, playing football, music,

88
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,849
whatever it is, we want to connect with people.

89
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:13,110
I mean, it's a really common theme, obviously,

90
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,750
in everything that you talk about here.

91
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,370
I love the connection with people who are creative.

92
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:25,730
And when we first started managing bands and starting a record label

93
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,329
and all that kind of stuff, and I'll talk about, I say we,

94
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:31,389
because there was two people that were very,

95
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:34,350
very pivotal in me being lucky enough to do this.

96
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:39,810
It was because we just wanted to be close to music somehow, you know,

97
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,250
and we weren't good enough to do it.

98
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,910
You know, there's a great quote somewhere from Morrissey,

99
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,269
who was the singer in the Smiths who said, you know,

100
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,550
the music industry is a miserable place for embittered ex-bass players.

101
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,629
And so many music managers are ex-bass players,

102
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:00,709
including myself.

103
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:05,750
Well, but I really love, I really love people.

104
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:08,870
I mean, sweeping statement, I don't love every person,

105
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,750
but I really love the people that I love and being around.

106
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:17,709
And I get, we sort of define ourselves by who is around us.

107
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:21,610
They sort of help us become who we are, our parents, our family,

108
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:28,529
our friends, and through these really talented people that I get to work with,

109
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:30,389
you sort of,

110
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:35,209
helping them connect with other people and strike a chord.

111
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:39,149
And there's like, that gives great joy to people.

112
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:41,089
And I'm sorry, this is a long answer.

113
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:42,170
I will answer your question.

114
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:49,709
But I was watching Coldplay at Glastonbury this year.

115
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:50,629
I wasn't there.

116
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:56,149
I was just watching the footage and I don't listen to Coldplay every day.

117
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:59,949
And, and, but I really understand how they kept, like,

118
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:00,629
I love how they do it.

119
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,689
Yeah.

120
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:01,209
How they connect.

121
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:05,069
Like I would challenge anyone to go and see Coldplay and say that wasn't good.

122
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,529
Even if you don't like Coldplay, it's like, it's incredible.

123
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:10,529
And we were watching, I was watching with my daughter, Evie,

124
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:14,569
and I was getting really emotional because they were seeing,

125
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:17,509
and just the joy on the face of the crowd, you know,

126
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,389
and people were crying and they just connected so well.

127
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:22,709
It was incredible.

128
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:29,670
And I couldn't, I got started crying and she was like, are you okay?

129
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:35,430
And I was like, yeah, I just, I'm so overwhelmed by, this is what it's all about.

130
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,670
This is why people make music.

131
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,990
This is what it means to people.

132
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:40,889
To answer your question.

133
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:47,129
I think the reason that I want the best for the people we work with is I want everyone

134
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:49,889
to, to be able to experience those feelings.

135
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:50,970
It's a great answer.

136
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:55,949
And you, you mentioned a bassist, a bass guitarist and a couple of indie rock bands.

137
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:59,589
And, and it was with two of your great mates that you decided to go on this path to be connected.

138
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:05,850
To these creative people that were colleagues and friends and peers of yours.

139
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,949
That's a great motivation to start something.

140
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:13,910
But the fact that all those businesses still exist, still exist, that's a great credit to partnerships that.

141
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,730
They don't often turn out that way.

142
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,930
That must make you feel really proud.

143
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:17,610
Yeah.

144
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:23,149
Well, look, I don't want to spoil the party, but unfortunately that the partnership doesn't exist anymore.

145
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:28,870
And that's all part of the journey, but what we can certainly talk about that too, because I think, you know,

146
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,569
there's a lot of things we can learn from, from the, from the experience that you've had with artists.

147
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:35,769
know those things are important to talk about as well um but in starting it um i would never have

148
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:41,389
got the opportunity without my two friends one one pete lusty and the other andy castle

149
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:48,430
and those two guys played in bands and uh really so did i and we just all kicked around together

150
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,569
and all our friends played in bands but they had this idea that they would just start managing

151
00:07:53,569 --> 00:08:01,029
each other's bands and then a couple of friends bands as well and um they came up with this

152
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:08,410
such a great name it was basically like two guys living in a share house with no money you know

153
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:14,769
and uh they came up with the name winterman and goldstein management because it just sounded

154
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:23,110
really important it was so good because it was pre-internet you know pre-email pre-mobiles and

155
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,449
you'd

156
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:23,490
you've

157
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:23,509
you'd

158
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:23,550
you'd

159
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:23,569
you'd

160
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:28,009
If you wanted a gig, you had to try and catch the person who booked the pub

161
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:33,269
or try and get, you know, an article in, you know, street press about your band.

162
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:39,429
And you had to ring up and go, oh, it's Luke Darcy from the Luke Darcy band.

163
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:42,049
And they'd be like, well, okay, I'm not going to put you through or whatever.

164
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,789
So they come up with this idea that, you know, well, if we come up with this name,

165
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:48,909
it sounds like you have to question, like, that sounds pretty important.

166
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,529
And it kind of worked.

167
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:56,809
And so, you know, they'd ring people and go, yeah, it's Pete Lustig from Winterman and Goldstein here.

168
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:00,789
And, you know, there'd be a pause and they'd go, what's it regarding?

169
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:03,850
You know, it's, oh, well, it's about, you know, I'll put you through.

170
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:08,490
But it was also hilarious because it was a complete, it was completely unrealistic.

171
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,629
What a great, great story.

172
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,490
And I think Ivy League Records does that too, doesn't it?

173
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:20,149
In the same way, it taps into that same, you know, Ivy League's such a great brand, isn't it?

174
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:21,330
Of the elite, elite.

175
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:24,669
It's got alumni out of the greatest universities in the world.

176
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:28,889
And it's like, I'm from Winterman and Goldstein Management representing Ivy League Records.

177
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,429
It's like, I'm talking to Pete Diddy here.

178
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,090
That's extraordinary.

179
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,529
Yeah.

180
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:43,649
And the reality is it's three idiots in a tiny office, like, smoking cigarettes with one computer, like a Commodore 64.

181
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:51,049
And so that was really, that was one of the, like, most hilarious and clever things

182
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,370
that they did, you know.

183
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:55,429
And so that was, that was just an amazing way to start.

184
00:09:55,529 --> 00:10:00,769
And the reality was for like four or five years, we were just managing friends' bands

185
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:06,909
and trying to get 70 people to go to, you know, the Hopeton Hotel in Sydney on a Tuesday night, you know,

186
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,350
to see a band playing first on support.

187
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:12,429
So it was, that was almost like half the fun.

188
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,129
And Andy, the reputation, you know, the music industry has a lot of complex characters

189
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:20,610
and it's often hand to mouth at times.

190
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,029
People are really, you know, they're really, you know, they're really, you know, they're really, you know,

191
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:24,789
they're really battling it out, as you said, trying to get 70 people to the Hopeton Hotel.

192
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:28,129
But what have you loved about working with musicians?

193
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,129
You are one yourself.

194
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:30,529
It's your community.

195
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:35,389
You've been doing it for more than three decades to work in those challenging environments.

196
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,049
What's been the real driver for you?

197
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,950
I think it always comes back to people.

198
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:47,350
Musicians, like really, really good ones are just really interesting, unique people.

199
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,710
And I'm not like that.

200
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:52,769
I like being in proximity to that.

201
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:56,629
I like seeing people who are just so gifted at something.

202
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:03,649
You know, it's so crazy to be close to that, to see like how the Avalancers put a track together

203
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:08,330
or to see how Chris Cheney from The Living End can play the guitar.

204
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,529
It's actually mind blowing.

205
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:11,669
You know what I mean?

206
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:14,090
But then these are just like really good people.

207
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:17,830
I mean, that's not always the case with talented people either.

208
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,149
So, you know, so I'd say we've sifted.

209
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:23,909
It's been a process of elimination over the years.

210
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:27,529
But I really love being in proximity to that because it's interesting.

211
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,330
And it's also like other and it's maverick.

212
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:36,070
There's a maverick spirit to it that I really love.

213
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:44,049
Like I never, I always felt uncomfortable within traditional structure,

214
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:50,769
whether it be like working in a restaurant or a bar or an office that wasn't,

215
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:52,529
that interesting to me.

216
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,669
But you just like you had to do it, of course, you know, all that stuff's important.

217
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,710
But I love the, I guess it comes down to freedom.

218
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,549
And I don't mean freedom to do whatever you want, whenever you want.

219
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:08,149
Just like a sort of a intellectual freedom and artistic freedom of freedom to express,

220
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,230
for those people to express themselves and put something out into the world

221
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,850
and create a world that people can become a part of.

222
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,009
Like that's the thing.

223
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:21,009
And those people have that ability to think.

224
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:23,750
They can produce stuff on a different scale to the rest of us.

225
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,889
And I can't do that, but I can get to stand next to it.

226
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,389
Like you could do it playing football or like when I watch, whether it was you

227
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:36,350
or whether it was like, whether it's someone now, like being at the football

228
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:42,129
and watching Patrick Cripps or Toby Green, it's like, how can you do that?

229
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,230
Speaking to you, Andy, you remind me of the great footy coaches that I love now

230
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,730
who've transcended an era where it was all hierarchy.

231
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:52,590
And it was pretty confronting.

232
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,750
You know, you got personally abused and you either coped or you, or you could,

233
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:00,990
we laugh about all those stories now, but I think it spawned a generation of people

234
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,250
that was pretty unhelpful.

235
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:04,389
And, and there was a body count of people.

236
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:08,250
Do you feel like when you're in the music management game that you are like a,

237
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,190
like a coach, you know, that you're part mentor, part psychologist, part friend,

238
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,210
and a whole range of different things to do that successfully?

239
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:18,850
Do you, do you feel like that's what you've got to tap into yourself?

240
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,009
Yeah, I think you've,

241
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:23,070
you've absolutely nailed it.

242
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:24,190
It's so many things.

243
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:28,789
It's all those things plus an ability to, which, you know,

244
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:33,110
you learn along the way, like a sort of a business mind as well.

245
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:39,450
Like none of those things preclude wanting to be successful in terms of having a long-term career

246
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,129
and hopefully some financial stability.

247
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,929
So it's how you, how you blend all of that.

248
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,990
And it's, it is, yeah, it's probably a little bit like coaching.

249
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:50,830
And it,

250
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:51,690
it's probably the,

251
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,070
there's all those similarities.

252
00:13:54,070 --> 00:14:01,809
And then probably the one thing that's different about it in terms of like a structure with hierarchical or what's that one called?

253
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,149
You know, the sideways one.

254
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:03,990
Horizontal.

255
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,889
It's a funny business set up because as a manager,

256
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,389
you're not the boss.

257
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,990
Like the artist is the boss.

258
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:18,490
The artist is employing you to help them do the thing they want to do.

259
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:20,990
So I'm not,

260
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,149
I'm not telling them, okay, here's what you should do.

261
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,330
They're like, it's more like, what do you want to do?

262
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:33,970
And then trying to, trying to get a sense of what's your actual overall vision, you know, and how,

263
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,809
where do you want it to go?

264
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,169
And how do you want that to look?

265
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,409
And how do you want it to feel?

266
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,610
And how do you want to feel?

267
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:48,070
And then trying to put together a system or a plan or to help them do that.

268
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,970
And then the weirdest part about it,

269
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:57,149
is they're employing you often to tell them things they don't want to hear.

270
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:01,309
That's a strange employment setup.

271
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:08,509
So, but, you know, I always say to people, artists, you know,

272
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:14,409
it's my job to tell you things that you don't necessarily want to hear because you'll have a million ideas.

273
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,309
And I mean, you can do whatever you want.

274
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:18,190
You're the boss.

275
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,950
But sort of assume,

276
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:30,490
assuming that we're involved because of our experience and our way of looking at things to make sure you make the,

277
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,269
as close as the right decision as possible,

278
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:39,389
rather than based on stuff we know, like, look, if you do that, you can do that.

279
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:46,029
But we think that's not going to work or that's not going to go how you want it to go for these reasons.

280
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:51,659
And so, yeah, the coaching part,

281
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,519
is pretty close to that where, isn't it?

282
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,779
Except maybe with coaching in a traditional sense like sport,

283
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:02,299
I think it's like, well, this is a game plan.

284
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:07,580
Whereas they're like, what do you want to do?

285
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,919
And you go, well, this is the game plan based on what you said you want to do.

286
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,399
Do you want to do the game plan?

287
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:13,720
And they can go, no.

288
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,039
And they go, well, more about another game plan.

289
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,159
And Andy, I look as an outsider into the music industry,

290
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,220
you see these,

291
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:29,220
these nuclear Liam and Noel Gallagher style bust-ups of these incredibly successful bands

292
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,059
that have got the world in front of them.

293
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:36,899
And yet they seem to be in turmoil regularly in the music industry.

294
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:39,279
How is that the case?

295
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:43,360
And how challenging is that when you've got something as precious as that,

296
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,500
but you just can't get personalities together?

297
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:46,740
How have you dealt with that?

298
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:50,620
Yeah, it's a challenge and it's really common.

299
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:59,100
I think it's a funny thing where often just in my experience,

300
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:03,399
like you could talk to 10 different managers who would have different ideas about it,

301
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,859
but it's a funny thing where, you know,

302
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:12,680
how we measure external success is generally things like,

303
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,960
have you done a billion streams?

304
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:19,500
Have you won awards, you know, ARIA awards?

305
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,880
Or have you had a number one album?

306
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
All those kinds of things.

307
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,059
And those things are all really exciting and great.

308
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:29,680
In my experience,

309
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,720
sometimes, often when people are at the absolute peak of their,

310
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,440
let's call it externally perceived success,

311
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:45,680
it's often the peak of their unhappiness and dysfunction.

312
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,039
And that can be for a variety of reasons,

313
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,220
but often it's because,

314
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:55,859
you know, the people involved are really young when they're having that success.

315
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:02,599
You know, I'd sort of challenge anyone to be 21, 22 with a million dollars in the bank,

316
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,740
having just won a whole bunch of awards and everyone blowing smoke up their ass.

317
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:13,579
And especially if you're in America, you know, and how you process that.

318
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:19,680
And often how people process it is they,

319
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,539
yeah, they drink too much and they take a load of drugs

320
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:26,059
and they surround themselves with people that aren't healthy for them.

321
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:33,000
And they start getting their feed of what they think is wellbeing from praise,

322
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,440
whether it be through social media,

323
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:40,259
whether it be, you know, number of streams or sales or ticket sales.

324
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:44,039
And because, you know, as a performer, you want that love,

325
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,319
you want that affirmation.

326
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,319
And that generally comes through, you know, playing live.

327
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,500
And how many people listen to your music, of course.

328
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:56,980
And that's kind of what, of course, that's how people get their affirmation.

329
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:59,559
But then they want more and more and more.

330
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:03,079
So the way to deal with it, I think, is it's difficult.

331
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,839
And in earlier years, like with bands that we looked after,

332
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:12,880
like The Vines and Jet, for example, in the early 2000s,

333
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,420
I mean, they were the two bands that allowed us to really have a career in management.

334
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:19,880
And it was all...

335
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,220
It was all brand new to us as managers.

336
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:26,440
And we had no idea, well, really,

337
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,960
we had no idea we were just making it up, as were the bands.

338
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:34,819
And they were relying on us to sort of help them and advise them.

339
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,880
But we had no prior experience of it.

340
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,299
So it's all new to us as well.

341
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:45,220
So you've got people, management, trying to work it out really quickly,

342
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,200
trying to help bands that are trying to work it out.

343
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,519
And it's quite overwhelming.

344
00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:01,220
And so I would say, you know, in retrospect, we...

345
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,619
Actually, I shouldn't speak for Andy and Pete.

346
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,480
I can speak for myself.

347
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:09,019
I wasn't equipped.

348
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:10,579
I was just trying.

349
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,420
But in a lot of cases, one in particular,

350
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,339
I think I enabled...

351
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:19,420
I think I enabled...

352
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,420
Bad behaviour and bad decisions,

353
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,460
because I thought I was trying to help.

354
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:32,059
But I was just perpetuating, you know, difficulty by...

355
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:34,619
Because you feel pressure that people have to stay on the road

356
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:37,779
or people, you know, have to deliver and do, you know,

357
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,319
10 interviews in a day and stuff.

358
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,420
Because you don't know.

359
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,359
You've been spending your whole life trying to get to this situation.

360
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:47,880
And then all of a sudden, you know, a band like, you know,

361
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,259
The Vines, for example,

362
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,200
who are a bit of a...

363
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,880
I don't want to give a footnote in musical history now,

364
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,200
but at the time, it was like the only Australian band

365
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,299
that had sort of had international success for quite some time.

366
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,740
That's a slight exaggeration, but, you know,

367
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,500
they were an amazing but dysfunctional band

368
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,460
who went like a rocket, you know, in about 18 months

369
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,019
and then crashed very quickly.

370
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:15,740
But that rocket ride around the world was so crazy

371
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,019
that in order to keep it going, I think there was ego on my part.

372
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:26,599
But, you know, well, this is my success as well.

373
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:30,700
You know, because you're focusing on yourself

374
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,099
as much as you think you're not.

375
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,200
You're kind of starting to build an identity through that.

376
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:37,519
And then so are those people.

377
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:42,200
So now, like 20 years down the track,

378
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,700
you approach it completely differently and say,

379
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,059
listen, all that stuff's great.

380
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,140
And that stuff's really important.

381
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:55,059
But who are you as an artist?

382
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:55,960
Who are you?

383
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,180
Do you have an identity outside of being so-and-so in this band

384
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,420
or this act?

385
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,019
So I think the way you try and navigate it now is to say,

386
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,559
who are you?

387
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,059
Like if this all went away, what's your identity?

388
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:17,819
You know, and that's a really difficult question to answer

389
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:19,980
when you're 22, 23.

390
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:20,599
24.

391
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:27,079
And it must be, Andy, I can't imagine how intoxicating it would be

392
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,640
to be on stage, to be at Glastonbury.

393
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:30,940
You just mentioned Coldplay.

394
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,559
You've got everyone, the words that you created in your own office

395
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,079
and are being sung back to you and you've got, you know, 80,000 people.

396
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:44,059
That adulation must be a drug that is incomparable to anything.

397
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,240
And you look at, you know, the Rolling Stones

398
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,960
and guys are in their 80s.

399
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,740
They're still chasing that.

400
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,859
Paul McCartney's still playing, you know, like from the Beatles.

401
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,819
He's still out there on stage chasing that.

402
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,359
I mean, it must be intoxicating for people to want to keep doing it.

403
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,119
Yeah.

404
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,799
I can't imagine anything more intoxicating, you know,

405
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,559
even just like being close to it.

406
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,640
Like, you know, like we were talking about being close to it before.

407
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,900
That's as close as I'm going to get.

408
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,339
Yeah, it's intoxicating to know the people doing it.

409
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:19,359
And, you know, the people with self-awareness,

410
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,640
and that's usually people who have been doing it for a long time,

411
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,599
you know, like the Avalanches, you know,

412
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,339
they were playing at Fuji Rock a few years ago,

413
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,460
an amazing festival in Japan, and it was the first time they had.

414
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:36,500
And people were singing.

415
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:41,400
It was absolutely rammed, you know, main stage.

416
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,680
And I don't know how many people.

417
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:43,299
It was a lot.

418
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:48,420
And singing back this song, Since I Left You,

419
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:49,980
and afterwards, Robbie,

420
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,460
from the band saying that's just he was just thinking about how they put

421
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,220
that song together on a laptop, you know,

422
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:04,279
when they were 21, 22, and on the dole in Melbourne.

423
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,460
And 20 years later, he's in another country,

424
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,660
and there's thousands of people singing that back.

425
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:14,619
And really, like, that's almost the amount of time you need to be able

426
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,839
to reflect on that properly.

427
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,099
But how's the, like, you're right.

428
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:19,859
I mean, how would it make you feel?

429
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,700
Like, incredible.

430
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,440
The needle in a haystack, Andy, of, you know,

431
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,000
you having the Vines and then having Jet and the global success

432
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,059
those two bands have in your early stages,

433
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:34,599
is there something that sets apart groups like that that go on

434
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,900
and have this meteoric rise?

435
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,799
Is there something tangible you can point to?

436
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,880
Yeah, I've thought about this a lot.

437
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:42,480
I think if we knew the answer to that question,

438
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,940
we'd have every successful act going around.

439
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,380
But I think it's probably not tangible,

440
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:54,500
but you could say what I think it is, it's connection.

441
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,859
Like, it's somehow making,

442
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,960
it's something about a song that has an emotional impact on people.

443
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:10,500
And that is the bit that I just, I have no idea what it is.

444
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,579
I wouldn't have a clue.

445
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,680
You know, the longer we do it, the less I know.

446
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:16,460
I wouldn't know.

447
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,900
So, all you know is,

448
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:23,579
you hear a song and you're like, wow, you know, like a demo and you go,

449
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,599
that's incredible, you know.

450
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:30,400
And so, if you feel it and a few people around you feel it,

451
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,500
you kind of think, well, that could be, that's got to be,

452
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:35,859
I mean, that's why we started doing it.

453
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,119
It's like, this stuff's great and more people need to hear it.

454
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,180
Nine times out of, well, 99 times out of 100, you're wrong.

455
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:45,220
You're just wrong.

456
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:45,980
You like it.

457
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
But no one else does.

458
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:53,599
And then, yeah, you know, like a song like Since I Left You

459
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:58,940
or Are You Going To Be My Girl from Jet, it's like, well,

460
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:01,519
when you hear that demo, you're like, that song's unbelievable.

461
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,640
But there's still no guarantee.

462
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,119
There's so much luck, you know.

463
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,279
Like that song was out for a while and then Andy Castle,

464
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:15,019
one of the three of us, did a really great job in like really just pushing

465
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:17,880
so hard with the label, didn't want to make a video,

466
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,220
for that song and he just pushed them and pushed them until they were fine.

467
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,920
Like, okay, you know, and then, you know,

468
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,920
he organised the whole thing pretty much, you know.

469
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,799
I mean, I don't mean to take anything away from the US label.

470
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:35,000
They did, but also then, you know,

471
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:43,039
the kismet of Apple launching the first iPod and that being the song

472
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,359
that got chosen to be, you know, when people actually watch TV

473
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:47,859
and there's a lot of people watching TV and there's a lot of people

474
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:50,980
and there's no social media and all that stuff for that to be the song.

475
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:56,359
That was the song that was used in that ad and then boom-ba, you know,

476
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,839
it was like a runaway train because they got exposed to so many people

477
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,240
and it is an incredible song.

478
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:06,579
It's amazing and it makes you feel amazing and there's so much about it

479
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:08,400
that it's sort of intangible too.

480
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:10,900
There's a bit of that.

481
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,460
There's a lot of luck actually, I would say.

482
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,980
So this is a bit of life about timing.

483
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,880
I mean, my mind was going as you're talking to,

484
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,359
the tone's a nice story, busking in Byron Bay with her guitar,

485
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:25,319
music, Rhett walks past and says, geez, I like that tune

486
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:30,359
and it becomes literally the song of the world at the time.

487
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,200
I mean, is that the sort of genius of timing meets brilliance and creativity?

488
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,559
Does it need a bit of that magic?

489
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:41,079
Yeah, yeah, I reckon you're absolutely right there.

490
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:45,160
It's almost like, you know, there's a circle of fashion

491
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,079
or, you know,

492
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,460
yeah, timing where you could release a song,

493
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,619
you know, if there's a circle of time

494
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:56,559
and I often thought this about Jet actually.

495
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,359
That first album would be amazing in any era

496
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:02,480
but had they released it five years earlier,

497
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,440
I don't think it would have happened

498
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,220
because, you know, musical fashion and, you know,

499
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,700
just people were into different stuff at that time

500
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:15,599
but it sort of came about at a time when bands like The Strokes

501
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,680
and The White Stripes,

502
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,319
and, you know, The Vines were a small part of it

503
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:22,500
and there's all these really exciting rock bands

504
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,380
that people got really, I guess, you know, people in their 20s,

505
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:27,220
they'd never experienced that

506
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,339
and they were great songs, you know,

507
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,779
The Strokes put out an incredible album,

508
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,220
White Stripes put out an incredible album,

509
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:33,539
Hives put out an incredible album,

510
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:36,200
it becomes this sort of thing

511
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,079
and then Jet come along, you know,

512
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,460
young guys who just loved rock and roll

513
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,720
and grew up on, you know, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones

514
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,720
and ACDC and Kanye West, you know,

515
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:46,859
you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,

516
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,740
and they kind of meld it all

517
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,480
with a whole bunch of 20-year-olds

518
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,460
that didn't get to experience that the first time

519
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,200
and it just strikes a chord, you know,

520
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,039
for whatever reason.

521
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:01,380
So, I think, yeah, had it not come in that precise moment,

522
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,740
it's hard to know whether it would have gone as well

523
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,819
and maybe the same with Tones, you know, like,

524
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,099
if that just happened at a slightly different time,

525
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,660
if she'd written that song at a slightly different time

526
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,720
and, you know, someone hadn't had the faith

527
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,000
in it to push it hard and, you know,

528
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,079
would it have happened?

529
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,700
I don't know.

530
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,200
It's fascinating to me on so many levels.

531
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:25,880
I know you're a great lover of sport, Andy,

532
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,180
and the crossover between sport and music

533
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,960
and I understand you see sport as a creative pursuit in itself.

534
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,279
Tell us why you love that synergy between those two pursuits.

535
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,599
Well, before I was into, well, sort of at the same time

536
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:43,000
as I was into music, I grew up in Canberra

537
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,400
and absolutely loved footy, VFL.

538
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:53,799
And cricket as a kid and, yeah, I was obsessed with it, really.

539
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,980
But I was sort of the lone ranger because at my school,

540
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:59,180
I was kind of the one kid, oh, there's two of us actually,

541
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,220
that liked footy and it wasn't a very sporty school

542
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,279
or anything like that.

543
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:07,380
But I just found in Canberra in the 80s,

544
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:12,380
we had one game a week on Channel 7 and it was usually like,

545
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,039
you know, the big teams were Collingwood, Carlton,

546
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,680
you know, they were the ones that were going well.

547
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,240
I just ended up going for Collingwood

548
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,759
because they're on TV every week

549
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:22,519
and I loved all those players of that era, you know,

550
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,299
Hayfee's Heroes.

551
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,420
And, yeah, I just became obsessed with it.

552
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,619
Also because it was a little bit far away, I couldn't touch it.

553
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,759
I couldn't go to games, you know.

554
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,759
It was like, it might as well have been Hollywood, you know.

555
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,700
So then when I started playing, not very well, I hasten to add,

556
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,140
there's a real theme going through my pursuits.

557
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,880
Footy and music.

558
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,700
It was not really good.

559
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:54,079
What I loved was the getting, being in the team.

560
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:59,960
You know, I loved being around those other kids my age

561
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,619
and doing this thing I really loved and the feeling of,

562
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:09,339
I remember I've been able to put my finger on it only in the last few years.

563
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:13,579
I would have this feeling and I still have it now when I go for a kick

564
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:16,700
with a whole bunch of guys every Sunday and girls,

565
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,220
and kids, I'll be driving home or I'll be driving there

566
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,640
and it's one of the best parts of the week to this oval in Marrickville in Sydney

567
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,599
and I have this feeling I drive past people and it's kind of quiet

568
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:31,839
on a Sunday morning and a few people will be walking around

569
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:33,799
and you look around and I've got this thing in my head,

570
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,920
it's like, they don't know.

571
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,420
No one knows how good this is.

572
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:42,680
There's only a few of us that know, like that feeling,

573
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,680
like that meditation, like that getting lost in something,

574
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,640
but being around all these people and we've all got this common thing

575
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,259
and you know, like when you play sport with people at a community level

576
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:58,500
or like not at an elite level, it's like,

577
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,019
we've been doing it for like five years and you're like,

578
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:05,059
I don't see no one that guy duds for a job.

579
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:07,299
When were you duds?

580
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:11,619
Like, I mean, I do, you know, you're asked,

581
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:14,599
but there are times when you're like,

582
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:20,079
but you've got this connection and that was it with sport for me.

583
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,400
Like I had this connection with these kids,

584
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,359
none of whom I went to school with, but a lot of them,

585
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,740
we just had a great connection and got them well

586
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,099
and I loved being a part of that.

587
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:31,779
And so the music thing for me is similar.

588
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:35,839
Like all, you know, all the greatest people,

589
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,460
all these great people that I've met and experiences I've got

590
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,440
comes from people and that connection.

591
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,099
So I was really interested in that connection that comes from music

592
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:47,619
and sport and makes people belong to something bigger than themselves.

593
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:52,680
And so I've always been very intrigued by it,

594
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,859
but I didn't really know anyone in sport, like not at an elite level.

595
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:01,380
So I started trying to work out what is similar, what's different.

596
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:01,980
I don't know.

597
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,220
And I actually got in touch with a great mate of yours, Bob Murphy,

598
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,619
and I didn't know him.

599
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,339
Pretty strange thing to do.

600
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,220
I got his,

601
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:18,279
his number from Tim Rogers from UMI because I was like, well,

602
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:21,400
I know that he really likes, from what I've read and seen,

603
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,940
Bob really likes music.

604
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:27,900
So anyway, I just, I just, I just sent him a text like, well,

605
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,519
you don't know me, but to his great credit, he gave me a call.

606
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:34,359
He's probably thinking what is going on here,

607
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,920
but this is when he was playing still.

608
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,640
Anyway, I had this idea that, because I wanted to understand it.

609
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:43,380
And I, and also in music.

610
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:44,039
So,

611
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:47,000
so many of my conversations would start with people like who,

612
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:52,599
who love footy and you talk about footy for five minutes and then you,

613
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,319
oh yeah, hang on.

614
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,460
And so, yeah, then you talk about the, you know,

615
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,900
can so-and-so, you know, play this show or, you know,

616
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,759
what you talk about the thing.

617
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:02,599
And then it's like, wow,

618
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:08,179
like people in music really want to be people in sport and people in sport

619
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,599
really want to be people in music or they want to know each other or they're

620
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:11,960
interested in each other, you know?

621
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,159
So,

622
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:17,019
I had this idea that I ran by Francis Leach,

623
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,159
a great broadcaster who,

624
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,539
who,

625
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:23,119
who knows everything about sport, everything about music,

626
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,079
everything about politics.

627
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,559
Like what a polymath, you know, like what an amazing guy.

628
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:32,800
And I put it to Bob that I had this idea about having a conversation between a

629
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,639
footballer who loves music and a musician who loves football and having a

630
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,739
conversation about what, what is similar, you know,

631
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,300
what's it like before you go out and play a game?

632
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:44,039
What's it like before you go out?

633
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:46,940
You play a show, you know, what are the, what's going through your head?

634
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,260
You know, what drives you?

635
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,280
What motivates you?

636
00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:51,739
What are your fears?

637
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,280
Do they connect?

638
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,019
Are they different?

639
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:54,559
You know?

640
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:57,940
And yeah, Bob was awesome.

641
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:59,440
He was like, yeah, I'm in.

642
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,179
And I was, I was still, I don't know this guy.

643
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,039
He doesn't know me.

644
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,539
And it was a great leap of faith.

645
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:11,019
And, and, and the idea was,

646
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,019
so I thought it would be great for Bob to have,

647
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:15,300
to have a conversation with Paul Kelly,

648
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:18,519
not the former Swans captain, the musician.

649
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,099
Cause I knew, you know,

650
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,800
Paul loved football and sport and those two knew each other.

651
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,980
So we just did this night at the corner hotel in Melbourne and we kind of

652
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,679
wrote, we didn't write the show, but we had touch points, you know,

653
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:34,980
like for Francis to guide the conversation.

654
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:41,280
And it was honestly one of the most enjoyable things I've been involved in to

655
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,980
hear that, but also then to like make friends,

656
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:46,960
with someone that I didn't know before that, you know, Bob.

657
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,199
And, and then, and then we did one with Richo and Tim Rogers and Dennis

658
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:58,760
Kometi and Dave Graney, and then one with Darcy Bessio and Tony Armstrong

659
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,559
and Chris Cheney and Jude Bolton and Earthboy, but I only do them

660
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:07,179
occasionally because like that connection has to be right.

661
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:09,039
It's not like a club night.

662
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:12,400
It's not like come and tell some old funny stories about the time that,

663
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,980
you know, someone punched you in the head.

664
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,539
You know, on a windy day with noble, like, it's not that.

665
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:20,420
It's a bit close to home that unfortunately, Andy, and it's a,

666
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:25,079
it's a great idea and I love it.

667
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,719
And I often say, you know, Bob Murphy is a great lifelong friend.

668
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,340
That crossover is just, you know,

669
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,960
so many sports people are frustrated musicians and vice versa.

670
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,280
And, you know, Paul Kelly's legendary,

671
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,519
the kick down in Elstenwick to run a best and fairest where no one tackles

672
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:43,960
and get the musicians.

673
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,039
Together is just pure geniuses.

674
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,820
And I love the crossover of that.

675
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,079
You've been able to bring it to life in a way.

676
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,360
I think everyone's sort of been curious about, and why are we so fascinated

677
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,500
in each other's different worlds, which probably leads into the crossover

678
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,820
with you and I, Andy, and we've been so thrilled to have you in our leader

679
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,800
connect world.

680
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,980
And it's a bit of that, isn't it?

681
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,739
Having a creative brain like yours that operates in such a unique and

682
00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:09,559
successful way.

683
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:12,760
And when you put that together in conversations with people that might

684
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,940
come from a sporting background.

685
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:13,960
Yeah.

686
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,980
And your collaboration is interesting from high performance at Collingwood

687
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,719
with Jared Wade and TJ Barra from the Milwaukee Bucks.

688
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,780
Alan as a school principal has got a great way of thinking.

689
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,340
Dave Bartlett's a great champion of the diversity world and getting minds

690
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,480
together to sort of connect and share and learn in different ways is something

691
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,780
we've been really passionate about.

692
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,440
And I know the team are just obsessed with having you in the community.

693
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,539
Tell us about why that's been appealing to you.

694
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,940
Yeah, it's been, it's been really,

695
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:48,699
really fantastic because I think we live in a silo in music, you know,

696
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,219
well, I guess a lot of industries, you know,

697
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:57,440
we just kind of do our own thing and we don't really get to experience

698
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,099
other industries so much, you know?

699
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:02,699
Yeah.

700
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:10,599
So I actually read about your group with Pat Cummins and Marcus Bonson-Pelly,

701
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:12,500
Rob Sitch, Andy Lee.

702
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:13,380
Yeah.

703
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:13,639
Sorry.

704
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:13,900
Yeah.

705
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,820
I was really interested in that idea.

706
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:18,000
I was like, oh, and so yeah,

707
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,840
just sort of cold called your partner, Matt.

708
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,920
And I think my interest was, I, I,

709
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:29,940
I'm aware of, you know, as, as you get older,

710
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,619
you can become more closed off or like in our case,

711
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:37,920
because we manage a lot of acts that have been going for quite a long time.

712
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,039
Or maybe we've been doing things a certain way.

713
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:43,699
I don't,

714
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:45,000
I don't feel, I mean,

715
00:38:45,019 --> 00:38:48,679
I'm enjoying obviously talking about Jet in the Blind now as a, as,

716
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,239
you know, good stories and things to learn from, but I'm not,

717
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,099
I don't want to live in the past.

718
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:57,960
I don't want to like, yeah, I want to always, you know,

719
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,800
be trying new things and, and,

720
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,880
and challenging yourself because that's kind of why you get up in the morning

721
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,800
or thinking about new ways of doing things.

722
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,960
So I was really interested in like, wow.

723
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:07,179
Yeah.

724
00:39:07,699 --> 00:39:10,980
Just throw me in a group with people from these worlds that I don't know

725
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,780
anything about, you know?

726
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:13,519
And like,

727
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:17,000
like you say to have a school principal in our group,

728
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:18,139
Alan Kersar,

729
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,519
who's an amazing guy who the stuff he deals with is like,

730
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:28,500
it's just a great reminder that what we do,

731
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:30,679
it's just like, it's just entertainment.

732
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,119
Like it's more than that.

733
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:35,039
It's connection and stuff, but we're not saving lives, you know,

734
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,139
but he is.

735
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,659
And, and the guys in the sporting world,

736
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:41,380
what they're dealing with and the personalities and the,

737
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,199
and the structure that they're working within.

738
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:43,380
But,

739
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,099
the way they think it's so creative, like it's kind of, it's,

740
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:48,360
it's really amazing.

741
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:53,000
And Dave in a multicultural area, it's so,

742
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,679
it's so different.

743
00:39:53,679 --> 00:40:00,099
So for what I've got out of it is learning so much about how they go about

744
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:00,559
things.

745
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:06,579
And it's very helpful in terms of remembering to ask yourself,

746
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,780
why am I doing this?

747
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:13,400
Because a lot of what they're good at is knowing what the vision is.

748
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,639
And constantly referring back to it.

749
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,639
And is this the right path?

750
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:21,719
Whereas we don't, I think generally in music, we don't do that.

751
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,860
We're like far out, man.

752
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,400
Let's just hang onto the tail of this tiger and hope for the best.

753
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:31,619
And it's just trying to strike a balance between,

754
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,579
because I think what I love about music is it's kind of a maverick

755
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:35,420
operation.

756
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,460
And often I think now where it's getting messed up and I won't,

757
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:42,639
it would be rude to mention.

758
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:45,019
And companies that I think are doing that,

759
00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:50,000
but there's companies that are trying to put this structure around something

760
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,420
that grew from being unstructured.

761
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:57,480
Like the really great stuff that we love grows from culture,

762
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:59,760
grows from culture, like real people on the street.

763
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,940
So in Australia, to give an example, it's like the big day out.

764
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,920
That's people that like played in bands, managed bands, working.

765
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:07,219
So why don't we do this?

766
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:11,739
Let's put this thing on and it grows or like splendor in the grass,

767
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,420
you know,

768
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:17,360
grew from just a crew who started it and Paul Patiko,

769
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:25,000
these two great minds who just grew up loving music and managing bands and

770
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,099
booking bands and putting on events and stuff.

771
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:31,139
And it kind of grows and grows and grows, sort of grows like, you know,

772
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:32,059
all over the place.

773
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,159
And that's, what's great about it.

774
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:39,219
So I'm always aware of like, I want a sort of,

775
00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:41,139
I want a struck, I want a vision,

776
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:47,500
but I don't want to make it so rigid that it's, oh, it's this,

777
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:48,579
you've got to do it this way.

778
00:41:48,699 --> 00:41:49,320
You know what I mean?

779
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,900
So that really long answer, sorry,

780
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,860
but it's like, what's been good for me,

781
00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:01,159
it's just really opened up my mind and it's been exciting to just think about

782
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:05,099
a whole lot of stuff that I would never have thought about and meet people I

783
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:09,300
would never would have met, you know, as a result.

784
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,739
It's a brilliant answer, Andy.

785
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:12,059
I love that about it.

786
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:17,699
And as I said, having your unique thinking is such a gift to other people as well.

787
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:19,679
My mind was immediately, as you were talking,

788
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,639
going to the legendary Michael Gudinski, who's a great friend of yours,

789
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:25,980
bought 50% of your record label.

790
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,480
Mushroom Music is now the entity that holds the great success stories of yours.

791
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:34,360
I had the great pleasure of meeting Michael, as a lot of people did.

792
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,760
If you're in Melbourne and you are anywhere,

793
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:41,119
you came across this force of nature and it just made you smile every

794
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:41,559
time.

795
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,300
If you had an idea or you heard an idea,

796
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:48,780
the unbridled enthusiasm for that idea is the likes of which I've never met any

797
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,619
other human being.

798
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:50,440
This is brilliant.

799
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,119
We're going to do this.

800
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,880
Can you share with us sort of what that was like to be around someone like Michael?

801
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,199
I suppose that feels like the organic culture you're talking about that is why

802
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:02,239
music is so special.

803
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:03,739
Yes, you're right.

804
00:43:03,739 --> 00:43:06,920
He is the organic culture that it grew from, you know,

805
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:11,019
like he kind of built the Australian music industry.

806
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:14,960
From a watermelon stand at Sunbury and went from there.

807
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,239
From putting on dances at the town hall in the late 60s, early 70s.

808
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:26,719
He, yeah, force of nature is the perfect description.

809
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:30,360
Like you knew when he was in the room, he was there.

810
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:39,920
He was definitely there and he, yeah, he was just a unique person who had an ability to

811
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:41,840
bring you in.

812
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:48,380
And my perception of him before I met him was like, he's a bit scary, you know?

813
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,579
And then meeting him, it's like, oh, he's, he's the opposite of scary.

814
00:43:55,579 --> 00:43:55,900
I don't know.

815
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,539
It was like to actually like, if you worked for him, maybe at some point he was scary.

816
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:03,320
I don't know, but, or whether I was just like, just cause he's a big personality, but,

817
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:10,579
um, he really, the thing that he was really good at, he just, he just had faith in people.

818
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,079
If he.

819
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:16,659
If he, like you said, if he thought you had a good idea or he was excited by something

820
00:44:16,659 --> 00:44:22,460
you worked with, he just made, he just pumped you up to feel like you can do anything, like

821
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,099
just go for it, you know?

822
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:27,579
Um, and he was also just hilarious.

823
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:34,400
You know, he was just a hilarious guy who loved having fun and he, that's a real key.

824
00:44:34,699 --> 00:44:39,900
I reckon to his success was, it was fun.

825
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,019
Um, you know, not all the time.

826
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:48,880
Of course he had plenty of lows, but he was fun to be around and that's what this should

827
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,880
be.

828
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:57,539
Like we should, we've got to have fun doing this because you know, so much of it isn't

829
00:44:57,539 --> 00:44:58,539
going to work.

830
00:44:58,539 --> 00:45:02,320
Um, but his thing was like, yeah, go for it.

831
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:09,420
He, he would, um, trying to think of, this is not actually relatable.

832
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,420
It's not related to his success, but this is to give you an idea of the sort of person

833
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,420
we're working with.

834
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,420
Not your classic CEO.

835
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:22,940
So here in this office that I'm sitting in, there's a couch over there and, um, it's like

836
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:32,039
a awesome mid-century parker couch that, uh, a few years ago I got recovered, you know,

837
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:39,400
at decent expense, little treat and, uh, anyway, so I'm in Sydney, I'm working in the mushroom,

838
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:45,639
um, building and one, one day he just walks into my office, didn't even know it was in

839
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:46,639
town.

840
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:49,039
He comes in, you know, he's like, where are you?

841
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:50,039
You know?

842
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:51,039
I'm like, yeah, I'm good.

843
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,039
What are you doing here?

844
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:53,039
He goes, ah, do you want to sit here?

845
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:54,039
I'm like, yeah, yeah.

846
00:45:54,039 --> 00:46:00,079
And he lies down on the couch, he's lying on the couch, just like talking on the phone

847
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:01,079
really loudly.

848
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:07,980
Well, I'll carry on then, you know, and he says, oh, he's just doing all this stuff.

849
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,400
And then he, you know, then he sits up.

850
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,639
Um, we're talking for a while and he's, he's just asking what I'm up to and what's happening.

851
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:18,639
And this is the great thing about him too, like he's, he's like, how's Jolly, how are

852
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:19,639
the kids?

853
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:22,639
You know, he knows your whole family, you know, what happened with such and such, you

854
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:29,940
know, unbelievable, unbelievable memory, you know, anyway, we're chatting, he gets

855
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:36,639
up and then he goes and sits in another chair, I look over at this recently recovered couch

856
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:37,639
and I'm like,

857
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:38,639
What?

858
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:42,880
Michael, have you got a pen in your pocket, mate?

859
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,880
And he jumps up and he's like, what?

860
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,880
He's got, he's just laid down on my couch with a Sharpie with no lid on it.

861
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,880
It's scrawled all over the couch.

862
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,880
And I was like, oh my God.

863
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:04,769
And he's like, he stands up and he's done it on the, on the recently recovered chair

864
00:47:04,769 --> 00:47:05,769
as well.

865
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:06,769
I was like, oh my God.

866
00:47:06,769 --> 00:47:07,769
And he's like shut up.

867
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:08,769
And then another friend of mine.

868
00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:09,769
Oh my God.

869
00:47:09,769 --> 00:47:13,590
Another friend comes to poke his head around the door, he goes, what are you two doing?

870
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:15,909
And Michael just shuts the door in his face.

871
00:47:15,909 --> 00:47:18,489
And then I get a call and I'm like, all right.

872
00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:22,269
And then I walk off and I come back and I walk back in and he's really happy.

873
00:47:22,269 --> 00:47:25,809
He's like, I've done something I think you might like.

874
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,710
And I go, oh yeah.

875
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:32,769
He holds up the cushion of the chair and he's done a big, he's drawn a big love heart on

876
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:33,769
it in a Sharpie.

877
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:34,769
He's like, MG plus AK, forever, love you, mate.

878
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:35,769
And I'm like, oh my God.

879
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:36,769
And he's like, oh my God.

880
00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:37,769
And I'm like, oh my God.

881
00:47:37,769 --> 00:47:38,769
And he's like, oh my God.

882
00:47:38,769 --> 00:47:39,769
And I'm like, oh my God.

883
00:47:39,769 --> 00:47:40,769
And he's like, oh my God.

884
00:47:40,769 --> 00:47:41,769
And I just laughed.

885
00:47:41,769 --> 00:47:47,769
I was like, I guess you're all in on this.

886
00:47:47,769 --> 00:47:51,590
But now, I've got that.

887
00:47:51,590 --> 00:48:02,489
And it's the perfect distillation of like, he turned this thing that was pretty annoying

888
00:48:02,489 --> 00:48:08,769
into just this really fun thing, where he said, you know what?

889
00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:09,769
I love you, kind of thing.

890
00:48:09,769 --> 00:48:10,769
And it's just, who can do that?

891
00:48:10,769 --> 00:48:11,769
And that's the whole place was built on that energy.

892
00:48:11,769 --> 00:48:12,769
And yeah, it just made you feel good.

893
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:13,769
Mick Malloy tells a story of being with him at the Logies.

894
00:48:13,769 --> 00:48:14,769
And I'm sure you could go for an hour here, but I can picture this engrossed in a conversation

895
00:48:14,769 --> 00:48:15,769
with someone with so much intensity, and they're face to face, and talking over the speaker,

896
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:16,769
and you can just see, he's just, whatever this idea is.

897
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:17,769
And I'm like, oh my God.

898
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:18,769
And he's like, oh my God.

899
00:48:18,769 --> 00:48:19,769
And I'm like, oh my God.

900
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:20,769
And he's like, oh my God.

901
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:21,769
And I'm like, oh my God.

902
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:22,769
And he's like, oh my God.

903
00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:23,769
And I'm like, oh my God.

904
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:24,769
And he's like, oh my God.

905
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:25,769
And he's like, I'm not looking at the map.

906
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:27,010
He's like, and I'm just thinking that I don't know what I'm on the planet's top or what

907
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:28,010
kind of planet I'm on right now.

908
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:29,010
And then he's completely clueless, literally, and he thinks.

909
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:30,010
He thinks it's going in that direction.

910
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:31,010
I don't even know what's going on.

911
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,010
G пос organisationalир.

912
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,010
I don't understand what the hell he's thinking.

913
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,010
No, I get it.

914
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,010
He thinks it's an issue.

915
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:36,010
That's the issue.

916
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:37,010
That's the best I can find out.

917
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,010
The worst I can find out.

918
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:39,010
No.

919
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:40,010
No.

920
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,010
I think, I feel like on this rankings, Jeremy's is like, oh, I really like this thing of

921
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:42,010
what we're doing.

922
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:43,010
No.

923
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:44,010
That's what makes me feel it afterwards.

924
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:45,010
Does that make sense?

925
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:52,190
around he's clearly looking for a water and there isn't one so he glances at the the vase as the

926
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:59,530
centerpiece at the logies out go the flowers and uh and he chugs down the vase water and

927
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:05,590
puts it back and moves on as if nothing happened at all and um yeah just as you said one of the

928
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:12,070
unique people of all time and i'm sure you could spend hours talking about it we we love um this

929
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:16,829
idea and success leaves clues and we love the patterns of that in speaking to someone as

930
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:23,269
brilliantly creative as you is fascinating to us and uh really curious to get your uh thoughts on

931
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:27,150
some of this this idea of being able to lead yourself i want to ask you what's what's one

932
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:32,610
way that you fill up your own cup this idea of self-leadership what what do you do andy to make

933
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:38,730
you feel better to have the success you have it's a really that's a that's such a good question um

934
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:41,829
it's a there's a probably a couple of things um

935
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:47,829
the first is uh please no i i don't mean this in any kind of like you know preachy way or anything

936
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:52,190
like that so something works for me like i'm not drinking like i stopped drinking a really long

937
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:58,590
time ago sort of at the height of the jet vines era actually because i was doing it too much um

938
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:05,489
because i reckon uh it was a little bit of a i was very stressed and i took it too seriously

939
00:50:05,489 --> 00:50:11,809
and working across you know i was living in new york at the time don't get me wrong it's not a

940
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:12,050
nightmare

941
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:19,550
it's like oh you know oh you poor thing uh it was awesome but uh i yeah you're working across

942
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:26,630
three time zones and you're really invested in this um this this thing and um i guess you feel

943
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:34,690
under a lot of pressure so i think uh oh and also in rock and roll it's a pretty weird caper where

944
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:38,989
there's not too many other jobs where every time you finish your job for the day you walk into a

945
00:50:38,989 --> 00:50:41,789
room that's laden with free booze or some form of reward

946
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:48,010
like oh well done now go and here's all this free alcohol you know like if you're a teacher you

947
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:51,949
don't walk into the staff room and go there you go it's all laid on knock yourself out you know

948
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:58,630
so that's a strange that's a strange work environment but um so yeah i just kind of

949
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:06,110
i stopped drinking i thought i'll just see what this is like no you know no thought of anything

950
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:11,469
after a month and it was it was it was a bit difficult actually because it's it's a it's a

951
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:12,050
socialization it's a socialization it's a socialization it's a socialization it's a socialization

952
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:16,610
it's a socializing thing right you know but when you're at work are you socializing or are you at

953
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:21,929
work are you at a show what's happening you know um and there's just an expectation more so then

954
00:51:21,929 --> 00:51:27,809
i think than now uh and then after a month i was like well i feel pretty good that's weird i don't

955
00:51:27,809 --> 00:51:34,150
actually feel as anxious about things i feel more level you know and then it just continued um

956
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:41,110
and that that works for me because i feel very level all the time i don't have a sense of

957
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:47,469
you know i don't wake up in the morning oh god you know or you know i used to feel what i what you

958
00:51:47,469 --> 00:51:53,409
know i'm sure i'm sure now that we're in a much better world where we can talk about this stuff

959
00:51:53,409 --> 00:51:58,630
i'm absolutely certain that i was suffering from depression and anxiety for most of the vines

960
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:06,250
and um jets time in the sun that's been really helpful to many i just feel i feel freedom

961
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:12,050
from it freedom to make choices freedom to not um take on other people's

962
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:18,170
anxieties as my own um and then like it's i think basics are just really important for me

963
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:27,869
like self-leadership like um eat well exercise every day and try and get enough sleep and uh

964
00:52:27,869 --> 00:52:36,510
that's it and do those things consistently um do the basics consistently for me makes me feel

965
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:42,050
really um up to it up for the task and and to

966
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:48,889
be clear-headed i guess because you know every day you're absorbing you're absorbing people's

967
00:52:48,889 --> 00:52:58,090
anxieties their their difficulties um and and to not spend my free time absorbing too much

968
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:05,730
like social media tv you know um of course i do you know like of course i'll watch

969
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:10,710
something or whatever but not too not too much i'm conscious of like i don't need to pick up my phone

970
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:11,829
and check

971
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:17,489
instagram every two hours like i'll i'll read the news at the start of the day and the end of the

972
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:21,710
day i'll make a conscious effort i don't need to know i don't need to know what a local council bus

973
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:27,650
does going on i don't i don't need to know it's too much information so that's it for me like

974
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:34,110
pretty straightforward which is sounds easy but in the rock and roll industry that that must have

975
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:38,949
taken some courage to be able to and the peer pressure must have been enormous as you said

976
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:42,050
it's an industry where it's the rock and roll lifestyle isn't it

977
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:47,210
so to be someone that's like i don't need to do that um takes incredible leadership it's a it's a

978
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:51,650
great story we're really passionate about the impact people are conscious of having on others

979
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:55,969
and i want to ask you the question is there one piece of leadership advice that you've taken on

980
00:53:55,969 --> 00:54:01,469
board that you share regularly is there something that comes to mind on that front i think it is

981
00:54:01,469 --> 00:54:10,380
i don't know if anyone gave me the advice or it just came over time like well maybe

982
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,780
again it's really simple

983
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:19,599
luke it's like have fun are you having fun like if you're making music is it fun

984
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:27,460
are you having fun and always ask yourself why why am i doing this like the whole thing

985
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:32,300
when we all get caught in the minutiae of what we do every day and we get frustrated and

986
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:36,960
um i mean of course we're gonna get for it so i'm not saying you know

987
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:43,360
i'm a buddhist monk you know things annoy me and and stuff but but to just strip it back

988
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,920
just keep it really simple we don't need to over complicate what we're doing you know like if i'm

989
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:54,119
operating to remove a tumor from someone's brain i suspect that is pretty complicated

990
00:54:54,119 --> 00:55:00,340
but if we're trying to put some music up on a streaming service and sell some tickets

991
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:08,960
is it fun and why why are we doing it and that's that's it it's brilliant andy uh coming out of

992
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,860
the world of sport it it's exactly the same question isn't it probably what everyone should

993
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:13,420
ask themselves is why are we doing it and why are we doing it and why are we doing it and why are we

994
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,159
doing it and everything they do isn't it like people we all started playing sport because it

995
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:22,760
was fun and then people take on all these pressures of performance and and we're going to win or lose

996
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:27,199
is it going to be stressful what are people going to think and it's just when you zero back out to

997
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:32,380
play sport for a living is one of the most fun things you could possibly imagine and it's a great

998
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:36,440
reminder and why am i doing i did it because when i was a kid i loved kicking the ball you know that

999
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:42,480
was that was it and it gets uh complicated a lot um a lot of our worlds isn't it it's a great

1000
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:42,860
question to

1001
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:49,119
to ask we um you know we see people really conscious about the visions they share and the

1002
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,920
way they go about has it been a leader visionary leader that's inspired you and you felt compelled

1003
00:55:53,920 --> 00:56:05,280
to follow their vision in your world yeah it's actually my uh i didn't expect to get emotional

1004
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:14,119
there does but um it's the two guys that i i worked with at the start pete lusty and andy castle

1005
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:22,440
so yeah we were friends and they those guys were so driven like unbelievable um without being

1006
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:32,320
hard asses just so driven to do this and i feel like i was a bit of a passenger initially or not

1007
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:39,980
i just didn't back myself i just didn't think that anything in this this kind of sphere or world

1008
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:44,480
was within my reach it was so

1009
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:50,380
out of reach it just it might it might as well have been on mars you know like i used to as a

1010
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:58,719
teenager obsess over like what's it like backstage what is it like to be on a tour bus like what is

1011
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:04,440
it like i just want what's it what is it like inside a recording studio it felt like there's

1012
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:11,719
this wall up with a moat in front of it like how do you get in you know and they were like

1013
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,840
let's just get

1014
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:21,380
let's just get like a a ramming what's that thing called a ramming pole and just smash through the

1015
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:28,679
drawbridge you know um let's just work it out and they sort of had no fear and had a lot of um

1016
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:36,440
self-belief and so for them to it's the way it worked was you know we we were friends and played

1017
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,719
in bands and then they said hey we reckon we should start a record label and you should come

1018
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:44,380
and run the record label because i've worked at a record label doing you know primaries

1019
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,500
and i was like i actually wouldn't know how to do that like ah yeah we'll work it out don't worry

1020
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:55,659
about it you know and so it was very affirming that they thought that that would work and so

1021
00:57:55,659 --> 00:58:02,340
it was being in proximity to them and seeing how they did it you know it was like being um

1022
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:07,300
caught in a rip like i wouldn't advise anyone to actually get caught in a rip but

1023
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:14,139
you know like you the advice is if you're caught in a rip you just don't swim against it go with

1024
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:18,780
it and you'll come out the back of the breakers and then you can just swim back in if you don't

1025
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:29,400
panic so they were like they were the rip and i was like okay um and i i would have a lot of

1026
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:36,039
self-doubt and and because we were um guys in that era you didn't really talk about feelings

1027
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:43,940
and you took a piss out of each other and um but just them including me

1028
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:53,820
was really um generous because maybe i didn't deserve to be included in that vision so i i really

1029
00:58:53,820 --> 00:59:01,099
they are the ones who taught me that you know you can you just got to go for it which you know it

1030
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:07,099
took me a long time to to learn that and to go well if you fail yeah of course you're going to

1031
00:59:07,099 --> 00:59:13,519
like you're going to fail much more than you're going to succeed but they were really sort of

1032
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:14,539
driven and pushed me to do it and i was like yeah i'm going to do it and i'm going to do it and i'm

1033
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:20,920
pragmatic about it and so no for no real reason other than that's how they were built i think and

1034
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:25,079
you get emotional andy because of how life-changing having people like that in your life is is that

1035
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:30,239
where the emotion comes from yeah there's two reasons it's like unfortunately we don't work

1036
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:37,940
together anymore um pete unfortunately passed away a few years ago and that was very um that

1037
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:44,539
was just so terrible that was just such a awful cataclysmic

1038
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:52,460
situation you know where he got cancer quite quickly and um yeah unfortunately he didn't

1039
00:59:52,460 --> 01:00:00,480
get through and then yeah unfortunately you know andy and i i guess didn't didn't see the eye to eye

1040
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:08,639
on a bunch of stuff and i don't think that's i honestly feel like he's he's totally fine within

1041
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:13,920
his rights to feel that and and a lot of the stuff that he felt probably right you know and and

1042
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:21,440
and maybe some of the stuff i felt was right but we just couldn't come to uh you know and we couldn't

1043
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:27,599
get on common ground again and uh but i think you know the the rupture in that was uh was pete

1044
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:35,639
passing away and and and he was a real he was the glue i've never really spoken about this so um

1045
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:44,440
uh well beyond you know uh my own circle and and so um you're a very good interviewer

1046
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:51,800
uh and uh but it feels good to talk about it because i i i although that relationship doesn't

1047
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:58,539
exist now i have such fondness for what it was i don't want to preclude any of the awesome stuff

1048
01:00:58,539 --> 01:01:03,260
i'm gonna celebrate that you know i do think i think about it like it was awesome you know

1049
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:09,219
and so that i guess you know even though pete dying was terrible i can't tell you how terrible

1050
01:01:09,219 --> 01:01:14,400
it was um well you you know you've been close to people you know we've all experienced grief

1051
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:22,539
and um but the way the greatest gift of that has been like how do i process the grief

1052
01:01:22,539 --> 01:01:28,159
um i'll just celebrate him and i'll take it like his spirit was to just

1053
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:32,860
go for it and keep going and and have fun you know he was so fun

1054
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:37,320
geez he was really good fun hilarious hilarious all the time he was always

1055
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:44,199
joking and so and he but he had a very unique manner where like unless you'd known him for

1056
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:50,320
a really long time he didn't know he's kind of joking all the time so he was a unique cat and

1057
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:59,139
i love that too so you know that was that you know from a terrible situation um comes a comes

1058
01:01:59,139 --> 01:02:06,260
a positive where i still love doing this and i really value people so much more and i know that

1059
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:15,420
um my joy in the world comes from like how can how can you sort of try and help someone get better

1060
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:20,179
what's a small thing you can do to help someone have a better day it might even be saying like

1061
01:02:20,179 --> 01:02:25,860
i love that hoodie it looks awesome on you you know uh just a little thing you've always got

1062
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:30,360
an opportunity to to do it it sounds so funny when it comes out of your mouth it sounds like

1063
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:36,019
you're making it up like i wasn't i i wasn't that person 10 years ago you know but you get older

1064
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:36,239
you get older you get older you get older you get older you get older you get older you get older

1065
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:44,800
and you realize what's it all about it's just about people yeah what a brilliant thing you know

1066
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:48,820
very generous of you to share that they're not easy when those public things happen and your

1067
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:54,119
partnerships change and evolve and you lose a great a great friend but even without knowing

1068
01:02:54,119 --> 01:03:00,400
your great friend i can hear his words impact you on the way fun comes up every time that ask you a

1069
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:06,019
question and sounds like you live the values that uh he was able to share with you curiosity is

1070
01:03:06,019 --> 01:03:06,199
aware

1071
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:11,980
we use all the time and we we see people like you as infinitely curious have is that curiosity take

1072
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:16,260
you down different rabbit holes and different uh passions from time have you got one you could

1073
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:26,780
share with us yeah well i'm in sports the i guess the obvious one um you know i i love i really love

1074
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:36,019
um i love that my family is really into sport my daughter evie my son jed my wife jolly bulldogs

1075
01:03:36,019 --> 01:03:41,480
supporter jolly we've got four different teams in our house which is unbelievably stressful

1076
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:46,019
luke that's an incredible democracy you're running there andy there's there's no democracy in the

1077
01:03:46,019 --> 01:03:50,920
darcy household well nor should there nor should there be and i think that's probably you've gone

1078
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:54,900
the right way about it and and especially for the bulldogs for the future you know that's

1079
01:03:54,900 --> 01:04:05,780
that's looking very good um uh but yeah so but i coach uh jed's footy team my son who's 13 and uh

1080
01:04:06,019 --> 01:04:18,449
that's a like that's a really great um it's so good because you are thinking again you are just

1081
01:04:18,449 --> 01:04:24,710
thinking about these other people and these kids who are just like the best bunch of guys

1082
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:31,690
they're they're they're so awesome and you know we're division three under 14s you know we finished

1083
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:36,730
seventh last year we finished third this year and that's all them because you know we just keep

1084
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:37,409
talking about well

1085
01:04:37,429 --> 01:04:42,469
what do you want to do what do you want this to look like and they come up with it you know but

1086
01:04:42,469 --> 01:04:47,730
they but also they just have a lot of fun they talk about having fun and that being really

1087
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:55,409
important to them and um so we might not be the best team we might have the best skills but like

1088
01:04:55,409 --> 01:05:02,190
their togetherness and their selflessness like i learn so much from it i'll get so much out of it

1089
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:08,449
you know that that i think that's just a really good thing outside of

1090
01:05:08,449 --> 01:05:09,809
doing

1091
01:05:09,809 --> 01:05:15,650
this every day which i also love uh but it feeds back you know like i learned stuff from then

1092
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:20,110
that's like oh actually that's pretty good yeah maybe i could use it here it's pretty pretty

1093
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:27,690
funny you can learn a bunch for a lot from a bunch of third angels but you sure can i i love it i

1094
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:32,369
the joy of um coaching my four and it's the same thing i think you've just given the best

1095
01:05:32,369 --> 01:05:37,829
description is that kids get the fun element that's what they play for and they like to win

1096
01:05:37,829 --> 01:05:43,369
but a minute afterwards they don't really care do they they they they get at the perspective

1097
01:05:43,369 --> 01:05:48,650
immediately and occasionally it's one of my other great hobby horses is the crazy sort of winning

1098
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:55,070
culture parents want around it's if you don't win the under nine premiership where uh it's it's uh

1099
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:59,389
you know sheep stations and people are going mental at junior sports got just listen to the

1100
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:04,969
kids like all they want to do is have some fun like and it's not hard to create that it's um

1101
01:06:04,969 --> 01:06:07,809
you know you need more people like you down there uh

1102
01:06:07,809 --> 01:06:11,889
doing it for sure um communication something we talk about a lot and

1103
01:06:11,889 --> 01:06:14,710
have you got a mantra when it comes to how you communicate in your world

1104
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:25,010
yeah yeah it's it's uh what's the best way to articulate it uh always try and understand like

1105
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:29,050
always just trying to understand where the other person's coming from like what's their motivation

1106
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:37,030
and i won't always get it you know but you know like when something is annoying to you or like

1107
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:39,250
why is this person being so difficult

1108
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:43,769
why won't this person come back look why won't this person come back to me i'm still working

1109
01:06:43,769 --> 01:06:53,909
on that one that that was bugging me but but but um yeah it is it is honestly in any conversation

1110
01:06:53,909 --> 01:07:02,989
or negotiation or anything to try and understand what's their motivation what do they want what

1111
01:07:02,989 --> 01:07:07,670
do they need to get out of this you know where did they come from all that kind of stuff just

1112
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:14,110
always trying to be conscious of um anything you go into any even a conversation like it's

1113
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:21,829
it's a partnership so yeah the communication thing is and yeah look not always perfect

1114
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:29,469
because it's certainly you know don't always get it right no way but um i reckon spend a lot of time

1115
01:07:29,469 --> 01:07:34,989
going into conversations not thinking about that and just thinking here's the outcome i want

1116
01:07:34,989 --> 01:07:37,250
but you

1117
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:41,590
you see it sometimes when people come to you with a pitch

1118
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:45,869
it's like this would be great for all these reasons you're like well it'd be great for you

1119
01:07:45,869 --> 01:07:55,829
but you know so when you're thinking about that stuff like well we want to do this thing you know

1120
01:07:55,829 --> 01:07:59,269
we might want to do this tour we might want to do this show we might want to do this we might want

1121
01:07:59,269 --> 01:08:06,210
to suggest this event whatever it might be we might want to do this deal what does the other party

1122
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:13,949
what do they want you know what's what's important to them it's a great piece of advice isn't it and i

1123
01:08:13,949 --> 01:08:18,090
know it's something i'm trying to get better at all the time isn't it when you hit a roadblock

1124
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:22,850
and you're like that person's incredibly frustrating it's normally something to do with me

1125
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:29,909
it's normally 100 because of me and and when you get better at it you go okay i can have some more

1126
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:34,350
empathy there if i'm actually trying to step in their shoes it's a it's a brilliant piece of

1127
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:37,649
advice um in terms of collaboration how do you go about it and how do you go about it and how do you

1128
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:40,550
go about that i mean it's a it's a world of collaboration is as you said you're in this

1129
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:46,369
unique situation where you're employed by the bands that you represent they effectively are

1130
01:08:46,369 --> 01:08:51,949
the decision makers how do you go about sort of empowering people in the world that you operate in

1131
01:08:51,949 --> 01:08:56,770
well that's a great question i mean i think i'm still trying to work it out

1132
01:08:56,770 --> 01:09:07,350
all these years later um i think it's making them feel like they're in control

1133
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:11,229
not making them feel like they're in control like letting them know

1134
01:09:11,229 --> 01:09:18,770
we're here for you we're here to help you it's fine line though and i this is a this is definitely

1135
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:23,409
something that i have not got right over the years it's a very fine line between helping

1136
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:30,430
and enabling you know so it's trying to find the line between trying to trying to just make sure

1137
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:37,609
they've got the confidence in themselves because a lot of people in uh artistic uh and creative

1138
01:09:37,609 --> 01:09:45,750
endeavors are a really um unique probably the same in sport um unique combination of uh insecurity

1139
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:55,189
anxiety and self-belief so to try and try and get it more towards the self-belief part without it

1140
01:09:55,189 --> 01:10:03,149
becoming delusion you know it's it's a great description isn't it i think a sport's incredibly

1141
01:10:03,149 --> 01:10:07,590
insecure business like like music isn't it you you're at the whim of a

1142
01:10:07,609 --> 01:10:12,789
coach or change of decision or being selected and you go from supreme self-confidence in your

1143
01:10:12,789 --> 01:10:17,829
ability to to being dropped out of the team and feeling like your career's over that could happen

1144
01:10:17,829 --> 01:10:24,029
within the space of 24 hours and yeah you're right it's a delicate line between reality and

1145
01:10:24,029 --> 01:10:29,689
self-confidence and and that anxiety of wanting to perform is uh is really interesting andy who's

1146
01:10:29,689 --> 01:10:37,149
been the greatest leader in your life oh i think uh my family

1147
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:45,590
my mom my dad i got three older brothers uh and and then my family my my wife jolly

1148
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:55,390
my daughter evie and my son jed without ever having those um titles but i really really

1149
01:10:55,390 --> 01:11:01,850
looked up to my older brothers growing up they're really into music and um i was really

1150
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:07,210
fascinated by that my parents were just very quietly encouraging

1151
01:11:07,609 --> 01:11:14,369
you know they never said you should do this or you should do that it's like you like doing that

1152
01:11:14,369 --> 01:11:20,130
yeah go on good stuff you know oh yeah you like playing music yeah that's good you know he wasn't

1153
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:29,729
like overt but just to know that you could do it like yeah let me go and play you can play in a

1154
01:11:29,729 --> 01:11:35,229
band that's good you can rehearse in the lounge room like it's not it sounds like pretty low-key

1155
01:11:37,609 --> 01:11:45,449
oh this is cool i can do it i'm allowed to do it um and then yeah my uh yeah my own family i think

1156
01:11:45,449 --> 01:11:54,949
they just um like you know like with leadership it's not like it it's maybe not what we think

1157
01:11:54,949 --> 01:12:00,789
about in terms of like who's the leader you know it's more like um what we're just talking about

1158
01:12:00,789 --> 01:12:06,609
they are sort of like yeah you yeah you do that yeah that's great

1159
01:12:07,609 --> 01:12:12,789
you know yeah you you've got this company in music that's that's really good you know i want

1160
01:12:12,789 --> 01:12:17,270
to coach the footy team yeah cool uh you know it's like it's really it's just like support

1161
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:25,449
so in a way it's not there's no there's no roadblocks there's no questioning of it it's

1162
01:12:25,449 --> 01:12:32,010
it's like faith it's like it's like this faith that you're given which is just such a um thing

1163
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:36,409
to be grateful for isn't it like it's people people aren't trying to stand in it never no one

1164
01:12:37,609 --> 01:12:42,029
stood in my way and said that's stupid or why would you try that or why don't you try and get

1165
01:12:42,029 --> 01:12:47,789
her a normal job or you know my parents must have been like this guy is a bloody disaster

1166
01:12:47,789 --> 01:12:56,149
you know because they because dad worked in the public service and mom was a teacher and they came

1167
01:12:56,149 --> 01:13:02,170
from like kind of you know mom grew up in south melbourne and you know with

1168
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:07,449
nothing and you know that back you know before south melbourne now

1169
01:13:07,609 --> 01:13:12,590
you know we're talking the third we're talking the 30s and then you know dad you know they're

1170
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:17,130
all on scholarships and uni and they worked really hard for their education and then i just like

1171
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:25,010
wasn't that and i just it's they must have been going i think they were relieved when one of our

1172
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:30,449
bands did all right like okay he might be okay but they never said anything and andy they give

1173
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:36,609
that a fancy term now of conscious parenting which would have been double dutch to your parents but

1174
01:13:37,609 --> 01:13:42,270
you've summed up really well isn't it it's like we trust you follow what you love we're in your

1175
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:47,729
corner here's the lounge room if you want to get the bass guitar out like that's sort of

1176
01:13:47,729 --> 01:13:53,729
unconditional love isn't it and you think of all the pain of the tiger parents these days that i

1177
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:57,829
want my kid to be an engineer i want you to play the piano i'm going to force you to do that no

1178
01:13:57,829 --> 01:14:02,789
matter what because that makes me feel good around having a kid who plays an instrument or i'm going

1179
01:14:02,789 --> 01:14:07,590
to force you to play sport and i really want you to play professionally because i'm not going to

1180
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:10,489
i wasn't good enough but i'm gonna i'm gonna hammer that and you're gonna feel really shit if

1181
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:15,770
you don't get there and feel good enough and so that that sort of seems where majority of parents

1182
01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:19,609
are going so what a gift isn't it when you look back and think you've had parents that were just

1183
01:14:19,609 --> 01:14:24,510
in your corner no matter what that may be the greatest gift of all we're a bit obsessed in

1184
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:28,909
elita with this idea of collaboration and what it looks like andy and how it shows up in different

1185
01:14:28,909 --> 01:14:33,930
areas you've got to collaborate with some of the most extraordinary creative people in the world

1186
01:14:37,609 --> 01:14:42,390
just connect and collaborate with a specific person is there a name that comes to mind

1187
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:48,449
there's so many i was i was thinking about this before we had a chat you know like god how long

1188
01:14:48,449 --> 01:15:01,050
how long you got but um i think i would love have loved to be near um some of the really

1189
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:06,149
innovative legendary music managers

1190
01:15:07,609 --> 01:15:14,210
of like elliot roberts who managed um i think still manages uh i think he's still alive neil

1191
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:24,029
young um what was that what's that like or paul mcginnis who managed you too um just to see

1192
01:15:24,029 --> 01:15:29,789
because it would have been it would have been so different then because talk about making it up as

1193
01:15:29,789 --> 01:15:37,590
you went along but yeah so smart you know and dealing with artists that were just like

1194
01:15:37,609 --> 01:15:43,930
like on another level like how you how you deal with those with that for such a long period of

1195
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:50,750
time you know john landau who manages bruce springsteen you know um who actually michael

1196
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:55,710
yeah that was it i was always like do you really think i could meet john landau and he's like

1197
01:15:55,710 --> 01:16:05,069
never happened but you know that's okay um that was a stupid question really how how what would

1198
01:16:05,069 --> 01:16:07,590
be the possible reason you know but worth asking

1199
01:16:07,609 --> 01:16:14,010
but you know like we said you know i got to got to spend so much time with michael to be that close

1200
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:19,189
to someone who genuinely was an innovator and a maverick and just a completely unique person that

1201
01:16:19,189 --> 01:16:25,909
was that was incredible so in a way i did get to spend time with with someone did to collaborate

1202
01:16:25,909 --> 01:16:32,109
with someone who was like that and it's been a great joy to chat to you i've heard so much about
