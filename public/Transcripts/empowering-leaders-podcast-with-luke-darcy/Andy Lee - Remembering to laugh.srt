00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,900
They say when you do what you love, you never work a day in your life.

2
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,960
But when that turns into a successful career, how do you stay true to yourself?

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,140
G'day, it's Luke D'Arcy.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,019
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

5
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:24,780
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,699
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

7
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:30,440
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,600
in education, sport, industry and the arts

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,560
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,039
where everyone has a voice.

11
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:43,600
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,460
I was lucky enough to be joined by Andy Lee

13
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,359
to chat about how he stays calm and collected while living a busy life,

14
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,040
encouraging others around him and his incredible sense of positivity and fun.

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,140
Well, our next guest is one of the most successful people I've ever met

16
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,280
in everything that he does in every area of his life

17
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,459
from Hamish and Andy, the radio show,

18
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:24,239
to writing children's books that are bestsellers,

19
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:28,379
to Gap Year, which is one of the great experiences in television

20
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,159
that we've ever seen.

21
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:31,239
You don't get someone that's got better energy

22
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:33,180
and better to be around than Andy Lee.

23
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,959
Good to catch up with Andy.

24
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:34,840
Great to see you, mate.

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,739
You know, we bump into each other from time to time

26
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:38,680
and we've had great pleasure to meet you

27
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,680
in a range of different settings,

28
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,439
but you always seem to be happy.

29
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,280
Has that always been you?

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,680
Oh, look, I mean, obviously a lot of that comes back to family, I reckon,

31
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:50,840
and I've been really fortunate with my mum and dad.

32
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,379
They...

33
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:54,640
They've just been fantastic from the get-go,

34
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,859
both primary school teachers.

35
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:59,079
There was a point when our whole family was at the same school,

36
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,680
going in the same van, five of us to the same school,

37
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,340
and mum and dad...

38
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:05,780
Here come the Lees.

39
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,799
Yeah, here come the Lees.

40
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,300
Red Nose Day was funny.

41
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,400
We all had our red noses on

42
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,000
and the red nose at the front of the camper van.

43
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:12,599
We had a camper.

44
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,340
So there was...

45
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,139
Not to say that primary school teachers don't have a stressful life.

46
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,740
In fact, it's gotten more stressful talking to my dad about it,

47
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,139
but...

48
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:22,199
The hours are great.

49
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:22,860
Yeah.

50
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,319
They came home with their kids.

51
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,479
The family atmosphere was really great.

52
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,360
School holidays was...

53
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,139
Everyone's off.

54
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,599
Yeah.

55
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:33,219
You know, so you get a lot of that work-life balance

56
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,379
going from a primary school teacher's perspective for my parents,

57
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,379
and while they didn't earn a lot of money

58
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:41,740
and primary school teachers don't get paid well,

59
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,900
I think that was the first insight into a work-life balance,

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,280
probably before I even knew what work-life balance was.

61
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,580
Yeah.

62
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:50,400
So, yeah, we just...

63
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,360
And my dad's a goose.

64
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,139
He made things fun.

65
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,479
Yeah.

66
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,000
Like, even as a primary school teacher,

67
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:56,280
he got in trouble a couple of times,

68
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,879
but, you know, I remember I was in a composite class

69
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,340
that he was...

70
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,900
There was two teachers and 60 students,

71
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,879
and they kind of shared this big classroom,

72
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,319
and they used to make us all spies,

73
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,500
and when another class went out for PE,

74
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,340
we'd go and steal all their furniture

75
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,199
and leave a ransom note on the chalkboard,

76
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,500
and he was just inventing games the whole time,

77
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,080
and he's not particularly funny at all,

78
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,580
but he tries,

79
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,860
and so I think that that kind of happiness

80
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,580
kind of flowed through from them.

81
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,800
I would say that's how it started.

82
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,020
I bet you're older by the cam,

83
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,060
and you guys have been in a band together,

84
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:29,780
Zeus Fight,

85
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,500
and you've got a younger sister, Alex, I think.

86
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,539
Are they similar to you,

87
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,360
if you've got that similar legion?

88
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,659
Yeah, absolutely.

89
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,419
Absolutely.

90
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,919
I mean, my sister's a warrior,

91
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:42,599
as in not like a Spartan warrior.

92
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,199
She worries.

93
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,419
So mum's been more stressed.

94
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:49,319
Dad's pretty laid back.

95
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,979
Yeah, and Cam's a bit of both,

96
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,819
but my sister's probably inherited more from mum,

97
00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:00,360
but we talk about like as a family group,

98
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,439
my mum had a health scare in 1996.

99
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,400
She was given two weeks to live.

100
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,819
She forgot how to walk, how to talk,

101
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,199
who we all were in hospital for months on end,

102
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,340
and I think when people, you know,

103
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,139
Rebecca, my partner's asked me before,

104
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,079
she's like, you know, you don't worry about too much.

105
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,560
I was like, yeah,

106
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,019
since I reckon that's probably a pivotal moment.

107
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,439
And we talk about silver linings in bad situations.

108
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,959
I never say to mum, thanks so much for going through that

109
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,779
because I'm a better person.

110
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:32,839
But I think I remembered at that time,

111
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,519
and wrongly, when people came up to me and said,

112
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,680
oh, you know, I'm worried this girl doesn't like me

113
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,860
or this homework might be overdue and stuff,

114
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:44,399
I just didn't care because this was happening

115
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,480
and it kind of straightened me up for all the little things

116
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,540
not to be so concerned about.

117
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,240
And only years later, five to 10 years later,

118
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,220
did I realise I was probably being dismissive

119
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,279
of people's problems, which doesn't help them at all.

120
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:04,319
And telling someone not to worry about something

121
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:04,939
doesn't help them.

122
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,360
If someone comes to you and is concerned about something,

123
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,079
going, hey, don't worry about it, it'll be fine,

124
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,779
makes them feel even more isolated.

125
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:14,259
Yeah.

126
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,339
So that was my next bit of growth to go, okay,

127
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,540
just because I feel like I've got to handle this,

128
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,620
handle these situations, that's not very helpful

129
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,379
to others not listening, hearing them out.

130
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,639
So, you know, we talk about that as a family,

131
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:33,160
certainly mum being sick and being away from us

132
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,959
for a long time was a chance to probably get a lot

133
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:36,720
of things in perspective.

134
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,259
Yeah.

135
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,160
And it's interesting, what age were you, Andy?

136
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,259
And I heard you say the words, you know,

137
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,980
I'm a better person as a result of it,

138
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,939
not the thing you want to say, thanks mum for going through it.

139
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,339
But your mum's healthy and lived a long life since.

140
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:52,439
But what age was it and how close was it a near run thing?

141
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:54,459
And why are you a better person because of it?

142
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,879
I was 15.

143
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:57,660
My brother was 18.

144
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:59,040
My sister 13.

145
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,860
So mum, I'd go into the hospital every day and introduce myself.

146
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,220
Hey, I'm Andy.

147
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,800
Same conversation, be like round, I'm Andy.

148
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,639
I play the trumpet, I play hockey and all the cool things.

149
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,600
She'd be going, gee, you must have a lot of girls.

150
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,319
No wonder you're resilient.

151
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:19,480
You're resilient.

152
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,459
Andy now, look back, you did the hard yards early.

153
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,779
And she had no idea who you were.

154
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:25,579
No, no.

155
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,459
And so that was a few months.

156
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,519
It felt like a long, long time.

157
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,699
But there's a few months of that.

158
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,139
And, you know, I think she's in hospital for six months.

159
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:38,540
At that time, dad's got that to worry about.

160
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,660
So we became really self-sufficient.

161
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,300
You know, we were mummy's boys.

162
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:46,699
Our lunches were getting packed, probably getting a little afternoon tea

163
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:48,459
when we get home and dinner would be after that.

164
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:49,259
You know, it was that.

165
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:49,779
It was that kind of thing.

166
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:55,079
And suddenly you have to do all that yourself, which is good.

167
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:57,459
It's a good lesson to learn.

168
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,800
And, you know, I was probably, and I've been regretful for this

169
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,899
and I've said it in the past, I was probably not that helpful to my sister.

170
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:12,459
She was a young girl about to become a woman going through that change

171
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:15,980
in PB and stuff and not having the only female figure in the household around.

172
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,560
I reckon that would have been really difficult.

173
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:17,740
Yeah.

174
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:17,759
Yeah.

175
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:17,819
Yeah.

176
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:17,860
Yeah.

177
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:17,920
Yeah.

178
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:17,939
Yeah.

179
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:17,959
Yeah.

180
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:17,980
Yeah.

181
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah.

182
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,060
Yeah.

183
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,160
Yeah.

184
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,300
Yeah.

185
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,360
Yeah.

186
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,399
Yeah.

187
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:18,420
Yeah.

188
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:18,480
Yeah.

189
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:18,519
Yeah.

190
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:18,579
Yeah.

191
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:18,600
Yeah.

192
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:18,620
Yeah.

193
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:18,639
Yeah.

194
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:18,660
Yeah.

195
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,019
Yeah.

196
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:19,240
Yeah.

197
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:19,560
Yeah.

198
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:19,600
Yeah.

199
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:19,620
Yeah.

200
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:19,639
Yeah.

201
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:19,680
Yeah.

202
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:19,699
Yeah.

203
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:19,720
Yeah.

204
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,180
Yeah.

205
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,279
Yeah.

206
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:23,800
My brother was, they probably became a bit closer.

207
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,259
Yeah.

208
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,279
Even though there's a five-year difference there.

209
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,740
So, but I was, you know, wanted to step up and help run the house

210
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,160
and they probably didn't need some 15-year-old saying do the laundry

211
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,980
and do this and you're in charge of that and so on.

212
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:43,519
So, you know, again, that was just a bit of responsibility at a younger age

213
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,180
was important to fast-tracking, I suppose, those skills and also

214
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,240
just, you know, I think that's a big part of it.

215
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:54,459
I mean, we never had a curfew growing up and he just said,

216
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,379
when you want to come home, come home.

217
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:56,699
Yeah.

218
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,920
You've got to ring by 10 o'clock the next morning if you're staying

219
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,759
in another place because he couldn't micromanage all these things.

220
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,899
But I was the first person home.

221
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,180
You know, like when you don't have a curfew, you don't stay out to it.

222
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:08,639
Yeah.

223
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:11,139
It was kind of an interesting thing.

224
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,480
We'd look back and my mates are staying out for longer and I'm like,

225
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,100
this is boring.

226
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,939
And they're like, oh, yeah, but we've got the one night out.

227
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:18,720
I'm like, well, I can let it go at any night.

228
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,500
But it ended up being home more than I thought I would be.

229
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,920
And so I suppose, yeah, getting that responsibility,

230
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,019
it was probably by force because Dad didn't have much of a choice.

231
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,420
He had a lot of other stuff going on.

232
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:30,600
Yeah.

233
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,200
It was an opportunity to grow a little bit, yeah.

234
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,379
Yeah, it's an interesting parenting experiment, isn't it,

235
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:38,879
when you look back, Andy, and go, you know, give the freedom, isn't it?

236
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:42,320
I'm also thinking I've got a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old.

237
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:45,039
I don't think they appreciate each other too much, Andy,

238
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:47,500
right at the moment for the exact reasons you say.

239
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,139
There's a lot of growth.

240
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,700
You haven't got.

241
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,179
You haven't got the perspective.

242
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:52,220
I think you're probably most teenagers are inherently selfish

243
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,039
for obvious reasons.

244
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,159
You've got enough going on to go through it,

245
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,580
but you're sort of hoping that, you know,

246
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,440
and it will come back as same with my siblings as well.

247
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,220
But I suppose it's hard to look back.

248
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,539
You're going through so much on your own.

249
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,879
It's very rare for a 15-year-old boy to understand the perspective

250
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,480
of a 13-year-old girl at that age, I suppose.

251
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:07,860
Totally.

252
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,299
But also, like, you know, my brother is a, you met Cam.

253
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:12,820
Great fellow.

254
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,399
Yeah, he's just so nice.

255
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,240
Like, he's such a kind person and he's far kinder than I am.

256
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,679
Yeah.

257
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,179
And it was, you know,

258
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,480
that's really great of him to have supported my sister through that.

259
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,059
And, you know, I like logistics.

260
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,320
I like running things.

261
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:29,700
I like being in charge.

262
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:29,919
Really?

263
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:30,480
Yeah.

264
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,000
Still to this day, mate.

265
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,220
Is that part of the DNA?

266
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,860
It is.

267
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,419
So that's what I gravitate towards, which can sometimes be unhelpful.

268
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,080
But, again, those learnings, discussions after the fact,

269
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,039
they're all good things to learn.

270
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,120
And pretty early on.

271
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,919
Now, they're from humble beginnings.

272
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,919
The son of two primary school teachers.

273
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,879
And as you said, beautiful upbringing, but potentially not, you know,

274
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,559
school teachers are underpaid in Australia.

275
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,039
I think we could all agree on that.

276
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,440
But then fast forward to you now, Andy.

277
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,000
I think you're 39 years of age and you've just had extraordinary success.

278
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,440
And I want to ask you about that.

279
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:14,100
The Hamish and Andy show, still the most successful show in radio history.

280
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,039
Your TV shows are worldwide phenomenons.

281
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,659
You launched a kid's book.

282
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,159
And it goes global, Andy.

283
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,940
It's like people listening will say, it's okay to be happy.

284
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:23,360
I'd be happy if I was Andy Lee.

285
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,639
Andy Lee too.

286
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,179
But tell us about dealing with that enormous amount of success.

287
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,360
What's that done to you?

288
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:30,700
Yeah.

289
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:37,779
I mean, I'll preface this by saying success is an interesting word, I reckon,

290
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,460
because people seem to measure success on the traditional measurements of power,

291
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,779
like how high someone might be up in a company and money,

292
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,340
how much money they've made, oh, they must be successful.

293
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:54,440
But I've got a pal of mine who's a bookkeeper, not even an accountant,

294
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:59,360
a bookkeeper, who goes to work at nine, leaves at five,

295
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:02,580
doesn't think about work whatsoever, goes home to his family,

296
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:07,139
has 100 beers on the weekend, has the best time and loves it.

297
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,440
And I'm going, well, that's pretty successful as well,

298
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,539
to know that that's the work-life balance that he wants.

299
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:13,779
Yeah.

300
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:16,700
And people accuse,

301
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,919
when someone doesn't have ambition, people often think that's a slight.

302
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,620
You know, like, well, that guy's not very ambitious.

303
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:27,080
And you're like, well, in the way that you think, I mean, I'm not wired that way.

304
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,879
I like to make things big as they can be and dive into them and so on.

305
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,059
But, you know, stepping back, you go, well, a lack of ambition doesn't have to be a slight.

306
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,279
If you know exactly your lot in life and you want to be there to support your family,

307
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,720
have the work-life balance, and, you know,

308
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,820
I probably could accuse my dad of having the same thing.

309
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,059
You're like, don't you want to be principal?

310
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:45,559
He's like, nah.

311
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:46,679
I don't want to.

312
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,159
I don't want to be principal.

313
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,120
And we've had that discussion because I love the classroom.

314
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,019
I love hanging out with the kids.

315
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:51,919
I want to get home on time.

316
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,679
And I go, well, that's a good version of success as well.

317
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,179
Yeah.

318
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,100
But going back to the other measurements.

319
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,200
Let's get the scoreboard out now, Andy.

320
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:01,860
Yeah, yeah.

321
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:02,960
I remind dad all the time.

322
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,799
Look what you've created.

323
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:12,340
No, it's, again, I think we were, Haym and I were lucky in a lot of respects.

324
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,679
I'm super proud of the show and we worked super hard.

325
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:20,100
And as we reflected, we just brought out a podcast recently called

326
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:26,059
The Remembering Project where we reflected on those early days in radio,

327
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:27,779
that first, all the last 20 years.

328
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,159
Yeah.

329
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,360
And we, because we found out that our producers had left a run sheet

330
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,279
of every single show we've ever done.

331
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,519
So it was 2,700 run sheets.

332
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,740
And we would pick a date, go back to it, look at it and go, okay,

333
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,559
what were we doing?

334
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,940
So it was October 12th.

335
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,080
What were we doing in 2006, 2007, 2008?

336
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,960
And the run sheets are full.

337
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,279
We were really living and breathing the show.

338
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,799
We loved it so much.

339
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:53,059
It didn't feel like work back then.

340
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,139
And I reckon if, you know, when people have asked, well,

341
00:12:57,139 --> 00:12:58,879
what's the key to your success?

342
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:01,519
It's like, we just were in love with the work.

343
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:04,080
Haym and I just were having such a ball.

344
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,039
We were all so fortunate that we started at a time where we had no dependents,

345
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,720
no family.

346
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:12,039
You could just live it.

347
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:12,279
Yeah.

348
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,059
And so we immersed ourselves.

349
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:15,080
Yeah.

350
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,980
We immersed ourselves in it.

351
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:20,019
And also, we didn't realise it was that successful.

352
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:22,379
We knew a lot of people were listening, lots and lots of people listening,

353
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,620
but it felt normal because it was the first kind of run at it.

354
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,539
So only since then have I realised, oh, wow,

355
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,159
that was a lot of people listening.

356
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:33,759
More than any in radio history as it turns out.

357
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:33,879
Yeah.

358
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,080
But I was sitting there going, we should get more.

359
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,600
We could get more.

360
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,639
What are we doing?

361
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,120
And we're looking at the shows and, you know,

362
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,820
we're like we want it to be the best show possible.

363
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,059
And the same with our show.

364
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:48,919
We're looking at TV shows and I suppose the part that Haim and I,

365
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:51,840
and I think I'm most proud of with all my work with Haim,

366
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,419
is just that we've always said if we don't love it, let's not do it.

367
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:56,899
Yeah.

368
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,919
It doesn't matter about money.

369
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:58,820
It doesn't matter about anything.

370
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:01,620
If we don't find this hilarious and we don't love it, let's not do it.

371
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:07,460
And it only takes one person to pull that cord and the other person respects it.

372
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:10,299
So there's never been arguments in that regard.

373
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,240
I might have what I think is the best and funniest idea.

374
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,919
If Haim goes, oh, I don't really like it.

375
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:15,460
I don't get it.

376
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,899
I'll try and convince him softly.

377
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:21,799
And we have our onus on each other to try and love it.

378
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:22,139
Yeah.

379
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:24,539
But at the end of the day, you go, oh, mate, I'm just not seeing it.

380
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,779
You leave it straight away because you'll have other ideas.

381
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,659
And that creates a far less stressful environment.

382
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:30,059
Yeah.

383
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:33,840
You're not battling anyone, particularly the guy you have to perform with.

384
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:35,840
We're just not combative in that way.

385
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,299
And as soon as we agreed to, you know, I'm not sure if it was said out loud,

386
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:44,360
but as soon as we agreed to have kind of that approach to go,

387
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:47,299
yeah, I'll jump on board, whatever, but if I'm not seeing it, I'll tell you.

388
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,580
And we both agree at that point to leave it.

389
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,139
Life became a lot easier.

390
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:54,240
You're not worried about how you're pitching things in.

391
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,860
You're not worried about where the next idea is going to come from.

392
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:00,080
Haim and I have always felt that, and I particularly felt,

393
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:02,539
if you hang on to an idea so strongly,

394
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,539
it probably means you're not going to have another one.

395
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:08,960
If you can just free yourself a little bit from that

396
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,659
and be willing to share and put it through the pressure test,

397
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:19,019
then, yeah, you'll probably open your creative mind a bit more.

398
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:24,000
So we've done that with the TV shows and the radio shows

399
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,320
and all the other little bits and pieces we've done.

400
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,980
It's like, are we going to really enjoy this?

401
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,940
And if the answer is yes, let's do it.

402
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,740
And if we're not, let's not do it.

403
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,360
You also go pretty hard, the two of you.

404
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:34,940
And I want to talk about the friendship and the work friendship

405
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,139
and many other things.

406
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:39,039
But, you know, you push the envelope

407
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,340
and you don't leave much on the table between the two of you.

408
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,639
And there must have been some,

409
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:47,039
some moments where, have you ever had to tap the mat and say,

410
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:48,159
or, you know, in an ad break,

411
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,399
hey, you can't ring and talk about my dad like that

412
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,399
or you've got to pull up on my, something close to me.

413
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:55,700
Did you have any of those moments?

414
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:55,940
Yeah.

415
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,320
How often?

416
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:05,860
Well, again, we both love creating the playground to play in,

417
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,919
just to go, what are the rules of this game?

418
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,980
We love games and we love going, what are the rules of the game?

419
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,639
And I think that kind of analogy can kind of,

420
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:17,120
go across all of our stuff.

421
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:20,059
And there were times we'd tell each other stuff

422
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:23,740
and suddenly then I'm hearing it on air or I'm saying something

423
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,519
and you can see in his face, he's like, oh my God,

424
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:28,360
I'm going to be in so much trouble with my wife or girlfriend or mum

425
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,320
or what the hell are you doing?

426
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,340
And we made a decision kind of year, end of year one

427
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,919
or start of year two, around that time where we said, okay,

428
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,600
we've had a couple of testing moments in that regard.

429
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:43,419
Let's put it on the onus.

430
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:46,360
Let's put it on the person who's sharing the information originally

431
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,480
to say, hey, this is not for on air.

432
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,240
And if you don't, everything is free.

433
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:51,679
Yeah, yeah.

434
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,659
And so there was, you know, it swings around and, you know,

435
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:58,860
a week later, Hames bringing up something that's pretty awkward for me

436
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,700
and that I should have told him that, and he can see it on my face,

437
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,339
mid-break that this is not going to fly well with the family

438
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:07,720
or my girlfriend or something.

439
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,059
But he hasn't ruled it out.

440
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,599
But I hadn't ruled it out.

441
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,640
And so we get to the end of the break and instead of me,

442
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,220
going, why the hell did you do that?

443
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:18,400
You know, why did you, you know, I'm going, hey, mate, I'm so sorry.

444
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,319
I should have told you.

445
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,119
That one's not.

446
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,400
And then we both laugh.

447
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:21,660
Yeah.

448
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,220
So the onus on the person to create that.

449
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,259
And if that person forgets it, then you might have an issue.

450
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,119
But you don't normally because it's so rare that we would have something

451
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,900
that you go, please don't mention this.

452
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:37,720
So that was a nice swing of rule.

453
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:41,559
Instead of being angry at someone, you get kind of suddenly angry at yourself.

454
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:44,200
And again, it creates for a better environment.

455
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:45,700
It's an easy thing to have happen.

456
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,359
And I'll share a story with you.

457
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,799
And probably the worst moment I've ever had broadcast on air.

458
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:53,220
And it still makes me feel nauseous when I think about it,

459
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,299
because it's that line where you think you've had a conversation with someone

460
00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:00,400
and it was on air and it wasn't or it was a private conversation.

461
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,500
And in this instance, I thought I'd read in the paper about this incredible story

462
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,059
of a mate of mine who happens to be an AFL senior coach

463
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:10,400
and that he'd had a reversal of his vasectomy.

464
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:11,339
And he said, I don't know.

465
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:11,420
I don't know.

466
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:11,519
I don't know.

467
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:11,539
I don't know.

468
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:14,059
And that they had been able to conceive a fourth child.

469
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,660
So we're doing the boundary line interview.

470
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,000
Let's cross down to the boundary line.

471
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,059
You know, the traditional footy, who's in, who's playing, who's not.

472
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,259
And I thought the interview was going a little bit dry.

473
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,940
And I just said, hey, that's great news, too, with the vasectomy and the reversal.

474
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:28,859
Tell us about that.

475
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,480
That's extraordinary.

476
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:30,079
It must have been pretty.

477
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,160
And as the words are coming out of my mouth, I can just feel the blood draining.

478
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:38,799
I hadn't told his family, hadn't told anyone.

479
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,380
And it was a waste of friendship.

480
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,059
Andy, I hadn't done it, Mr. G.

481
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:48,119
I wasn't trying to be anything apart from mildly entertaining.

482
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:51,119
And it still makes me feel just horrific when I think about it.

483
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,079
Haim is so scared of spiders, right?

484
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:57,839
And on the way to the toilet in their song, live during the radio show,

485
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,720
I saw a huntsman.

486
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,720
And I was like, I went to pick it up because I'm not scared of spiders

487
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,980
and found out it was dead.

488
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,720
But it looked actually, you know, normally they shrivel up.

489
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:06,200
This one looked.

490
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:07,380
I was like, great.

491
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,920
So I've kind of put it in my pocket and the fuck could go wrong.

492
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:12,900
And I've waited for it.

493
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,980
And this is before delay.

494
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,339
We didn't have any dump buttons or anything back then.

495
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:20,319
And so I waited to, I kind of brought the show back in

496
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,859
and I've said to Haim just before we go to air, I was like,

497
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,779
hey, mate, we're just going to go to a different,

498
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,700
we're going to go to a little bit different on the run sheet.

499
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:28,380
And he went, what?

500
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,160
And I started the show and then I went to point at his run sheet

501
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,799
and I threw the spider in front of him.

502
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,799
And he's lost it.

503
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,960
Like he can't believe it.

504
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,920
And then I'm like, don't worry.

505
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:37,720
It's dead.

506
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:38,160
It's dead.

507
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,599
It's dead.

508
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,059
And he came back to the microphone.

509
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,140
He goes, I don't care.

510
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,559
Whatever's dead.

511
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,599
What if I draped something dead on you that you hate?

512
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,779
Like your ex-girlfriend.

513
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,359
And I was like, oh my gosh.

514
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,640
And suddenly at that point, it became a PA system to me

515
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,000
and my ex-girlfriend if she was listening.

516
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,940
Because I didn't hate her.

517
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,619
I don't know why he said that.

518
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,039
I'm like, Ella, if you're listening, I do not hate you.

519
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,880
So I just start speaking only to her.

520
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,640
And then he's back on the mic going, sorry, I've said that.

521
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:11,119
Backtrack.

522
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:14,660
So it does come up when you're on the knife.

523
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:17,240
But I think one of the brilliant things that you guys have done

524
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,880
and Hamish is to me the same as you.

525
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:22,900
It's great energy and it's great to be in your company.

526
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:24,140
It's such a privilege.

527
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,079
But nothing that you guys did was nasty at other people's expense.

528
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,359
It was comedy and it was fun.

529
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,680
You felt like everyone was in on the joke.

530
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,240
Was that a pre-planned thing or is that just a reflection

531
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,799
of who you two guys are?

532
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:40,460
Yeah, not necessarily pre-planned.

533
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,119
I mentioned this on the Will-osophy podcast,

534
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,240
but Will was really nasty to me coming through.

535
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,740
Will Anderson was?

536
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:49,920
Yeah.

537
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:50,380
Really?

538
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,180
So as far as like, I didn't hate anyone in the industry really

539
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,779
except for Will.

540
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,660
Is that a true story?

541
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,539
I told him that on the podcast and he said, I know.

542
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,779
And he acknowledged that he was really, he was pretty nasty to Hamish

543
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:07,000
and I said he was probably worse to me, but I loved comedy

544
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,799
and I loved Will, I loved The Glasshouse, but we kind of became punchlines

545
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,319
for Will on The Glasshouse and on his radio show.

546
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,660
I'd be listening and hearing.

547
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,660
We were like the joke, a joke for him.

548
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,940
In the early days of you guys doing radio.

549
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:25,119
Yeah, and just before, off the back of the Channel 7 show.

550
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:32,380
And, you know, I reckon being on the other side of that probably put something

551
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,119
deep in my head to go, okay, let's not do that to anyone.

552
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:35,480
Yeah.

553
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,980
And I do think it's our nature as well.

554
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:40,119
It's not like particular.

555
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,279
We really find it fun if people aren't having fun as well.

556
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:43,740
Yeah.

557
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,119
You know, it's a bit cliche to say, oh, you want it to be inclusive,

558
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,119
but we really did.

559
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,779
We wanted anyone to come to the show and feel comfortable.

560
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,140
Yeah.

561
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,940
We'll make you feel uncomfortable at times.

562
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,240
Yeah.

563
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:55,559
But that's fun.

564
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,299
That's the ribbing and so on.

565
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:03,140
But rather than walk away feeling hurt and even with prank calls and stuff

566
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,680
done in the past, we've always checked for permission before we air them

567
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,720
and people say no and you just leave it.

568
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,640
Like, it's not, it has, the idea that someone can have a negative experience

569
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,680
for a show that's just designed to be fun and frivolous,

570
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:20,980
it doesn't really add up.

571
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,720
How was that sitting down with Will, who I know very well and worked with

572
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,140
on Noam Radio for a couple of years?

573
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,740
Was that hard for him to hear you say that back to him?

574
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,140
Yeah, I reckon it would have been.

575
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,660
It was kind of tough to say.

576
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,059
Yeah.

577
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,720
I've still, you know, Will, I still respect Will and there's no hard feelings.

578
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,960
There's no hard feelings at all anymore and it was a good actually conversation

579
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,380
to have and he put it in the, I can't remember, I don't want to invent things

580
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,500
that were said either way but, you know, he said, yeah, we walk past each other

581
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,539
and nod for the last three or four years probably and be nice in the hallway

582
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,579
but this kind of discussion probably had to happen at some point.

583
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,420
But I also got it from his perspective.

584
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:03,299
Hayman and I had come from nowhere, seemingly from nowhere,

585
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,579
and back in, back 10, 15 years ago, stand-ups were trying really hard

586
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,099
to get their own and they do stand-up to get their radio show

587
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:15,140
or to get their TV show.

588
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,539
It seemed like the natural evolution and I think more nowadays

589
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:24,440
they're really viewed as separate disciplines but in the stand-up world,

590
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:28,099
people are going, who the hell are these guys and why have they got the slot

591
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:31,259
and why, you know, and there was resentment there for that,

592
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:33,900
which I can understand with people slogging it out.

593
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:39,859
And so in Will's world, he's hearing all these people probably bitch about us

594
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:40,759
but he's got a nice...

595
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,900
He's got a nice microphone to stand up for them,

596
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:45,960
to be a voice for those people and I think that's how he took it.

597
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,720
And pretty good at delivering a punchline too, Will.

598
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:51,279
So he would have been pretty handy at doing it.

599
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,319
I've seen it firsthand many times before and what I love about the person you are

600
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,980
and Will to be able to sit down and have that conversation is great.

601
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:05,039
I grew up in the locker room mentality, Andy, and that is just unmerciful sledging

602
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,599
and it is just, you know, brutal because you're given brutal feedback all the time

603
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:10,779
and you sort of get...

604
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,559
You get used to that as being...

605
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,539
But behind that, the best part of that is that whenever there is any problems,

606
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,440
you've never met a more caring and more loving group of people

607
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,299
and sometimes you forget I'm naturally that way

608
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:25,640
because that was my whole experience from a 17-year-old

609
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,980
and sometimes people hear you speak and you go,

610
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:30,140
that's actually supposed to be delivered with a bit of care

611
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,660
but it's coming across as a bit brutal.

612
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:36,720
But I think, you know, as you said, as you evolve,

613
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:39,640
you probably realise a bit like you, perhaps there isn't that robust...

614
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,640
You know, conversation going on with many people

615
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,259
and I've had to check that a bit at times as well.

616
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:55,319
About now, I should apologise for the text messages I send you occasionally.

617
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:57,160
I've got an accountant called Andy Lee.

618
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,299
About four times a year, I go,

619
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,200
hey, any danger of those returns coming back on time?

620
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
And I get the...

621
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,640
Yeah, probably the wrong person, Andy.

622
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:08,660
So I have tried to change that and sort it out.

623
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,059
Well, I used to want to be an accountant.

624
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:10,759
Truly?

625
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,160
Yeah.

626
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:13,180
So I studied accounting at school.

627
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,240
I did university accounting when I was still at school.

628
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,980
I was quite good at it.

629
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:17,319
But I went into...

630
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:20,180
I went into work for the good, good guys, the good, good, good guys.

631
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,359
Yeah.

632
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,180
And during my...

633
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:27,259
But in between school and university, over the summer break,

634
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:29,759
I don't know why I wasn't just out having beers with everybody,

635
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,640
but I went and worked there and I cancelled $80 million worth of cheques

636
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,619
instead of presenting them.

637
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,619
And back then, you couldn't...

638
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:39,980
They backed up.

639
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,859
So they found out that I'd done it on a Wednesday.

640
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,460
It was three days of just data entry and I was pretty quick at it.

641
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:46,480
But...

642
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,240
And they found out I'd done it.

643
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:47,779
It was on a Wednesday.

644
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:51,299
And so for their whole system, they only backed up on a Sunday.

645
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,299
It wasn't like live backing up back then.

646
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,140
So that's a pretty big transaction.

647
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,640
So every single employee there at head office had to redo their work for Monday, Tuesday,

648
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,920
Wednesday because they had to reset the computers for the...

649
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,000
How was that walking back into that workplace?

650
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,559
So...

651
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:10,059
And everyone was arriving at five to try and catch up with their work.

652
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:11,579
And I said, oh, look, I'll come in at five.

653
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,900
And they're like, no, no, you can come in at nine.

654
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,579
I was like, okay.

655
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:17,160
So I've gone out at a few beers and I'm walked up, hung over on the...

656
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,579
On a Thursday.

657
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:21,200
And I'm sitting there back putting the data entry in.

658
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,039
And at the end of Thursday, I said to the...

659
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,400
I said, I'm out.

660
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,339
I'm so sorry.

661
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:27,440
I'm not coming back.

662
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,579
And he understood.

663
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,119
I think he was fine with it.

664
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:31,640
And I went and changed all my subjects.

665
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,740
Sliding door moment, Andy, in life.

666
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:40,599
And as we said, we're sitting here alongside now someone who's one of the most recognizable

667
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,319
faces in Australia.

668
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,599
And as I said, what does success mean?

669
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,039
I love your anecdote about your mate who just turned...

670
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,460
Turns up at nine and does the bookkeeping and goes home.

671
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,500
And I want to drill into a bit more of success.

672
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,900
But then fame comes along, Andy.

673
00:26:53,900 --> 00:27:00,740
And I think Greg Norman had the saying once that in America, if you have enough success

674
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,400
to buy a nice car, someone will walk up and say, hey, man, nice car.

675
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,059
In Australia, someone will run their keys down the side of that car.

676
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:11,440
Now, has that been a little bit that tall poppy syndrome in Australia?

677
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:13,519
Have you been on the receiving end of a bit of that?

678
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,440
Not so much.

679
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:16,900
I think, again, we're pretty fortunate.

680
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,079
We're pretty fortunate in that regard.

681
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,220
I know what you mean.

682
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:22,299
I remember watching Oprah and Jay-Z.

683
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:23,940
This is years ago.

684
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:27,359
And Oprah said, hey, you know, to Jay-Z, how are things going?

685
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,779
And he said, well, I just bought my sixth house.

686
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,579
And the whole crowd goes off.

687
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:39,900
And I'm thinking, imagine Karl Stefanovic turned to Hamish or anyone in Australia and

688
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,900
said, how are you going?

689
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,240
Well, I've just bought my third house.

690
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,880
Like, okay, there goes your career.

691
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,099
But I must admit.

692
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,720
Well, I kind of prefer the Australian approach at times.

693
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,059
I don't think that people should be ashamed of work they're proud of.

694
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,779
I'm not into gloating about people's salaries or anything like that.

695
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:05,460
I just think, you know, but I think you can still be, and people that listen to the Hamish

696
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,400
Nanny podcast will find this funny, but you can still be in touch with the common man

697
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,720
because it's a very common thing that Hamish and I say to each other.

698
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:12,940
You've lost touch with the common man.

699
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,140
You can still do that in heaps of ways.

700
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,220
It's just aren't reflected in material things.

701
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:29,579
And so, and look, I'm pretty lucky that I don't really want the flashy things.

702
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:35,160
I don't, like, that's my natural, you know, if I was, Burner Tomics is probably a different

703
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,440
mindset.

704
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:42,700
And so, Hayman and I weren't sitting there going, gosh, I wish we could drive a Lamborghini,

705
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,160
but you better not for our brand.

706
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:44,480
Yeah.

707
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,019
Because that, you know, it's.

708
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:47,200
I'm not.

709
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,180
You bought a Ferrari and stuff.

710
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,480
Yeah.

711
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:50,900
So, I'm not kind of fussed by those things.

712
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,279
And I think that's, there's a bit of luck in that.

713
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,059
Like, you know, as far as like my natural demeanor probably stems from, I'm actually

714
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:00,740
massively a saver, like because of mum and dad.

715
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,059
Yeah.

716
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:06,500
You know, like I'm kind of cautious of my own stuff, like spending on other people essentially.

717
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:11,319
Love sharing what big success we've had and enjoying those types of things.

718
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:15,980
But yeah, I think people are in with a tall.

719
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:17,019
Yeah.

720
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:18,019
Poppy approach.

721
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:22,480
People are more likely to cut you down, yourself, you're down if you're getting ahead of yourself

722
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
in your actions.

723
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
Yeah.

724
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,279
Rather than just off the bat success, you know, because I don't think, you know, Chris

725
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:34,160
Hemsworth, no one's going, you know, what an asshole, you know, I think he seems to

726
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,480
carry himself really well.

727
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,099
Hugh Jackman's the same, but then there's other people that don't.

728
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:39,099
Yeah.

729
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:40,500
And they're the ones that will get sliced down.

730
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,099
You give up your anonymity, of course.

731
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:46,000
Does that impact on your life?

732
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,660
Or do you find that not a problem to deal with, given what you're doing?

733
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:57,000
I think that, again, for radio, because we found our notoriety through radio, it's a

734
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,460
different relationship.

735
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:03,059
We ask so much of our listeners to share with us and we share so much back and it's a great

736
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:04,480
transaction.

737
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:11,319
And so to suddenly go, okay, well now you can't look into my life, that probably goes

738
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:14,759
against the whole structure of the show and what we're doing.

739
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:15,759
But it's a different relationship.

740
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:16,759
It's a different relationship.

741
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:17,759
I think that's the thing that I think is really important.

742
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:18,759
Yeah.

743
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:19,759
And I think that's probably the thing that's never, ever in awe of me.

744
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:20,759
Like, you know, I've...

745
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:21,759
I don't know about that.

746
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:22,759
No.

747
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:26,140
I think they come up and they want to share a story or they like something, it becomes,

748
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,559
I feel like it's a very much more a mate kind of discussion.

749
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:30,740
They feel like they know us.

750
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,220
People feel comfortable coming up and having a chat with you.

751
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,220
Yeah.

752
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,220
And you're great in that situation too.

753
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,220
I've seen you.

754
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,220
You seem as easily comfortable.

755
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,220
I love it.

756
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,220
Yeah.

757
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,220
I love it.

758
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,420
Because they're probably going to, there's every chance they're going to give us more

759
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,220
material, like there's something fun happening or whatever.

760
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,220
So is that how you see it?

761
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,220
You sort of see that interaction as part of what you do.

762
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,220
Yeah.

763
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,220
Yeah.

764
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:56,019
And then, but compare that to movie stars and supermodels.

765
00:30:56,019 --> 00:31:00,220
You don't, you never really, you're doing more now because of Instagram and stuff, but

766
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,720
back in the day, you didn't know what those people were like and you only saw them on

767
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,940
a silver screen or a big billboard.

768
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,079
So you're a bit more awestruck.

769
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:09,740
It feels weirder to see them in the flesh.

770
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,740
Yeah.

771
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,819
And you know, even with my ex-partner, with Megan.

772
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:19,819
The way people react to her versus to me, if we went to the pub was extremely different.

773
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:24,819
And, or if I went out with a mate of mine that was a movie star, the way they are acting

774
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:26,920
because they're like, oh my God, we never see these people.

775
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,819
And they would try and sneak the photo or stuff where for me, it's just, hey mate, heard

776
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:31,819
this, whatever.

777
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:32,819
Yeah.

778
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:33,819
That's interesting.

779
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:35,819
So it's quite a different transition, transaction I reckon.

780
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:40,819
But I, yeah, I love the, I'm so grateful anyone took an interest in what we were doing.

781
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:41,819
Yeah.

782
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:42,819
And so I'm always appreciative when people come up.

783
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:43,819
Yeah.

784
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:48,099
But I think with, with Megan Gale, who's very, very, very famous, you know, Australian and

785
00:31:48,099 --> 00:31:51,819
your long term girlfriend for a long while was, was there more interest in, if you're

786
00:31:51,819 --> 00:31:55,819
out in a pub or you found that people were more starstruck by Megan and less by you?

787
00:31:55,819 --> 00:31:56,819
Absolutely.

788
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:57,819
Really?

789
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:58,819
Yeah.

790
00:31:58,819 --> 00:31:59,819
Yeah.

791
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:00,819
Yeah.

792
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:01,819
A hundred percent.

793
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:04,599
And it's, yeah, it's, it's, yeah, it's, I think it is that thing is we, there's a far

794
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:07,579
more mystery to, again, before Instagram.

795
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:12,299
Now we kind of know who people are, but that's why tonight shows used to work because we

796
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:13,619
didn't know who these people are.

797
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:17,400
Now I've got to turn in, tune into Rove because John Travolta's on and I don't know what John

798
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
Travolta's like.

799
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,619
I've seen him dance in Greece and I've seen him play the villain in this film, but we're

800
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:24,839
about to find out what he's actually like.

801
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:29,380
And now you can just type in John Travolta on Instagram.

802
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,940
So I think that, you know, talk shows lost their superpower and I think a lot of celebrities

803
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,619
have lost their mystique because they're sharing so much.

804
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:36,619
Yeah.

805
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:39,619
Now I want to ask you a question and, and I'm happy for you not to, you know, to be

806
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:40,619
comfortable.

807
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:44,440
So the line that you used and, and, and speaking about your, your, your former relationship

808
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,779
with me, and I just thought it was one of the most disarming, most extraordinary things

809
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:50,960
I think I, and I mightn't get it quite right, but you know, when you're in a public eye

810
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,559
and a high profile relationship ends and you know, it's clearly Megan Gayle's married and

811
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,220
got two kids and moved on.

812
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,720
But I think there was a tweet you sent out at the time that it was just, I remember reading,

813
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,559
I think we might've talked about it on Radar, I thought what it just, to me, it's summed

814
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,559
up the person you are.

815
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:08,480
I think you said something like, when I first met Megan, I wanted her to share my great

816
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,400
passion for the Carlton Football Club.

817
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:15,359
I didn't expect her to take it so literally because she was going on to marry Sean Hampson,

818
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:18,000
who was, who was one of the great ruckmen at Carlton at the time.

819
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,019
I mean, to me, that's just such a disarming thing to say and, and, and sums you up.

820
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:24,400
What was the, the, the meaning behind it?

821
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:31,640
Well, I mean, there was, it was, it's, it's a, a breakup's a tough time for anyone.

822
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:37,759
And then one that's so, so in the public eye was a unique situation for us.

823
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:38,759
And for me particularly.

824
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:39,759
Yeah.

825
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:43,759
Um, I never wanted anyone to feel sorry for me.

826
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:50,519
Um, but that was probably the natural inclination for people to feel when, so like after myself,

827
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:55,640
suddenly she's dating the ruckman for my, the club that I love the most, you know, and,

828
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,000
uh, and, and introduced her to essentially.

829
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,319
So it's a, so that's a, um, I didn't want anyone to feel sorry for me.

830
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:06,799
It's never, I didn't feel, I didn't feel sorry for myself in that regard.

831
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,719
And I felt that if, before Hamish and I are doing this.

832
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:14,599
I don't want anyone watching our shows or listening to us and thinking, oh gosh, the

833
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:19,480
sad clown, that kind of stuff, because it wasn't really the case.

834
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:24,840
So, um, yeah, it was, it was an opportunity to just to, I actually got asked it.

835
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,820
It was a, um, I didn't have Twitter back then, but I, I got asked it by a reporter the day

836
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:36,719
it came out and, uh, I was at the, the Portsy, um, Portsy Pro-Am, a golf, a golf tournament,

837
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,719
um, down there.

838
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,719
Um.

839
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:45,659
That's where I met Jared Lyle, by the way, playing in the, in the Portsy Pro-Am, uh,

840
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:51,739
and got stopped on the eighth hole where by a reporter with a camera saying, hey, um.

841
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:56,659
Literally door stopped on the eighth hole of a Pro-Am with about 60 people following

842
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:57,659
and.

843
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,659
And that was off the cuff, wasn't it?

844
00:34:58,659 --> 00:34:59,659
Yeah.

845
00:34:59,659 --> 00:35:03,579
And I, and I was so, I was so worried about it, walking that hole.

846
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:04,579
About what you'd said?

847
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:05,579
What I'd said, yeah.

848
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:06,579
Really?

849
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:08,719
Um, and I, cause I thought, oh, is that.

850
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:10,940
Is that, is that flippant?

851
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,940
Is that, is that.

852
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,940
Yeah.

853
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,940
Is that disregarding the relationship?

854
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,940
Yeah.

855
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,940
Like all these things that you want to be a little bit protective and cautious of when

856
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,659
someone, um, and when two people part ways.

857
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,659
Yeah.

858
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:24,739
Um, but yeah, then the next day I saw it actually, it was actually at two in the morning cause

859
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:28,519
I had a lot of drinks that night and I saw it in the service station and I was getting

860
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:30,659
myself a water on the front page of, um.

861
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:31,659
That's the front page, isn't it?

862
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:32,659
Yeah.

863
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:33,659
There was a little, yeah.

864
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:34,659
Yeah.

865
00:35:34,659 --> 00:35:35,659
On the, on the page of the Herald Sun.

866
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:36,659
And I thought, oh, that's pretty funny.

867
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:37,659
.

868
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:42,059
That's an extraordinary line off the cuff, I don't know why it, um, resonated with me

869
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:43,059
so much.

870
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:46,480
I suppose people will listen and say, you know what, it is great life that Andy Lee

871
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,239
has and so much success, but, uh, you know, is there dark times?

872
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:53,539
I mean, you sound like you deal with those things incredibly well, but what, what, what

873
00:35:53,539 --> 00:35:54,539
are your strategies?

874
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:57,539
What, what, what are the things you do every day for people to share that, do you have

875
00:35:57,539 --> 00:35:58,539
daily habits?

876
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:01,400
Do you have, you know, routines and you're always healthy and, and, and fit looking.

877
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,880
Is there anything you do every day that, that keeps you feeling good?

878
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,659
Uh, I, during this most recent period of lockdown.

879
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:12,860
I've started exercising a lot more and, and I've realized the, the mental health benefits

880
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,800
of, of it rather than physical health, health benefits of it.

881
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,880
But no, I wouldn't say I have daily routines as such, um, it's more like, it's more those

882
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,980
philosophies we talked about across the board of, of just airing things really quickly.

883
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:36,460
Um, and I'm also really aware that, uh, I'm in a position where I can go at a slightly

884
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,460
different pace at times.

885
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,619
I don't have children at the moment, which would have been really difficult for people

886
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:41,619
in lockdown.

887
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:45,860
Um, we are in a position where we can choose the type of work we want to do.

888
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:54,860
Um, so I do have an advantage in that regard, see, but I think that, um, yeah, there was,

889
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:59,480
there's a great book I thought, uh, and I mentioned this on Willosophy, but, um, was

890
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,079
by Byron Katie called Loving What Is.

891
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,659
Um, and there was a period for me where, uh, you know, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

892
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:12,159
I would get frustrated with, say, some might get frustrated with people in my life that

893
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:16,880
I don't think are doing the right thing by themselves or by me or in work situations.

894
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:21,480
And, um, I got recommended this book and I read it and I was like, yeah, this actually

895
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,780
makes a lot of sense to me, which is just basically, I mean, I'm paraphrasing, you should

896
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,360
read it, but it's called Loving What Is.

897
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,139
Loving What Is, yeah.

898
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:35,400
And it's basically, don't try and fight reality, you know.

899
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:35,559
Yeah.

900
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:40,820
She, I think that she uses the example, and again, um, I might get it wrong, but, um,

901
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:46,159
says like this, this lady, her husband is, say, say the husband's name is Paul and said,

902
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,699
my husband watches too much television.

903
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,719
Paul watched too much television and that frustrates me.

904
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,099
And, but if you sit there and go, no, Paul watches that amount of television, you don't

905
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:57,159
be frustrated by it anymore.

906
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:59,139
Or could Paul watch more television?

907
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,679
Yeah, he probably could.

908
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:06,539
You know, so why are we getting frustrated by those?

909
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:10,780
And it's about, I suppose it sits there and minding your own business, but they, it does

910
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:14,820
a thing called the turnaround, which is essentially the one thing you're frustrated about if the

911
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,059
opposite is also true.

912
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:18,579
So Paul, Paul watches too much television.

913
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,039
Paul doesn't watch enough television.

914
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,039
That's actually also true.

915
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:28,780
He could watch more, you know, if the opposite is all also true, um, then you basically,

916
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,940
you should stop worrying about it.

917
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,280
And it goes really deep.

918
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,980
I mean, they've got people like my parents don't love me.

919
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:36,639
So the question might be, well, my parents should love me.

920
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:41,360
Parents don't have to love you, you know, the opposite is also true.

921
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,119
It's sad, but it's also true.

922
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:49,239
So if they don't, you have to accept that reality and find the love in other relationships

923
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,500
or whatever it might be.

924
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:56,980
So I found that one, a really helpful mechanism for my own little frustrations and things

925
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:02,519
that were weighing on me to go, if I turn this around and is the, is the opposite also

926
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:03,019
true?

927
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,760
Um, I shouldn't be worrying about this.

928
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:06,619
And you practice.

929
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:09,579
You basically use it in daily, daily sense.

930
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:09,840
Yeah.

931
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,519
They, they, they kind of in the book, and again, this is very self-helpy, which is,

932
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:18,760
which wasn't really my bag at all, but they, they tell you to stop at one point and they,

933
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,639
and, and write them down and then write, write the opposite down essentially.

934
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:30,139
And so you do that, but then you get quite good at doing it immediately in your head

935
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:31,559
when it comes up.

936
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:36,619
And so small frustration comes up and then, you know, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,

937
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:39,659
you can do that little turnaround and go, actually, what am I worried about this for?

938
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:41,420
Or am I putting too much pressure on this person?

939
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,119
All that stuff.

940
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:44,159
And, and yeah, you can walk a little bit easier.

941
00:39:44,539 --> 00:39:45,639
I'm keen to read it, Annie.

942
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:46,659
It sounds very practical.

943
00:39:46,659 --> 00:39:48,880
I read the first bit and then got the audio book.

944
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:51,719
So you can, but it was really helpful.

945
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:55,099
Um, and I started the conversation, you know, about success.

946
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:57,000
How do you define, what does it mean to you?

947
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:00,199
Um, I think, well, happiness, I think.

948
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:00,760
Yeah.

949
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:05,760
Um, I think if, if you're happy and that, I reckon that's what life's for.

950
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:08,199
Um, happiness, then you're successful.

951
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:08,880
Yeah.

952
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:12,320
Um, and so you can find happiness, a lot of different things.

953
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:18,820
Uh, and then I, I, I get a lot of self-worth out of, uh, working, um, and hanging out

954
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,099
at home.

955
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:20,619
I just, he just makes me so happy.

956
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:26,440
And I love, um, laughing and creating hijinks with him and seeing how inclusive and people

957
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,920
pouring in more energy to that.

958
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,539
I really love that.

959
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:31,139
It's definitely a happy place for me.

960
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,880
Um, and, but yeah, I think that's, that's the key because.

961
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:41,679
I've met a lot of people over the journey and as you have, and some of them are billionaires

962
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:43,320
and are not happy.

963
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:49,659
Um, and it's nice to be able to meet those people and realize that, uh, for all the material

964
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:54,159
wants there, um, it's, uh, it can't buy you that, that happiness.

965
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,420
It can be a lot of fun.

966
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:58,139
You can buy a big boat with it.

967
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:02,900
I think one of the saddest images of the year to me has been, you know, watching James Packer

968
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,219
give testimony to this, you know, floating on his $200 million boat.

969
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:06,440
Yeah.

970
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:06,539
Yeah.

971
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:06,599
Yeah.

972
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:06,619
Yeah.

973
00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:10,119
You know, he's been a very open about his own health issues and mental health issues

974
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:14,679
and just that image still sits, sticks with me as someone that has had access to so much

975
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:17,179
and, and, um, we had privilege of interviewing before.

976
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:22,000
It just seems like a genuine heartfelt person who's, you know, as you said, access to so

977
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,599
many things, but, but not happiness.

978
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:25,440
Can I come back to, uh.

979
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,000
Just on that.

980
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:26,219
Yeah.

981
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:31,300
A friend of mine, um, I, uh, was at a sporting event with him.

982
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:36,059
I'm going to be very vague cause I don't want, um, the names here, but, uh, and I said, how

983
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:36,599
things go.

984
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:37,960
And he's like, oh yeah, it's pretty weird.

985
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:38,980
Dad sold his company.

986
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,659
And I was like, oh wow, cool.

987
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,059
Cool.

988
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:42,019
Like what, what do you sell it for?

989
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:42,980
Like, you know, we're that close.

990
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:44,639
And he said four.

991
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,880
And I went, what's a weird, I'm like, what, four, four million?

992
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,280
Nah, it would have been worth more than that.

993
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:53,460
And I said, right, right.

994
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,239
And he goes, and he's decided he's not going to hold onto it.

995
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,519
He's just going to bequeath it.

996
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:58,340
He's just going to give it to the kids.

997
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,460
Three of us split three ways.

998
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,599
And then I've dawned on me, it's like four billion.

999
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:05,639
And I went, oh my God.

1000
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:05,840
So.

1001
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:09,239
You're going to have $1.6 billion.

1002
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:10,780
He goes, yeah, next week.

1003
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:13,780
And his life changed for the worst.

1004
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,119
It's been three years now.

1005
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:21,119
He's back on, back on track, but it was a strange thing to have to go through.

1006
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:25,739
Suddenly you're in a position where going to work doesn't feel like I should be doing

1007
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:26,039
that.

1008
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:28,519
What, what, what, what is life?

1009
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:30,519
What, what self-worth are you getting out of it?

1010
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,179
And, um, yeah, we're really off the rails and a couple of rehabs later and he's back

1011
00:42:35,179 --> 00:42:36,579
and family and all, all, all.

1012
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:36,940
Great.

1013
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:42,139
But I think when we talk about be careful what you wish for, and I know there's, there's

1014
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:42,940
a point in between.

1015
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:46,760
There's a, there's a point where certainly money to help pay the bills and not have to

1016
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,059
worry about these things is so great.

1017
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:56,360
But yeah, if you asked whether you wanted $1.6 billion tomorrow, it'd be, uh, it'd

1018
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,800
be a deeper thought for me.

1019
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,920
I'm not sure whether, um, it'd be something I'd be taking.

1020
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,199
It's a great conversation, Andy.

1021
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:05,320
I think there's a fascinating study to be done and, and Beck and I, my wife talk about

1022
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,500
this a lot and, you know.

1023
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:06,579
Yeah.

1024
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:10,079
And you, you meet a lot of people and you see, you know, um, a lot of people who are

1025
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:15,320
bequeathed money and, and, and, and you see often the family destruction that comes as

1026
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,159
a result of that.

1027
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:20,920
And I think Warren Buffett, the great investor, I think he, um, paid his kids school fees

1028
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,539
and might've even not paid the whole of their college.

1029
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:28,079
And his, his line was, why would I take away from them the opportunity to achieve?

1030
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:28,420
Yeah.

1031
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:33,320
And I, you know, I've got access to a hundred million dollars, but his idea was I'm not

1032
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,559
going to give them anything because, uh, because of that fact.

1033
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:40,539
And so you, you wonder what that, if there is a sweet spot, isn't there where, you know,

1034
00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:43,860
clearly too much can be, uh, can be more harmful than, than good.

1035
00:43:44,019 --> 00:43:50,539
One of my closest mates was, um, Spoonfeed's whole life going through and we had a ball

1036
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:54,920
and, and on his motor pass card, people had motor pass cards back in the day where you

1037
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,940
could get, uh, your, your, um, petrol.

1038
00:43:57,139 --> 00:44:01,480
We'd all fill up our cars on his dad's motor pass card and then all these types of things.

1039
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:05,980
But you could see the lack of real, you could like real world.

1040
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:09,800
And basically he ended up dropping out of uni to his credit.

1041
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:13,579
His dad said, he went back to his dad and said, oh, look, hey, you're going to have

1042
00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:14,300
to help me out again.

1043
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,460
And he, his dad said, nah, you go work in the warehouse for a year at this company.

1044
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,840
And if you do, I'll give you a job in the sales team.

1045
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,699
And he, to his credit, he said, if you miss a day though, you're gone.

1046
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,199
Yeah.

1047
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:30,199
And to his credit, he went and did that for a year.

1048
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:31,860
He's now got his own company running.

1049
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,780
He's very, very successful.

1050
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:37,739
But he talks about going back and actually waking up and getting out to the warehouse

1051
00:44:37,739 --> 00:44:42,579
while we're all having fun at uni still and didn't miss a beat was the huge reality check

1052
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:43,179
he needed.

1053
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,179
So yeah, there's something in it for sure.

1054
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,400
Can I ask, um, you know, back about, you said the happy place with you and Hamish working

1055
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,460
together and you, you just listened to the two of you and it just sounds like fun and

1056
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:58,739
you watched gap year and it's just, it just is and looks like so much fun, but you started

1057
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:00,460
off as young uni students.

1058
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:01,679
And as you said, no kids.

1059
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:02,760
You could pour your life into it.

1060
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:07,539
And then you get older and, you know, Hamish got kids now and, and, and you've got your

1061
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:08,539
partner back and life changed.

1062
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,940
Has that changed your, your friendship?

1063
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:12,920
Is it, is it put strains on it at times or?

1064
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,219
I wouldn't say strains.

1065
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,400
It's just, it's just definitely changed it for sure.

1066
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:21,460
There was a while there that, um, you know, it became more like, I reckon after four,

1067
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:26,460
four or five years, it became more like a marriage because we suddenly could turn around

1068
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:31,019
and see what this relationship meant to a lot of people.

1069
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:31,679
Yeah.

1070
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:32,639
Just to the company.

1071
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:37,119
We're working for how much money that it makes the company and all the people that we're

1072
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:38,599
employing and having fun with.

1073
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:41,739
And so we're like, oh, hang on, let's preserve this.

1074
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,860
You know, we had the, uh, our discussion about it wasn't like need to be front of mind, but

1075
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,460
just like, Hey, we need to kind of check in more.

1076
00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:48,900
Yeah.

1077
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:53,679
It probably becomes more of a marriage than it does, uh, you know, just to knock about

1078
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:58,239
friendship for that period because you're like, when in more stressful times, we've

1079
00:45:58,239 --> 00:45:59,000
got kids to worry about.

1080
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:01,500
We've got these assets, we've got these things, you know, that kind of thing.

1081
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:02,639
And so we checked in.

1082
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:07,239
We've done a lot with each other during that time, um, which is unusual for friends.

1083
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:15,780
So, so, um, that's, I'm proud of that.

1084
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,019
Yeah.

1085
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,880
Um, and, uh, and then, but that's a big change in a friendship.

1086
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:27,679
Um, and then off, on the, off the back of that, it's just been, to be honest, I think

1087
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:32,619
this, this last year, couple of years is probably back to the closest.

1088
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:34,179
We've ever been.

1089
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:39,000
And I think it's because we are doing less together.

1090
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,820
You know, um, the podcast is once a week.

1091
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,179
You can hang out and not talk about work.

1092
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:49,519
You, we, we go, we, you can go, go grab a beer, um, in the park and we'll go kick the

1093
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:51,239
footy with his son and just muck around.

1094
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,800
And we've done that, which I've just loved and I know he's loved.

1095
00:46:54,820 --> 00:47:00,400
And so it's, that's certainly something when you're on the treadmill and you've got five

1096
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,619
radio shows a week and in the break.

1097
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:03,920
You're filming TV shows.

1098
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:09,440
You probably can't catch up as much and just not talk about, you know, where we're going,

1099
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:09,920
what we're doing.

1100
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:16,159
And is it hard to do side projects when the two of you are so linked and your success

1101
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:16,800
is so linked?

1102
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,500
How do you, how do you work through that?

1103
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,860
No, we've always encouraged it.

1104
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,099
People have said like, you know, even with, um, with pain with Lego masters, which is

1105
00:47:25,099 --> 00:47:26,019
like so great.

1106
00:47:26,019 --> 00:47:29,500
And, and, and, uh, people like, Oh, well, how you feel about that?

1107
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,860
I was like, we've always done other projects.

1108
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:32,420
Yeah.

1109
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,300
That one's just a huge commercial success.

1110
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:34,860
Yeah.

1111
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:38,800
So, but I'm off in a band playing, you know, doing that.

1112
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,920
Hearing on the front bar, doing a great job.

1113
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:47,000
You know, I did talking about your generation, uh, short films and the books, they're all

1114
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,860
individual things and he's doing the same.

1115
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:54,460
It's just that when something's so there and on billboards, people must go, Oh, I wonder

1116
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,179
how Andy feels.

1117
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,780
It's like, no, we've, we've always had our side break.

1118
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,880
I think Hayme did 56 episodes of Spicks and Specks back from 2011.

1119
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:01,980
Yeah.

1120
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:02,019
Yeah.

1121
00:48:02,019 --> 00:48:02,039
Yeah.

1122
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:02,099
Yeah.

1123
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:02,119
Yeah.

1124
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:02,179
Yeah.

1125
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:02,400
Yeah.

1126
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,320
And then seven or six onwards.

1127
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:07,699
So like he was doing that a lot.

1128
00:48:07,699 --> 00:48:07,880
Yeah.

1129
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,039
Um, and we make time for our own stuff all the time.

1130
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:16,619
And the one thing that I would say to, you know, for teams of duo stuff, the learnings

1131
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:21,440
you get from going off and doing something by yourself, often we come back and go, gee,

1132
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:26,739
it's hard to work when you're by yourself to each other, but just the small learnings

1133
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:27,699
of like, Hey, this is interesting.

1134
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,840
They're doing this this way.

1135
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,340
You can get very insular with the group of mates because we still make our TV shows with

1136
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:32,920
our mates from uni.

1137
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:39,960
You've joined a group, uh, with, uh, Rob Sitch, Pat Cummings, Marcus Bond and Pelly, the, uh,

1138
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,820
the AFL captain and young superstar and Pat Australian cricket superstar.

1139
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:51,980
And I think maybe, uh, well, far, far from, from that, uh, you've had a long friendship

1140
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:55,280
with, with Pat and, and, you know, Rob really well, but can you tell us about what it's

1141
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,000
been like, uh, for you in terms of your own leadership, getting together with a group

1142
00:48:59,000 --> 00:48:59,320
like that?

1143
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:02,320
Uh, I must admit, I, I didn't know.

1144
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,659
I didn't know what I was getting myself into at the start.

1145
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,340
I got, Patty asked me, um, to whether I could come, come in and arrogantly, I thought I

1146
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:13,840
was coming in as a mentor, which clearly you were.

1147
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:14,639
No.

1148
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,059
So, um, Matt who, who ran, ran it, he said that, uh, that Pat had recommended me and,

1149
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:21,440
and, and Rob, but also recommended me to the group.

1150
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,400
So that was nice to be endorsed by those guys.

1151
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,219
I'm speak, you know, I think so highly of them, but I thought it was a one-off.

1152
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,719
And then when I got there and they said, uh, in, in over the next 12, one and a half hour

1153
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:32,260
sessions, I'm like, Holy shit.

1154
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,539
What the hell have I got myself into?

1155
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:36,219
So in true Andy style went, oh yeah, sorry.

1156
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,699
I just, I'm only committing to a small amount of this, but I'll see how I go.

1157
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,340
And then, um, really, really got a lot out of it and really enjoyed it.

1158
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:48,900
And, um, yeah, I mean, what I found really interesting about the, uh, the leadership

1159
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:53,059
course as it is, is it's peer to peer leadership.

1160
00:49:53,059 --> 00:49:59,539
That's something that I respond to a lot better than, um, I don't really respond that well

1161
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:02,239
to those, the, the big, what I feel like.

1162
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:05,519
Cult like, um, you know, empowering things.

1163
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:09,840
Um, I know it works for a lot of other people, so it's not a knock on them, but it all feels,

1164
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:14,059
well, to me at times a little disingenuine and a little bit one size fits all.

1165
00:50:14,059 --> 00:50:14,340
Yeah.

1166
00:50:14,739 --> 00:50:17,519
Um, and I don't think that leadership's about that.

1167
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,840
In fact, I think it's the opposite.

1168
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:24,300
The great leaders I've had come across in, in my time have been able to, you know, especially

1169
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:28,400
serve up advice bespoke to, to who they're giving it to.

1170
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,920
And, and that was what was really great about this peer to peer stuff.

1171
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,059
It was an opportunity to chat.

1172
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:37,860
We had insights from people that I admire so much in, in Rob Sitch, uh, and Bond and

1173
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,219
Pelly, um, Patty Cummins and Luke Balls in there as well.

1174
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:41,000
Yeah.

1175
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:46,300
And I suppose it's different, um, you know, uh, areas and, and you're, you're in the creative

1176
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,800
field and the media field with incredible success and elite sports people.

1177
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:54,539
And, uh, you know, it wouldn't necessarily, you'd think there'd be crossover.

1178
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:58,679
Why is there, and what are the sort of things that clearly there's some private conversations

1179
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:01,980
there, but where, where's the learning been of benefit to you?

1180
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:07,619
Uh, well, thankfully none of the sessions had a beep test, uh, because I think the Bond

1181
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:08,559
would have us all covered.

1182
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,719
I don't think Patty would go there if they weren't there to be honest.

1183
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,179
And Rob's a, Rob's a dark horse on that.

1184
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:19,699
Um, what, what was great, I've talked a lot about this with sports people.

1185
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:25,340
Um, there's a lot of parallels, um, with what we do in entertainment, um, with, with what

1186
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:28,960
can happen in the sporting field, which is particularly live television.

1187
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,099
You go out, it's a singular moment.

1188
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,099
You're meant to perform.

1189
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:32,239
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

1190
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:32,539
and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

1191
00:51:32,539 --> 00:51:33,400
and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

1192
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,960
um, and there's a lot of people that are really passionate about it.

1193
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:38,519
Now it's more passion in a sporting sense.

1194
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:42,639
You've got huge crowds and all this stuff and it's real time feedback for us.

1195
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:48,340
It's critics or, um, whether people tune in, um, nowadays a bit more, uh, online, you can

1196
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:50,719
see real time feedback about how something might be going.

1197
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:55,239
Uh, so it's interesting talking about those things about performance.

1198
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:01,360
Second aspect was with TV shows, it's a very small amount of time to get it right.

1199
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,380
They cost so much.

1200
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:04,400
So pre-production is very short.

1201
00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:05,480
You get together a crew.

1202
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:09,380
You're trying to find a gel and find this team unity really quickly.

1203
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,239
And then you shoot and it's all gone.

1204
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,760
And then everyone goes their other ways.

1205
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,099
And that happens in cricket specifically with IPL.

1206
00:52:17,139 --> 00:52:20,000
And you might go and play at another franchise and big bash leagues and so on.

1207
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,900
And how do you find a group of people, get them to gel quickly?

1208
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:24,360
Yeah.

1209
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,260
So we talked a lot about that.

1210
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,039
And then a lot of other stuff was just life hacks, you know,

1211
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:34,579
as Sitchy put it, the things like how do you organize your email or, you know,

1212
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:38,699
just anything that you felt you could give to the group which just helps you,

1213
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,420
assists you.

1214
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,579
And rather than being taught or spoken out or taught,

1215
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:47,179
essentially what would happen is we'd meet up and you'd always have a question

1216
00:52:47,179 --> 00:52:50,639
in the back of your mind like, hey, this happened to me this week

1217
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:54,940
and how would you guys have approached that or have you had that in your world?

1218
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,900
And here three or four great leaders go,

1219
00:52:59,000 --> 00:52:59,019
oh,

1220
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:04,079
I have encountered that, was powerful and also just as powerful

1221
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,280
as when someone went, I don't know.

1222
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:09,920
I don't know what I'd do because that is so comforting.

1223
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,619
People feel that they need to answer all the time.

1224
00:53:13,219 --> 00:53:17,360
And it can be just as comforting to hear, I don't know what I'd do

1225
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,380
because it means, oh, great, I'm not alone or I don't feel like a deal anymore

1226
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,639
that I don't really know how to deal with this moment.

1227
00:53:23,019 --> 00:53:26,280
And I love the fact that people, there's incredible success level

1228
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,139
that you've had and all that group.

1229
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:29,019
And, and,

1230
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,880
and other people are constantly looking at ways that you can self-reflect

1231
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,659
and improve and it makes sense that that is the type of person you are

1232
00:53:35,659 --> 00:53:39,820
and not surprised that the group have enjoyed your contribution in every way.

1233
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:42,139
And we've been talking about what we see these dimensions

1234
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:43,780
of what modern leadership looks like.

1235
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,579
So please be as expansive or as brief as you like,

1236
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,860
but we're picking up some commonality.

1237
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:51,119
And the first one to me is self-leadership.

1238
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:53,639
And if I ask you about that, self-leadership,

1239
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:54,460
what does it mean to you?

1240
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,460
The opportunity to reflect it in your own world,

1241
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:59,639
word and what you're doing.

1242
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:02,420
We talked about this a bit in our group.

1243
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,400
We, my, one of the mantras that we kind of stumbled across

1244
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,400
for Radio Karate, which is Hamish and my company with Tim and Ryan

1245
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,280
was particularly when it came to, to leading teams

1246
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,260
with Gap Year, the travel shows,

1247
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:21,159
we would travel to US, employ 50 to 60 people,

1248
00:54:21,539 --> 00:54:24,960
have them on the show and only take 10 max.

1249
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:27,300
Then the next year you go to the next country,

1250
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,340
employ 50, 60 people.

1251
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,099
Only take 10.

1252
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:33,760
So you're rotating a whole crew trying to create the same show.

1253
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:34,960
You don't have the same problem twice.

1254
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:38,719
And what pillars can we do to ensure that we try and create

1255
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:39,860
this culture really quickly?

1256
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,599
So when you say employ 50 or 60, but you only take 10 on the trip.

1257
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:43,820
Yeah.

1258
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:44,860
So we take 10 from Australia.

1259
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:45,159
Right.

1260
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:45,480
Okay.

1261
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,920
So 40 US citizens that you haven't met before,

1262
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:50,019
you employ on the ground.

1263
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,460
That's, that's big on a show.

1264
00:54:52,579 --> 00:54:52,699
Yeah.

1265
00:54:52,699 --> 00:54:54,960
Then you might have someone in graphics department

1266
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,239
who's fantastic year one.

1267
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,099
So you're like, oh, that's easy.

1268
00:54:57,159 --> 00:54:57,880
You don't need anyone there.

1269
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:58,440
And then the year two,

1270
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,219
you're over in Britain and you're like, you know,

1271
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:04,699
oh no, we should have got more people here because you don't know

1272
00:55:04,699 --> 00:55:07,139
whether you're going to have the same type of skill sets as you travel.

1273
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,280
And so what we found was it was important to reflect

1274
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,280
on every single element of the show and also every single person

1275
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,199
that we worked with.

1276
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,019
And it sounds like it's a bit, you know, self-bashing,

1277
00:55:19,219 --> 00:55:22,400
but Tim and I and the guys sat down and went,

1278
00:55:22,579 --> 00:55:25,679
what if it was our fault that these person didn't succeed

1279
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:27,059
or didn't get the best out of them?

1280
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:27,719
Not this.

1281
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,400
It's so easy.

1282
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,780
You go, you know, that guy was crap.

1283
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,780
We need to replace them.

1284
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,039
Yeah.

1285
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,059
Um, but what, what, what could we have done to give them

1286
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:37,340
a better chance to succeed?

1287
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:42,239
Um, and that's part of the self leadership that I've really enjoyed

1288
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:46,239
of recent times is like, how can we give everyone that I'm working

1289
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:49,920
with or I was working or working for, or, or they're working

1290
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,260
for me, their best chance to succeed.

1291
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:52,739
Yeah.

1292
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:55,219
Um, and taking a step back and going, what am I doing

1293
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:58,420
to help that rather than just expecting of people?

1294
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,840
Um, so that's probably, probably the main.

1295
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,519
Brilliant thought.

1296
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:03,980
And I, I, I think of, uh, the sporting environment, Andy,

1297
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:07,579
where it always in the past coaches, he can't kick.

1298
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:08,579
He's not a great mark.

1299
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:10,400
We're always telling you what you couldn't do.

1300
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,659
And I always just think, isn't the art of coaching.

1301
00:56:12,659 --> 00:56:15,340
We need you to do one or two of those things better.

1302
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,900
How do I support you to get better?

1303
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:21,219
Rather than this is a blank, uh, line through you because that

1304
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:23,659
skill is not something that can I just follow?

1305
00:56:23,659 --> 00:56:25,960
I'm, I'm fascinated in that because you're going to live

1306
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,280
and die by those 40 people.

1307
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:27,579
Really?

1308
00:56:27,579 --> 00:56:27,880
Aren't you?

1309
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:28,139
Did you?

1310
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:30,719
Did you find you got better, you know, you, you did

1311
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,860
several gap years.

1312
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:34,079
How'd you identify good people?

1313
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,139
I mean, without stereotyping, you go to the U S and everyone

1314
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:38,900
can do everything and they're the best at everything.

1315
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,880
So, so it's actually very, very in their minds or is that

1316
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,760
actually, well, no, it's in their mind.

1317
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,880
So it's actually really hard to interview for.

1318
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,019
So you sit down, you talk to some lighting guy who goes,

1319
00:56:49,019 --> 00:56:50,219
yeah, I'm the best there is.

1320
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:51,239
You know, I can light this.

1321
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:51,780
I can do that.

1322
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,579
I can light the statue of Liberty from here, you know, and, and

1323
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:55,920
she's like, oh, this guy seems pretty good.

1324
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,599
Then the next guy gives you the same kind of treatment.

1325
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,019
So it's, so it was actually very difficult to try and work

1326
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:01,860
out who to go with.

1327
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:04,719
And then you head to Britain and you're talking to someone

1328
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:07,059
who's got an amazing credentials and you ask them a question

1329
00:57:07,059 --> 00:57:08,800
like, oh, look, I'm not sure if I'd be the best at this, you

1330
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:13,739
know, so the difference in personalities was, was fascinating.

1331
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:18,599
Um, in Thailand, uh, I think it was 50% of the crew didn't

1332
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:19,500
speak in English.

1333
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,159
So, and same with when we're in Buenos Aires.

1334
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:23,920
So you had to trust the top people that they were

1335
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,960
translating back to you.

1336
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:27,360
So.

1337
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,760
All in, in South America, the director directed in Spanish.

1338
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:31,320
Wow.

1339
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:35,320
So, um, all the cameramen spoke Spanish and we just smiled and

1340
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:38,940
hoped then Tim would be tapping on the show director cause it was bilingual.

1341
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:39,300
So.

1342
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,039
Did the humor translate?

1343
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:42,059
Were they getting the gags?

1344
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:42,300
Were they?

1345
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,019
They got the gags, which is really great.

1346
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:48,239
Um, so, I mean, it was a long winded answer to the, to the, to the question,

1347
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:53,940
but, um, what you needed to do is make sure that you were set up so clearly from

1348
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:57,420
the head and, and that was, and that is just the.

1349
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:02,400
Structure of what we're trying to create was so clear and so defined in the head

1350
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,440
roles that we are taking across there.

1351
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:08,880
So they know what's expected of them and then they can, they can then employ the

1352
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,019
people, uh, that is going to, that they're going to answer to those people.

1353
00:58:13,019 --> 00:58:18,360
So our key personnel that we hired in country, we were more rigorous with, with,

1354
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:20,940
with, with, with getting them on board and we chose really well.

1355
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:23,280
And this probably relates to the second dimension.

1356
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,199
We talk about positively impacting others in your environment and of office,

1357
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:30,199
you're someone that feels like every environment you come in, there's a

1358
00:58:30,199 --> 00:58:31,579
positive energy when you're around.

1359
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:32,579
Do you think about that?

1360
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:33,699
How you, how you go about it?

1361
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,699
I've never felt that I, uh, I go, I better be positive today.

1362
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,380
Just happens for you.

1363
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:40,760
Doesn't it?

1364
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:47,239
So, you know, maybe someone will analyze it back, you know, at some point we'll

1365
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:50,480
sit down with the council, they might analyze where it comes from, but I would

1366
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:56,820
say, um, you know, upbringing is part of that really loving siblings, um, amazing

1367
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,179
work environment.

1368
00:58:57,199 --> 00:58:59,199
So I've had the whole way through.

1369
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:03,679
I feel like, um, Southern Cross Austerio when, when it was just Austerio and I

1370
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:05,119
first moved, came here.

1371
00:59:05,539 --> 00:59:09,440
Um, I thought the people culture was amazing in those, in that early period.

1372
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:14,940
And, um, yeah, borrowing and trying and just having great mentors along the way,

1373
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,699
I think helps and maybe natural disposition.

1374
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,480
There's some good DNA there for sure.

1375
00:59:19,579 --> 00:59:24,019
Andy, no doubt about you've, uh, had some incredible visions around what you've

1376
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:24,519
wanted to do.

1377
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:28,159
And you mentioned gap year and, uh, you know, the Hamish Dandy show and all the

1378
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:30,300
things you do, uh, a unique vision.

1379
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,679
How do you go about creating and sharing those visions?

1380
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,179
Uh, look, it was pretty easy when it came to home because, um, he made me laugh a

1381
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:38,340
lot.

1382
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:41,639
So he'd go, Hey, how about we do this?

1383
00:59:41,659 --> 00:59:42,260
I'm like, yeah, absolutely.

1384
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,000
That sounds great.

1385
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:47,320
Um, so I think what was, again, we were lucky.

1386
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,860
We, we got to make the shows with our best mates from school.

1387
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:54,139
Um, we found that a challenge when we, the shows got bigger, for instance,

1388
00:59:54,139 --> 00:59:59,599
first season of gap year, we had such a shorthand between the four of us that if

1389
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:04,360
I, if Haynes had an idea to me or vice versa, I could tell Tim or I, and we know

1390
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,699
it's going to end up on screen pretty much like we thought.

1391
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:11,000
And as soon as there were more people along the chain, you go, how's this guy

1392
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,719
not getting this?

1393
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:14,340
Well, it's because he didn't spend 10 years hanging out with you guys.

1394
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,579
So that was a, um, was a challenge.

1395
01:00:19,579 --> 01:00:23,820
And again, I'm big believer of pitching yourself.

1396
01:00:24,139 --> 01:00:27,960
Um, making sure that you're the one that's, the people that are going to capture it, that,

1397
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,440
that, that, that are going to do the whole thing, explain yourself what you want to do

1398
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:37,719
from the outset or what this show is going to be, um, and what the idea is.

1399
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:42,719
And I love looking at people's eyes and seeing if they get it, you know, you can, and, and

1400
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,079
if they, if they don't have any questions or if you feel like they're not quite, quite

1401
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:50,179
there, not necessarily in front of a big group going, do you not get it?

1402
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:53,480
Just pulling them aside and going, Hey, did that make sense?

1403
01:00:53,619 --> 01:00:53,760
You know?

1404
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:53,980
Yeah.

1405
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:54,119
Yeah.

1406
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:55,900
And, and I feel like, oh, awful.

1407
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:56,559
Did that make sense?

1408
01:00:56,599 --> 01:00:56,940
You know, whatever.

1409
01:00:57,059 --> 01:00:59,480
And, and get them asking that question.

1410
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:07,139
Cause often we think about shows or an idea so deeply that we're down at stage 10 and

1411
01:01:07,139 --> 01:01:08,699
you've forgotten where it came from.

1412
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,739
You know, the tree's already grown and you've forgotten what the seed looks like.

1413
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:12,119
Yeah.

1414
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:16,840
But when you're pitching that again, you're already starting, you're, you're telling them

1415
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,579
stage 10 and they're like, I have no idea what they're talking about.

1416
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:23,880
So, um, there, those are really important things to do in.

1417
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:30,739
I find, um, at, at, at, at the very beginning to set the, everybody with the, with the straight

1418
01:01:30,739 --> 01:01:31,079
rudder.

1419
01:01:31,739 --> 01:01:37,320
So if it hasn't been any lost in translation or any whispers where you've come back in two

1420
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:40,000
weeks later and gone, why the hell are we over here?

1421
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:40,599
Yeah.

1422
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:41,739
We're meant to be traveling that way.

1423
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,340
Yeah.

1424
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:46,900
John Worsfold, uh, on this podcast, Andy was talking about same thing.

1425
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:50,340
You think you've come up with a game plan that's going to win a grand final and you

1426
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:53,360
maybe focus on defense and you can see straight away.

1427
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:57,139
The defenders are sort of growing in stature and the forwards are going, my life's going

1428
01:01:57,139 --> 01:01:58,820
to be so much harder because he doesn't care.

1429
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:03,099
And you realize that you then need to go back and find out how to interpret it.

1430
01:02:03,159 --> 01:02:06,679
You might've had, you know, as he described what you thought was really clear vision,

1431
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:09,860
but it's going to be taken in that case, 42 different ways.

1432
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,400
How do you try and connect people?

1433
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,280
It sounds similar to the way you were, you were describing it.

1434
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:19,739
I reckon it really helps if you, if, if you've got another colleague there for anything,

1435
01:02:19,739 --> 01:02:23,119
for any meeting, because we just all interpret.

1436
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:27,420
Anything so differently, like I've walked out, you know, it might be pitching shows

1437
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:33,300
in the U S and walked out with my lawyer and said, um, that was, that was great because

1438
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:34,960
they said this, he's like, I didn't interpret that way.

1439
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:35,400
I think it was.

1440
01:02:35,659 --> 01:02:40,940
And so we're sitting there having a discussion as to what they actually meant by a certain

1441
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:42,280
sentence or so on.

1442
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:42,519
Yeah.

1443
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:48,239
And I'm thinking, wow, if I was there by myself, we wouldn't be there trying to dissect what

1444
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:51,300
was going on and what is the next question we can ask them back to clarify.

1445
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:51,780
Yeah.

1446
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:52,440
Similarly.

1447
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,739
I could walk out of a meeting thinking it all went really well and hey, might go to

1448
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:57,940
me, hey, that was a bit weird.

1449
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:03,480
And so it does help having a person there that shares the vision with you.

1450
01:03:03,539 --> 01:03:03,800
Yeah.

1451
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:09,460
So you can take in that, that, and, and, and, and properly prosecute how people are taking,

1452
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:10,699
uh, taking on what you're saying.

1453
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:11,179
Yeah.

1454
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:16,340
Great piece of advice all around, uh, talking about learning and improvement, Andy, through

1455
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,500
the lens of curiosity.

1456
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:21,800
We see that these great leaders we're talking to, like you, curiosity seems to be a really

1457
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:22,420
common trait.

1458
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:22,699
Is that?

1459
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:24,079
Does that resonate with you?

1460
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:25,079
Oh, yeah.

1461
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:30,199
I, I love, you know, a bit, this definitely stems from my dad, you know, if a question

1462
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:32,300
comes up, we both have to find out the answer pretty quickly.

1463
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:34,719
Reaching, now it's reaching for your phone, Google.

1464
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:37,679
It used to be, we used to hypothesize a lot, you know, when we were younger.

1465
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:38,079
Yeah.

1466
01:03:38,619 --> 01:03:42,199
Um, and, and now you've got the answer in your pocket, which I'm not sure is better

1467
01:03:42,199 --> 01:03:42,739
or worse.

1468
01:03:44,019 --> 01:03:50,719
Um, no curiosity, to be honest, I think that's both outside of, uh, of, of performing.

1469
01:03:51,639 --> 01:03:52,679
Um, I love it.

1470
01:03:52,739 --> 01:03:52,980
I like finding out.

1471
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:56,039
I like finding out what makes people tick and also what makes things work or not work.

1472
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:59,760
Um, but I also think it's our best place for Hamish and I to play comedically.

1473
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:04,099
I think when the show is curious and we're going on adventures and want to find out things,

1474
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:09,880
um, it's that little journey is, is what we find the best and the most fun and turns

1475
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:10,820
into maybe the most funny.

1476
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:17,400
So what I love about someone like Rob, Rob Sitch and, and, uh, and, and Marcus, uh, and,

1477
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,079
and, and Patty and all of them, but in that special group we had for that leadership group

1478
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:22,960
is they were all really good.

1479
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:27,420
They were really curious as to what, that, you know, I would have been interested to

1480
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:28,760
see who, who talked the most.

1481
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,539
Cause I, I, there wasn't, I never walked away from any session going, you know, probably

1482
01:04:32,539 --> 01:04:37,099
me talking the most, but like, it really felt balanced the whole way through.

1483
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,940
Um, because everyone felt like they really wanted to listen and I felt, you know, actually

1484
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:42,780
I'm getting so much out of this.

1485
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,079
I want to do the listening here.

1486
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:44,400
Yeah.

1487
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:51,420
Um, and it's, it just makes for quick learning, I reckon, if you, if you're happy to be curious

1488
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:52,119
and also.

1489
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,179
Except, except the feedback.

1490
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:54,880
Yeah.

1491
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:55,420
Yeah.

1492
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:56,840
That goes with it along the way.

1493
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:01,940
Uh, communicating with clarity is, uh, is something we're also seeing, uh, that's been

1494
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:02,739
your life really.

1495
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,980
Is that something you've refined?

1496
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:08,280
And now you've got big teams of people that you manage and you lead.

1497
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,360
Is that evolved over time, how you communicate?

1498
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:11,239
Yeah.

1499
01:05:11,539 --> 01:05:12,360
Uh, yeah, absolutely.

1500
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:18,099
Um, I talk to a bunch of people nowadays about just the language to use as well.

1501
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:22,360
Like I think language is so important when it comes to communicating messages.

1502
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:29,739
Um, and it's not with not being disingenuine, but to use the language that someone's used

1503
01:05:29,739 --> 01:05:35,320
to, um, the way I'm going to talk to, uh, you know, a knock about younger person, uh,

1504
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:38,380
that's working for us is going to be very different to the way I talk to a lawyer, like

1505
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:43,840
in the language I use, um, to make sure that we're all understanding what we're trying

1506
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:44,440
to achieve.

1507
01:05:45,019 --> 01:05:51,300
Uh, so even with, you know, a topic, a topic at the moment, which we don't want to go into

1508
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:52,679
too deeply because the vaccines.

1509
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:58,780
Um, in talking to friends and colleagues about the language to use and some people,

1510
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,280
a good example is I had a mate of mine going, oh, look, I've got to tell one of my employees,

1511
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:04,940
the government are going to force us to do this.

1512
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,639
So I'm going to have to force you to do that.

1513
01:06:06,659 --> 01:06:08,619
And I was like, well, just don't use the word force like this.

1514
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,000
Yeah.

1515
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:10,760
Let's just take, take that out.

1516
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:11,159
Yeah.

1517
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,679
If, if you change that sentence to it's a government requirement.

1518
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:17,480
So it's going to turn into me being, having to be a government requirement for my workplace

1519
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,159
to do this.

1520
01:06:18,199 --> 01:06:18,360
Yeah.

1521
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:21,619
Suddenly just in that substitute of one word.

1522
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:22,960
It's a different feeling.

1523
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,239
A feeling, a meaning, and the conversation started really differently.

1524
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:31,179
So, um, you know, putting the, that argument aside, I think it just highlighted though

1525
01:06:31,179 --> 01:06:35,179
how words can be really important, um, in specific words.

1526
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:40,219
So if there's a more delicate conversation to be had, uh, across the board, I do spend

1527
01:06:40,219 --> 01:06:41,139
more time on that stuff.

1528
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:41,619
Yeah.

1529
01:06:41,659 --> 01:06:42,920
And it is a great life story.

1530
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:48,199
And again, it's funny, everyone's reluctant to say, let's not talk about, you know, I

1531
01:06:48,199 --> 01:06:52,960
feel sort of compelled to talk about living in a time where there is a mandate, you know,

1532
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:57,920
on employers that, uh, in the city of Victoria and worldwide effectively in most places

1533
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:02,260
that unless you take a medical product, then you're going to be banned from work.

1534
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:06,619
And that's, there's no, you're almost just countering what you're saying straight away

1535
01:07:06,619 --> 01:07:08,440
to say there's no political statement in this.

1536
01:07:08,519 --> 01:07:13,440
But to me, to, to, to not have a debate anymore, you just sensitively thinking about the language.

1537
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,699
Well, that's out of your hand if you're an employer, it really is.

1538
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:18,860
But what you're talking about is having some empathy in that conversation.

1539
01:07:19,019 --> 01:07:20,099
Now it mightn't change anything.

1540
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:22,639
It doesn't feel like there's been a lot of empathy.

1541
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:24,280
At least in this conversation, which is.

1542
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,780
No, it's certainly divisive.

1543
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:26,219
Yeah.

1544
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:30,059
You know, you look at things like, um, there's a law for a while there.

1545
01:07:30,059 --> 01:07:33,039
If they pulled out your, um, your date of birth, you're going to fight a war in Vietnam.

1546
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:42,420
Like, you know, I personally would prefer a needle in my arm, but the, uh, so it's, we

1547
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:47,900
have, you know, putting, putting it all aside and not, not, I'm not swaying either way.

1548
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:50,599
I'm just saying that there is context to all the stuff.

1549
01:07:50,739 --> 01:07:50,880
Yeah.

1550
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:55,519
I think you're spot on that the language used across the board from media, from our, um,

1551
01:07:55,519 --> 01:08:01,639
public figures, but also trailing down to employers that aren't really trained to deliver

1552
01:08:01,639 --> 01:08:02,340
these messages.

1553
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:02,780
Yeah.

1554
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:04,059
But that's, what's really hard.

1555
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:06,019
That's, what's really, really hard about the subject.

1556
01:08:06,099 --> 01:08:11,619
If you put, and, and putting the vaccine aside, if you put anyone in charge, deliver a message

1557
01:08:11,619 --> 01:08:14,860
that they're not trained to do, it's going to be really difficult for them.

1558
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:19,920
And it's like the junior coach delivering the harshest message to a player opposed to

1559
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:20,500
the senior one.

1560
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:20,859
Yeah.

1561
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,399
You know, they're, they're, they're more than likely to stuff it up.

1562
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:26,420
Um, and then you can, it becomes divisive.

1563
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:31,300
I'm not sure if you've listened to the, um, the breakdown, it's a podcast, uh, about rugby

1564
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,399
union and its failings.

1565
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:33,479
Um.

1566
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:34,079
No, I haven't, no.

1567
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:34,859
Fantastic.

1568
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:39,479
Uh, you don't have to be into rugby union, but it talks about how, um, back in the day,

1569
01:08:39,539 --> 01:08:43,119
David Campisi, Nick Fade-Jones and like rugby union, late eighties, early nineties, biggest

1570
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:43,399
coach.

1571
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:44,520
Like it was unbelievable.

1572
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:45,560
So it was, and then.

1573
01:08:45,859 --> 01:08:48,020
Legends of, uh, Australian sport, all those names.

1574
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:48,199
Yeah.

1575
01:08:48,199 --> 01:08:49,380
And they had all the money.

1576
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:50,720
They, they were flying.

1577
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:51,000
Yeah.

1578
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,899
And they just managed to squander it all.

1579
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:53,460
And why?

1580
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:54,600
And it explains it all.

1581
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,180
But the Israel Folau conversation comes up.

1582
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:58,739
Michael Chek is the coach at the time.

1583
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:01,699
And he said it became, um, adversarial.

1584
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:05,159
It became too hard for other people to back down.

1585
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:05,520
Yeah.

1586
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,159
And that's where we are with vaccine.

1587
01:09:07,979 --> 01:09:12,779
But as soon as, and I, I got a great learning out of that, listening to that podcast and

1588
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:16,779
listening to Michael Chek and going, that's a great thing to take on board for anyone

1589
01:09:16,779 --> 01:09:20,680
I'm working with ever, or, or trying to do anything with is as soon as.

1590
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,060
As soon as it becomes this or else.

1591
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:22,619
Yeah.

1592
01:09:23,119 --> 01:09:24,960
It's very difficult to meet in the middle again.

1593
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:25,500
Yeah.

1594
01:09:25,739 --> 01:09:29,680
Um, and, and that's where Michael thought it fell down with Israel Folau when you've

1595
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,659
got the best player in the world, almost.

1596
01:09:31,659 --> 01:09:31,920
Yeah.

1597
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:35,239
And you're sacking him in anything in work.

1598
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:41,659
If it's someone's living conditions, their work hours, anything there's, there can come

1599
01:09:41,659 --> 01:09:41,920
a time.

1600
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,659
People don't want to get Dennis Rodman doesn't want to go to training for the Chicago bulls,

1601
01:09:44,659 --> 01:09:50,659
whatever it might be that, that the last dance, the great doco, where you see a coach, a coach,

1602
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:56,720
a coach that understands that sending Dennis Rodman to Las Vegas for two days in the middle

1603
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,520
of an important season is the best thing for the team.

1604
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,520
Yeah.

1605
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:04,319
There's not many, there's not many coaches that would do that.

1606
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:05,319
Yeah.

1607
01:10:05,319 --> 01:10:11,399
But that's where I'm talking about bespoke advice and leadership on purpose built for

1608
01:10:11,399 --> 01:10:12,399
the individual.

1609
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:13,399
Yeah.

1610
01:10:13,399 --> 01:10:18,119
Um, where a lot of coaches would go, nah, you train as hard as everyone else, uh, or

1611
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:20,119
you can see the door, you can walk out of it.

1612
01:10:20,119 --> 01:10:20,159
Yeah.

1613
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:20,319
Yeah.

1614
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:20,399
Yeah.

1615
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:20,479
Yeah.

1616
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:20,560
Yeah.

1617
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:20,659
Yeah.

1618
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:21,680
Yeah.

1619
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:22,680
Yeah.

1620
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:23,680
Yeah.

1621
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:24,680
Yeah.

1622
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:25,680
Yeah.

1623
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:26,680
And it's not one size fits all.

1624
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,680
Is it, is it, Andy?

1625
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,680
And I, um, I'm referring to a lot of, um, I feel examples today.

1626
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:31,359
It's probably, you know, clearly part of my life, but I, Max Gorm was a premiership captain

1627
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:32,539
this year for Melbourne Football Club.

1628
01:10:32,539 --> 01:10:35,060
I know you love your AFL as a big Carlton man.

1629
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:39,420
To me, he would never have been a captain in the previous year because he's not your

1630
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:41,319
stereotypical alpha male.

1631
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:43,479
And someone would've said, that's not fit.

1632
01:10:43,479 --> 01:10:46,880
And you would have missed out on one of the great leaders we've seen because he's purely

1633
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,140
himself.

1634
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:49,260
He's got this great joy.

1635
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:50,560
He doesn't take himself too seriously.

1636
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,100
but he inspires players in a way that because he's been allowed

1637
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:56,899
to be himself, which is a great credit to the people around him.

1638
01:10:57,079 --> 01:10:59,939
Not surprised that he turned out the way that he did

1639
01:10:59,939 --> 01:11:00,760
with great success.

1640
01:11:01,239 --> 01:11:05,159
Final question in terms of these dimensions of leadership is collaboration

1641
01:11:05,159 --> 01:11:06,260
and the importance of collaboration.

1642
01:11:06,439 --> 01:11:09,779
You've been in one of the great collaborations in Australia.

1643
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:13,439
When I ask you about that, what comes to mind?

1644
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:17,199
I love collaborating with anyone.

1645
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:20,300
I don't particularly, even with team sports,

1646
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:22,859
even with individual sports, I prefer to play doubles

1647
01:11:22,859 --> 01:11:23,640
than singles tennis.

1648
01:11:23,819 --> 01:11:24,939
I don't know why.

1649
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:28,140
Maybe it's sharing the blame or the pressure.

1650
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,239
Maybe I'm not strong enough to step up.

1651
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:35,359
But I love sharing the success.

1652
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,659
I think that, to be honest, I think the shared success is almost

1653
01:11:40,659 --> 01:11:42,539
as great as individual success.

1654
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:46,699
But shared failure is 50 times better than individual failure.

1655
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:48,600
Good way to think of it.

1656
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,159
I really feel like it's.

1657
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:51,539
You're playing the odds there.

1658
01:11:51,739 --> 01:11:51,880
Yeah.

1659
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,619
You know, it's.

1660
01:11:53,979 --> 01:12:00,680
So, yeah, I mean, Haim and I are in a real lucky position where not only

1661
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:04,659
do we make each other laugh, best of friends, but the product worked.

1662
01:12:04,819 --> 01:12:05,020
Yeah.

1663
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,260
And, you know, some would argue continues to work.

1664
01:12:08,319 --> 01:12:08,619
We'll see.

1665
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,859
We'll get a tap on the shoulder one day and they'll say,

1666
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,060
you've had your time ball, boys.

1667
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:16,180
And so you just want to preserve that.

1668
01:12:17,239 --> 01:12:20,279
And we take that really seriously.

1669
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:22,399
And, you know, obviously I only can speak on my behalf.

1670
01:12:22,539 --> 01:12:27,479
But I just, I love it so much that I'll do anything to make sure that it's

1671
01:12:27,479 --> 01:12:28,920
nurtured in the right way.

1672
01:12:29,239 --> 01:12:29,460
Yeah.

1673
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,460
What an amazing way to think about it.

1674
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,539
I think there's any argument that it continues to work.

1675
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,000
And I think that's, you can put that one to bed.

1676
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:39,960
The final two questions I've been asking all the leaders I've been fortunate

1677
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,819
enough to spend time with, including you, starting with,

1678
01:12:42,899 --> 01:12:44,300
who's the greatest leader in your life?

1679
01:12:47,239 --> 01:12:48,220
Great question.

1680
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:50,079
I mean.

1681
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:56,460
What I love about the world we live in is if I know to lean on someone

1682
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:57,439
for a certain situation.

1683
01:12:57,739 --> 01:13:02,699
Um, so I don't think there is a, I guess that's why there's a coaching

1684
01:13:02,699 --> 01:13:07,960
panel on, on a football team, but there's, uh, amazing mentors that

1685
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:11,840
are 30 years older than me that I, that I'll call up in a, in a moment

1686
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,739
where I'm like, you know, something particularly stupid with business.

1687
01:13:14,739 --> 01:13:17,819
And then if it came down to whether this is funny or not, I'll call

1688
01:13:17,819 --> 01:13:19,760
Hamish in a heartbeat, you know, like, you know, so.

1689
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,819
I don't think it's an individual person.

1690
01:13:22,819 --> 01:13:24,859
I think it's the sum of all the parts.

1691
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:29,180
Um, I've been really thankful to, to Rob Sitch who I know you've, um,

1692
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:33,560
done a podcast with because, uh, along the ride, I've been able to ring him

1693
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:36,619
and go, what'd you do here and what's happening with this?

1694
01:13:36,739 --> 01:13:40,180
And, and he probably doesn't even, he loves TV so much.

1695
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:42,699
He probably doesn't realize that I'm sitting there scouring down my notes,

1696
01:13:42,699 --> 01:13:47,359
but, um, yeah, it's, it's hard for me to put, put a singular person on it.

1697
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:47,600
Yeah.

1698
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,119
And, um, I think it'd probably be unfair to a lot of people in my life.

1699
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:50,279
Yeah.

1700
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:50,659
If I did.

1701
01:13:50,939 --> 01:13:51,680
I love the answer.

1702
01:13:51,819 --> 01:13:55,819
If you could collaborate with anyone in the world, who would you go to?

1703
01:13:56,439 --> 01:13:57,079
Hamish Blake.

1704
01:13:58,079 --> 01:13:59,100
Another good answer.

1705
01:13:59,479 --> 01:13:59,640
Yeah.

1706
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:02,779
It's a sort of semi-loaded question that one, isn't it, Andy?

1707
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:04,319
I'm going to get a story out of this.

1708
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:07,899
Andy's had enough of Hamish and he really always wanted to.

1709
01:14:07,899 --> 01:14:09,199
If Hamish says Lima or something.

1710
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:11,119
Yeah, exactly.

1711
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:13,699
I wish I had that in the bank.

1712
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,579
It would have been brilliant.

1713
01:14:14,579 --> 01:14:18,979
Um, have you thought about anyone overseas or anyone that you've, you've.

1714
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:19,460
Uh.

1715
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:25,720
Uh, there's people I admire, but, um, it's about how people work.

1716
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:26,899
Not about what they've done.

1717
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:27,220
Yeah.

1718
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:34,500
It's to me that I'm, you know, I, I'll, I've loved watching, um, individual performers.

1719
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:38,060
You know, it's Rick edge face and David Tennant is an actor recent times.

1720
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:42,279
And, um, but I've no idea whether it'd be fun to work with them.

1721
01:14:42,279 --> 01:14:42,479
Yeah.

1722
01:14:42,539 --> 01:14:45,100
Um, and the work has to be fun.

1723
01:14:45,819 --> 01:14:47,500
Uh, in my mind and.

1724
01:14:48,579 --> 01:14:49,020
Yeah.

1725
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:49,340
You know, you have to.

1726
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:49,380
Yeah.

1727
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:52,659
your Judd Apatows and all these people that are obviously comedy gurus

1728
01:14:52,659 --> 01:14:58,100
and legends, but, yeah, it would be, thankfully,

1729
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:00,359
I've got to meet a bunch of them along the ride.

1730
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:07,279
But you can't necessarily put two, I'm categorizing myself

1731
01:15:07,279 --> 01:15:12,800
as a brilliant comedian, but you can't necessarily put two great creators

1732
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,600
together and expect it to work, and I'm really mindful of that.

1733
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:22,060
So, yeah, there'd certainly be a fair few beers before committing

1734
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:22,619
to anything like that.

1735
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,399
You can't manufacture chemistry, can you?

1736
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:29,039
And sometimes it's the most abstract relationship, isn't it?

1737
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:31,279
It would be surprise works, and you're right,

1738
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:33,819
as you put two people in a room that you think will be great,

1739
01:15:33,859 --> 01:15:35,000
it doesn't always work that way, does it?

1740
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:40,960
No, I actually think it's the opposite a little bit in our, you know,

1741
01:15:41,239 --> 01:15:44,739
we actually do have a situation in footy now where there are two full forwards.

1742
01:15:44,739 --> 01:15:46,560
Most teams have got two big forwards.

1743
01:15:46,739 --> 01:15:49,060
But, you know, for a while, they still need to work in tandem.

1744
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,260
They still need to give themselves the space.

1745
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:55,560
And in the comedy world, you, and we experience this when we're trying

1746
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,659
to cast from, you know, my new TV show, The 100,

1747
01:15:57,739 --> 01:15:59,180
when you're putting the panel together, you're like,

1748
01:15:59,659 --> 01:16:02,539
who is actually going to help each other out and not just compete,

1749
01:16:02,819 --> 01:16:06,979
compete the whole time rather than help?

1750
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:10,659
And so that would be an important part of it, sure.

1751
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:12,920
It's always fun, Andy, to catch up.

1752
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:16,579
It's always positive, and I'm always appreciative of your time.

1753
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:17,439
So thanks again.

1754
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,180
Really appreciate it.

1755
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:18,840
Great to see you, mate.
