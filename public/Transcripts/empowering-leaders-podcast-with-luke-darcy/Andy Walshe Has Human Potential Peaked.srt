1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:08,759
Andy, I thought of Elon Musk a lot in research for wanting to talk to you.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,980
Actually, behind his desk in his office, there used to be a picture of the Earth, you know,

3
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:13,839
the blue planet.

4
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:17,359
There was a big picture of Mars, and then there was another picture of another blue

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,980
planet, so the red planet, blue planet, and then another.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,399
And I said, hey, what's that?

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,480
And he said, that's Mars when I terraform it.

8
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:27,519
Hello, and welcome to another episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:33,140
At Alita, we are passionate about inspiring connections and creating a world of collaboration.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,479
Our signature program, Alita Connect, curates groups of five to six leaders from diverse

11
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:42,659
backgrounds in sport, industry, social venture, and the arts who come together to learn, to

12
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:43,600
connect, and to collaborate.

13
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,939
Kirsten King, founder of Fluidform Pilates.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,299
It's been amazing.

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,640
Here you are on this Zoom call, feeling within the first session like you intimately know

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,159
these people and care for them, and then all of a sudden realizing that even though you're

17
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,259
in totally different industries, we're all going through the same thing.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,560
Or we've been through it, and we can help each other, or there's just this hurdle that

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:16,239
you can't see past, and then you share it with the group, and there's five answers in

20
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,280
40 minutes, and you think, I have not slept for two weeks thinking about that.

21
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,980
Like, how is this possible?

22
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:27,379
Craig McRae, senior coach of the Collingwood Football Club.

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,500
You're listening to stories and breadcrumbs of what makes success, and I constantly get

24
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,260
something out of these.

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,420
Zoom calls and catch-ups, because we're all living the same stuff, aren't we?

26
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,780
Extraordinary people with extraordinary experience.

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,500
What happens there is magical.

28
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:47,379
The Empowering Leaders podcast is proudly brought to you by Victoria University, where cutting-edge

29

and empower more leaders.

37
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,319
Dr. Andrew Walsh is a globally recognized leader and expert in the field of elite human

38
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,020
performance.

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,500
For over 20 years, has been focused on the goal of demystifying talent by researching

40
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,919
and training individuals and teams across the vast network of world-class programs in

41
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:36,180
sport, culture, military, and business settings.

42
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,319
Dr. Walsh has been the director of high performance for Red Bull, where he worked with hundreds

43
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,680
of international athletes and culture opinion leaders, supervising a team of industry-leading

44
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,979
scientists, engineers, physicians, and technologists to develop and implement elite performance

45
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:51,379
models.

46
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,939
Dr. Walsh was the performance manager for Red Bull Stratos, leading the performance

47
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:02,780
plan for Felix Baumgartner's record-breaking jump to Earth from the stratosphere in 2012.

48
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:08,659
In 2013, Dr. Walsh was awarded the Outstanding Contribution to Performance Innovation Award

49
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:11,599
at the prestigious Leaders in Performance Conference.

50
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,860
Dr. Walsh founded Glimpses, the annual human potential Red Bull conference, which is now

51
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,599
in its third year.

52
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,460
This conference is a two-day symposium that brings together world-class talent to illuminate

53
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,039
our understanding of human potential.

54
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,680
Andy is currently the chief performance officer and founding member of Liminal Collective.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,900
Prior to joining Red Bull, Andy designed a highly successful performance program for

56
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:37,599
the U.S. Olympic ski and snowboard teams, guiding their athletes to victories on the

57
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,300
world stage.

58
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,560
Andy consults directly with numerous organizations and institutions in his field, including the

59
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,039
Armed Forces, Fortune 500 companies, technology companies, artists, and athletes worldwide.

60
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:50,979
Andy, great to spend some time with you.

61
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,419
I've been really looking forward to this conversation.

62
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,360
Yeah, mate.

63
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:53,919
Likewise.

64
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:54,360
Likewise.

65
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,080
A pleasure to be here today.

66
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,180
You hear these incredible stories, Andy, from time to time, where someone might have a loved

67
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,860
one trapped under a car.

68
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:10,180
And they develop what we call superhuman strength, where they're able to lift a one-ton car and

69
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,379
save a wife or a partner or a loved one.

70
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,339
You take them back the next day and they can't move that car a centimeter.

71
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,600
Are we only tapping into a small amount of our own human potential?

72
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:28,620
Put it this way, the way we approach it is that we know so little about the human system

73
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,620
on the scale of sort of knowing how everything works.

74
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,120
How the human mind and body and the spirit all comes together, consciousness.

75
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:41,579
And so relative to what we know, which I think is only in the sort of three or four percent

76
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:48,500
of what's possible, I think the question is, you know, if we did know everything there

77
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,600
is to know about how to bring the best out of a human, what could we possibly do?

78
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,000
And I think that's where we sort of sit.

79
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:59,079
We try and understand as best we can, given all our limitations with the sort of current

80
00:04:59,079 --> 00:04:59,779
knowledge base.

81
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:02,779
And then we try and also look at a human and say, well, there's definitely...

82
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,600
There's definitely some upside.

83
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,680
And how do we bring that to bear in the program when we bring it to the table?

84
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,259
So, yeah, I think, you know, whether it's lifting a car or not, I'm not sure how well

85
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:18,300
that all translates, but the reality is we truly believe there's massive upside in most

86
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,120
people's potential.

87
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,620
And the trick is how to unpack it and get to it so it can become something that they

88
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,839
can develop and train to in a functional way, you know.

89
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,540
Have you got an explanation for that though, Andy?

90
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,899
Because you would have heard the same stories, haven't you, where under those extreme,

91
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,459
extreme situations, humans can do things that there's no way in a normal situation

92
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:38,139
they could.

93
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,620
What happens there?

94
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,139
Where do we channel that ability?

95
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,480
What makes sense of that?

96
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,779
Yeah, there's definitely the extreme scenarios.

97
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,839
I think people surprise themselves in very high stakes, high risk environments and pull

98
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,480
things off.

99
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,399
And it's not just the physical capability.

100
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,879
I think for many of us, it's the combination of just their sort of cognitive capacity,

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,500
their ability to perform in those sort of under pressure.

102
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,459
I also think it happens in play.

103
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,579
Some of the most extraordinary athletic experiences over the years I've seen is when the crew

104
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:12,139
are just out there messing around, playing, you know, they're doing things in sort of

105
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:16,980
the unstructured training that sort of you wish they could deliver in structured times.

106
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,139
I think there's a freedom to it.

107
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,379
So I don't know if the physiology of it is, there's probably something along the lines

108
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:28,000
of, you know, your body has systems or mechanisms in play to protect itself.

109
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,800
But if there's enough, you know, stress or pressure on the system, it can overreact.

110
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,720
It can override some of those systems to do things that are sort of typically not possible.

111
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:41,600
Yeah, I'd be making it up if I went any deeper than that right now, given that's probably

112
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,519
a lecture I did 30 years ago.

113
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,920
But what's extraordinary about it all is those are the sorts of opportunities we look to

114
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:55,319
as sort of our North Stars, whether it's what a potential athlete does on the field of play

115
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,540
or, you know, in practice, what some of the military groups do under high stakes, high

116
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,620
risk environments, what some of the artists are able to pull together.

117
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,899
And without any explanation, we use that as more of a North Star.

118
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,160
We try to say, all right, we're not going to try and even understand it per se, but

119
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,240
it shows us what's possible.

120
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,660
And then we benchmark ourselves against those sort of best practices, if you like.

121
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,480
Andy, I thought of Elon Musk a lot in research for wanting to talk to you and someone who's

122
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:28,860
got a fairly interesting place in the zeitgeist of the world at the moment and talking about

123
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,279
wanting to build a colony on Mars.

124
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,699
And I think the average person thinks that's possibly.

125
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,399
Insane.

126
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,680
But then at the same time, we watch him land SpaceX rockets from outer space back on the

127
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,699
launch pad that they took off from.

128
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:44,620
And no one thought that that was something that was going to be viable.

129
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,980
Is he tapping into some of that human potential that maybe others find hard to access?

130
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,839
Yeah, he's an interesting case study.

131
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:58,360
Actually, behind his desk in his office is, well, there used to be a picture of the Earth,

132
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,740
you know, the blue planet.

133
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,040
There was a big picture of Mars.

134
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,819
And then there was another picture.

135
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,220
There was a picture of another blue planet.

136
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,480
So the red planet, blue planet, and then another.

137
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,300
And I said, hey, what's that?

138
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:09,060
And he said, that's Earth.

139
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,819
That's Mars when I terraform it.

140
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,100
So I think what's interesting is he's got staggering intelligence.

141
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,379
He's obviously very, very, very bright.

142
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,000
He, I think, is unconstrained by what holds a lot of us back.

143
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,160
He backs himself right to the nth degree.

144
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:26,180
So there's a confidence, there's a mindset there.

145
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,160
And I think he's also, in some respects, you know, it can be a positive or negative.

146
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,899
He doesn't really care.

147
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,399
He doesn't really care a lot about other things in some ways.

148
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:41,639
And I think that gives him that sort of space to push hard and beyond and try things.

149
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,860
And he just seems to bring it all together, you know.

150
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:47,059
And, you know, you can argue one way or the other.

151
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:48,399
He does do extraordinary things.

152
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,100
How he does it, you know, maybe not the most empathetic guy on the planet,

153
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,000
but you need it to do what he does.

154
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,259
So that's the staggering thing about some of these amazing performances

155
00:08:57,259 --> 00:08:58,299
that people pull together.

156
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,740
You'd like to think there's a nice model of how it all comes together.

157
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,679
You'd like to think that.

158
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:07,980
And people have had to, you know, realise a higher version of themselves to get it done.

159
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:10,440
But sometimes they're just good at what they're doing

160
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,220
and they pull it off irrespective of, you know, these other factors.

161
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,600
It's interesting, Andy, you referenced that,

162
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,860
is that there's a genius level ability to do something like that,

163
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,360
but maybe another human trait like empathy might be really low.

164
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:28,480
Is that a common thing where, as you just said,

165
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,799
to be able to push through and not care?

166
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,320
Do you do extraordinary things?

167
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,299
Maybe there's a deficiency in one of the other human traits?

168
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,879
Yeah, we're right into it, aren't we?

169
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,919
You know, look, years and years ago when I was early in this stage,

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,659
there was a lot of athletes coming through,

171
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,159
a lot of military community we were working with.

172
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,580
And people would say, well, if they can only fix these other things.

173
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:54,360
And then one of the old trainers said to me at the time, he said,

174
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,919
you know, look, you know, sometimes what's broken is what makes them great.

175
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:01,940
You should be very careful of what you try to fix in some of these people.

176
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,639
And I think, you know,

177
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,580
the easy way to think about that maybe, again,

178
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,700
athletics is probably the easiest model, is, you know,

179
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:15,440
to be very, very good at something, there is a selfishness that's required.

180
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:19,539
You have to put a lot of other things on the backbone to do the amount of work

181
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:21,220
required to get to that level of success.

182
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,019
And sometimes I think it manifests in, you know, let's be very negative,

183
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,299
a narcissistic, self-absorbed nature.

184
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,720
And there's a, you know, I'll say it out loud,

185
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,039
there's a lot of assholes that are really,

186
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,960
really good at what they do, you know.

187
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,340
And it's, I think what's the question that sort of begs to be asked is how do

188
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,679
you want to achieve what you want to achieve?

189
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,580
Is there a part of you as a human that wants to do things well,

190
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,159
but also wants to do them the right way?

191
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,840
It's a more of a philosophical question.

192
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,379
You know, in our business, we don't get to choose, you know,

193
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,039
you work with whomever you get to deal with,

194
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:58,259
but you'd like to think that there's a model where you can be really

195
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,019
extraordinary at something and still be a good person at some,

196
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:06,539
and not to say that that doesn't happen, but, you know,

197
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:08,759
you see both sides of that coin.

198
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,179
Can't help as you're talking, Andy, thinking about what Gar said recently

199
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:15,940
with Dr. Pippa Grange, you might've come across her work,

200
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,360
wrote a great book about fearlessness.

201
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,080
She talks about winning shallow versus winning deep,

202
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,500
which I think is not dissimilar to what you were suggesting there.

203
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,539
There are a couple of ways to go about it.

204
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:29,980
Andy, you're a great student of artificial intelligence,

205
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,679
the world of AI.

206
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,559
And how fast that's moving.

207
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,220
Can I ask you to project forward?

208
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,120
What's our world look like in 20, 30, 50 years?

209
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,500
How big a daily impact is AI going to have on all of our lives?

210
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:48,440
Well, I mean, you really picked some hard ones out today.

211
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,639
I just did a big briefing for the government on some aspects of human

212
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,820
machine teaming, which is sort of the foundation of how we look at it.

213
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,179
How does a human interact with some nascent intelligence,

214
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:01,220
artificial intelligence?

215
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,720
It's pretty, you know, hardware itself.

216
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,440
You know, the conversation is to me right now is I'm very cautious about

217
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,899
predicting anything because it's moving so quickly.

218
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,019
Every time I predicted something, it's happened twice as fast.

219
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:20,039
So I'd say there is going to be, and that's just on the first part,

220
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:26,240
there's going to be an AGI at some form or another, which is a debatable point,

221
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,220
you know, artificial general intelligence, which is smarter than any human has ever

222
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,759
existed.

223
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:36,220
And the culmination of all human knowledge, yeah, most of the machines out

224
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,340
now, right now, they are smarter than most of us already.

225
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,659
So I don't think that's a mute point.

226
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,620
How smart is smart?

227
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,379
It's already part of most people's worlds, even if they're not aware of it.

228
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:49,600
I think it's obviously going to be far more impactful in how it manifests itself.

229
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,940
I think there's a whole bunch of philosophical questions.

230
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,639
The one we're digging deeply into, what does it mean for the human in this

231
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,259
conversation right now?

232
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,620
Most.

233
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:05,539
Most of them are at the level of sort of Einstein, Nobel laureate intelligence.

234
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,340
They'll pass every exam better than us.

235
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,820
They're starting to solve problems we've had no clue of how to solve.

236
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,340
And in fact, there's some recent problems being done where even the developers

237
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,379
working with the AI can't figure out how it actually solved the problem.

238
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:23,000
So it's already manifesting itself as a level of intelligence, which is beyond

239
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,500
most of our comprehensions.

240
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,240
So what does that mean for us as humans is that I think it's, it's, it's as two

241
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,600
sides.

242
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,440
There's obviously the.

243
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,000
What do you do with the smartest intelligence that's ever been created in your

244
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,240
pocket, which I think provides the idea.

245
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,360
Well, my take my job or all the rest of it, there's a fear side of it, but there's

246
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,960
also the opportunistic side, which is what would you do if you were sitting in a room

247
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,980
of the brightest and best minds in the world and all the cumulative knowledge of

248
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,659
the world, could you bring yourself to bear in such a way that you could get the

249
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:57,940
most out of that conversation?

250
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,139
That's what we're seeing a lot of.

251
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:04,580
We're seeing that most people are using AI to simplify sort of mundane tasks right

252
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:11,980
now, versus using AI to actually explore the edges of what's possible and ask the

253
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,179
deep, deep questions.

254
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:18,080
And so, yeah, challenge your listeners, go out and ask AI, sort of give it a proxy,

255
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,539
give it a, you know, ask AI, take on the role of a God and ask the question of the

256
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:24,519
AI, what are, what are humans missing?

257
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:25,600
What is there a God?

258
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,159
What's the meaning of life?

259
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,960
Ask it really, really deep.

260
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,100
Philosophical questions.

261
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,039
And you'll be blown away by the answers it pushes back at you.

262
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:38,320
So I think that whether you default to, it's going to be a good or bad thing.

263
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,000
That's a, that's a TBD.

264
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,419
I think the question more appropriately for us right now is how are you going to

265
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,519
show up to that partnership?

266
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,639
How do you bring your best self to that conversation?

267
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:56,759
So when you're sitting down with the all knowing entity, whatever it is, can you

268
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,100
imagine near what's possible?

269
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,799
And there's a.

270
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,620
There's a clip we've been using for many years as part of a creativity training program

271
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,919
we use and we've developed.

272
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:06,960
It's got Ray Charles as it's sitting in front of a computer, his piano.

273
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,799
And he makes it very clear.

274
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,279
He says, there's everything in the piano that you can ever imagine.

275
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:17,379
You can never bring the piano to its knees as I think is the exact language.

276
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,600
And what he's speaking to is this idea that to get the most out of the piano, you have

277
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,919
to imagine it first.

278
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,740
And I think the skill that everybody should be focusing on right now in this conversation is how do I

279
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:34,600
bring my imagineering, my creativity and of course, some of the other human qualities of courage,

280
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,559
empathy and compassion.

281
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:41,659
But fundamentally, how do I bring my imagineering or creativity or level where I can get the most out of

282
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:42,179
the machine?

283
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:47,000
That's a that's a much different conversation to be having than, you know, what's it going to do to me?

284
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,600
Long answer.

285
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,139
Sorry for that.

286
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:50,360
But it's a brilliant answer.

287
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:55,100
It's a brilliant answer, Andy, because I think that's your world is an unlocking human potential.

288
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,620
And I love the way you describe that as this partnership with this entity.

289
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:58,720
Yeah.

290
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:04,139
We've been talking about this, you know, the role of intelligence and we know already from chat,

291
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,740
GEBT has put it front of mind for all of us.

292
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,779
Everyone's probably had a play at least with that and come back with these things that blow you away and

293
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:14,480
how quickly the language and how good the language is.

294
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,559
But as you say, potentially, the human part is going to be more important, isn't it?

295
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,259
How do you show up with empathy?

296
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:21,659
How do you ask the right questions?

297
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:23,860
How do you interact with other humans?

298
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,379
Do you think it almost amplifies those ancient skills?

299
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:28,620
I hear you talk about ancient skills a lot.

300
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:34,000
almost more important now in this new world of ai we talked about this human machine paradise we

301
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,399
could see the technology racing and i was privy to some of the government stuff here without working

302
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,080
on some really bleeding edge tech and you can see that everybody could get their heads around it

303
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,679
there's a plan there's a technology there's a faster chip a faster gpu whatever it may be a

304
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:55,059
bigger computer but it was very clear that the human sort of plan for the human wasn't quite

305
00:16:55,059 --> 00:17:00,620
as considered in that equation as equally and so we called it the human machine paradox with this

306
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,519
evolution of the machine to this you know let's go to artificial super intelligence like

307
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,440
a way of thinking and comprehension that's beyond our current world of thinking

308
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:17,180
then what's the humans what's the the opportunity for the paradox is with this massive tech is we

309
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,440
can double down on those things that make us truly human which is kind of where we started is

310
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,779
think about courage empathy compassion creativity

311
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:25,039
imagination

312
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:33,839
wisdom those are the things that the machine is at this point in time is not as well designed to

313
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,680
move through and so bringing those skills to the forefront is all we focus on in our high

314
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,019
performance training now for our highest teams our biggest most highest performing communities

315
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:47,779
it's literally look the machine's got you on everything else let's focus on being humans

316
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:54,059
more humans like a better coach you know there's no keeping up with the machine now it's got you

317
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:54,779
and knowledge

318
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:59,440
you know knowledge for all intents and purposes as a commodity is going to be worth worthless

319
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,220
in the next few years like it's going to have a value proposition trending to zero because it's

320
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:10,099
everywhere everybody's got the smartest machine in the world in their fingers or their fingertips

321
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:14,099
getting back to that conversation the paradox is it allows us to develop our skills that were

322
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:18,599
probably in some ways less refined in the last couple hundred years because we've been so focused

323
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:23,559
on the other side of the equation and i think what it really boils down to is we start to hit this

324
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:24,759
space where i think we're going to be able to do something that's going to be more efficient and

325
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:27,339
more efficient than what we think i think the bigger question on the table it's not about does

326
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:33,039
i take my work job or work or how does it it doesn't make my life easier it's it's it fundamentally

327
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:39,180
challenges our purpose it's you know if knowledge is no longer a differentiator in the in the

328
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:45,480
equation um it's you know humans value a lot of the idea of relevance based on what they know

329
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:52,079
who they are um and if it does surpass us in sort of creation and intuition and and logic

330
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,619
you've got to start to confront a world where

331
00:18:54,779 --> 00:19:00,259
our reason for being is no longer self-evident you know you start to hit this space where

332
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:05,380
what am i doing here you know and i think this is really meaning and purpose is foundational to

333
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:12,779
those ancient sort of communities and and and and ways of being i think really is the bigger threat

334
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:17,599
that i see coming down the pipeline i can't remember who it was it was recently i was listening

335
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:23,039
to some real genius in this space not me they basically were saying this future you know your

336
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,759
choices are do we end up being just pets and we're not going to be able to do anything about it

337
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:28,180
so we just this everything's being done everything's being solved all the questions and

338
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,299
answers you end up being like a lab you run outside every day and you're happy you just

339
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:35,819
run around playing in the yard i kind of was someone very very smart i'm not doing a good

340
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:40,240
job of interpreting but that's fundamentally what they said so i think thinking about your

341
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,099
role in this sort of future state is going to be an interesting conversation and we're about

342
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:49,440
the human side of it so for us tripling down our biggest programs like i said running creativity

343
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,759
leadership imagineering developing character virtue justice prudence

344
00:19:54,779 --> 00:20:00,000
empathy that's the differentiator for us and funnily enough the best programs in the world

345
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,180
have always done a lot of that they're just now being i think realizing that that's where most of

346
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:10,140
the bang for your buck's going to be had such a fascinating conversation andy and i my mind goes

347
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,779
to the sporting field probably where i spent a lot of my life and you're already seeing it in my

348
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:19,819
view that the the new generation of coaches are incredibly empathetic they talk about love

349
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:24,619
in sport that would no one would ever said that 30 years ago about love for their

350
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:30,480
foots and they're they're doubling down tripling down as you said on the connection point and the

351
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,619
connection within the team because you're probably right all of the tech advantages and the training

352
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:40,200
advantages are going to be a moot point at some that because of where we're headed with that so

353
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,140
it's already happening in in real time you've explained that in a fascinating way i've got to

354
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,920
ask you about red bull stratus and you're the performance manager for that uh billy's

355
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,759
baumgartner's record-breaking jump to earth can you take us behind the scenes

356
00:20:54,779 --> 00:21:00,279
on on that one it was such an unbelievable moment uh the genesis of it and what it was

357
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:04,799
like working on that project yeah it was an extraordinary project i mean and it comes back

358
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,240
to what we're talking about it was fundamentally the dream of felix you know he had an old picture

359
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,960
of himself i think he drew it when he was like five years old jumping off the back of his house

360
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,160
with a parachute something he drew it that's kindergarten or at school and you know i think

361
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:24,500
he'd always had this idea of being sort of doing the pushing the edges of that sort of skydiving

362
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:32,720
space jumping world so the genesis of the project was his idea now he'd seen uh the earlier versions

363
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:40,140
of the of the program so when you look at the sort of genesis of the space program in the u.s

364
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:45,359
there's i think there's a documentary called the first astronauts when the colonel joe kittinger

365
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,839
they were basically going up to see if you could even handle being at that altitude and a bunch of

366
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:54,759
guys got out in the desert here and in new mexico i think and strapped joe's

367
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:58,779
strapped himself to a balloons went up and jumped off it i think he got around a hundred thousand

368
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:03,359
feet and that was done in the 50s so they were the testing the preciousness of the space suits

369
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:09,240
if you like so i think he saw that um and then realized that it hadn't been revisited and wanted

370
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,940
to break that record so that was the genesis of the idea and that was sort of rebel at its best

371
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:19,400
the best talent in the world telling you what was the next best thing um and then just working on

372
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,019
the project itself was just an extraordinary uh privilege to be

373
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:31,420
connected to at that time that community that was sort of aging out of the space where so the

374
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:36,099
mercury program the polar program a bunch of aerospace engineers and flight test engineers and

375
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:43,119
test pilots who had all matured and retired and rebel we we couldn't afford to go to the

376
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:48,920
lockheeds or the raytheons or the northrop's and nasa and hire the current talent so we got all

377
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,779
this sort of called the old stuff as if compared to the old right stuff we used to call them

378
00:22:54,779 --> 00:23:00,440
they would sit around and every evening after you know days of testing we'd go down to the local

379
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,380
we're in new mexico in roswell area 51 up the road the whole thing was surreal in that regard

380
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:12,660
um and roswell has its alien sort of historical sort of narrative going around it and they would

381
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:17,920
sit around they'd get a couple of margaritas into them and they'd start to talk about how they

382
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:24,200
developed all the tech and all the things you see in the movies through those 60s and 70s and 80s and

383
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:32,279
just staggering to see what again people could achieve given yeah given permission the funding

384
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:36,740
and some imagination and the ideas that they were generating at that time

385
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:42,759
really caught my attention and i think that's when i started to see this sort of narrative and

386
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:49,079
of how much upside and opportunity there is in bringing that right mindset to those sort of

387
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:54,440
big bold and what you call a moonshot endeavor and i think the moonshot endeavor is

388
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:59,539
is really an underplayed aspect of i think we've lost a lot of those skills in the current sort of

389
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:03,440
world where we look at incremental gains and return on investment and all the rest of it but

390
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,079
it's it was their imaginations and what they were able to achieve during that time and

391
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,880
and funnily enough that was where the human machine paradox narrative was born because

392
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,880
with all the tech and all the geniuses and 200 300 people around and you know felix fundamentally

393
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,519
had his own personal challenges that we'd sort of lost in the mix and what that sort of brought

394
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:30,859
up when he had his well sort of documented issues around getting into the suit and getting in doing

395
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:36,440
the job and so it required us going back to very simple premises of how do you how do you want to

396
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,119
be remember what's your legacy here what's who who are you what do you want to stand for so

397
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:45,839
it was really a massive education at the end of the day for me and a privilege to spend time with

398
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:51,819
those that community uh again it's it's just staggering what they're able to achieve during

399
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:54,700
that sort of year of the space program at test

400
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:59,599
platform that the u.s government had running at that time can i ask you a little bit more on on

401
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:05,079
felix because i i got a fear of heights when i climb a ladder and i look at that and my heart

402
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:10,420
rate goes to max velocity just looking at the vision of it yeah then today as you said it

403
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:15,460
might be this dream but you still got to get to outer space and jump i mean were there moments

404
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:22,299
where he thought hey this is this is crazy i can't do it or was he focused all the way did

405
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:24,680
he go up and down at all no look he was a

406
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:29,140
base jumper so fundamentally base jumping you may remember some of those famous pictures of him

407
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:34,200
the christ statue in rio where he's standing on the hand and he jumps off i think some of the

408
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,660
things that became more more obvious is when you're doing it and as a base jumper you know

409
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,660
you're not obviously not going to be afraid of heights in fact the the world comes at you very

410
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,799
quickly from those lower altitudes so in some respects you are disconnected once you get to

411
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,980
skydiving and above because you're so far away from the earth that you don't see it coming so

412
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,759
to speak i think one of the things he shared

413
00:25:54,779 --> 00:26:00,859
with us was that he had always you know base jumping is a solo for the most part solo career

414
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:07,099
you have yourself you have usually someone you're paying to pay the bills and uh yeah usually you

415
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:11,039
know maybe someone to run the getaway car when you land because for the most part there it's an

416
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:18,079
illegal jump you know jump off a building in the city off the statue so when you get thrown into

417
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:23,359
this sort of community of several hundred people who are working together the sort of pressure on

418
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:29,559
because you're sort of leading the fact and uh there was a combination i think of him just being

419
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:34,460
amongst a larger community of people that he he wasn't able to control everything at this point

420
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,859
now you're in the hands of others which is a big thing to shift from when you're doing your own

421
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:43,339
single base jump you're packing your own chute you're checking everything you're the one in

422
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:48,859
charge and you're the one who is responsible and i think that on its own right sort of manifests

423
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:53,339
in many ways and then also those suits those pressure suits that you see the astronauts wear

424
00:26:54,779 --> 00:27:02,160
it's you know you've got to you know just to stop you getting the bends basically you got to sit

425
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,940
there and breathe oxygen up for a couple of hours before you actually go up in the thing so you're

426
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,960
breathing pure oxygen sitting in a room by yourself with the helmet it's all locked up

427
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:15,420
you can't you can't open it once the process starts and it's it's claustrophobic and so i

428
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:19,339
think that in some respects was maybe a manifestation of that broader pressure on his

429
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:24,480
shoulders and so he struggled so that sort of inoculation of one minute in the suit two minutes

430
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:29,180
five minutes of the suit etc etc got him over the line but i think it was also he started to grow

431
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:33,779
and and face these fears and he openly publicly admitted them and i think that gave him the

432
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:39,000
confidence to start to step into that leadership role as well so that you know these are two things

433
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,319
are probably a hundred things that were happening at the time but these are things that from a

434
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:48,140
personal perspective i could observe and see in him changing and uh again you get up to the edge

435
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:53,839
of space there's still no guarantee it's going to work and even the fact that he was going to break

436
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:54,720
the speed of sound

437
00:27:54,779 --> 00:28:00,779
outside of a machine outside of a plane or a rocket there were people sending us letters saying

438
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:05,680
that you know he's going to die when that he breaks the speed of sound so not we've done the

439
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,200
math the math didn't add up in fact and we also had some old test pilots who had ejected above

440
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,299
the speed of sound so we knew that you could survive that but um the reality was it was still

441
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:21,140
a you know it was a it was a risk and you know that's part of the doing the doing to try and

442
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,759
control as much as you can control and then doing the preparation and

443
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:30,220
training to make sure you you don't um you know you're if things do go wrong you've got at least a

444
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:35,640
backup plan it's an amazing story isn't it i i feel like i could sit in a space suit and breathe

445
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,400
in some oxygen put me in the plane and i'm in real real trouble it's fascinating and as you

446
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,359
described suddenly you've got a couple hundred people and you're the leader of that team it's

447
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:52,019
a different perspective it's a different game yeah yeah a different game yeah we all are born different

448
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:52,619
oh

449
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:52,859
oh

450
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:53,660
oh

451
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:53,700
oh

452
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:53,720
oh

453
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:53,740
oh

454
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:53,759
oh

455
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:53,779
oh

456
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:53,799
oh

457
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:53,819
oh

458
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:53,839
oh

459
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:53,859
oh

460
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:53,900
oh

461
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,119
oh

462
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:54,140
oh

463
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,579
oh

464
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:54,759
oh

465
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:55,279
oh

466
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:55,299
oh

467
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:55,920
that's

468
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:03,900
one of the most important things about what

469
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:13,799
being a

470
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,859
student

471
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:17,240
is

472
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,819
is

473
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:21,900
uh

474
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,279
uh

475
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:25,319
uh

476
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:28,859
to move from Iraq when I was six years old because of the war. When we went to Jordan,

477
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,119
we just applied for a visa to come to Australia. Thank God we got it. And we came here and

478
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:40,480
I'm loving it so far. So the course on studying gives me the opportunity to study many other

479
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,200
pathways and it gives me the opportunity to choose whatever I want. It opens so many places

480
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,539
for me.

481
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,900
At Alita, our signature program, Alita Connect, is something we're really passionate and proud

482
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,779
of. We bring together groups of five to six people around the globe from diverse backgrounds,

483
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,359
sport, industry, social venture and the arts. We come together to learn, to connect and

484
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:01,819
to collaborate.

485
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,180
Liz Ellis, Australian netball icon and television presenter.

486
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:10,420
The thing that I've loved about it is not just the meetings that we have with our group,

487
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:14,700
it's the thinking that you do the days and days afterwards. Someone says something and

488
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,200
it sparks a thought and within my sport and within women's sport, I'm just someone who

489
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,740
I try to lead by keeping people talking.

490
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,980
About the issues. There's times when I think the person I'm trying to convince is not listening

491
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,839
to me. It actually got me thinking about this is how I need to address my communication

492
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:32,839
with them. So it was, I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it.

493
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,539
A lot of people listening to this, Andy, will be interested in developing themselves and

494
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:43,980
they'll be listening to you. But what would you disseminate for people? What's the highest

495
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:49,019
impact you can do from what you've witnessed in unlocking human potential for someone driving

496
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:51,720
their car today, they're listening. What should people do?

497
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,839
To develop themselves and have a great life.

498
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:00,220
Yeah, a great life. Maybe that's fairly beyond my realm, but to help develop themselves,

499
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:06,599
I think is, for me, what it boils down to, what we've seen, I'll just speak to the experiences.

500
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,779
Everyone's journey is different. So what does that mean? It means that there's no one way

501
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:17,839
to do this. And I think people tend to get a little bit, throw a little added pressure

502
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:21,440
on themselves when they're starting to think about, I want to improve that. And they suddenly

503
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:21,859
get this.

504
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,960
It's this sort of idea that they're measuring up against others. And I think the challenge

505
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,920
is that you've got to, first and foremost, learn to be very patient and kind with yourself.

506
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:36,119
There's no roadmap for you. There's a road that you can listen to a lot of people who

507
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:41,079
have done things. And we say, sure, go and watch the best soldiers, athletes, business

508
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:46,319
leaders, creative artists, musicians, study the hell out of them. But there's no roadmap

509
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:50,039
for you. So you have to be very kind.

510
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:50,160
Yeah.

511
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,220
Yeah.

512
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:50,240
Yeah.

513
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:50,259
Yeah.

514
00:31:50,259 --> 00:31:50,279
Yeah.

515
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:50,299
Yeah.

516
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:50,319
Yeah.

517
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:50,359
Yeah.

518
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:50,400
Yeah.

519
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:50,420
Yeah.

520
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:50,440
Yeah.

521
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:50,500
Yeah.

522
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:50,599
Yeah.

523
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:50,660
Yeah.

524
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:50,720
Yeah.

525
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:50,799
Yeah.

526
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:50,839
Yeah.

527
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:50,880
Yeah.

528
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,880
Yeah.

529
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,039
Yeah.

530
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:52,059
Yeah.

531
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:52,099
Yeah.

532
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:52,140
Yeah.

533
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:52,160
Yeah.

534
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,180
Yeah.

535
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:52,200
Yeah.

536
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,220
Yeah.

537
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:52,240
Yeah.

538
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,259
Yeah.

539
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:52,279
Yeah.

540
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:52,299
Yeah.

541
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:52,319
Yeah.

542
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:52,339
Yeah.

543
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:52,359
Yeah.

544
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:52,660
Yeah.

545
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:52,680
Yeah.

546
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:52,740
Yeah.

547
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:52,759
Yeah.

548
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:52,779
Yeah.

549
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:52,799
Yeah.

550
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:52,859
Yeah.

551
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:52,880
Yeah.

552
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:52,920
Yeah.

553
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:52,940
Yeah.

554
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:52,960
Yeah.

555
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:52,980
Yeah.

556
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,000
Yeah.

557
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,059
Yeah.

558
00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:53,119
Yeah.

559
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:53,160
Yeah.

560
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,180
Yeah.

561
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:53,200
Yeah.

562
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,220
Yeah.

563
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:53,240
Yeah.

564
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:53,279
Yeah.

565
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:53,299
Yeah.

566
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:53,359
Yeah.

567
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:53,400
Yeah.

568
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:53,460
Yeah.

569
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:53,480
Yeah.

570
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:53,519
Yeah.

571
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:53,559
Yeah.

572
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:53,579
Yeah.

573
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:53,660
Yeah.

574
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:53,720
Yeah.

575
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:53,759
Yeah.

576
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:53,799
Yeah.

577
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:53,859
Yeah.

578
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:53,920
Yeah.

579
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:53,960
Yeah.

580
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,000
Yeah.

581
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:10,079
Yeah.

582
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:15,920
that works, good, keep it. If it doesn't work, try something else. And using that sort of iterative

583
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:24,960
model of trying, learning, shifting, adjusting. And then I think, you know, the first step in all

584
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,019
that is that requires a pretty deep level of self-awareness. You've got to understand yourself

585
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:35,440
first. So you've got to develop an understanding of what's your triggers, what motivates you,

586
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,259
what scares you. You've got to build your own personal interoceptiveness, you know, understand

587
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:44,819
as things are happening, what triggers you. Now, then you can start to look at some of the tools

588
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:49,099
that people have sort of practiced over the years. By copying the best, you'll probably find a few

589
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:53,460
shortcuts. You'll find some paths that have been trodden and you can use those, but you've

590
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:59,579
really, really got to, you know, give it your best shot, put your best foot forward out there,

591
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:05,000
and then really learn for yourself what works and doesn't work. And it can be anything from

592
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,420
benefits to success.

593
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,180
a better parent or a better athlete or a better, you know, leader,

594
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,960
you've got to start to craft your own narrative.

595
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,299
And as you craft your own narrative, allow yourself to make those mistakes

596
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:19,480
so that you can push it forward.

597
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:23,839
That's another great human answer, Andy, and I love it from someone

598
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:27,140
who's been at the cutting edge of elite performance.

599
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,160
I've got the sporting lens on again.

600
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,259
I look at the number one draft picked in the NBA a few years ago,

601
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:37,140
the French seven-foot-four freak of an athlete, Victor Wimbanyana.

602
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,779
It looks like he's landed from outer space.

603
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,200
You're not supposed to be able to run and move at that height

604
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,460
and the way that he does.

605
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,019
And again, I project forward and I think it is human potential.

606
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:51,680
You know, 100 years ago, there weren't athletes like that.

607
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:54,940
50 years ago, 10 years ago, where does it end up, Andy?

608
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,240
I think every time we think on any level that we've reached a limit,

609
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,240
whether it's a career or a career, it's a career.

610
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,259
It's a career.

611
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:03,900
It's a machine or a human, whatever.

612
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,059
It just, in a few years, we look back and go, wow,

613
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,860
someone's taken that next step.

614
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,940
Victor is an interesting case.

615
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,139
He's an extraordinary athlete.

616
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,039
I know him well, the program well, because of the relationship I've had

617
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,320
with the Spurs for many years.

618
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,780
They were lucky to get him in the draft.

619
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:28,300
And, you know, he's just reimagined what's possible at seven-foot-four.

620
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,800
You know, it's like he moves in a way that you're just like,

621
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,159
that shouldn't be physically.

622
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,780
So, what's wonderful about that idea is that I think it just shows you

623
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,820
that there's no, again, what we just said, there's no right or wrong in this.

624
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:43,920
There's opportunities and there's ways to reimagine what's possible.

625
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,760
And if you're courageous enough to have a go, put yourself out there

626
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,440
a little bit, you might find yourself stumbling into a new way of being.

627
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:54,960
And I think you can stand on the, like he is, the shoulders of everyone

628
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,820
that's been before you.

629
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,260
He shoots like, you know, almost like Steph.

630
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,880
He moves like a Jordan in his, you know.

631
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,260
And he's a good kid, too.

632
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,320
He's a really good kid.

633
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:10,099
So, you know, that's the wonderful idea about working in human performance

634
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:12,159
is that there's never any end game.

635
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,659
You're always, you never quite reach the finish line.

636
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:21,019
And I think now where it's going to go is I think you'll see more

637
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:26,500
and more intelligence solving the problems that we've dealt with for years

638
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,880
around how do humans do what they do.

639
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,519
And we'll understand more and more.

640
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:31,519
And I think that's the big.

641
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,699
Frontier that'll be cracked pretty quickly here through the next gen

642
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:41,260
platforms, quantum AI, artificial super intelligence, where we will start

643
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,019
to understand how the brain works really well.

644
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:44,260
So we'll have a lot more answers.

645
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,199
So I think you'll start to see some acceleration of capabilities.

646
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:51,199
That's my prediction is you'll start to see humans developing skills and the

647
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,260
things because our understanding improves in ways we can't imagine right now.

648
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,480
So, yeah, I don't think there's any limit to it.

649
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:01,780
Uh, at some point you're probably going to start to shift into where it gets

650
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:06,579
really esoteric, some fume of, uh, uh, synthetic consciousness from the

651
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:10,059
platforms and humans uploading their brain, you know, all that sort of stuff.

652
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:15,519
I think that's more ahead of us sooner than we imagined, but probably

653
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:17,440
still, yeah, maybe 10, 20 years out.

654
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,400
We'll see.

655
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,400
Andy, you, you described before that there's no roadmap given to you when

656
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,039
you're born and this is how you, you, you win and you never get the path of it.

657
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:30,639
You can, as you described before, there's maybe some shortcuts from others.

658
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:31,659
And we, we love this saying.

659
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:35,920
It's success leaves clues and we see these patterns of what successful people

660
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,599
do, whether they be artists or sports people or business leaders or, um, people

661
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,659
who've unlocked human potential like you have, uh, this idea of self-leadership

662
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:48,760
is where we start as, and I want to ask you the question, how do you make

663
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,199
sure that you're feeling your best?

664
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:53,280
What do you do so that you can lead others effectively yourself?

665
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:58,719
For me and, you know, I think it's just by default, I get to spend time in

666
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:01,360
these communities of extraordinary people.

667
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,500
So the, I think what I have to always bear in mind is as much as I think I've

668
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,619
known that there's still so much more.

669
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:14,500
So as a leader, I, I sort of focus on the, on the openness, like I'm open to anything.

670
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,960
I'll, I'll take a call on the craziest stuff and just try and

671
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,719
learn and continuously learn.

672
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:26,719
But I'm also humble, uh, in that I try to stick to the humility of it by recognizing

673
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:29,019
that there is much more to be, to know.

674
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:31,300
And, and, and that keeps me sort of hungry to learn.

675
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,539
More, uh, you know, and then from a leadership perspective, just as you,

676
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:39,699
especially as you get older, like one of my great mentors, Peter Reyes, and so

677
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,579
you surround yourself with people you love, admire and respect and, you know,

678
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,440
and that's, you know, the opposite is that the no dickhead rule, I think more

679
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,659
and more as you, as you embarking on these sort of bigger, broader, more, you

680
00:37:52,659 --> 00:37:55,900
know, challenging programs, the more you can do that, the better.

681
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,960
So I sort of think you're keeping it that simple for me right now.

682
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:00,639
It's sort of where it's at, you know?

683
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,340
And if I.

684
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,719
If I, you find yourself getting very frustrated and, and even myself personally getting sort

685
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:10,179
of caught up in just the overwhelming pace of things right now.

686
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,239
So that's where I think it's also really important to give yourself space.

687
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:19,219
And that comes back to the creativity side that I think you got to give your brain and

688
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:26,119
your body time to connect back and recovery, regeneration, or walk in nature, whatever

689
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:26,599
it takes.

690
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:30,559
But those are the things that I think we're, we're, we, we, we really have to value more

691
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,059
nowadays.

692
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,920
Given the pace of the, of the way that things are moving and the way of the world right

693
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,900
now, for one matter.

694
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:40,719
Andy, what's the one piece of leadership advice that you pass on the most?

695
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,460
It comes back to that, you know, you've got to sort yourself out first.

696
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,940
You're going to, you're going to look at, look at the world and understand that, you

697
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:54,719
know, before you can sort of have impact on others, you sort of have to sort of know yourself

698
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:59,980
deeply and understand that, that, and that across all the, all your strengths and all

699
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,539
your weaknesses.

700
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:03,420
And just getting, you know, no one's perfect by any means.

701
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,460
And knowing that allows you then, I think, to be more receptive, to be able to sort of

702
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,940
listen and learn from others.

703
00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:11,320
So I think that's the biggest part.

704
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:16,159
I say people get, get the sense of self first before you start to try and move into the

705
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:17,039
sort of the role.

706
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,440
And then I think being very, very open for me is one of the things like, how do you,

707
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,360
how do you bring your imagineering forward in such a way that sort of is inspiring to

708
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,260
others is probably the other thing I share a lot of.

709
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:30,420
Andy, in terms of vision.

710
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:34,639
We think about it in the sense, it's one thing to have a vision, but as you described

711
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:39,920
before, then trying to get a couple of hundred people on board with that same vision, you've

712
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,360
been on teams that have achieved remarkable things.

713
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:48,780
How do you get people together and with a common vision?

714
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,139
What's, what's the skill with that?

715
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,260
Oh, there's a lot to it.

716
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:58,500
I think what's really where I find the most fun in this space is getting the really bold

717
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,059
visions out.

718
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:00,519
Like shoot for the moon.

719
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:06,539
Like what I've learned over the years is that if the bolder and more, more challenging

720
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:10,780
and more imaginative, the vision, the easier it is to get people on board.

721
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,340
It's like, I think everybody's looking for a bit of inspiration.

722
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:18,340
And if you can come up with something, that's, it's just the beyond what most people are

723
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:18,900
thinking about.

724
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,260
For me, that's the first step being really bold in that vision, then attracts the kinds

725
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,500
of people that I think that at least I like to work with.

726
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:29,559
So I think that's the important part.

727
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:30,500
I think there's always this.

728
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:32,260
There's always an element of sales in it.

729
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,460
If you want to get down to the nitty gritty, you've got to be able to, in our creative

730
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:40,099
process, training, basically, you've got to come up with the idea, but the next sort

731
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:41,659
of thing is you've got to sell the vision.

732
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,800
You, you, you actually have to get people on board and that can be really hard and challenging

733
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,139
if you are shooting for the moon, because most of the time, what you're saying and what

734
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:55,599
you're, you're speaking to is sounds incredulous or unbelievable.

735
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,059
And it's very easy for people to shoot you down.

736
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,519
So you've got to, you've got to, you've got to, you've got to, you've got to, you've

737
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,420
got to get some people on board, you've got to, you've got to, you've got to get some

738
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:01,780
people on board.

739
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:01,920
And, you've got to, you've got to, you've got to, you've got to, you've got to have

740
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,099
the team.

741
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:07,739
I think it's, it's the hardest part to manifest its courage, maybe not in the classical sense,

742
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:12,199
but in the idea of putting yourself out there with an idea that for the most part, people

743
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,739
thinks stupid or crazy.

744
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:17,079
And then when you, like they say, the pioneers get the arrows, the settlers

745
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:17,840
get the land.

746
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,699
So you've got to be prepared to take a few later.

747
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:21,500
You've got to take a few shots in the back.

748
00:41:22,539 --> 00:41:25,179
Um, you know, that's my, that's my simple version of that.

749
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:29,679
So a great bit of wisdom, isn't I love what you said that sometimes the bolder, the vision,

750
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:30,380
the easier.

751
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:36,019
it is to get people to fold in behind it and there's a great lesson in that for sure today

752
00:41:36,019 --> 00:41:41,019
we see curiosity comes up a lot with successful people annie and i want to ask you is there a

753
00:41:41,019 --> 00:41:45,539
latest rabbit hole you've gone down where something's piqued your curiosity and it's

754
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:52,719
taking you down a path on any uh particular idea i'm very curious that's probably one of my

755
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:58,780
defining characteristics the rabbit hole i'm in right now is a combination of technologies and

756
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:04,420
insights and most of it around the brain we're working on a cognitive warrior program for the

757
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:08,920
for the u.s government and what we don't know about the brain is first and foremost

758
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,639
mind-blowing like people say this say that and then you look at the numbers and you're like this

759
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:19,500
we really have no clue but what's the rabbit hole i'm into right now is this combination of

760
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:24,420
i can't even do it justice there's a new sort of realm of the science of photons and measuring

761
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,659
light photons that are emitted from the brain during different brain states so

762
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:28,760
you

763
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,900
senses that you can put above you they can actually look at your skull and tell you how

764
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:37,159
you think and what you're thinking and then i'm doing a really bad job and then in parallel to

765
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:43,579
that the mechanoreceptors on the cells of the brain being triggering mrna adjustments and

766
00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:48,880
messenger adjustments in the brain or in any cell for that matter based on sound and vibration

767
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:54,000
and i love the two of those things because it goes back to that ancient wisdom concept they're

768
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,659
finally getting our science to a level of showing that wow we like to

769
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:04,260
body response to sound music like go figure but we've known it for centuries but now they're

770
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:12,059
figuring out the math and there's a whole quantum uh computing side to that that's emerging to be

771
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:17,500
able to help maybe solve some of these questions and that's getting us into this idea of you know

772
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:23,039
again back to the machine this sort of artificial consciousness you know synthetic consciousness what

773
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:28,579
what it is and the question so that's the rabbit hole i've been buried in the last few days because

774
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:32,400
So we're trying to figure out how to bring the performer of the past,

775
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:34,699
especially the athletic performer, the military performer.

776
00:43:35,539 --> 00:43:38,719
A lot of the work was done on obviously the physical side,

777
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:42,420
your world, train and run them, see who's the toughest.

778
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,900
The cognitive warrior, the cognitive knowledge worker,

779
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,739
the cognitive performer is now all our focus.

780
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,420
And we really don't have much of a bag of tricks for the brain.

781
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,340
When it boils, like if I was training you,

782
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,440
I could run you up and down the hill a few times, you'll get fitter.

783
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,219
And you pick up some heavy rocks, you'll get stronger.

784
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:00,079
We got you.

785
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,900
You really said, what can I do specifically for you to make you think faster,

786
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:07,460
perform better, be more creative?

787
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,719
It's a much more complex problem.

788
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:13,039
And so cracking that code is where we're focused right now.

789
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:17,760
I got no answers for you, mate, but I definitely got down a rabbit hole there.

790
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,460
Well, that was a great rabbit hole and probably where all the gains are,

791
00:44:20,539 --> 00:44:20,760
aren't they?

792
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:26,239
And the athletes, performers, artists, business people that tap into that

793
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,980
are the ones that tend to do things that, but as you said,

794
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:32,119
it's not a simple answer as to how to coach that.

795
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:35,539
Or as you just described, it's fascinating.

796
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,079
Artificial consciousness is just a wild concept in itself.

797
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:44,079
And that's where some of the community we're with,

798
00:44:44,179 --> 00:44:47,360
it's where they're spending all their time on this idea of cracking that code

799
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,900
and synthetic consciousness.

800
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:53,179
And there's little, you read these little articles like recently,

801
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,059
I think it was Sam Altman and the group,

802
00:44:56,059 --> 00:44:57,800
I think it was out of their office.

803
00:44:58,039 --> 00:44:58,639
You may see them.

804
00:44:58,739 --> 00:44:59,780
I see this stuff so much.

805
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,820
I can't pinpoint it.

806
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,960
So hopefully I'm not misquoting somebody, but it was fundamentally,

807
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,619
there was a few things that are happening.

808
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,719
And when this one caught my attention was they realized there's code in the

809
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:13,260
learning and the neural networks that was wrong.

810
00:45:14,139 --> 00:45:17,099
And, you know, that's where you get the, you know, the bad,

811
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:20,320
the bad responses, you get the hallucinations in the, in the AI.

812
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:25,900
And so they put in code to go and find the bad bits,

813
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,139
the bad bits of learning.

814
00:45:27,139 --> 00:45:28,840
And now I'm really getting out of my wheelhouse.

815
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:33,400
But, and then what they found was that the machine itself was trying to hide

816
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,739
its mistakes from the other code that was being put.

817
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,500
So you started to get into this narrative of what,

818
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,039
what the hell is actually happening and you get a sense of it.

819
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,059
Type into your chat.

820
00:45:43,539 --> 00:45:45,019
What are you most afraid of us?

821
00:45:45,019 --> 00:45:46,960
The machine, that question, see what it spits out.

822
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,420
You'll get some answers that get you thinking a little bit.

823
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:50,920
Fascinating.

824
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,679
We love this quote, Andy, the cost of leadership is time.

825
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:54,980
How do you juggle?

826
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,119
Yeah.

827
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:55,280
Yeah.

828
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,179
Workloads and demands and doing these great projects and still,

829
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,360
you know, promoting culture of collaboration.

830
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:06,440
I know you've got, uh, twin daughters and family life and balance.

831
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,000
How, how do you juggle all that?

832
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:12,860
Yeah, uh, I don't do a very good job like everybody right now.

833
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,599
I'm probably defaulting to more on the work side just because there's so much

834
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,719
that we're trying to catch up on and, and, and, and it takes a moment.

835
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:22,400
So how do I manage it?

836
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:30,380
I try and make sure I just take time out for just, just sit down with the crew, the family.

837
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,619
If we spend time down at the beach, make it for a surf, you know, go up the mountain.

838
00:46:33,619 --> 00:46:35,079
So for me, it's a natural world.

839
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:40,219
I think that brings some restoration to that and, and doing, doing things with them that,

840
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:42,840
that sort of gets us together as a family.

841
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:47,019
But you know, like everybody there's, I struggle, the kids are on their screens too much.

842
00:46:47,019 --> 00:46:50,420
My half, my life is get off your screens, you know, that sort of stuff.

843
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,280
So I'm I, I wish I was.

844
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,940
A role model in that space, but I, I think I'm, I'm with everybody else.

845
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,719
I'm trying to figure it out, uh, how to navigate the space, just like the rest of us.

846
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:03,079
So leaders are really conscious of their communication.

847
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:06,320
Do you have a mantra when it comes to how you communicate?

848
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:14,719
Yeah, I think for me, what I've tried to learn to do is, is, is keep it really simple.

849
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:19,019
I try, you know, and I, you know, I could get excited.

850
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:22,260
I have chronic ADHD and dyslexia kind of combined.

851
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,639
So I get, I follow the squirrels and I get off on tangents.

852
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:32,119
And, um, so for me, I've tried to learn to really bring it back to some simple things, but also I like to make it.

853
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,159
I like the curiosity.

854
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:45,920
I try to make communicate and, and leave a question if I'm, if, if, if I'm communicating in sort of the training environment, I try to not, I try to make sure that all I'm doing is opening the aperture for people we're working with.

855
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,579
They're brilliant.

856
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,519
They're better at everything that they're doing than I'll ever be.

857
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:52,099
So I, I try to communicate in such a way.

858
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:56,000
That gets them to think, so let's poke them a little, like stoke the fire.

859
00:47:56,719 --> 00:47:56,920
Yeah.

860
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,079
We call them fun grenades.

861
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:03,920
I like to throw fun grenades into the mix and, and, and, and see, and just create that spark and see what happens.

862
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:10,559
So that's sort of how I've navigated my challenges in that space, but I'm by no means a great communicator.

863
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,039
I forget, I get distracted.

864
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:13,880
I, you know, it's, it's hard for me.

865
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,800
Sounds like you've got a great understanding of, uh, of what your skillset is.

866
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,760
Uh, Andy, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

867
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:22,199
Oh, my greatest leader in my life.

868
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,960
It's, it's, it's shifted over the years.

869
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:33,800
Uh, You know, I think earlier, a lot of my early days with my, my, just my grandfather was really, he was an old copper in Sydney.

870
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:42,719
You know, he, he just, you know, obviously had his own, all his same faults and that of everybody, but he was definitely someone who, you know, you always make sure you tell the truth.

871
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:44,199
You had some great lessons in there.

872
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:52,079
And then as I, I seem to find that I gravitate towards different people when I first was in the performance world, uh, like in the scientific side of it.

873
00:48:52,199 --> 00:49:10,599
So Alan Hahn was just a guy who was doing all the groundbreaking stuff back in the day on talent ID and physiology and the rowing and all that success we had, uh, shifted over when I got to the U S I, I, I started to connect with, uh, some of the, some of the, uh, special mission units.

874
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:15,400
And in particular, there's the business partner now, Jurgen Heitman.

875
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,000
He's an extraordinary leader.

876
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:22,159
He, he follows and leads this as well as anyone I've ever.

877
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:30,079
Met and, and, uh, just watching him, how he handles himself and he's done incomprehensible things in the, in the military.

878
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,480
Um, but he's, he's, he's really playing four dimensional chess all the time.

879
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,480
And, and more recently, a mentor of mine is, uh, Peter rare.

880
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:45,079
I mentioned earlier, uh, you know, uh, he's, he's whole world has been the study of human character based on the seven classical virtues.

881
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:52,159
And the way he's able to bring classic thought around the compassion, wisdom, virtue temperance.

882
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,980
Uh, so I think that's shifted over the time, a long answer, but it just moves.

883
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:02,480
And I, I find that I still always look back at those people, but always looking forward to, to who else can I learn from?

884
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,199
I love asking that question because your answer is brilliant.

885
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:05,599
Isn't it?

886
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:10,139
And those people that impact your life are at the top of your mind in different stages.

887
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:12,159
It's, uh, it's such a gift, isn't it?

888
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:15,559
When you have access to people that have been able to do that for you.

889
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:22,000
We're a bit obsessed, uh, and in the spirit of collaboration, and we've been really privileged to have you as part of our,

890
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:32,239
our leader world, and you've been a great champion of, of that space for us and, and really generous and sharing your wisdom amongst the leader community, you get to collaborate with great people all the time.

891
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:39,119
Is there been someone you thought, wow, that that's someone I would love to spend some time with on one of your particular passions?

892
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:47,039
You know, I was really fortunate when I spent time at rebel, I was obviously had the athlete portfolio and motorsports and all that wonderful thing.

893
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:50,760
I was learning every day from that community, but they get through the culture program at us, the artists, the musicians.

894
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:50,880
Yeah.

895
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,079
Yeah.

896
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:51,179
Yeah.

897
00:50:51,179 --> 00:50:51,400
Yeah.

898
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:51,460
Yeah.

899
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:51,559
Yeah.

900
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:51,639
Yeah.

901
00:50:51,639 --> 00:50:51,699
Yeah.

902
00:50:51,699 --> 00:50:51,760
Yeah.

903
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:51,820
Yeah.

904
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,440
Yeah.

905
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:52,460
Yeah.

906
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:52,480
Yeah.

907
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:52,539
Yeah.

908
00:50:52,539 --> 00:50:52,579
Yeah.

909
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:52,599
Yeah.

910
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:52,659
Yeah.

911
00:50:52,659 --> 00:50:52,679
Yeah.

912
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:52,699
Yeah.

913
00:50:52,699 --> 00:50:52,739
Yeah.

914
00:50:52,739 --> 00:50:52,760
Yeah.

915
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:52,780
Yeah.

916
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:52,840
Yeah.

917
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:52,900
Yeah.

918
00:50:53,239 --> 00:51:02,320
And the learnings from that community probably set me up even more profoundly than anything I learned from the athletes.

919
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,599
So not to say just different and, and new and fresh.

920
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:17,739
And I, as I think about communities of people, I'd love to collaborate with, um, I find myself now drawn deeply to some of these extraordinary, uh, artists.

921
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:18,940
Oh yeah.

922
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:21,960
I look back, you know, you know, if I,

923
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:42,679
if I had to pick one right now, I am blown away from a, from a physical longevity, creative, you know, someone like a Keith Richards, if I spend time with someone like him and just his passion for what he does and how he does it and how, how he's still alive, just the reality of the whole thing is just an enigma to me.

924
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:49,559
I would, I would die to spend six months listening to how he does what he does and how he came about it.

925
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:51,559
To me, it's just people like that.

926
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:56,519
Artists, I'm really drawn towards these creative communities.

927
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:57,079
You pick them.

928
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:57,760
It doesn't matter.

929
00:51:58,039 --> 00:52:01,679
It just blows my mind to see how they do what they do and how they come about it.

930
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:06,159
And thankfully there's a lot of great documentaries that I study the hell out of to learn.

931
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:17,199
And then if you get with the artistic side of the same thing, it's the recent show, um, light and magic with Spielberg and Lucas, those two, how they, how they did what they did.

932
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,440
It's just, to me, those are two brains as well.

933
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,239
I'd love to learn from.

934
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:20,920
Yeah.

935
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,320
Great.

936
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:26,239
No, to finish on, uh, Andy, they don't need to donate the Keith Richards body to science.

937
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:33,920
When that time he might live to 150, uh, Keith and amazingly it was a coconut that nearly, uh, nearly killed him some years ago.

938
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,559
But, uh,

939
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:43,400
well, then there's several overdoses, but he said, you know, he said, I think he's famous quote is I've been close enough to death more times than I can count.

940
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,719
And, uh, all I know is it's worth waiting for.

941
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,599
I think it's brilliant.

942
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:51,280
Uh, then a great pleasure to spend some time with you, Andy.

943
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,320
I love what you do.

944
00:52:52,320 --> 00:53:02,760
We're really grateful to have you part of, uh, our leader community and, and to share, you know, your knowledge is, uh, there's been a brilliant thing to, to witness lots of learnings from today for me and great to catch up with you.

945
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,320
Thanks for your time.

946
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,719
Nah, Luke mate.

947
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:05,280
Likewise.

948
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,639
The community has been wonderful.

949
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:07,519
They've shared so much.

950
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:08,400
I've learned so much.

951
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,760
I appreciate your time today and yeah, just the chance to riffle.

952
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,760
It was a great for me to just, uh, sit here and spend some time.

953
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,840
So thanks for everybody.

954
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:16,880
Thanks, Andy.
