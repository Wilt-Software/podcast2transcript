A Listener Production.

00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:09,279
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

3
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:13,179
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,939
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,859
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,600
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,760
in education, sport, industry and the arts

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,739
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

9
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,199
where everyone has a voice.

10
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,799
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

11
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:53,609
Ange Postakoglou's history of success as a player and coach

12
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:55,289
in Australian soccer is unparalleled.

13
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:58,090
Born in Athens, Greece before emigrating to Melbourne, Australia

14
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,609
at the age of five, Ange's love and dedication to the World Game

15
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:03,049
has defined his life.

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,489
As a player for his beloved South Melbourne,

17
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,349
Ange played 200 games over nine years, twice winning the championship,

18
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:11,329
the second time as club captain.

19
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:14,989
At the ripe old age of 30, Ange's senior coaching career

20
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:18,349
began by leading South Melbourne to back-to-back NSL titles

21
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:19,209
for the first time.

22
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,569
In their history, following a seven-year stint

23
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:23,049
as the coach of the Australian youth teams,

24
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:25,530
Ange's coaching history is remarkable.

25
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,829
Back-to-back titles with the Brisbane Roar,

26
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,569
including a 36-game streak without loss

27
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:32,849
that stands as the longest undefeated period

28
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:34,609
in Australian sporting history.

29
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,769
As coach of the national team, he guided the Socceroos

30
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:40,609
to a win in the 2015 Asian Cup on home soil

31
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:44,969
following an outstanding campaign at the FIFA World Cup in Brazil 2014.

32
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,709
In 2019, Ange became the first Australian manager

33
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:49,269
to win a league title in the World Cup.

34
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,170
Ange won the league title in Japan with Yokohama.

35
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,310
And on the 10th of June 2021, Ange Postakoglu became

36
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,349
the manager of Scottish Premiership Club Celtic,

37
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,930
making him the first Australian manager to coach a major club in Europe.

38
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,750
In one of the most high-pressure jobs in world sport,

39
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:07,209
Ange in his first season coached Celtic to the title,

40
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,729
becoming the first Australian manager to win in Europe.

41
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,490
Ange, thanks for joining me.

42
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,129
Congratulations.

43
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,750
It feels on your life's work, but in particular,

44
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,870
the most recent success at Celtic.

45
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:17,969
Thank you.

46
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:18,050
Thank you.

47
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:18,110
Thank you.

48
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,169
Thank you.

49
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:18,189
Thank you.

50
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:18,250
Thank you.

51
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:18,270
Thank you.

52
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:18,289
Thank you.

53
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:18,349
Thank you.

54
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:18,370
Thank you.

55
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:18,389
Thank you.

56
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:18,629
Thank you.

57
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:18,650
Thank you.

58
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:18,669
Thank you.

59
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:18,689
Thank you.

60
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:21,610
All Australians feel incredibly proud of what you've achieved, mate.

61
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:21,969
Congratulations.

62
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,870
Yeah, thanks, Luke.

63
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,349
It's one of those, when you read it like that, you go,

64
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:27,770
oh, jeez, you know, he's had a great career.

65
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:29,409
But, mate, there's a lot of dips in there, you know,

66
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:33,330
that anyone who's in the game for any length of time realises that,

67
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,310
you know, people sort of tend to look at the peaks.

68
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:41,969
But, you know, when I think about particularly sort of,

69
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,129
not so much my playing career, but my sort of managing coaching career,

70
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:48,310
you know, there's been so many moments where,

71
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:51,189
it's been a grind and it's been tough.

72
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,770
And, again, even in every individual job that I've had,

73
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,729
that I've had the success even within that, you know,

74
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,210
and it's a bit, to be fair, that I love and embrace,

75
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:06,669
but it's also, you know, the most difficult bit that people tend to,

76
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,830
not dismiss, but when they talk about your career,

77
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:14,009
sort of tend to focus on, you know, those summits rather than the climbs.

78
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,610
Well, I want to speak to there is so much success,

79
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:18,210
and you're right, you do focus that.

80
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:20,569
And, you know, I know you've been in the open a bit,

81
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:23,530
certainly there's been periods where you were cast into the wilderness.

82
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,129
When you look back, remarkably as well, I keep using that word,

83
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:30,969
but I definitely want to ask you about that period after coaching the youth teams as well.

84
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:32,289
But could I go back to the start?

85
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:34,469
I mentioned the opening, you're born in Greece.

86
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:37,770
Your dad, from what I read, Ange, was running a successful business.

87
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,449
He came from a line of merchants, a furniture business.

88
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:48,650
And in 1969, the Greek nationalism of taking businesses and land back off those who own them,

89
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,330
forced your family's hand.

90
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,129
Mum and dad decide they're going to emigrate to Melbourne, Australia.

91
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:57,810
And reading about it, it was a pretty tough time for you as a kid.

92
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,250
Can you describe what it was like?

93
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:01,689
Yeah, it was.

94
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:09,289
Look, to be fair, it probably wasn't as tough for me as I've come to realise as it was for the family,

95
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:10,490
and particularly my parents.

96
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:17,790
Because as you said, it was, you know, life for them was, you know, fairly normal in Greece

97
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,649
and surrounded by family.

98
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:24,529
And friends, and I guess they had a sort of life plan sort of charted out for themselves.

99
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:27,649
But then, obviously, things changed and they had to make a decision.

100
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:32,410
And it was pretty much, it ended up being a decision between, I think,

101
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,269
South Africa and Australia as to our ultimate destination.

102
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:37,709
And not because of any sort of links.

103
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:41,430
It was just, you know, you're literally putting two pins into a globe and saying,

104
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,709
well, which one are we going to?

105
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:48,629
And, you know, my parents, at the time, Australia had a sort of a, you know, the immigration policy,

106
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:53,189
of bringing sort of migrants and migrant workers from, particularly from Europe.

107
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:57,209
And, you know, my dad made the decision that we'd go to Australia.

108
00:04:57,209 --> 00:05:03,370
And, you know, when I think about it now, to go, sort of, that's halfway around the other side of the world.

109
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:09,370
And you're talking about on a boat for a month with, you know, without knowing a soul,

110
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,689
not really knowing where you're going to end up.

111
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:18,089
We ended up in Bonnegilla in, you know, in a refugee camp for sort of a period of time, which, again,

112
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:19,649
I have no recollection of.

113
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:20,649
I was five years old.

114
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:25,790
But I'm just thinking now, obviously, being a parent myself, and with two young boys as well,

115
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,110
was just how difficult that would have been.

116
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,170
And then we finally got allocated a family in Melbourne to sort of go and live with.

117
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:39,250
And we started then, and my childhood was, as I see it, pretty happy, you know.

118
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,470
I was a normal Melbourne kid.

119
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,589
I played, I loved my football, obviously, but I played Aussie rules.

120
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:47,189
I played cricket in the summer, and we were always outside, we were always playing.

121
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,189
But in the back, granted.

122
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:53,430
I always got the sense that, you know, from my mum and dad, it was a real tough existence,

123
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,430
you know.

124
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:01,189
My dad was constantly at work, just trying to scrape a living for us to get by.

125
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:06,009
And my mum, you know, she was forever either looking after us or doing part-time work or

126
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:11,310
shifts wherever she can, just to literally put food on the table.

127
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:17,430
And whilst it didn't sort of make an impact on me at that time, I think as I've got older,

128
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,930
it's had more of a profound impact on me.

129
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:24,910
And that you've got two individuals there, my mother and my father, who have actually

130
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:32,230
pretty much sacrificed their happiness and their sort of plans for the opportunity that

131
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,230
they can give their kids.

132
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,430
And that, to me, is obviously very significant.

133
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:42,509
Yeah, it's an incredible story, and it's probably, you know, maybe a fairly common migrant story

134
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:43,509
for families.

135
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:47,430
And you read about it, and you maybe, you know, when you haven't had that perspective,

136
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,990
you mentioned, you know, reading in preparation for this, it was a bit tougher for your older

137
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:57,149
sister who was 10, and your dad, without the language, trying to, you know, adapt to culture

138
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:01,310
in Melbourne, as you said, pre-internet days, pre-understanding anything, and really trying

139
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,029
to find your way.

140
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:07,529
You transition from there, and I read sort of seven to eight years of age, in your words,

141
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:11,709
soccer becomes, you know, the round ball game becomes your life and the center of the universe.

142
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:15,870
And it's based on really wanting to spend that time with your dad, and you would go

143
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,870
to the soccer.

144
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,990
And you felt like that was the only time that he was at ease for those two hours, that you

145
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,829
got to really connect with him.

146
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:25,990
Is that where the love of the game came from, Ronnie, to connect with your dad?

147
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,990
Yeah, absolutely.

148
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:32,069
And it's funny, because it's almost entwined with Australia's sort of football, soccer

149
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:36,589
sort of history, because 74 was when we made the World Cup for the first time, and that

150
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,670
was when I was just eight, nine years old.

151
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,670
That was about the same time.

152
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:45,430
So there's a real consciousness around soccer making an impact in Australia, but also the

153
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,430
impact it had on my family.

154
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,430
And that's what I'm really proud of.

155
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:53,189
And as I said, my dad kind of really struggled with life in Australia, he was a very sociable

156
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:59,290
kind of guy, he loved his soccer, you know, he didn't really understand life in Australia

157
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,290
that much.

158
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:04,430
There was not much he could relate to, because, you know, like I said, for the most part,

159
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:11,189
he was just working, and his pastime and the social aspect of his life pretty much disappeared.

160
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:17,149
So in the end, we were lucky enough that, you know, South Melbourne Hellas was sort

161
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:20,689
of a, even though it was a soccer club, it was more than that.

162
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:26,990
It was a conduit, it was a social gathering of people who were having similar sort of

163
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,990
experiences in life.

164
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,310
Because like you said, the migrant stories, my migrant story is not unique, especially

165
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,850
in Australia, it's quite common, and every time I tell a story or when I write my book,

166
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,409
so many people come up and said, well, that was my upbringing, that was exactly what I

167
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:42,169
went through, you know?

168
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,769
And Hellas ended up being, you know, like I said, a social hub where, you know, you've

169
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:44,769
got the culture, you've got the, you've got the culture, you've got the culture, you've

170
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:45,769
got the culture, you've got the culture.

171
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:46,769
And you know, you've got the culture, you've got the culture, you've got the culture.

172
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:58,250
On a Sunday, people like my father, who probably are struggling through the day-to-day, even just speaking, you know, just being able to have a conversation with people about whether it's their problems or just life in general.

173
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:07,269
That sort of got left at the gate as soon as we bought our ticket, went through the turnstiles and you could smell the souvlaki.

174
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:14,909
So even the smells you got were really sort of, for my dad anyway, he just brought this consciousness of back home, his home.

175
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:22,690
And I sort of saw that and I saw how passionate he was about the game and how alive he became.

176
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:33,250
And I figured out that, OK, well, because I was desperate to get close to my father, even though I couldn't spend much time with him, I thought, well, here's definitely something that he's really interested in.

177
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:44,090
And at the same time, I kind of got the bug the other way and he kind of recognised, well, hold on, if I want to keep my son really close to me, he goes, I can't.

178
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:44,889
I can't.

179
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:44,909
I can't.

180
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:50,909
I can't put him in the local cricket club or the local Aussie rules club because I won't understand those people.

181
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:57,470
If he can love this game, at least I'll put him in a soccer club where, again, that social network existed, you know.

182
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:01,690
So it was so much more than just a choice of sports for me.

183
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,529
It wasn't because I loved them all, you know.

184
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,549
People know I'm a massive Carlton fan.

185
00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:06,330
I love my cricket.

186
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,529
You know, I was big into cricket back then.

187
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,269
But like all kids in Melbourne, you know.

188
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,929
But he couldn't put me in those environments.

189
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:13,929
He didn't understand them.

190
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:14,149
So.

191
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:20,490
So soccer ended up becoming the social glue for our family in many respects, our connector.

192
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:34,909
And all the significant relationships I've had and even my parents had after that in terms of friendships and close networks, all pretty much, 95% of them came from that club.

193
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:44,129
And I read, Ange, that often you would sit around with your dad and the old man, I think you described them as, that would dissect the game and argue about the umpire.

194
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:45,350
And debate the tactics.

195
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:51,649
And you're seven or eight, your mates are out there playing, but you wanted to sit there on, you know, dad's lap or next door.

196
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:59,330
Was that where your sort of understanding of how you were going to approach the game, your coaching, do you think it stems back from those conversations in some ways?

197
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:06,049
Yeah, I kind of try and think about that, you know, what made me be that different.

198
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:13,509
And it wasn't just, you know, my dad certainly noticed it because he would see, and even my mates would say, you know, like I said, they'd be out playing.

199
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:16,470
I'd be sitting there wanting to hear them dissect the game.

200
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:22,809
I just became really passionate and fascinated by every aspect of the game, not just playing it.

201
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:34,429
I mean, obviously I love playing it, but I just got really enraptured in this understanding that, you know, the game didn't finish at the final whistle, you know, there was more.

202
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:43,470
And sometimes the best bits came after the final whistle, you know, when the debates would start about the numerous, you know, refereeing decisions.

203
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:48,389
That were wrong or the coaches' decision-making.

204
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:53,710
And I used to love it, you know, I used to really sort of get engrossed in it.

205
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,970
And I wasn't really a contributor.

206
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,330
I just, because like I said, I was eight years old and these guys, you know, there's 40-year-old men sort of dissecting it.

207
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:11,649
But I think that's where, like I said, my passion and obsession for the game became, I mean, that's the early seeds of it, where it wasn't just, oh, this is a game I'm going to play, I'm going to love.

208
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:13,190
It went beyond that.

209
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,830
This was something that was going to, I had a pretty good idea early on, was going to consume me.

210
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:26,129
When you look, and I love this story, you're a 12-year-old Paran High and you're the captain and the coach of your 12-year-old team.

211
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:28,190
I find that incredible.

212
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:34,490
And in some ways, you know, when you write about it, it makes sense because you were probably the first generation coming through.

213
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:41,309
You're wearing the old Australian rules, woolen jumpers that would get wet and you'd be freezing cold and the sleeves off, you didn't have to have the right uniforms.

214
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:43,169
But the fact that you had that sense of leadership.

215
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:49,029
At 12, that you were comfortable coaching your own mates, that is pretty out there for that age.

216
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:49,750
Where did that come from?

217
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,570
I wrote about that in my book.

218
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:59,610
I think just as bizarre for me was not the fact, just the fact that I sort of stepped into the breach and saw that, okay, I wanted to do this, I wanted to organise things.

219
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:05,210
But the other 12-year-olds or 11-year-olds decided to kind of follow.

220
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,710
That to me still kind of, I don't understand it.

221
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:13,169
And it wasn't, you know, like I said, the coach of our team.

222
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,990
The coach of our team was the music teacher.

223
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:22,870
Because again, you know, in our school at Paran High at the time, yeah, the footy team, because we were just down the road from Paran VFA Club, two blues, they were massive.

224
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,730
And there's a really strong Aussie rules kind of culture in the club.

225
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:29,470
And so they got everything, including the coaches.

226
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:38,889
So when it came to assigning the coach for the soccer team, it was like, well, which teacher's got some spare time and end up being the music teacher?

227
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:39,909
I had no idea.

228
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:43,169
And, you know, we'd end up training and he'd be doing marketing.

229
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,070
We'd be doing our homework on the sidelines, you know, and he was, and it was a typical muso as well.

230
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,070
I wasn't even interested in sport.

231
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,250
It wasn't even like just soccer he wasn't interested in.

232
00:13:51,389 --> 00:14:00,750
So, you know, I kind of made a decision, okay, I'm going to, all this stuff that I've been sitting there listening, sitting in my dad's lap, listening to all these guys talk about the game, I'm going to take over.

233
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:05,990
And I mean, I was, obviously I was one of the better players, which kind of helped.

234
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:12,309
But it wasn't like I was a kind of a real dominant personality outside of that, like in the schoolyard.

235
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:12,590
I was.

236
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:20,470
You know, I was, I was a sporty kid and, you know, I had, I was, you know, I had a lot of mates and everything, but I wasn't the leader in any sense.

237
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:38,090
But when it came to football, it just seemed, A, it seemed a natural fit for me that I would do this and that for some reason, like I said, the other 11, 12 year old boys who were just as unruly as anyone, any other 11, 12 year old boys, all of a sudden were kind of going, okay, well, tell us what we're going to do and let's do it.

238
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,789
I mentioned your playing career, very successful to win.

239
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:50,470
You're in a very competitive National Soccer League at the time, you're captain of a title, you're playing a second title as well.

240
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,230
But, you know, the words you used, I think that you're always a coach masquerading as a player.

241
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:00,990
Did that sense, even when you were playing, that your destiny was to lead teams from a coaching perspective?

242
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:12,710
Yeah, I don't know why, but I got the sense fairly early on in my career that the kind of dreams and ambitions that I had for what I wanted to do the game.

243
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:17,549
I wasn't going to, I wasn't going to satisfy it as a player because I just felt that I was limited.

244
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:35,509
And I kind of look back on it now and I think, well, I almost sort of predetermined my own destiny because, you know, you know what it's like, you know, if you don't have that self-belief as a player, and I talk about the players all the time, if you kind of put a ceiling on what you can achieve, you're almost, well, you're restricting yourself to that ceiling.

245
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:43,710
And it's almost like I did that with myself, you know, even though, you know, I got to play for the national team, I think I was only 21 when I made my debut for the Socceroos.

246
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:50,769
So there was a career there and I had a couple of opportunities to go overseas and play and which didn't quite work out.

247
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:55,889
So there was a career there where I think I could have sort of got more out of it than I did.

248
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:03,870
But like I said, I almost put a ceiling on myself that, okay, now this is just a precursor to what I really want to do.

249
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:21,450
And as, you know, fate would have it and sort of life kind of throws these things at you, I ended up getting a pretty significant knee injury when I was 25 and by 27, you know, I kind of knew that, you know, I was done and dusted and sort of the coaching career kicked off.

250
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:29,429
Andrew, I mentioned the incredible success that's followed everywhere that you've gone, but you also were very quick to point out off the top that there's challenge.

251
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:33,230
And I go back to, you spent seven years as the national youth coach.

252
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:38,450
There's a lot of success and then you're unceremoniously sacked from that role.

253
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:44,009
And, you know, I read, I think your words were that at the time you felt that you were never more capable as a coach.

254
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,129
You never had more understanding of what was going to be.

255
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,789
You're at the very top of the curve, I think were the words you used, but the curve collapsed from underneath you.

256
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:57,509
I mean, how tough was that period where really no one would really come after you for a coaching role?

257
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:03,049
Yeah, look, in a sort of, I mean, my first sort of coaching, he was 97, 98.

258
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,009
So it's almost 25 years now.

259
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:11,369
The most difficult time for me, and I've had sort of challenging periods while I've been coaching, is that period when I wasn't.

260
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:16,609
And it was probably like a sort of eight to 12 month period.

261
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:31,410
And as you said, I felt that the seven years I've had as national youth coach was almost, it was my PhD in coaching because I kind of used it as a vehicle for not just, you know, obviously doing the job I was assigned to do.

262
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,210
But because of the uniqueness of the role.

263
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:40,690
I had where, you know, we ended up qualifying for six World Cups during that time because the World Cups were every two years and I was coaching two teams.

264
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:47,150
So I ended up going to six underage World Cups where I saw the best in the world at development level.

265
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,930
I was lucky enough to travel the world.

266
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:56,369
I made a point wherever I went to educate myself to stay longer and talk to people.

267
00:17:56,369 --> 00:18:03,210
So I was just gathering all this information and it was sort of crystallizing in my mind that I either kind of.

268
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:08,230
Football, I wanted my team to play, the kind of leader I wanted to be, the kind of environment I wanted to set.

269
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,710
So it's kind of, you know, I've done this as I said, sort of like a PhD in coaching.

270
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,509
I get to the end of it.

271
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:31,329
And because again, of the perception that I wasn't successful, then particularly the time in Australia where, you know, here in particularly in Europe and in my game anyway, in soccer, you know, getting sacked is not, is not terminal.

272
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:33,109
It's just part of the journey of any coach.

273
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,890
You know, and if anything, you, people see that, oh, well, he's learned from that.

274
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,809
So you get another opportunity.

275
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:41,029
But in Australia at the time, it was like, well, you know what?

276
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,609
He's failed.

277
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:42,109
That's it.

278
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:43,910
He's time's done that.

279
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,829
It also coincided with the A-League just launching.

280
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:54,670
And there was, there was a real sort of attempt at the time to leave the game's history behind and start with a new chapter.

281
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:59,650
And almost all got lumped in with the, with kind of the history of the game rather than what was ahead.

282
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,170
And so there was a, there was a, there's a, you know, a whole sort of set of.

283
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:29,130
Circumstances that meant, you know, I remember going for a couple of jobs, even as an assistant coach and not even getting a look in, you know, and, and I thought at the time, geez, you know, this is, this is going to be tough because, and again, it's, it's kind of something I learned from and I grew and I'm using it today that it's not just about having the knowledge and having the desire, you know, everything, most things in life are about opportunity.

284
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,210
Somebody's got to be able to open that door for you or else, you know, you don't get.

285
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,630
An opportunity to put that into practice.

286
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,150
And, you know, I was lucky that there was a certain set of circumstances that brought it together.

287
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:47,430
Now, my belief is that irrespective at some point, I would have got back on the horse and I was, I was super confident that I'd have success.

288
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:48,190
I'd have a career.

289
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:56,730
I was never in fear of that, but where that was going to be and how that was going to come about, that uncertainty was a little tough period.

290
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:02,609
And there was a memorable exchange at the time too, with Craig Foster, that's been much reported.

291
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:02,849
Yeah.

292
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,190
And that,

293
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:09,269
you know, it was pretty brutal in, in coming after you, the former Soccer Ruin commentator at the time.

294
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:15,509
I mean, there was a thought that that was a really, almost made you unemployable post that.

295
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,589
Was that how you felt about it at the time?

296
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:18,589
Yeah, it was.

297
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,609
No, it was, it was a fact.

298
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:25,250
I mean, there was one job I went for and for an A-League job and got down to me and another candidate.

299
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:32,089
And in the end, the decision was made to go for the other candidate because the owner of the club was alerted to this, you know,

300
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,190
because it's, it's obviously,

301
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:39,549
you know, on YouTube, this interview I did and, and that kind of put him off that I was kind of, you know,

302
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:45,309
not the kind of person that they would want associated with their football club.

303
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:53,650
So, so yeah, so it was, it was, and, and, and again, again, that was part of, you know, I've said at the time, I didn't, I, I didn't like it.

304
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,329
I didn't like the way it was done.

305
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,690
You know, I wasn't appreciative of the way it was sort of set up.

306
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,829
I kind of already knew when I did the interview that,

307
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:08,470
you know, my tenure as, as youth coach was over anyway, I kind of, I was moving on, but, you know,

308
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:10,869
Foz at the time was really passionate about football.

309
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:17,329
You know, when I look back on it now, I think it's two guys having a passionate debate about something they love from coming from different angles.

310
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:25,930
But at that time, because the football community was so small, the soccer community was so small that, you know, I thought, well, you know,

311
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:31,710
I don't, I didn't think it was fair that my, everything I've done in the game was kind of tarnished in that moment.

312
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:32,789
Now, the one thing I,

313
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:50,609
I always did though, was that irrespective of circumstances, I was in, I always fronted up, you know, I, I never, I never shied away from, from interviews or, or, you know, whether that's the press or, or, or talking to people when it came, even at the most difficult of moments, I felt, you know, you know, I want to be there.

314
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:54,470
So I could have very easily dodged that interview because I knew it wasn't going to go great.

315
00:21:55,049 --> 00:22:02,549
But, you know, that's part of who I am is that I always front up and it didn't, it didn't come out, didn't paint me in a great light.

316
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:03,410
But, you know, that's part of who I am is that I always front up and it didn't, it didn't come out, didn't paint me in a great light.

317
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:03,450
But, you know, that's part of who I am is that I always front up and it didn't, it didn't come out, didn't paint me in a great light.

318
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:08,490
And like I said, in the short term, it certainly hampered my ability to, to, to get a job.

319
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:18,029
But again, that's, I guess that's where the growth comes in that you, you survive things like that and you kind of understand that, you know, as I said, nothing is terminal in terms of your career.

320
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,509
There's always an opportunity to, to, to get back up and go again.

321
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:22,970
Yeah, it's interesting the way you describe it.

322
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:29,329
You look back and I have done that and looked at the interview and, you know, in the other codes in Australia, those exchanges happen all the time.

323
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:39,769
You're right, you know, and, and, and they're reported and you move on, but maybe, you know, you write very passionately about, you know, soccer's hindrance in lots of ways by the codes here.

324
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:41,690
And that was an example, wasn't it?

325
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:52,950
To have someone with all that experience, all of your history of success, to, to, to, to think that the, the community of soccer and would not want to tap into that is, is almost bizarre.

326
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:58,470
And I suppose, as you said, it's, it's, it's spawned this incredible period that has come after it.

327
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:14,990
I love reading, Ang, you talk a lot about the idea and your sense of purpose and everything that you do, that there needs to be some deep immersion in what your story is and that you write about, you know, that you feel like if it wasn't soccer, then that would be something you pursue in other aspects of your life.

328
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:19,089
Can you, can you describe a bit more about what you mean and where that, that sense of purpose comes from?

329
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:22,950
Look, I'm just, again, probably because of.

330
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:41,289
My experiences and my life experiences, like I've always felt that there's, you know, for me, there's something more meaningful to life than just chasing, you know, the, the, the goal that, that, that's the end of a, of a rainbow.

331
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:51,009
To me, it's always been about, I don't know, I've always been attracted to stories, whether that's in sport or in life in general, that have a much deeper purpose.

332
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,930
And they seem to be the most significant.

333
00:23:52,970 --> 00:24:06,809
Things that people hold onto that, that the sort of a generational, you know, that many people have success in different ways, but the ones that get remembered are the ones that have a higher purpose or a deeper meaning for what they do.

334
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:21,390
And I've always felt that almost an obligation that the game itself gave me in many respects, the life I have is that, you know, whatever I do, I want to.

335
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:33,150
You know, with the people I share the journey with is give them, give them something more to hold onto than just chasing success or just trying to be, you know, making money or chasing fame.

336
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:44,970
All those things are important and they're all byproducts, but it's to be, to sense like you're part of something special, something that will stay beyond, you know, that, you know, whatever period you're in at that time.

337
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:50,569
So everything I've done, I've tried to, at the core of it, be well, you know.

338
00:24:51,390 --> 00:25:03,150
In the most basic of terms, I'm not chasing the victory at the weekend, that, that, that is almost the last thing on, on, even though it's, it's the most important thing for me to continue to do what I do.

339
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:11,349
It's the last thing I talk about because I want people to feel like they're, they're doing something more meaningful than that.

340
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:19,769
They're doing something more meaningful and more purposeful than just trying to win a, win a contest on the, on, on the weekend because everyone wants to win.

341
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,349
Everyone wants to be, you know.

342
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:45,869
You know, get that victory and, and that's really been an important part of kind of everything I've done is that at the end of it, I want to be able to say that I was part of something that people still talk about, you know, and for that to happen, it can't just be success because success, you know, many people have, have, you know, are able to, to attain that.

343
00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:50,869
And, you know, for me, that's the, that's always been the most important drive.

344
00:25:51,349 --> 00:26:00,930
And, and what I do, every challenge I've taken on and everything I kind of do, particularly in my professional life, you kind of want to transfer it to, to your personal life as well.

345
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:18,309
But that becomes even more challenging in many respects because, you know, when you have a family, you have, you know, your wife or your partner and, and, and, and, you know, they've got their own ambitions and, and you've got to make sure you're not trying to impart, impart your own sort of journey onto them.

346
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:21,250
So, but for the most part, there are core values.

347
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:21,569
Yeah.

348
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:31,990
That, that, you know, transfer both, particularly in my professional life, the anchor of everything I do is to have a purpose beyond just trying to be successful.

349
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:33,009
Yeah.

350
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:40,950
And you, it's, you hear coaches talk about the process rather than the outcome, but, you know, yours sounds like a really deeper feeling than that.

351
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,029
And, and, you know, you look at what you've done and it's been multiple titles.

352
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:46,369
It's been breaking new ground.

353
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:51,329
You know, you listen to the intro, taking on challenges that haven't been achieved before.

354
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:53,529
and Australian coach, is that the sort of detail?

355
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:56,450
I mean, for people to understand that and relate that to their life,

356
00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:01,170
is that your mind is going not just to doing what others have done before?

357
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,630
And how do you impart that on your players?

358
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,029
How do you share that with them?

359
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:09,450
Yeah, and you're right because it is process-driven,

360
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,490
but, you know, it's such a dry word, particularly in sport,

361
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:16,269
when you're talking about passionate people, you know,

362
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:22,029
that if you walk into a room of, you know, sort of athletes

363
00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:24,869
and you're just talking about processes and, you know,

364
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,029
you'll lose them after a while, but ultimately that's what it is about.

365
00:27:28,109 --> 00:27:29,069
It is about the process.

366
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:34,470
It's about creating an environment where the end result should take care

367
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,210
of itself if we go through these steps.

368
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:39,930
But, you know, for me to bring that to life, and like you said,

369
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:42,710
what I've tried to do my whole career is really challenge myself

370
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,549
and put myself in positions where, you know,

371
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,210
whether that was professional or professional,

372
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:46,250
whether that was professional or professional,

373
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,829
whether that was a club level, international level,

374
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:51,390
internationally, you know, in different cultures,

375
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:57,269
is how do I get those processes to come to life into something that,

376
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:02,190
you know, people that I'm in that room with can resonate to

377
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,849
and understand and appreciate?

378
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:08,930
And so invariably you end up becoming a storyteller,

379
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,250
and that's what I think I've sort of honed my craft into becoming,

380
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:15,569
into telling a story.

381
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:20,069
That people who are sometimes coming from totally,

382
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,450
particularly when I think about Celtic,

383
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:24,990
where I've got guys from all over the world

384
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:27,309
who have had totally different life experiences,

385
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:31,750
is to tell a story that they all have interest in, you know?

386
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,509
And again, it can't just be that we're going to be champions

387
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:36,529
because they've heard that story before

388
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:40,849
and they can walk into any dressing room in any sport and hear that.

389
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:45,549
It's how do I tell a story that they all can relate to,

390
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:47,109
and they all want to be a part of,

391
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:50,029
and they all are really interested in what the next page has,

392
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,490
and what potentially the ending may look like,

393
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:55,789
because you can't, you know, talk about the ending.

394
00:28:56,849 --> 00:29:02,630
And, you know, if you can tell that story in a real sort of vivid way

395
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:06,269
where it almost becomes a living thing,

396
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:10,069
then, you know, when I've had success, you know,

397
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:13,490
sometimes from being the narrator,

398
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,490
I end up just being somebody who's living,

399
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:17,529
who's listening because I can hear the words being spoken

400
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:19,890
by the playing group and the other coaches

401
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,049
and everyone I'm involved with.

402
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:24,529
And, you know, within that, there's so much detail, obviously,

403
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:27,250
because there's the technical aspects, there's the tactical aspects,

404
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:31,569
there's the management of people, there's all these other things,

405
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,769
but the core essence of it, even with that, is, well,

406
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:39,069
this highly skilled group of people, of players and staff,

407
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,950
what I'm hoping is that the story I'm telling,

408
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:45,089
they've all bought into it.

409
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:49,769
And I want to sort of take it to the end point.

410
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:54,190
The Celtic story, Ange, there's nothing dry about that.

411
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:58,950
That is full of passion and even your courage to take on that role.

412
00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:05,009
I described it as arguably the hottest coaching seat in world sport in lots of ways.

413
00:30:05,089 --> 00:30:07,589
And for those listening, Ange, that don't understand,

414
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:11,750
and I've got to admit, I sat next to Eddie Maguire for 11 years

415
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,789
as a Scottish immigrant with a Scottish father as a Celtic supporter.

416
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:15,529
And I...

417
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:20,569
Even through him, you know, the legend of Old Firm Games

418
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:23,230
and understanding it and then just his passion for it,

419
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,950
I've followed, you know, the history of what happens with Celtic and Rangers

420
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:32,170
and then you watch it and you see and hear the atmosphere of just the passion.

421
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,470
It's almost like nothing I've ever seen in world sport

422
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:39,049
and had the pleasure of being international and seeing some big events.

423
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,190
But can you describe to the audience just how passionate, you know,

424
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,009
coaching Celtic is and what the fans and the supporters are like?

425
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:48,369
Yeah, and it is unique, Luke.

426
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,349
Because, I mean, again, growing up in Australia,

427
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:54,029
we really are passionate about our sport.

428
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:58,329
And, you know, I think that's what I loved about, you know,

429
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:03,809
and I was lucky that my dad ended up choosing Australia as our destination,

430
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,309
was that I grew up in a sport-loving nation.

431
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,529
You know, we love our sport.

432
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:09,130
We're passionate about it.

433
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:12,650
It was so much a part of my upbringing as a kid.

434
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,849
And so many of my...

435
00:31:14,849 --> 00:31:17,849
My values are entwined with sport.

436
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:23,829
But, you know, Celtic in Glasgow, it goes beyond that

437
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:27,829
because for the people who love that football club,

438
00:31:28,029 --> 00:31:29,150
they're not supporters.

439
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:30,309
They're not fans, you know.

440
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:33,670
It's not for them that, you know, they look forward to a game.

441
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:36,009
For them, it's part of their life.

442
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,190
It's as much a part of their life.

443
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:41,609
It's an extended family member.

444
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,829
And I'm not talking about a distant family.

445
00:31:44,849 --> 00:31:48,029
But this is a family member that they bring into their household

446
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:52,309
that sits at the dinner table with them, that organises their year,

447
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,130
organises their, you know, their significant moments.

448
00:31:55,589 --> 00:31:58,750
You know, so when we're getting the fixture list out on Friday

449
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,930
and, you know, people will map out their whole year,

450
00:32:03,009 --> 00:32:05,269
the next 12 months around the fixture list.

451
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,009
And that's because it's generational.

452
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,230
That's been passed down from, you know, great-grandparents

453
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:14,130
to great-grandparents to fathers.

454
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,269
And sons and mothers and daughters.

455
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:25,509
And for that, then you walk into that and understand that everything I do,

456
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,549
whether that's not just in a game sense, but every time I speak

457
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:32,390
or every time, you know, I'm seen or I'm heard from,

458
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:35,829
has an impact on each and every household.

459
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:36,849
It's massive.

460
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:41,890
And then you put the expectations because it is a league where, you know,

461
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,990
when you look at it at the moment, it's Rangers and Celtic

462
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,769
that have been the most.

463
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:46,049
It's dominant by far.

464
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:50,150
Clubs and people think, oh, well, at least you're guaranteed, you know,

465
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,250
you're going to be successful.

466
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,950
But what people don't understand is that finishing second in this league is,

467
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,829
you may as well finish last.

468
00:32:57,029 --> 00:32:59,650
It's not well done, you know, you got close.

469
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:00,769
Second is not.

470
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:04,390
So every year the expectations are you will win and you will be successful.

471
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:09,109
So all that sort of encompassed is, it is.

472
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:14,009
It's probably one of the most sort of high-profile pressurised positions,

473
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:16,150
in terms of the football club.

474
00:33:18,349 --> 00:33:20,410
The flip side of that is I love it, you know, I mean,

475
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,410
that's, that's what I've always wanted.

476
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,960
And my frustrations with Australia and Australian soccer was,

477
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,299
it was always been that it wasn't the people who loved the game or the people

478
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:33,200
who hated the game.

479
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,599
It was the apathy that sort of landed in between,

480
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:39,680
which was probably the biggest part of it was that most people just didn't care.

481
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:43,339
You know, I mean, even when people had crack at soccer in Australia,

482
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:46,480
I, I kind of, I didn't mind that because, okay, that's,

483
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,859
that's somebody being passionate about it and the ones who love it in Australia,

484
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:54,339
you know, even that there was, you know, we weren't even a united voice in that,

485
00:33:54,339 --> 00:33:55,359
but that I could live with that.

486
00:33:55,359 --> 00:34:00,579
But it was the apathy in between that people just didn't care that it just would

487
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:02,599
churn in my guts because I love this thing.

488
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:04,180
This was my passion.

489
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,579
So now to be right smack bang in the centre of it,

490
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:13,719
it almost like this is where I was supposed to end up at some point in my career.

491
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,000
You arrive on the way over there.

492
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,300
And it's,

493
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,139
and Jim pasta,

494
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:17,739
cod glue.

495
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,039
And who's this Australian,

496
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:21,579
Greek migrant coming to,

497
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:23,139
to coach the famous Celtic.

498
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:25,840
You came as is the want with,

499
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,380
with that.

500
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,880
And then you've delivered the title in the,

501
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,900
in the first year.

502
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,500
And,

503
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,340
and as you said,

504
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,840
you described it beautifully,

505
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,920
but you know,

506
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,920
we'll play some of the crowd just to get a sense of what it's like.

507
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,900
Can you share with some of the links that fans go do to get into games?

508
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,460
There there's legendary stories in there.

509
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:42,579
I mean,

510
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:46,300
it helps back obviously to the religious divide dividing in Glasgow,

511
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:46,760
isn't it?

512
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,440
The Celtic Catholic and the Protestants and,

513
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,119
and you know,

514
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,480
there was sectarian violence,

515
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,119
you know,

516
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,079
historically,

517
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:56,500
but now it's just this next level of,

518
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,059
of intensity,

519
00:34:58,059 --> 00:34:58,420
isn't it?

520
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,800
That's represented on the sporting field,

521
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,079
but people will do anything,

522
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:01,380
won't they?

523
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:01,900
To get to it,

524
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,219
to get to a guy.

525
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:03,460
Yeah,

526
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:03,840
absolutely.

527
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,539
But I think,

528
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:05,860
you know,

529
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,440
I think with each club as well,

530
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,039
but when,

531
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:10,079
when,

532
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,780
when you look back at Celtic story,

533
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,920
part of the,

534
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,420
the,

535
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,639
the sort of passion for the football club is like I said,

536
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:15,820
I,

537
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:20,739
as I've spoken sort of on my journey in coaching,

538
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:22,199
there's a deeper purpose to the club.

539
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:28,340
It was actually a club very similar to South Melbourne that was born out of,

540
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:28,579
you know,

541
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:30,000
feeding the poor,

542
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
the Irish immigrants who had come to Glasgow.

543
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,219
That was the purpose of,

544
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:36,320
of making this football club.

545
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,699
So that is there constantly.

546
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:43,019
It's a constant reminder to you because there are images and,

547
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:45,539
and the stories told all the time of,

548
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:48,920
there is a greater purpose to this football club than just winning titles,

549
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,300
even though that's what we want to do.

550
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,219
And that's obviously the end goal.

551
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:53,219
And,

552
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:54,000
and,

553
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,179
and so,

554
00:35:55,179 --> 00:35:55,460
you know,

555
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,340
when people attach themselves or,

556
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,059
or,

557
00:35:58,059 --> 00:35:58,559
you know,

558
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:00,179
when people are part of that football club,

559
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:01,059
they're,

560
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:01,599
like I said,

561
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,099
they're in it wholly,

562
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:03,360
you know,

563
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,059
it's not just,

564
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:05,519
like I said,

565
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:06,900
this is not a,

566
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,400
them deciding whether they're going to go to a game on the weekend.

567
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:09,940
This is,

568
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,360
this is,

569
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,280
this is who they are.

570
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,940
So,

571
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,199
you know,

572
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:15,300
having a season ticket at Celtic is,

573
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:16,119
is,

574
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:17,079
is like gold.

575
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:17,539
It's,

576
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:18,539
it's,

577
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:18,960
you know,

578
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,500
it's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,

579
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:21,719
mate.

580
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:21,920
It's,

581
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,500
it's that golden ticket that no,

582
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:23,800
you know,

583
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,760
that everyone wants.

584
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:24,920
And,

585
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,099
and,

586
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:25,300
you know,

587
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,000
if you've got one,

588
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,880
you're not going to be giving it away too easily.

589
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,059
You know,

590
00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:29,380
so season tickets,

591
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:29,599
you know,

592
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,300
we could probably sell out Celtic Park,

593
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:31,480
you know,

594
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,639
two or three times over.

595
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:34,639
So,

596
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:34,900
you know,

597
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,260
when,

598
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,320
when there's that sort of,

599
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,019
so,

600
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:37,480
I mean,

601
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,559
the rivalry stuff is always there,

602
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:43,199
but I think each club has its own sort of story to tell.

603
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:43,820
And,

604
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,480
and from Celtic's perspective,

605
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:46,840
it's a really compelling,

606
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,880
strong story that,

607
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,340
that,

608
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,880
that goes beyond them just being a sporting institution.

609
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,719
And,

610
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:54,260
and again,

611
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,639
that's what,

612
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:56,599
you know,

613
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:58,059
is the uniqueness of the,

614
00:36:58,059 --> 00:37:01,099
that club that you will get somebody like Eddie,

615
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:01,940
like I said,

616
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,480
you know,

617
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,480
a boy who grew up in Brodie,

618
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,360
Broadmeadows,

619
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,219
as AFL centric and Collingwood centric as possible.

620
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:10,360
But because of the stories,

621
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,519
I'm sure his father told him about Celtic,

622
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:15,400
he's probably as passionate as anyone living in

623
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,239
Glasgow and that,

624
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,059
that that's,

625
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:19,320
that's a global sort of perspective because I,

626
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,820
I get messages from all around the world,

627
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,659
you know,

628
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:22,500
from,

629
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,320
from,

630
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,119
from Celtic supporters who are absolutely as passionate.

631
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,880
They will get up at any time of the day to watch the

632
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,880
football club play.

633
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:37,449
I've sort of had the,

634
00:37:37,449 --> 00:37:39,449
the privilege from afar of seeing you,

635
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:40,289
Ange,

636
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:43,170
collaborate in something that my great friend,

637
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,170
Matt Waterwitz and I are passionate about Leader Connect.

638
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,010
And,

639
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,590
and you've been generous enough to,

640
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,210
to over a fairly extended period of time,

641
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,329
to collaborate with a range of different coaches.

642
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:54,170
Luke Beveridge,

643
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:57,710
who coaches the Bulldog Premiership coach in 2016.

644
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,849
Brian Gorgian,

645
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:02,309
legendary Australian basketball coach.

646
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:03,130
Neil Craig,

647
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,050
whose history in sport and also now with alongside Eddie Jones,

648
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,050
they're both at English Rugby.

649
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,730
Eddie, the head coach of,

650
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:09,570
of English Rugby.

651
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,389
Can you,

652
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:11,610
can you share with us a little bit about,

653
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:14,610
as someone who's leading your own organisation and got a busy schedule,

654
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,809
why it's important for you to,

655
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:16,989
to reflect with other,

656
00:38:16,989 --> 00:38:18,590
other peers?

657
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,429
Yeah,

658
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:20,269
it's,

659
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:21,110
it's been great to be fair.

660
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:21,949
And,

661
00:38:21,949 --> 00:38:22,769
and,

662
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:23,610
and as you said,

663
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,449
it's one of those things where,

664
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:25,269
you know,

665
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:26,110
we're also,

666
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:26,949
I mean,

667
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:27,789
look,

668
00:38:27,789 --> 00:38:28,630
I'm,

669
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,449
I'm,

670
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:30,289
I'm on holidays at the moment,

671
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:31,110
but I'm,

672
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:31,949
I'm talking to you and,

673
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:32,789
you know,

674
00:38:32,789 --> 00:38:33,630
after this,

675
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,469
I've got a call with the guys at the club.

676
00:38:34,469 --> 00:38:35,289
So,

677
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:36,130
you know,

678
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:36,969
in our life,

679
00:38:36,969 --> 00:38:39,289
the football or managing or coaching is not,

680
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:40,130
you know,

681
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:40,969
it's not an occupation.

682
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:41,809
It's a lifestyle choice.

683
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:42,650
So,

684
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,309
so how you use your time is really important.

685
00:38:44,309 --> 00:38:45,969
There's nothing more valuable that we've got in,

686
00:38:45,969 --> 00:38:48,030
in our arsenal and sort of time.

687
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,309
And so when things come along to you and think,

688
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:51,110
well,

689
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,710
should I put amount of time,

690
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,710
a lot of amount of time to this?

691
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,869
Is it going to be worthwhile?

692
00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:57,809
You got to really put a lot of thought into it.

693
00:38:57,809 --> 00:38:59,369
And I remember when Matt sort of,

694
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:00,210
you know,

695
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,170
reached out and I think for yourself,

696
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,010
Luke,

697
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:03,849
that,

698
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:04,690
you know,

699
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,610
listening to the people who were going to be involved,

700
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,449
I,

701
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:08,289
I just thought,

702
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:09,110
you know what,

703
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:12,849
at the time I was coaching Yokohama and it was just,

704
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:14,849
I think pretty sort of pandemic,

705
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:15,690
but,

706
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,530
but being in,

707
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,369
in Japan,

708
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:18,210
I,

709
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,050
I kinda,

710
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:19,889
you know,

711
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:20,730
being in a country where,

712
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:21,070
you know,

713
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,949
obviously language not being not been able to communicate as

714
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:26,170
easily as I went back home.

715
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,010
I thought,

716
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:27,829
well,

717
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:28,650
you know what,

718
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:29,670
this will give me a chance to at least connect still with

719
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,469
people and have conversations around what I do.

720
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:34,630
And I,

721
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,469
and I,

722
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:36,309
and I was really intrigued with the group of people we had

723
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:37,150
together,

724
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:37,989
you know,

725
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:40,690
I hugely admired sort of what Luke did with,

726
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,309
with the Bulldogs.

727
00:39:42,309 --> 00:39:43,150
You know,

728
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,309
I kinda,

729
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:47,489
I actually visited the Bulldogs pre Luke was in there.

730
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:50,010
I think the year before I'd been by down for a couple of

731
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:50,849
days.

732
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:51,849
You know,

733
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:52,690
because of that,

734
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,369
I kind of followed the path and watching him when the

735
00:39:55,369 --> 00:39:56,590
premiership was outstanding.

736
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,130
And Brian,

737
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:58,969
I remember from,

738
00:39:58,969 --> 00:39:59,809
you know,

739
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:00,650
the big NBL days,

740
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,489
I was a big Melbourne Tigers fan,

741
00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:02,329
mate.

742
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:03,170
And,

743
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,010
you know,

744
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:04,849
Lindsay and,

745
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:05,690
and Andrew guys were,

746
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:06,510
were,

747
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,349
were big in Melbourne at the time.

748
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:08,190
And,

749
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,030
and Gorge was,

750
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,869
was coaching,

751
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:10,710
like the giants and,

752
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,550
and basketball was massive.

753
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,389
So he was someone I got,

754
00:40:12,389 --> 00:40:13,230
he'd be really intriguing.

755
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,550
I knew he'd spent time in China,

756
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,670
which,

757
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,510
you know,

758
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,829
was kind of going to be interesting for me.

759
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:19,650
Eddie's,

760
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,469
you know,

761
00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:21,309
well known.

762
00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:22,130
And,

763
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:22,969
and again,

764
00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:23,809
so I'd read his books.

765
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:24,750
So I kind of knew he was an intriguing character.

766
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,949
He'd spent time in Japan.

767
00:40:25,949 --> 00:40:26,929
It was just a really good group.

768
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:27,849
And Craigie,

769
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:28,670
Craigie,

770
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,489
I'd be lucky enough to,

771
00:40:29,489 --> 00:40:31,190
to come across when I was coaching Melbourne Victory,

772
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,090
because he was at Melbourne Footy Club of the Demons.

773
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:36,409
And we shared the same training facility at Amy Park.

774
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:37,849
And again,

775
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:40,829
another guy who always found really interesting and really

776
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:41,670
passionate.

777
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,750
So it is just a good group of guys.

778
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,730
I thought at the initial,

779
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,050
but you never know how these things go.

780
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,010
And I'm always worried about,

781
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:48,849
you know,

782
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:50,469
becoming too structured and sort of having,

783
00:40:50,469 --> 00:40:51,550
you know,

784
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,989
sort of some kind of agenda.

785
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:56,070
As soon as I hear a gender in meetings and stuff,

786
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:56,909
mate,

787
00:40:56,909 --> 00:40:57,750
I'm gone.

788
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,590
I'm out of there,

789
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,429
you know?

790
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:00,269
So,

791
00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:01,110
but it ended up being really good and,

792
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,170
and just a real good discussion.

793
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,010
I think,

794
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:04,849
you know,

795
00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:06,710
I was listening to your podcast with Eddie and I think Eddie

796
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,710
probably described it best.

797
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:10,289
He described something like alcoholic anonymous,

798
00:41:10,289 --> 00:41:13,590
where you just go in and you kind of purge your sins and,

799
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,429
and,

800
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:15,269
you know,

801
00:41:15,269 --> 00:41:16,110
we can talk really freely.

802
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,449
And that was a good thing about all the guys was that it

803
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:19,289
was almost like,

804
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:20,130
you know,

805
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:20,969
a,

806
00:41:20,969 --> 00:41:21,789
a,

807
00:41:21,789 --> 00:41:22,630
a get smart cone of silence that,

808
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,469
you know,

809
00:41:23,469 --> 00:41:24,289
what we can say,

810
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:25,130
whatever we want in here and,

811
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:25,969
and it'll be safe.

812
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:26,809
And,

813
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:27,630
and because of that,

814
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,469
it was just,

815
00:41:28,469 --> 00:41:30,949
it's just great that obviously you just talk about your most

816
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:31,949
recent experiences.

817
00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:33,989
And obviously when you're connected,

818
00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:35,969
you're following the other guy's journeys and you might pick

819
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:38,050
up something that they've been through and you can ask them

820
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:38,889
questions.

821
00:41:38,889 --> 00:41:41,050
I think we all appreciate the fact that,

822
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:41,869
you know,

823
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:44,769
we're able just to connect with people who are,

824
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:45,610
you know,

825
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:46,449
in a,

826
00:41:46,449 --> 00:41:47,289
in a similar line of,

827
00:41:47,289 --> 00:41:48,190
of sort of work,

828
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,030
but,

829
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,909
you know,

830
00:41:49,909 --> 00:41:50,750
experiences.

831
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,750
And for me,

832
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,409
that's where growth lies for me now.

833
00:41:54,409 --> 00:41:55,250
I mean,

834
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,489
I'm kind of 56 and,

835
00:41:56,489 --> 00:42:00,150
and obviously I've been coaching for 25 years and,

836
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,989
you know,

837
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:03,110
great for me now becomes if I can keep growing as a

838
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:07,429
person by just trying to gain as much knowledge as I

839
00:42:07,429 --> 00:42:08,269
can and,

840
00:42:08,269 --> 00:42:11,090
and listening to as many people as I can and,

841
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:15,289
and still trying to stay relevant to today's world and,

842
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:16,449
and today's people,

843
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:17,289
you know,

844
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:19,449
particularly young people who I deal with every day,

845
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:21,510
that's where my sort of growth comes.

846
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,349
It won't,

847
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:26,210
my ability to stay in the game will come from,

848
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,369
from being able to connect with people like that,

849
00:42:28,369 --> 00:42:29,769
rather than sort of,

850
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:30,610
you know,

851
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,449
go through,

852
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:32,289
you know,

853
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:33,389
whether it's courses or doing things that are more sort of

854
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:34,230
structured.

855
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,070
I think that's,

856
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,989
that's where kind of my evolution continues to.

857
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,989
We just need to teach Eddie Jones how to say pasta

858
00:42:40,989 --> 00:42:41,989
coglou.

859
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:45,289
Angie had some troubles with that from my recollection of the,

860
00:42:45,289 --> 00:42:46,170
of the interview with him.

861
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,010
Unbelievable, man.

862
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,329
Unbelievable.

863
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:49,329
Unbelievable.

864
00:42:49,449 --> 00:42:51,510
I've only known him for the last two and a half years.

865
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,449
And,

866
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:53,449
and,

867
00:42:53,449 --> 00:42:54,449
and,

868
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:55,449
and,

869
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:56,449
and to be fair,

870
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:57,449
like Matt,

871
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,449
you know,

872
00:42:58,449 --> 00:42:59,449
whether it's gorgon or beverage,

873
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:00,449
they just roll off his tongue with pasta coglou.

874
00:43:00,449 --> 00:43:01,449
Just,

875
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:02,449
he struggles with it.

876
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:03,449
It's all right.

877
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:04,449
I,

878
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:05,449
I did mention that quite a few times the last time I caught

879
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:06,449
up.

880
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:09,449
We sort of are passionate again on the idea that people,

881
00:43:09,449 --> 00:43:10,449
clearly you,

882
00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:11,449
you met people at the,

883
00:43:11,449 --> 00:43:12,449
at your level and it's been,

884
00:43:12,449 --> 00:43:15,949
it sounds like a beneficial experience and it's great that it's still going.

885
00:43:15,949 --> 00:43:19,010
But the idea that you do connect with people and reflect and,

886
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,010
and,

887
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:21,010
and as you said,

888
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:22,010
the learning and your growth coming from these in-person,

889
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,010
um,

890
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,010
forums,

891
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,010
effectively,

892
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,010
is,

893
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,010
is something that we think,

894
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:28,010
uh,

895
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,010
is applicable to everyone,

896
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,010
regardless of whether you're the,

897
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,010
the head coach itself.

898
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,010
Do you,

899
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,010
do,

900
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,010
would you subscribe to that?

901
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,010
Would you see that as a beneficial thing for people to,

902
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:36,010
to,

903
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:37,010
uh,

904
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:38,010
to,

905
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,010
to do what you're doing regularly?

906
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,010
Yeah,

907
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,010
I think so.

908
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:42,010
And I think it goes beyond that.

909
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:43,010
And,

910
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:44,010
and I,

911
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:45,010
I was really,

912
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:46,010
I mean,

913
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,010
I,

914
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:48,010
I,

915
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:50,010
when I first started it,

916
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,010
um,

917
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:52,010
you know,

918
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:53,010
particularly in a,

919
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,010
in a coaching leadership sense,

920
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,010
I,

921
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,010
I,

922
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,010
I've always been a real kind of guy who,

923
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,010
you know,

924
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,010
has,

925
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,010
you know,

926
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,010
likes to have control of things.

927
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,010
I kind of like,

928
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,010
you know,

929
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,010
I'm,

930
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,010
I'm pretty strong on,

931
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,010
on setting the environment,

932
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,010
making decisions.

933
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,010
I empower people absolutely,

934
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,010
um,

935
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,010
you know,

936
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,010
within the organization.

937
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:12,010
But in terms of my own,

938
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,010
um,

939
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,010
sort of reflection and ability,

940
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:15,010
I,

941
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:16,010
I've kind of gone through my career,

942
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:17,010
um,

943
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:19,010
pretty much doing it myself.

944
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,010
And that's where I'm most comfortable.

945
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:22,010
I,

946
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,010
I haven't needed a sanding board.

947
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:24,010
I haven't needed a,

948
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:25,010
you know,

949
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,010
somebody within the organization to,

950
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,010
to kind of bounce things off or to,

951
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:29,010
you know,

952
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:30,010
I've,

953
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,010
I've always managed to,

954
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:33,010
to do that myself and felt really comfortable in that space.

955
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:37,010
But what I've come to realize is that sport and life has changed.

956
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,010
Yeah.

957
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,010
And if I was starting my journey again,

958
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,010
the one thing I would do,

959
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,010
and,

960
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,010
and,

961
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:43,010
and,

962
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,010
and,

963
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:45,010
and it's interesting being part of the group and particularly,

964
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,010
you know,

965
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:47,010
the role in,

966
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:49,010
within an organization of being,

967
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,010
you know,

968
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:52,010
a sanding board to somebody like an Eddie,

969
00:44:52,010 --> 00:45:04,010
Eddie talks about it often that he uses Craigie in that sense is that I think in today's world where the attention and the saturation of,

970
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,010
you know,

971
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:11,010
opinions that are out there that potentially you have to deal with in a leadership role,

972
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:14,010
the more avenues you have to be able to,

973
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,010
um,

974
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:16,010
you know,

975
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:19,010
go through those thought processes of how to deal with them.

976
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,010
And the more support you have,

977
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:23,010
I think the more chance you'll have a success,

978
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:24,010
you know,

979
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:25,010
or having a career in the game,

980
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:28,010
because I just think there's going to be a huge burnout factor.

981
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:30,010
If anyone tried to do it the way I've done it,

982
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:34,010
I don't know if you can in today's kind of world,

983
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:35,010
the way it's set up where,

984
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:36,010
you know,

985
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:37,010
you,

986
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:38,010
you can't,

987
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:40,010
unless you've got really good sounding boards,

988
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:43,010
people who you can,

989
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:44,010
um,

990
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,010
sort of,

991
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:49,010
reflect and deflect from in terms of the,

992
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:51,010
whatever issues you may have and,

993
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:53,010
and not carry that burden yourself,

994
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:55,010
the more chances you have that you'll,

995
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:56,010
it'll be sustainable.

996
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,010
Um,

997
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:58,010
I,

998
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:59,010
I,

999
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:00,010
you know,

1000
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,010
whether it's players today or,

1001
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:02,010
or,

1002
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,010
or,

1003
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,010
you know,

1004
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:05,010
like I said,

1005
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:06,010
um,

1006
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,010
coaches,

1007
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:08,010
it's,

1008
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,010
it's,

1009
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:10,010
it's so much,

1010
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:11,010
you know,

1011
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:12,010
a much more intense environment we're all in nowadays.

1012
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:13,010
Now,

1013
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,010
like I said,

1014
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,010
I'm pretty good at shutting things out,

1015
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,010
you know,

1016
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:18,010
I can shut social media out,

1017
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:19,010
I can shut,

1018
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:20,010
um,

1019
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:21,010
you know,

1020
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:25,010
sort of unwanted noises wherever they're coming from pretty easily,

1021
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,010
mate.

1022
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:30,010
I've heard it all in my career and it doesn't really affect me,

1023
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:31,010
but,

1024
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:32,010
you know,

1025
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:33,010
if I was starting out today,

1026
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:34,010
trying to manage all that,

1027
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:35,010
um,

1028
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:37,010
without having some sort of network of people,

1029
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:43,010
whether that's within the organisation you're working with or external that can help you through those processes would be,

1030
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,010
would be tough.

1031
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,010
So,

1032
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,010
um,

1033
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,010
I certainly,

1034
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,010
you know,

1035
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:49,010
with the,

1036
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,010
the,

1037
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,010
the,

1038
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:52,010
you know,

1039
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,010
I've tried to do that myself in,

1040
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,010
in many respects,

1041
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:55,010
you know,

1042
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:56,010
there's a lot of the coaches I've worked with who are now sort of doing their own thing.

1043
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:57,010
I've always,

1044
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:58,010
without it being anything formal,

1045
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:59,010
I've always tried to be,

1046
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:00,010
again,

1047
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,010
mentor was not the right word,

1048
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:02,010
but a bit of a sounding board for them.

1049
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:03,010
Um,

1050
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:04,010
you know,

1051
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:05,010
guys that I've worked with in the past that every time,

1052
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:06,010
and sometimes it's just saying,

1053
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:07,010
G'day,

1054
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,010
you know,

1055
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:09,010
just sending out a text and saying,

1056
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:10,010
how are you?

1057
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:11,010
And I'll get on the phone with them and,

1058
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:12,010
and,

1059
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:13,010
and,

1060
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:14,010
you know,

1061
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:15,010
we chat about it for half an hour.

1062
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:18,010
I think that allows perspective,

1063
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:19,010
um,

1064
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,010
that,

1065
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,010
you know,

1066
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:24,010
if you try and deal with it by yourself and sort of do it the way I've done it,

1067
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,010
you know,

1068
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,010
in sort of my career,

1069
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,010
um,

1070
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,010
it just wouldn't,

1071
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,010
like I said,

1072
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:30,010
it wouldn't be sustainable.

1073
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,010
You,

1074
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:33,010
you'd find yourself sort of burning out pretty,

1075
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:34,010
uh,

1076
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:35,010
pretty quickly.

1077
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:36,010
Yeah.

1078
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:37,010
Brilliant.

1079
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:38,010
Uh,

1080
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,010
thanks for sharing that.

1081
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:40,010
And I,

1082
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:41,010
and I will give a,

1083
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:42,010
a quick plug because we are,

1084
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,010
uh,

1085
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,010
we're going to inform,

1086
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:45,010
uh,

1087
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:46,010
these groups.

1088
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:47,010
So if you are interested,

1089
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,010
uh,

1090
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,010
you can check that out at,

1091
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:50,010
at Alita.

1092
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:51,010
Matt and I are really passionate about the,

1093
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:52,010
the power of,

1094
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,010
uh,

1095
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:54,010
of that reflective leadership that Ange described,

1096
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,010
uh,

1097
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:56,010
so brilliantly.

1098
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:57,010
Don't feel like I can go past,

1099
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,010
uh,

1100
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:59,010
a quick mention,

1101
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:00,010
uh,

1102
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,010
the Socceroos have just qualified again for the World Cup in spectacular fashion.

1103
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:02,010
And,

1104
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,010
uh,

1105
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:04,010
Andrew Redmayne is the,

1106
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:05,010
the John Aloisi,

1107
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:06,010
it seems,

1108
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:07,010
of,

1109
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,010
uh,

1110
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,010
of 2022.

1111
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:10,010
It's a,

1112
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,010
it's a,

1113
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:12,010
a.

1114
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:13,010
It's an opportunity for Ange and I,

1115
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:14,010
uh,

1116
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:15,010
yours gran Martel,

1117
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:16,010
uh,

1118
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:17,010
to plan,

1119
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:18,010
uh,

1120
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:19,010
months in advance that he was a,

1121
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:20,010
a penalty specialist as,

1122
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,010
as a keeper,

1123
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:22,010
and to sub him in,

1124
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:23,010
you know,

1125
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:24,010
a minute sub out the captain.

1126
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:25,010
I,

1127
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:26,010
I know,

1128
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,010
uh,

1129
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:28,010
you coached Andrew,

1130
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:29,010
uh,

1131
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:30,010
for a short time I think when you were at,

1132
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:31,010
at Brisbane.

1133
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,010
At Brisbane,

1134
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,010
yeah.

1135
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,010
Yeah,

1136
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,010
great,

1137
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:36,010
great story,

1138
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:37,010
isn't it?

1139
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,010
Uh,

1140
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:39,010
Ange to get the Socceroos through the World Cup again but in,

1141
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:40,010
in that fashion.

1142
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:43,610
You know, I've sort of described to you how passionate people in Scotland are.

1143
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:46,909
They haven't been to a World Cup since, I think the last one was 98.

1144
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:49,650
You know, they just missed out in the playoffs.

1145
00:48:49,789 --> 00:48:51,530
They're desperate to get to a World Cup.

1146
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:52,449
And this is our fifth.

1147
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:56,150
And I sometimes think we just take it for granted that, you know,

1148
00:48:56,230 --> 00:49:00,989
every World Cup campaign is a grind to get there.

1149
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:03,630
And we should celebrate that fact, you know,

1150
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:07,130
and whether it's whatever means we got through.

1151
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:09,329
And, you know, this time we got through on penalties, as you said,

1152
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:13,349
that that achievement of getting to a World Cup should never be dismissed.

1153
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:20,869
It's what, you know, the beautiful thing about the Australian game has,

1154
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:24,170
it's Australian soccer, which I think is entwined a little bit

1155
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,210
in that Australian sporting spirit,

1156
00:49:26,389 --> 00:49:31,550
is that ability to constantly sort of punch above your weight

1157
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:36,429
and the ability to take on anybody and everybody without fear.

1158
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:38,550
You know, it's...

1159
00:49:39,329 --> 00:49:44,809
It's such a great sort of embodiment of who we are as a nation

1160
00:49:44,809 --> 00:49:46,610
and particularly for football.

1161
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:48,610
So, you know, I was wrapped.

1162
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:53,429
And like I said, I did coach Redders when I was at Brisbane for a little while.

1163
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:55,150
He's had an interesting sort of coaching journey.

1164
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:56,269
And that's the beauty of sport.

1165
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:58,510
You know, when I talk about, you know, stories,

1166
00:49:58,590 --> 00:49:59,610
who could have written that script?

1167
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:00,929
Because, I mean, you can plan for that,

1168
00:50:00,949 --> 00:50:03,909
but you've got to be planning for the game to finish sort of

1169
00:50:03,909 --> 00:50:07,130
at a tight end of the game for you to make that move.

1170
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:09,090
And you can't write that.

1171
00:50:09,329 --> 00:50:10,530
It's all on this for Peru.

1172
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,239
Alex Balera.

1173
00:50:27,389 --> 00:50:38,250
It's the one.

1174
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:41,670
They are in Qatar.

1175
00:50:43,369 --> 00:50:43,809
Chance.

1176
00:50:44,469 --> 00:50:47,289
But no.

1177
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:50,889
A fifth consecutive World Cup

1178
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:54,750
as the cheers for Graeme Arnold turn to cheers.

1179
00:50:54,929 --> 00:50:56,449
If you did write that script, some of you would say,

1180
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:57,750
ah, too far-fetched, mate.

1181
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:59,210
You know, that's a Hollywood ending, you know.

1182
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:01,730
But that's the beauty of it, you know.

1183
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:05,150
And as you said, you know, Redders now will go down

1184
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,789
in the folklore of Australian sport.

1185
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,369
You've got him and it's great, mate.

1186
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:14,190
I'm loving the fact that, again, we'll be at a World Cup.

1187
00:51:14,449 --> 00:51:17,010
And I know that the guys will have a great experience there.

1188
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:20,349
There's nothing like I went to the 2014 one in Brazil

1189
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:22,250
and it was an unbelievable experience.

1190
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:26,090
And I'm sure Arnie and the boys will have another, you know,

1191
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:29,090
unbelievable experience and we'll take all comers on.

1192
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:31,110
They're in a good group where, you know,

1193
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,250
they've got nothing to fear.

1194
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:37,869
And as I said, I've never taken that part of it for granted,

1195
00:51:37,989 --> 00:51:39,230
knowing that what it would mean.

1196
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:42,050
I mean, to other nations, for them to get to a World Cup,

1197
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:45,510
the fact that, you know, for a long time we couldn't get to one

1198
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:48,010
now that we've gone to our fifth in a row is a hell of an achievement.

1199
00:51:48,369 --> 00:51:51,010
Yeah, brilliant to get your thoughts on it, you know,

1200
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:53,989
fresh from that remarkable moment in Australian sporting history.

1201
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:57,690
Ang, we've been identifying what we think are dimensions

1202
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:01,929
of great leadership of modern leaders in a range of different areas

1203
00:52:01,929 --> 00:52:06,929
and your leadership story stands out in Australian sporting folklore.

1204
00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:09,150
And we think self-leadership, without it,

1205
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:12,469
there's not really a basis to lead from.

1206
00:52:12,469 --> 00:52:14,369
Does that resonate with you, the idea of self-leadership?

1207
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:16,010
Yeah, I think so.

1208
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:23,010
I mean, I, again, it's something I guess as you get older

1209
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:27,550
and more experienced, you tend to reflect more on what is it

1210
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:31,349
that has been a constant in terms of whether it's my success

1211
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:32,550
or you're looking at other people's success.

1212
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:35,730
Why, you know, why am I in this space right now?

1213
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:38,510
Why have I kind of, I've been fortunate enough

1214
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:39,110
to be successful?

1215
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:39,210
Yeah.

1216
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:43,809
To sort of have the career I've had and a lot of that is,

1217
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:48,309
you know, it does come from within and understanding yourself

1218
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:50,190
and understanding you as a person, you know.

1219
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:55,349
And again, it's such a dichotomy from who you are sort of

1220
00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:58,929
in your personal life as to who you need to be

1221
00:52:58,929 --> 00:53:00,429
in your professional space.

1222
00:53:00,429 --> 00:53:05,469
And, you know, in kind of my personal life

1223
00:53:05,469 --> 00:53:08,429
and the person I am, I've got the same mates I had

1224
00:53:08,429 --> 00:53:09,110
when I was...

1225
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:11,110
You know, as I said before, I met at South Melbourne

1226
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:12,110
when I was six or seven, you know.

1227
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:15,730
So, they've been with me the whole journey, which suggests

1228
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,510
to me I haven't really changed much as a person.

1229
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:19,650
You know, I'm kind of the same person I was back then.

1230
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:22,929
We have the same interests, same values, same passions in life.

1231
00:53:22,929 --> 00:53:25,170
And that's been pretty constant.

1232
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:31,230
As a leader, I've kind of understood that I've had a chameleon aspect

1233
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:32,989
to the way I've led.

1234
00:53:32,989 --> 00:53:37,989
I've constantly changed, even if it's just, like I said,

1235
00:53:37,989 --> 00:53:38,989
like chameleon.

1236
00:53:38,989 --> 00:53:41,989
I've changed my appearance to fit in with wherever I've been

1237
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:43,989
to make sure that I fit into that environment.

1238
00:53:43,989 --> 00:53:45,989
And you can't do that unless you understand yourself,

1239
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:48,989
because at the core of that is I'm still the same person

1240
00:53:48,989 --> 00:53:50,989
within that different skin.

1241
00:53:50,989 --> 00:53:54,989
It's just that I've changed to adapt to make sure that my message

1242
00:53:54,989 --> 00:53:58,989
and what I say and the way I behave and the way I act

1243
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:00,989
is going to resonate with the room that I'm in.

1244
00:54:00,989 --> 00:54:04,989
And, you know, when you go back home, the chameleon comes off

1245
00:54:04,989 --> 00:54:06,989
and you become the person back you are.

1246
00:54:06,989 --> 00:54:07,989
But, you know, it's...

1247
00:54:07,989 --> 00:54:08,989
Yeah.

1248
00:54:08,989 --> 00:54:11,989
If you don't have a true sense of who you are yourself,

1249
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:15,989
you know, the danger is you become this chameleon

1250
00:54:15,989 --> 00:54:18,989
and you stay like that just because you have success

1251
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,989
in a certain environment and then you don't adapt

1252
00:54:20,989 --> 00:54:24,989
or you take that home and all of a sudden it doesn't work,

1253
00:54:24,989 --> 00:54:25,989
you know, you're figuring.

1254
00:54:25,989 --> 00:54:29,989
So, you know, I think that ability to have a real core sense of self,

1255
00:54:29,989 --> 00:54:33,989
who you are, what your values are, that's your bedrock,

1256
00:54:33,989 --> 00:54:37,989
and then to be able to change your skin to adapt to wherever you're going,

1257
00:54:37,989 --> 00:54:40,989
and the different environments you're going to be in

1258
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:43,989
and the journey you're on is really important.

1259
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:47,989
And, you know, like I said, you can't do that unless there's some sort

1260
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:52,989
of self-reflection upon, you know, who you are and what you want to do

1261
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:53,989
and what you want to achieve.

1262
00:54:53,989 --> 00:54:56,989
I think there's a really unique part to your leadership,

1263
00:54:56,989 --> 00:54:59,989
and from what I understand, and you mentioned it,

1264
00:54:59,989 --> 00:55:02,989
this great sense of self and unwavering really,

1265
00:55:02,989 --> 00:55:06,989
but you also have expressed that you purposely keep your distance

1266
00:55:06,989 --> 00:55:10,989
from the players and that you've held that ground back

1267
00:55:10,989 --> 00:55:12,989
because you like to keep them guessing at times

1268
00:55:12,989 --> 00:55:15,989
and you didn't want to build these really close connections

1269
00:55:15,989 --> 00:55:18,989
and then have to tell them that they were, you know, sacked,

1270
00:55:18,989 --> 00:55:20,989
which is part of the role of being a coach.

1271
00:55:20,989 --> 00:55:23,989
Is that a bit of what you're talking about as well,

1272
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:26,989
that that's what you need to do to be successful in your role

1273
00:55:26,989 --> 00:55:28,989
and that's the path that you want to tread?

1274
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:30,989
Yeah, I mean, look, so that's the chameleon bit.

1275
00:55:30,989 --> 00:55:35,989
That's the bit where, you know, I really believe that an important part

1276
00:55:35,989 --> 00:55:41,989
of, you know, being in a group is that everyone has an equal sense

1277
00:55:41,989 --> 00:55:46,989
of self-worth, and a lot of that comes from, you know, the leaders.

1278
00:55:46,989 --> 00:55:48,989
You know, how do I treat people?

1279
00:55:48,989 --> 00:55:50,989
And I treat everyone the same.

1280
00:55:50,989 --> 00:55:52,989
It doesn't matter whether you've just arrived at the club,

1281
00:55:52,989 --> 00:55:54,989
whether you're a player, whether you're the boot-stutter,

1282
00:55:54,989 --> 00:55:57,989
whether you're the security man.

1283
00:55:57,989 --> 00:56:01,989
I think that's really important because I think that people need

1284
00:56:01,989 --> 00:56:04,989
to feel like they're just as important

1285
00:56:04,989 --> 00:56:07,989
as the person next to them.

1286
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,989
Then they feel like they belong to something

1287
00:56:09,989 --> 00:56:12,989
and then they're willing contributors to it.

1288
00:56:12,989 --> 00:56:17,989
Now, you know, because of that, you know, some of it's, yeah,

1289
00:56:17,989 --> 00:56:20,989
a little bit of sort of fable and folklore because when I was

1290
00:56:20,989 --> 00:56:24,989
with the national team, most of those stories come from that time

1291
00:56:24,989 --> 00:56:27,989
where I do keep a distance because I couldn't.

1292
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:29,989
At club level, when I'm working with players every day,

1293
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:33,989
I still have a connector with them at some point every day, you know.

1294
00:56:33,989 --> 00:56:38,989
I don't not talk to people, but I don't spend more time

1295
00:56:38,989 --> 00:56:40,989
with sort of certain people.

1296
00:56:40,989 --> 00:56:44,989
I don't socialise with whether that's players or staff

1297
00:56:44,989 --> 00:56:48,989
because I think that's where, for me, I'm kind of going into territory

1298
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:53,989
of saying, well, you know, am I, you know, is everyone

1299
00:56:53,989 --> 00:56:56,989
in this room getting my equal attention?

1300
00:56:56,989 --> 00:56:58,989
Do they feel like they're getting my equal attention?

1301
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:01,989
I think everyone I work with, whether players or staff,

1302
00:57:01,989 --> 00:57:04,989
I'll tell you that, you know, even though they probably don't

1303
00:57:04,989 --> 00:57:09,989
get to know me really well, will know that I care for them

1304
00:57:09,989 --> 00:57:14,989
and I have total support for who they are within that organisation

1305
00:57:14,989 --> 00:57:17,989
irrespective of the role they play.

1306
00:57:17,989 --> 00:57:19,989
And it just suits me.

1307
00:57:19,989 --> 00:57:22,989
It suits my personality, my style of management.

1308
00:57:22,989 --> 00:57:23,989
It's not for everyone.

1309
00:57:23,989 --> 00:57:27,989
There's other managers I know who really get really sort of involved

1310
00:57:27,989 --> 00:57:31,989
with the people they work with and it works just as effectively.

1311
00:57:31,989 --> 00:57:34,989
It's just not, you know, like I said, suited to me.

1312
00:57:34,989 --> 00:57:39,989
For me, it's about my ultimate responsibility is to lead

1313
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:44,989
and to make sure that everyone within the walls that I lead in

1314
00:57:44,989 --> 00:57:49,989
feel the same self-worth when it comes to me,

1315
00:57:49,989 --> 00:57:52,989
that I don't place more importance.

1316
00:57:52,989 --> 00:57:55,989
So, you know, I've said to them, you know, it's not something unique.

1317
00:57:55,989 --> 00:57:57,989
It's something that happens at a lot of clubs.

1318
00:57:57,989 --> 00:58:00,989
But I will, every morning, I will shake everyone's hands

1319
00:58:00,989 --> 00:58:03,989
and say hello to every person in the building.

1320
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:06,989
It's just something I've always done because it gives me, you know,

1321
00:58:06,989 --> 00:58:10,989
two or three seconds of connection with someone that,

1322
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:14,989
irrespective of that, just could be a quick conversation

1323
00:58:14,989 --> 00:58:18,989
but it might prompt something in my mind for me to say something to them

1324
00:58:18,989 --> 00:58:21,989
or they might feel like this is the moment they need to say something to me

1325
00:58:21,989 --> 00:58:23,989
to catch up later.

1326
00:58:23,989 --> 00:58:24,989
But everyone gets it.

1327
00:58:24,989 --> 00:58:26,989
You know, no one misses out.

1328
00:58:26,989 --> 00:58:29,989
And, you know, during COVID,

1329
00:58:29,989 --> 00:58:33,989
during COVID times, mate, the fist bump has, you know,

1330
00:58:33,989 --> 00:58:34,989
annoyed the crap out of me.

1331
00:58:34,989 --> 00:58:35,989
I hate a fist bump.

1332
00:58:35,989 --> 00:58:39,989
So I'm glad we're back to handshakes as of next year.

1333
00:58:39,989 --> 00:58:42,989
Which is a brilliant part of your folklore, Anjan.

1334
00:58:42,989 --> 00:58:44,989
I'm glad you brought that up because, you know,

1335
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:48,989
it probably costs you in time maybe four or five minutes of your day, isn't it?

1336
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:50,989
But make physical contact with everyone in the organisation

1337
00:58:50,989 --> 00:58:52,989
and understand that's what you do.

1338
00:58:52,989 --> 00:58:54,989
You walk through and whether it's the boot starter

1339
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,989
or the security guard or the player, everyone.

1340
00:58:56,989 --> 00:58:59,989
And then, as you said, you might stop and an interaction occurs from there.

1341
00:58:59,989 --> 00:59:00,989
It's a simple thing, isn't it?

1342
00:59:00,989 --> 00:59:02,989
But to have the leader of the organisation

1343
00:59:02,989 --> 00:59:05,989
literally make contact with you physically every day,

1344
00:59:05,989 --> 00:59:09,989
it's a powerful thing that's become part of what you do.

1345
00:59:09,989 --> 00:59:12,989
We see leaders are really conscious about how they positively impact others

1346
00:59:12,989 --> 00:59:13,989
in their environment.

1347
00:59:13,989 --> 00:59:14,989
You did that.

1348
00:59:14,989 --> 00:59:16,989
The words of Scottie Paper in my,

1349
00:59:16,989 --> 00:59:17,989
you tread your own path.

1350
00:59:17,989 --> 00:59:20,989
It feels like you tread your own path very, very clearly.

1351
00:59:20,989 --> 00:59:24,989
How do you think about positively impacting everyone in the environment?

1352
00:59:24,989 --> 00:59:29,989
Again, you know, I think that's probably my main thing.

1353
00:59:29,989 --> 00:59:33,989
My major sort of role within that is that,

1354
00:59:33,989 --> 00:59:36,989
you know, I'm dealing with,

1355
00:59:36,989 --> 00:59:40,989
like I said, I look back at my playing career

1356
00:59:40,989 --> 00:59:43,989
and my own sort of self-doubts about who I could be

1357
00:59:43,989 --> 00:59:46,989
and how far I could go

1358
00:59:46,989 --> 00:59:49,989
absolutely put a limit to whatever I reached.

1359
00:59:49,989 --> 00:59:50,989
If I had somebody in that room who said,

1360
00:59:50,989 --> 00:59:52,989
listen, forget your coaching career

1361
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:55,989
and make the most out of your playing career

1362
00:59:55,989 --> 00:59:58,989
and had that sort of positive reinforcement,

1363
00:59:59,989 --> 01:00:00,989
because as I said, you know,

1364
01:00:00,989 --> 01:00:03,989
my father was a major influence in my life,

1365
01:00:03,989 --> 01:00:05,989
but he was old school, mate.

1366
01:00:05,989 --> 01:00:06,989
I never got a good word out of him

1367
01:00:06,989 --> 01:00:10,989
and I wasn't going to get any positive feedback going home after every game.

1368
01:00:10,989 --> 01:00:11,989
Even if I played well,

1369
01:00:11,989 --> 01:00:15,989
he had a crack at me about something else that I didn't do well.

1370
01:00:15,989 --> 01:00:17,989
So there was no real, you know,

1371
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,989
it just didn't help my sort of self-doubt insecurity about things anyway.

1372
01:00:20,989 --> 01:00:25,989
But again, that was that generation of dads, I guess.

1373
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:28,989
But, you know, so when I kind of deal with people today,

1374
01:00:28,989 --> 01:00:36,989
you know, being able to kind of get them to really believe in themselves

1375
01:00:36,989 --> 01:00:39,989
and the possibilities of, like I said,

1376
01:00:39,989 --> 01:00:41,989
we spoke about Andrew Redmayne,

1377
01:00:41,989 --> 01:00:44,989
is that if you told Andrew Redmayne 12 months ago

1378
01:00:44,989 --> 01:00:47,989
that he's going to be the person who takes us to a World Cup,

1379
01:00:47,989 --> 01:00:53,989
like that is not something that's conceivable

1380
01:00:53,989 --> 01:00:54,989
that you can sort of plan out and say,

1381
01:00:54,989 --> 01:00:56,989
this is a real goal for you, right?

1382
01:00:56,989 --> 01:00:57,989
That can't happen.

1383
01:00:57,989 --> 01:00:58,989
But, you know,

1384
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,989
I guarantee you that, and I know,

1385
01:01:00,989 --> 01:01:03,989
and John Crawley who works with the Goalies at Socceroos level,

1386
01:01:03,989 --> 01:01:06,989
he's been outstanding for years.

1387
01:01:06,989 --> 01:01:08,989
Somewhere he would have had those conversations with him,

1388
01:01:08,989 --> 01:01:10,989
you know, to paint that picture,

1389
01:01:10,989 --> 01:01:12,989
not just with him and with the other goalkeepers.

1390
01:01:12,989 --> 01:01:14,989
So as a leader,

1391
01:01:14,989 --> 01:01:17,989
you can have such a profound impact with positive reinforcement.

1392
01:01:17,989 --> 01:01:21,989
And it's not about painting unrealistic or sort of,

1393
01:01:21,989 --> 01:01:26,989
you know, just sort of throwing fantasies out there.

1394
01:01:26,989 --> 01:01:27,989
It's things that,

1395
01:01:27,989 --> 01:01:30,989
that are tangible because they happen every day.

1396
01:01:30,989 --> 01:01:31,989
You know,

1397
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:34,989
these so-called sporting miracles are everywhere.

1398
01:01:34,989 --> 01:01:35,989
You know,

1399
01:01:35,989 --> 01:01:38,989
they sprout up and then it's only when you read the story,

1400
01:01:38,989 --> 01:01:39,989
you go,

1401
01:01:39,989 --> 01:01:40,989
oh geez,

1402
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:41,989
how did he end up doing that?

1403
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:42,989
And you read and you go,

1404
01:01:42,989 --> 01:01:43,989
well,

1405
01:01:43,989 --> 01:01:44,989
that's why,

1406
01:01:44,989 --> 01:01:46,989
because he's been preparing his whole life for this,

1407
01:01:46,989 --> 01:01:47,989
for that moment,

1408
01:01:47,989 --> 01:01:48,989
you know,

1409
01:01:48,989 --> 01:01:49,989
it didn't happen.

1410
01:01:49,989 --> 01:01:50,989
But so,

1411
01:01:50,989 --> 01:01:51,989
you know,

1412
01:01:51,989 --> 01:01:52,989
I think within the environment,

1413
01:01:52,989 --> 01:01:53,989
whether that's players or coaches,

1414
01:01:53,989 --> 01:01:55,989
I really try and,

1415
01:01:55,989 --> 01:01:56,989
I've never been a,

1416
01:01:56,989 --> 01:01:57,989
and again,

1417
01:01:57,989 --> 01:01:59,989
this goes against convention in some respects,

1418
01:01:59,989 --> 01:02:01,989
but I've never been a goal-orientated perp.

1419
01:02:01,989 --> 01:02:03,989
I never set goals out at the start of the year.

1420
01:02:03,989 --> 01:02:04,989
I don't say,

1421
01:02:04,989 --> 01:02:05,989
well,

1422
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:07,989
we've got to do this and we've got to achieve this.

1423
01:02:07,989 --> 01:02:09,989
Because if I'd have done that for my own career,

1424
01:02:09,989 --> 01:02:11,989
I would have surpassed them.

1425
01:02:11,989 --> 01:02:12,989
I mean,

1426
01:02:12,989 --> 01:02:13,989
I ended up winning the championship in my second year as,

1427
01:02:13,989 --> 01:02:15,989
as a coach at South Melbourne.

1428
01:02:15,989 --> 01:02:16,989
That would have been my goal.

1429
01:02:16,989 --> 01:02:18,989
And that was 25 years ago.

1430
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:20,989
So if that was kind of the end,

1431
01:02:20,989 --> 01:02:22,989
I would have surpassed that in my,

1432
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,989
what happens after that,

1433
01:02:24,989 --> 01:02:25,989
you know?

1434
01:02:25,989 --> 01:02:28,989
So I kind of realised with my own life that,

1435
01:02:28,989 --> 01:02:29,989
you know,

1436
01:02:29,989 --> 01:02:32,989
not having a predetermined goal means that,

1437
01:02:32,989 --> 01:02:33,989
you know,

1438
01:02:33,989 --> 01:02:36,989
you can exceed even your most sort of positive of,

1439
01:02:36,989 --> 01:02:38,989
of expectations.

1440
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:41,989
If I can impose that on the people I work with,

1441
01:02:41,989 --> 01:02:43,989
then that's when I think special things happen.

1442
01:02:43,989 --> 01:02:44,989
That's when you break through ceilings.

1443
01:02:44,989 --> 01:02:47,989
That's when you do things that have never been done before,

1444
01:02:47,989 --> 01:02:49,989
because you've never spoken about it.

1445
01:02:49,989 --> 01:02:50,989
You know,

1446
01:02:50,989 --> 01:02:52,989
it comes to you because you haven't put a ceiling on what you've done.

1447
01:02:52,989 --> 01:02:54,989
That can only come with sort of,

1448
01:02:54,989 --> 01:02:55,989
you know,

1449
01:02:55,989 --> 01:02:56,989
positive reinforcements.

1450
01:02:56,989 --> 01:02:58,989
When we do analysis after the game,

1451
01:02:58,989 --> 01:02:59,989
I will never highlight mistakes,

1452
01:02:59,989 --> 01:03:00,989
you know,

1453
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:01,989
because if,

1454
01:03:01,989 --> 01:03:03,989
I just think there's no,

1455
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:06,989
there's no purpose in highlighting a person's error.

1456
01:03:06,989 --> 01:03:09,989
No one goes out there with the intention of making a mistake.

1457
01:03:09,989 --> 01:03:10,989
Mistakes are,

1458
01:03:10,989 --> 01:03:11,989
you know,

1459
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:13,989
and if I was going to go out and point out mistakes,

1460
01:03:13,989 --> 01:03:14,989
I'd have to start with my own,

1461
01:03:14,989 --> 01:03:15,989
because I'll make plenty during,

1462
01:03:15,989 --> 01:03:16,989
you know,

1463
01:03:16,989 --> 01:03:18,989
the course of a game or the course of a season.

1464
01:03:18,989 --> 01:03:21,989
So everything we show them in terms of feedback is,

1465
01:03:21,989 --> 01:03:22,989
is positive.

1466
01:03:22,989 --> 01:03:23,989
You know,

1467
01:03:23,989 --> 01:03:24,989
this is stuff we did well.

1468
01:03:24,989 --> 01:03:25,989
Maybe we didn't do it often enough,

1469
01:03:25,989 --> 01:03:26,989
why?

1470
01:03:26,989 --> 01:03:27,989
Well,

1471
01:03:27,989 --> 01:03:28,989
let's do it more often rather than saying,

1472
01:03:28,989 --> 01:03:30,989
this is stuff we didn't do well and we've got to cut out.

1473
01:03:30,989 --> 01:03:31,989
Yeah,

1474
01:03:31,989 --> 01:03:32,989
that's fascinating.

1475
01:03:32,989 --> 01:03:33,989
And again,

1476
01:03:33,989 --> 01:03:34,989
I love these conversations,

1477
01:03:34,989 --> 01:03:35,989
Ange,

1478
01:03:35,989 --> 01:03:36,989
because you know,

1479
01:03:36,989 --> 01:03:37,989
you share and you hope it impacts.

1480
01:03:37,989 --> 01:03:39,989
Spent a lot of my time with younger kids,

1481
01:03:39,989 --> 01:03:40,989
junior,

1482
01:03:40,989 --> 01:03:41,989
junior sport,

1483
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:42,989
the age of my kids.

1484
01:03:42,989 --> 01:03:45,989
And unfortunately that message has been lost somewhere because,

1485
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:46,989
you know,

1486
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,989
you would have spent your time on the sidelines and just seen,

1487
01:03:49,989 --> 01:03:50,989
you know,

1488
01:03:50,989 --> 01:03:51,989
junior coaches do the exact opposite.

1489
01:03:51,989 --> 01:03:52,989
You know,

1490
01:03:52,989 --> 01:03:54,989
they scream at kids when they make a mistake and they,

1491
01:03:54,989 --> 01:03:58,989
and you can see the body language drain and the confidence get,

1492
01:03:58,989 --> 01:03:59,989
to have someone who,

1493
01:03:59,989 --> 01:04:00,989
you know,

1494
01:04:00,989 --> 01:04:01,989
who's just won the league title,

1495
01:04:01,989 --> 01:04:02,989
sort of say,

1496
01:04:02,989 --> 01:04:03,989
I don't even,

1497
01:04:03,989 --> 01:04:04,989
on the video review show a mistake.

1498
01:04:04,989 --> 01:04:05,989
So you literally,

1499
01:04:05,989 --> 01:04:06,989
you won't play a replay of,

1500
01:04:06,989 --> 01:04:07,989
yeah.

1501
01:04:07,989 --> 01:04:08,989
I don't.

1502
01:04:08,989 --> 01:04:09,989
No,

1503
01:04:09,989 --> 01:04:10,989
no,

1504
01:04:10,989 --> 01:04:11,989
no,

1505
01:04:11,989 --> 01:04:12,989
I don't.

1506
01:04:12,989 --> 01:04:13,989
I mean,

1507
01:04:13,989 --> 01:04:14,989
and,

1508
01:04:14,989 --> 01:04:15,989
and you're right.

1509
01:04:15,989 --> 01:04:16,989
I mean,

1510
01:04:16,989 --> 01:04:17,989
I,

1511
01:04:17,989 --> 01:04:18,989
my oldest boy,

1512
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:19,989
when he was going through sort of junior soccer,

1513
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:20,989
I hated it.

1514
01:04:20,989 --> 01:04:21,989
I hate standing on the sideline and listening to the coaches and the parents,

1515
01:04:21,989 --> 01:04:22,989
screaming,

1516
01:04:22,989 --> 01:04:23,989
kids making mistakes,

1517
01:04:23,989 --> 01:04:24,989
you know,

1518
01:04:24,989 --> 01:04:25,989
there's no purpose in it.

1519
01:04:25,989 --> 01:04:26,989
You know,

1520
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:27,989
if,

1521
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:28,989
if a player sort of,

1522
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:29,989
you know,

1523
01:04:29,989 --> 01:04:30,989
miss hits a pass or miscontrols a ball,

1524
01:04:30,989 --> 01:04:31,989
what's the purpose of highlighting that?

1525
01:04:31,989 --> 01:04:32,989
That there's no,

1526
01:04:32,989 --> 01:04:33,989
there's no learning in that because that,

1527
01:04:33,989 --> 01:04:34,989
that person is not going out there intentionally doing that.

1528
01:04:34,989 --> 01:04:35,989
You know,

1529
01:04:35,989 --> 01:04:36,989
the stuff that I'll highlight,

1530
01:04:36,989 --> 01:04:37,989
if,

1531
01:04:37,989 --> 01:04:38,989
if we've got team structures or something in the team planning that they,

1532
01:04:38,989 --> 01:04:39,989
they don't follow,

1533
01:04:39,989 --> 01:04:40,989
then even then I'd say,

1534
01:04:40,989 --> 01:04:41,989
well,

1535
01:04:41,989 --> 01:04:42,989
why?

1536
01:04:42,989 --> 01:04:43,989
If they're not following it,

1537
01:04:43,989 --> 01:04:44,989
it means my message hasn't been strong enough as to why they need to follow that team message.

1538
01:04:44,989 --> 01:04:45,989
So again,

1539
01:04:45,989 --> 01:04:46,989
it comes back to,

1540
01:04:46,989 --> 01:04:47,989
to positive,

1541
01:04:47,989 --> 01:04:48,989
positive,

1542
01:04:48,989 --> 01:04:49,989
positive,

1543
01:04:49,989 --> 01:04:50,989
positive,

1544
01:04:50,989 --> 01:04:51,989
positive,

1545
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:52,989
positive,

1546
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:53,989
positive,

1547
01:04:53,989 --> 01:04:54,989
positive reinforcement.

1548
01:04:54,989 --> 01:04:55,989
People react to better,

1549
01:04:55,989 --> 01:04:56,989
to,

1550
01:04:56,989 --> 01:05:00,989
to showing them the possibilities of what they can do rather than limiting them by saying,

1551
01:05:00,989 --> 01:05:01,989
look,

1552
01:05:01,989 --> 01:05:02,989
you need to eliminate,

1553
01:05:02,989 --> 01:05:03,989
you know,

1554
01:05:03,989 --> 01:05:04,989
this aspect of,

1555
01:05:04,989 --> 01:05:05,989
of your game.

1556
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:06,989
And,

1557
01:05:06,989 --> 01:05:07,989
and it's,

1558
01:05:07,989 --> 01:05:08,989
and it's born from the fact that that's how I want my teams to play.

1559
01:05:08,989 --> 01:05:09,989
At the end of the day,

1560
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:10,989
I want my teams to be exciting.

1561
01:05:10,989 --> 01:05:15,989
I want supporters to come to the game and be excited by the way the team's playing.

1562
01:05:15,989 --> 01:05:17,989
That's never going to happen if people,

1563
01:05:17,989 --> 01:05:19,989
players feel constricted to,

1564
01:05:19,989 --> 01:05:22,989
and worried about mistakes because everything,

1565
01:05:22,989 --> 01:05:23,989
every,

1566
01:05:23,989 --> 01:05:26,989
thing about the game style I set up is about taking risks.

1567
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:28,989
It's not being risk averse.

1568
01:05:28,989 --> 01:05:29,989
Now,

1569
01:05:29,989 --> 01:05:30,989
the first,

1570
01:05:30,989 --> 01:05:31,989
you know,

1571
01:05:31,989 --> 01:05:37,989
I would have zero chance of achieving what I want to achieve if at the first attempt to play our football,

1572
01:05:37,989 --> 01:05:44,989
I pull people up for mistakes because what's going to happen is they're going to become risk averse and that goes against totally everything I'm trying to prescribe.

1573
01:05:44,989 --> 01:05:45,989
So,

1574
01:05:45,989 --> 01:05:46,989
you know,

1575
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:47,989
I,

1576
01:05:47,989 --> 01:05:48,989
I say at training sometimes,

1577
01:05:48,989 --> 01:05:49,989
I,

1578
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:50,989
I'll have a crack at the coaches and say,

1579
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:51,989
you know what,

1580
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:52,989
training's been too good,

1581
01:05:52,989 --> 01:05:54,989
it means that they're not getting challenged.

1582
01:05:54,989 --> 01:05:55,989
You know,

1583
01:05:55,989 --> 01:05:57,989
like when we make mistakes at training,

1584
01:05:57,989 --> 01:05:58,989
it means that,

1585
01:05:58,989 --> 01:05:59,989
you know what,

1586
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:00,989
they're getting challenged because we're working with good players.

1587
01:06:00,989 --> 01:06:03,989
So that means get the speed of things up,

1588
01:06:03,989 --> 01:06:04,989
you know,

1589
01:06:04,989 --> 01:06:05,989
put more pressure on them,

1590
01:06:05,989 --> 01:06:06,989
make them make mistakes.

1591
01:06:06,989 --> 01:06:10,989
And the players learn from that without it being highlighted as a,

1592
01:06:10,989 --> 01:06:11,989
as a negative,

1593
01:06:11,989 --> 01:06:12,989
you know?

1594
01:06:12,989 --> 01:06:13,989
So,

1595
01:06:13,989 --> 01:06:14,989
you know,

1596
01:06:14,989 --> 01:06:15,989
for me,

1597
01:06:15,989 --> 01:06:16,989
everything that I love about the game,

1598
01:06:16,989 --> 01:06:20,989
I love about sport is in,

1599
01:06:20,989 --> 01:06:21,989
in,

1600
01:06:21,989 --> 01:06:22,989
in achieving the,

1601
01:06:22,989 --> 01:06:23,989
the,

1602
01:06:23,989 --> 01:06:24,989
the unattainable.

1603
01:06:24,989 --> 01:06:25,989
And then along they come,

1604
01:06:25,989 --> 01:06:30,989
if people take risks and are not afraid of making mistakes and the repercussions of mistakes.

1605
01:06:30,989 --> 01:06:31,989
Yeah,

1606
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:32,989
it's brilliant.

1607
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:33,989
You can hear how clear you are on,

1608
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:34,989
on your vision.

1609
01:06:34,989 --> 01:06:38,989
And that is the next dimension about leaders really conscious about how they create and

1610
01:06:38,989 --> 01:06:39,989
share their vision.

1611
01:06:39,989 --> 01:06:41,989
I think you gave us a really good insight into that.

1612
01:06:41,989 --> 01:06:42,989
The risk profile and,

1613
01:06:42,989 --> 01:06:43,989
and,

1614
01:06:43,989 --> 01:06:44,989
you know,

1615
01:06:44,989 --> 01:06:46,989
the 36 game streak without being beaten in,

1616
01:06:46,989 --> 01:06:49,989
in Brisbane war is a great story of that and maintaining possession.

1617
01:06:49,989 --> 01:06:50,989
And,

1618
01:06:50,989 --> 01:06:51,989
you know,

1619
01:06:51,989 --> 01:06:54,989
there were some horrific mistakes that happened that you didn't flinch and you,

1620
01:06:54,989 --> 01:06:55,989
and you,

1621
01:06:55,989 --> 01:06:56,989
you know,

1622
01:06:56,989 --> 01:06:57,989
then went on and the,

1623
01:06:57,989 --> 01:06:58,989
the,

1624
01:06:58,989 --> 01:06:59,989
the group got it and the,

1625
01:06:59,989 --> 01:07:00,989
the,

1626
01:07:00,989 --> 01:07:01,989
the vision was there.

1627
01:07:01,989 --> 01:07:02,989
Can you,

1628
01:07:02,989 --> 01:07:03,989
can you explain a bit that more?

1629
01:07:03,989 --> 01:07:04,989
You're going back to,

1630
01:07:04,989 --> 01:07:05,989
to Scotland.

1631
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:06,989
You've just won the league and I suppose it all starts again.

1632
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:07,989
I mean,

1633
01:07:07,989 --> 01:07:08,989
how do you go about creating the next vision and continuing?

1634
01:07:08,989 --> 01:07:09,989
Yeah.

1635
01:07:09,989 --> 01:07:10,989
And,

1636
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:11,989
and,

1637
01:07:11,989 --> 01:07:12,989
and like I said,

1638
01:07:12,989 --> 01:07:13,989
but it kind of,

1639
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:14,989
for me,

1640
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:15,989
I think particularly with the group I've got now,

1641
01:07:15,989 --> 01:07:16,989
the,

1642
01:07:16,989 --> 01:07:17,989
the way of the,

1643
01:07:17,989 --> 01:07:18,989
the more of a grade,

1644
01:07:18,989 --> 01:07:19,989
whether it's the players or something,

1645
01:07:19,989 --> 01:07:20,989
that's what they'll be expecting from me.

1646
01:07:20,989 --> 01:07:21,989
They won't be expecting for me to come in and say,

1647
01:07:21,989 --> 01:07:22,989
look,

1648
01:07:22,989 --> 01:07:23,989
we're going to do what we did last year because that'll go against everything that,

1649
01:07:23,989 --> 01:07:24,989
that kind of I've been talking about,

1650
01:07:24,989 --> 01:07:25,989
because that would be risk averse.

1651
01:07:25,989 --> 01:07:26,989
That would be saying,

1652
01:07:26,989 --> 01:07:27,989
well,

1653
01:07:27,989 --> 01:07:28,989
you know,

1654
01:07:28,989 --> 01:07:29,989
we've got a successful formula.

1655
01:07:29,989 --> 01:07:30,989
Let's just roll it out again.

1656
01:07:30,989 --> 01:07:31,989
But I know that's not how sport works because,

1657
01:07:31,989 --> 01:07:32,989
you know,

1658
01:07:32,989 --> 01:07:33,989
whether,

1659
01:07:33,989 --> 01:07:34,989
you know,

1660
01:07:34,989 --> 01:07:35,989
every year there's,

1661
01:07:35,989 --> 01:07:36,989
there's,

1662
01:07:36,989 --> 01:07:37,989
if you're,

1663
01:07:37,989 --> 01:07:38,989
if you're part of the chasing pack,

1664
01:07:38,989 --> 01:07:39,989
you're trying to hunt somebody down.

1665
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:40,989
You have to be better than the person that's ahead of you.

1666
01:07:40,989 --> 01:07:41,989
If you're ahead of the pack,

1667
01:07:41,989 --> 01:07:42,989
you've got to be better than you were last year,

1668
01:07:42,989 --> 01:07:43,989
because look,

1669
01:07:43,989 --> 01:07:44,989
one thing you know is whatever marker you've set down is the people who were chasing you,

1670
01:07:44,989 --> 01:07:45,989
the clubs who were chasing you,

1671
01:07:45,989 --> 01:07:46,989
they're going to go surpass that mark you've laid down because that's their objective.

1672
01:07:46,989 --> 01:07:47,989
So we've got to be further ahead.

1673
01:07:47,989 --> 01:07:48,989
That's only going to happen if,

1674
01:07:48,989 --> 01:07:49,989
from the first day of pre-season,

1675
01:07:49,989 --> 01:07:50,989
the guys come in and go,

1676
01:07:50,989 --> 01:07:51,989
okay,

1677
01:07:51,989 --> 01:07:52,989
well,

1678
01:07:52,989 --> 01:07:53,989
you know,

1679
01:07:53,989 --> 01:07:54,989
we've gone up a level again,

1680
01:07:54,989 --> 01:07:55,989
you know,

1681
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:56,989
with terms of our environment,

1682
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:57,989
intensity,

1683
01:07:57,989 --> 01:07:58,989
and tempo in,

1684
01:07:58,989 --> 01:07:59,989
in how we're going to approach things,

1685
01:07:59,989 --> 01:08:00,989
how we're going to play,

1686
01:08:00,989 --> 01:08:01,989
how we're going to work.

1687
01:08:01,989 --> 01:08:02,989
And,

1688
01:08:02,989 --> 01:08:03,989
and,

1689
01:08:03,989 --> 01:08:04,989
and,

1690
01:08:04,989 --> 01:08:05,989
and,

1691
01:08:05,989 --> 01:08:06,989
and,

1692
01:08:06,989 --> 01:08:07,989
and,

1693
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:08,989
and,

1694
01:08:08,989 --> 01:08:09,989
and,

1695
01:08:09,989 --> 01:08:10,989
and,

1696
01:08:10,989 --> 01:08:11,989
and,

1697
01:08:11,989 --> 01:08:12,989
and,

1698
01:08:12,989 --> 01:08:13,989
and,

1699
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:14,989
and,

1700
01:08:14,989 --> 01:08:15,989
and,

1701
01:08:15,989 --> 01:08:16,989
and,

1702
01:08:16,989 --> 01:08:17,989
and,

1703
01:08:17,989 --> 01:08:18,989
and,

1704
01:08:18,989 --> 01:08:19,989
and,

1705
01:08:19,989 --> 01:08:20,989
and,

1706
01:08:20,989 --> 01:08:21,989
and,

1707
01:08:21,989 --> 01:08:22,989
and,

1708
01:08:22,989 --> 01:08:23,989
and,

1709
01:08:23,989 --> 01:08:24,989
and,

1710
01:08:24,989 --> 01:08:25,989
and,

1711
01:08:25,989 --> 01:08:26,989
and,

1712
01:08:26,989 --> 01:08:27,989
and,

1713
01:08:27,989 --> 01:08:28,989
and,

1714
01:08:28,989 --> 01:08:29,989
and,

1715
01:08:29,989 --> 01:08:30,989
and,

1716
01:08:30,989 --> 01:08:31,989
and,

1717
01:08:31,989 --> 01:08:32,989
and,

1718
01:08:32,989 --> 01:08:33,989
and,

1719
01:08:33,989 --> 01:08:34,989
and,

1720
01:08:34,989 --> 01:08:35,989
and,

1721
01:08:35,989 --> 01:08:36,989
and,

1722
01:08:36,989 --> 01:08:37,989
and,

1723
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:38,989
and,

1724
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:39,989
and,

1725
01:08:39,989 --> 01:08:40,989
and,

1726
01:08:40,989 --> 01:08:41,989
and,

1727
01:08:41,989 --> 01:08:42,989
and,

1728
01:08:42,989 --> 01:08:46,250
People will say, okay, we know who he is now.

1729
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:47,430
We're not going to underestimate him.

1730
01:08:47,689 --> 01:08:48,949
We know what he can deliver.

1731
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:52,829
So, you know, all those kind of things that I could have used as tools this year

1732
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:54,090
don't exist next year.

1733
01:08:54,189 --> 01:08:55,550
But, you know, there are other things.

1734
01:08:55,649 --> 01:08:57,050
You know, we're in Champions League this year,

1735
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:58,670
which is going to be unbelievable.

1736
01:08:58,949 --> 01:09:01,850
You know, we're going to be playing against the best football clubs in the world.

1737
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:04,489
What a challenge that is.

1738
01:09:04,489 --> 01:09:08,289
And if you're ever going to talk about being risk-averse,

1739
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:11,729
that's the environment that they get truly tested in, you know.

1740
01:09:11,729 --> 01:09:13,670
So, but I love that bit.

1741
01:09:13,729 --> 01:09:15,069
That's the exciting bit for me.

1742
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:17,930
And again, it comes back to the environment that, you know,

1743
01:09:17,949 --> 01:09:21,770
the players and the staff will come in knowing that, okay,

1744
01:09:21,869 --> 01:09:23,270
we're off on another journey.

1745
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:25,550
We're off, you know, there's another story to tell

1746
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:27,189
and we don't know where it's going to end.

1747
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:30,850
But what we're not going to do is kind of limit our possibilities

1748
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:38,670
of where we could end up by not buying totally into, you know,

1749
01:09:38,729 --> 01:09:39,829
everything we believe in.

1750
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:41,409
And as you said,

1751
01:09:41,489 --> 01:09:41,710
there's, you know,

1752
01:09:41,729 --> 01:09:43,229
there's going to be bumps along the way.

1753
01:09:43,289 --> 01:09:44,430
Like I said right at the start, you know,

1754
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:46,170
I've had a lot of success in my career,

1755
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:49,789
but it's the bits where I was building that success

1756
01:09:49,789 --> 01:09:52,329
that are the most profound to me.

1757
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:53,369
They're the bits I love.

1758
01:09:53,449 --> 01:09:56,050
The end bit's great and everyone's happy and, you know,

1759
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:57,630
you get the trophy and everything.

1760
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:01,770
But, you know, I'm kind of uncomfortable in that space for too long.

1761
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:03,770
I'm looking for the next build, you know.

1762
01:10:03,789 --> 01:10:04,890
That's the bit I love.

1763
01:10:05,109 --> 01:10:07,770
And bizarrely, that's where people go, oh, jeez, that's the worst bit.

1764
01:10:07,869 --> 01:10:10,029
That's really under the most pressure because, you know,

1765
01:10:10,029 --> 01:10:11,529
the results aren't there and people,

1766
01:10:11,729 --> 01:10:14,409
sort of coming at you and going, no, that's the bit you love.

1767
01:10:14,529 --> 01:10:17,909
You know, that's when you put your shoulder in and you go, you know,

1768
01:10:18,149 --> 01:10:21,229
when we come out on the other side, that's the bit you'll reflect on.

1769
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:24,069
That you kind of take pride in that, you know,

1770
01:10:24,069 --> 01:10:26,470
you didn't shift at that moment.

1771
01:10:26,609 --> 01:10:27,970
You kind of stood strong, you know.

1772
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:31,149
And, you know, at the start of last year at Celtic, you know,

1773
01:10:31,189 --> 01:10:34,010
we lost three of our first six games, you know,

1774
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:37,590
which in a league season in Scotland,

1775
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:41,710
if you lose four games, you can't finish first.

1776
01:10:41,729 --> 01:10:43,329
So, we lost three of the first six.

1777
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:46,210
So, you go, oh, we've got to be perfect to win this thing, you know.

1778
01:10:47,149 --> 01:10:49,869
But through that time, that element, I love the fact that, you know,

1779
01:10:49,869 --> 01:10:52,789
everyone kind of bought into it and said, no, let's keep going, you know.

1780
01:10:52,810 --> 01:10:53,529
We're not going to change.

1781
01:10:53,729 --> 01:10:57,750
Yeah, you are counterintuitive, Angie, in lots of your thinking.

1782
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:01,689
And, you know, as I said, it's unique to hear you describe it.

1783
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:06,149
Curiosity is a common word that we associate with leaders

1784
01:11:06,149 --> 01:11:09,170
who operate the way that you do.

1785
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:11,529
And through that, they approach their learning and development.

1786
01:11:11,729 --> 01:11:13,590
Does that word resonate with you, being curious?

1787
01:11:14,449 --> 01:11:15,109
Yeah, I think so.

1788
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:20,109
I mean, I certainly sense that in myself, that I'm constantly, you know,

1789
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:24,770
interested in finding out about things, irrespective.

1790
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:31,210
And you have different sort of interests as you get older and, you know,

1791
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:33,649
you experience more things in life that, you know,

1792
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:37,909
there are other things that you're kind of maybe in the past

1793
01:11:37,909 --> 01:11:40,630
having a great interest in, but all of a sudden, you know,

1794
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:41,489
it might be a person.

1795
01:11:41,489 --> 01:11:44,989
It comes into your life or something that comes across your path.

1796
01:11:44,989 --> 01:11:46,689
You think, oh, I want to find out more about that.

1797
01:11:46,689 --> 01:11:48,729
And it's always been part of me.

1798
01:11:48,729 --> 01:11:56,050
I mean, I'm, you know, always, you know, I used to get, I think,

1799
01:11:56,310 --> 01:12:01,470
20 cents lunch money at school and I used to spend eight cents of that

1800
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:04,729
on the Herald Sun in the morning as an eight year old because I wanted

1801
01:12:04,729 --> 01:12:07,250
to read the paper, you know, I don't know why I was reading the paper.

1802
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:09,250
I mean, I usually read the back pages, right?

1803
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:11,250
But I remember that.

1804
01:12:11,489 --> 01:12:14,829
One of the teachers going, what the hell is a seven or eight year old kid

1805
01:12:14,829 --> 01:12:17,350
doing when you're holding a paper, you know, buying a paper in the morning?

1806
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:18,090
I said, oh, you know.

1807
01:12:18,529 --> 01:12:21,770
So that's always been part of me, I think, that I've always sort of,

1808
01:12:21,829 --> 01:12:29,229
whether that's just for my own sort of self, it helps me feel comfortable

1809
01:12:29,229 --> 01:12:31,470
that I know what's going on.

1810
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:38,369
Again, I often say that the most important thing I do on a daily basis

1811
01:12:38,369 --> 01:12:41,310
is make decisions.

1812
01:12:41,489 --> 01:12:45,409
In my professional life, for the most part, when people come and have a chat

1813
01:12:45,409 --> 01:12:49,010
to me, they're asking for some direction and that usually means

1814
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:49,829
making a decision.

1815
01:12:50,829 --> 01:12:54,390
If I get more of those decisions right than wrong, because I'll never get

1816
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:56,789
all of them right, we've got a better chance of success.

1817
01:12:57,449 --> 01:13:00,170
I'll have a better chance of making more of those decisions right

1818
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:02,949
if I have the right information.

1819
01:13:02,949 --> 01:13:09,949
So I'm really big on, you know, even in areas where maybe I'm not as well informed

1820
01:13:10,609 --> 01:13:11,470
as, you know.

1821
01:13:11,529 --> 01:13:15,090
Because in sport nowadays, you know, you've got, you know,

1822
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:19,270
sports science, there's analysis, there's, you know,

1823
01:13:19,569 --> 01:13:22,350
all these different aspects of the role that are really important

1824
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:24,050
that aren't my expertise.

1825
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:27,829
I have people who've educated themselves and know,

1826
01:13:27,909 --> 01:13:31,289
but I still need to know that information, you know,

1827
01:13:31,289 --> 01:13:34,670
and I try to understand that information so that when I have to make a decision,

1828
01:13:35,449 --> 01:13:36,789
it's a better informed one.

1829
01:13:36,789 --> 01:13:41,069
So I think unless you have that, you know, as a leader,

1830
01:13:41,069 --> 01:13:46,109
that sense of always wanting to at least explore new things

1831
01:13:46,109 --> 01:13:49,989
and taking new things, it's very hard to grow.

1832
01:13:50,149 --> 01:13:52,109
You know, if you're just sort of set in your ways and think,

1833
01:13:52,229 --> 01:13:55,850
well, I don't really want to know anything else apart from what I know right now,

1834
01:13:56,630 --> 01:14:00,229
there's going to be an end date to your ability to relate to people

1835
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:01,430
and communicate with people.

1836
01:14:01,569 --> 01:14:04,229
I mean, it's like I said, I didn't grow up with social media.

1837
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:08,270
Now, I don't engage in any sort of form of social media,

1838
01:14:08,270 --> 01:14:10,350
but that doesn't mean I don't understand it.

1839
01:14:11,069 --> 01:14:14,609
I don't cross it, and I don't have people who give me the information I need on it

1840
01:14:14,609 --> 01:14:18,090
because the people I'm working with, and particularly the players,

1841
01:14:18,609 --> 01:14:21,670
they know all about it, and I'm going to have to deal with that at some point.

1842
01:14:22,229 --> 01:14:24,609
I don't want to deal with it by saying, well, it's got nothing to do with me.

1843
01:14:24,649 --> 01:14:26,289
I've got no idea why you're on it.

1844
01:14:26,649 --> 01:14:31,130
I can't tell a person not to use their mobile phone, a young person today,

1845
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:33,789
because it's just part of their life.

1846
01:14:34,489 --> 01:14:36,869
I mean, you know, as you get older, you know,

1847
01:14:36,869 --> 01:14:39,649
and each generation is the same, you know,

1848
01:14:41,069 --> 01:14:43,109
and people say today, oh, you know, when I was younger,

1849
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:45,489
we were outside all the time, you know, and we were always playing.

1850
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:47,689
We were never inside on the bloody PlayStations,

1851
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,109
and I'm the same with my kids, you know,

1852
01:14:49,409 --> 01:14:53,069
and we kind of wear it as a badge of honour that we were always outside,

1853
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:55,170
but to be fair, we never had the option, did we, mate?

1854
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:58,010
So, you know, maybe if PlayStation was around in those days,

1855
01:14:58,050 --> 01:15:00,130
I might be one of these kids who are inside, you know,

1856
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:03,510
so you need to understand that and be able to relate to that,

1857
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:08,069
and that's where I think, you know, curiosity helps you in that.

1858
01:15:09,109 --> 01:15:11,050
It helps in the most important task,

1859
01:15:11,109 --> 01:15:13,029
you have as a leader, and that is your decision-making,

1860
01:15:13,369 --> 01:15:19,189
because you have to, people come to you for the ultimate say,

1861
01:15:19,289 --> 01:15:21,609
the decision in whatever they're going to do,

1862
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:26,750
and the more informed you are, the better you'll be in giving,

1863
01:15:27,229 --> 01:15:30,210
making the decision that's going to be right for the organisation,

1864
01:15:30,210 --> 01:15:31,850
for the people you're working with,

1865
01:15:32,289 --> 01:15:35,729
and then for yourself as a leader moving forward.

1866
01:15:36,289 --> 01:15:37,510
It's a brilliant answer.

1867
01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:39,289
It resonates really clearly.

1868
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:41,050
Communicating with clarity is a dimension.

1869
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:44,130
It's a dimension as well that we see leaders really focused on,

1870
01:15:44,329 --> 01:15:47,369
and from what I understand, that is a real gift of yours.

1871
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:50,810
As a coach, you get little windows sometimes to make a difference

1872
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:52,810
with your communication at certain stages.

1873
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:54,930
Is that something you can share with us,

1874
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:56,789
how you've gone about your communication?

1875
01:15:57,210 --> 01:15:58,869
Yeah, it's an important part of what I do.

1876
01:15:58,989 --> 01:16:02,770
Again, as I said earlier, I'm not a massive communicator in that,

1877
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:06,170
you know, I'm not constantly talking to players every day,

1878
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:09,010
and, you know, I really kind of give a lot of responsibility

1879
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:11,050
to the other coaches, the other staff,

1880
01:16:11,069 --> 01:16:15,390
and even the players themselves to sort of dictate the day-to-day stuff,

1881
01:16:15,489 --> 01:16:17,369
so they're not constantly hearing my voice.

1882
01:16:17,689 --> 01:16:21,970
So when I do talk, I try and make an impact in those moments,

1883
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:24,810
and, you know, I put a lot of thought into what I'm going to say

1884
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:25,970
and why I'm saying it.

1885
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:30,010
For me, the key is, as you said, is the clarity of message.

1886
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:33,470
You can't, again, I've met so many brilliant people

1887
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:35,930
who have the most unbelievable knowledge,

1888
01:16:36,069 --> 01:16:40,170
and yet when I hear them talk, particularly in front of a group of people,

1889
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:40,930
it gets...

1890
01:16:41,069 --> 01:16:43,090
It's lost when those words leave their mouth.

1891
01:16:43,229 --> 01:16:46,670
You know, they lose the room, not because of their lack of knowledge,

1892
01:16:46,789 --> 01:16:49,989
just their ability to really make that clear and concise

1893
01:16:49,989 --> 01:16:52,689
and relatable to the people they're talking to,

1894
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:54,029
the audience they're talking to.

1895
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:58,229
And, you know, I've worked really hard to try and make sure that,

1896
01:16:59,149 --> 01:17:02,350
you know, the biggest impact I can have in a communicative sense

1897
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:05,670
is that when I talk, there's a purpose behind it,

1898
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:07,289
and it's really clear.

1899
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:10,409
You know, it's not just me talking just for the sake of it.

1900
01:17:10,449 --> 01:17:10,970
And I had...

1901
01:17:11,069 --> 01:17:11,750
I've got plenty of examples.

1902
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:14,229
I mean, there was a couple of coaches I had when I was playing.

1903
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:18,449
I remember one, he used to talk for 45 minutes, 50 minutes before training, you know.

1904
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:22,210
And then we'd go out there, and all of us would be brain-dead by then, you know,

1905
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:25,829
because, you know, we were part-timers back then, like most sport in Australia.

1906
01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:28,390
You know, our guys were plumbers and bricklayers,

1907
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:30,689
and the last thing they wanted to do was come to training

1908
01:17:30,689 --> 01:17:33,050
and listen to the coach talk for 45 minutes,

1909
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:35,670
even though he was a real knowledgeable guy and what he was saying was great.

1910
01:17:35,789 --> 01:17:38,850
But, okay, mate, it's just not working.

1911
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:41,029
And, you know, I kind of understood.

1912
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:45,270
I understood early on that for me to have the biggest impact is that when I spoke,

1913
01:17:46,069 --> 01:17:47,529
like I said, there was a purpose, a clarity.

1914
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:51,550
I got really challenged in Japan with that because, obviously, you know,

1915
01:17:51,909 --> 01:17:53,270
that's, like I said, it's a major...

1916
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:57,029
I think it's a major asset I have, the ability to, in a room of people,

1917
01:17:57,109 --> 01:18:00,489
to be able to sort of have a real clarity of purpose and message.

1918
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:04,890
And when language is taken away from you, because I've got an interpreter,

1919
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:10,369
I've got three interpreters in the room, that became, you know,

1920
01:18:10,449 --> 01:18:10,890
a real sort of...

1921
01:18:11,069 --> 01:18:16,470
a real kind of tricky for me to figure out, well,

1922
01:18:17,829 --> 01:18:23,489
I'm really relying on another person now to get this message the way I want to across,

1923
01:18:23,489 --> 01:18:25,130
you know, and how do I know?

1924
01:18:25,189 --> 01:18:26,590
Because I don't understand what he's saying.

1925
01:18:26,590 --> 01:18:28,890
So I'm saying it in English, he's saying it in Japanese.

1926
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:32,189
The Portuguese guy is waiting for him to finish in Japanese,

1927
01:18:32,189 --> 01:18:36,449
so he can then say it in Portuguese, the Brazilian players, the Thai translator.

1928
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:40,590
So there's four or five people talking in a room while I'm talking.

1929
01:18:41,789 --> 01:18:47,390
And I'm hoping that this isn't Chinese whispers and my message isn't getting diluted or changing along the way.

1930
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:49,069
So how do you know, you know?

1931
01:18:49,069 --> 01:18:50,869
So that was really tough.

1932
01:18:50,869 --> 01:18:54,250
And I ended up, I think I said to the boys in the coaching group,

1933
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:58,750
that I ended up illustrating a bit on, and I'm a terrible drawer,

1934
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:01,510
I'm talking stick figures, but I'd ended up going on a whiteboard.

1935
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:05,189
And while I'm telling the story, starting to draw these stick figures

1936
01:19:05,189 --> 01:19:10,109
and just making sure that what I'm saying, they kind of got as clearly as possible.

1937
01:19:10,109 --> 01:19:10,430
And...

1938
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:14,350
I still do it now, actually, but the boys get a laugh out of it,

1939
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:17,989
even in Scotland, because, like I said, they're terrible drawings.

1940
01:19:17,989 --> 01:19:24,869
But your ability to make an impact and be clear in what you're going to say is,

1941
01:19:24,869 --> 01:19:31,430
I've always felt is probably one of the most sort of vital roles within the group.

1942
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:36,189
You mentioned earlier, Ang, that you've done what you've done without formal mentors,

1943
01:19:36,189 --> 01:19:40,409
and you've often just been comfortable in your own skin enough that the answers were,

1944
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:45,329
within, but collaboration is obviously, you know, essential in team sport at some level.

1945
01:19:45,329 --> 01:19:48,529
We see it as being more relevant than ever.

1946
01:19:48,529 --> 01:19:50,689
How have you gone about collaboration?

1947
01:19:50,689 --> 01:19:55,170
Yeah, as you said, I'm probably a little bit old school in that, in that, you know,

1948
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:59,289
I've kind of haven't had mentors or people I've felt, and as I said earlier,

1949
01:19:59,289 --> 01:20:03,489
I think maybe if I was starting out again in today's world,

1950
01:20:03,489 --> 01:20:06,890
I maybe wouldn't take, do it the way I've done it.

1951
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:13,449
But within that, though, now, even now, I still know that what's really important for me

1952
01:20:13,449 --> 01:20:17,210
is the people I work with, not just the players, but the staff.

1953
01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:22,210
They're a vital sort of conduit to me creating the right environment.

1954
01:20:22,210 --> 01:20:26,890
So in very, in every aspect of it, they're my collaborators.

1955
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:29,130
They're, you know, the people I work with every day.

1956
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:34,689
And I try to empower them as much as I possibly can, give them as much responsibility,

1957
01:20:34,689 --> 01:20:36,810
almost like they feel like they're in charge.

1958
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:42,649
And in many respects, they are, even though I've got sort of my fingerprints all over it.

1959
01:20:42,649 --> 01:20:50,250
You know, as the old adage of, you know, I tell people what to do, but I don't tell them how to do it.

1960
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:52,770
You know, that's their, that's what they bring to the table.

1961
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:56,649
You know, whatever your role is, this is your role, this is what I want you to do.

1962
01:20:56,649 --> 01:20:59,770
But, mate, do it your way, you know, bring your own personality.

1963
01:20:59,770 --> 01:21:05,649
And in a sense, those people, rather than, I think in the end, feeling like they're working for you,

1964
01:21:05,649 --> 01:21:06,850
they're working with you, you know.

1965
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:09,369
And I think that's really important.

1966
01:21:09,369 --> 01:21:19,810
And, you know, I, in kind of, in my game, it's pretty common practice that when you move around as a kind of coach or a manager,

1967
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:24,850
you take a group of people with you because there's a sense of security in that and people understanding.

1968
01:21:24,850 --> 01:21:27,529
And I've tried to shy away from that.

1969
01:21:27,529 --> 01:21:29,449
I've kind of moved myself.

1970
01:21:29,449 --> 01:21:32,930
So even when I went to Celtic, I kind of went there on my own, which was very unusual.

1971
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:36,489
Everyone sort of found it bizarre that I'd move sort of halfway across the world

1972
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:42,890
and I'd take anyone with me, no staff member, no one who already knew me, who I, you know, sort of a trusted ally.

1973
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:45,890
I was literally walking in and I was the only new person in there.

1974
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:49,449
Everyone else was there from last year and, you know, how do you get those people?

1975
01:21:49,449 --> 01:21:55,770
But I love that because that means there's another group of people I've got to sort of get to believe in me and this new vision.

1976
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:59,850
So that means I'm going to be at my best on super high alert.

1977
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:06,170
Whereas if I'd taken half a dozen people with me, maybe that would dull those senses a little bit because I know, well, he's got that in,

1978
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:08,489
he already knows what he's doing, he already knows what he's doing.

1979
01:22:08,489 --> 01:22:11,369
So, you know, I'm kind of not at my best.

1980
01:22:11,369 --> 01:22:21,489
So when I do that, it means that I need to then make sure that everyone who's working with me feels part of,

1981
01:22:21,489 --> 01:22:24,850
you know, an important part of, you know, the machine we're kind of building.

1982
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:31,409
And so, you know, for me, that's where the collaboration comes in is that even though I'm kind of,

1983
01:22:31,409 --> 01:22:37,529
like I said, in many respects people would look at me and say, well, he's very old school in the way I work in terms of,

1984
01:22:37,609 --> 01:22:40,850
well, I'm kind of the dominant leader in the group.

1985
01:22:40,850 --> 01:22:45,090
I think when you walk into the Watch Us work, you wouldn't get that sense.

1986
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:51,130
I think you'd see that everyone is working hard at it.

1987
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:52,369
Everyone has responsibility.

1988
01:22:52,369 --> 01:22:54,770
Everyone's a leader in their own right.

1989
01:22:54,770 --> 01:23:00,449
But asking these two questions, Anz, to every leader, I've had the great privilege sitting down with,

1990
01:23:00,449 --> 01:23:02,609
who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1991
01:23:02,609 --> 01:23:06,930
Yeah, I mean, I think for me, you know, anyone who knows my story will know, you know,

1992
01:23:06,930 --> 01:23:15,439
it's my father and whilst he was the bane of my existence for a long time,

1993
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:26,159
because just his never ending penchant for making me feel like I'm not good enough was annoying.

1994
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:30,720
You know, it's only as I've got older, I've understood why,

1995
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:35,640
where that's kind of taken me to the place I am in terms of the kind of person I am.

1996
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:38,520
And ultimately,

1997
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:42,119
it comes back to that original thing that I just think my father and my mother,

1998
01:23:42,119 --> 01:23:48,199
but particularly my dad, pretty much sacrificed his own happiness

1999
01:23:48,199 --> 01:23:56,640
and his own sort of fulfilments in life to give me the opportunity in the life I've had.

2000
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:00,199
I just think there's no greater sacrifice.

2001
01:24:00,199 --> 01:24:02,359
And he did that how? Just through hard work, mate.

2002
01:24:02,359 --> 01:24:03,239
There was no shortcuts.

2003
01:24:03,239 --> 01:24:08,279
He just worked his backside off, you know, some really strong values, you know, strong family values.

2004
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:15,479
Strong friendships, some real basic stuff that we can be pretty dismissive about.

2005
01:24:15,479 --> 01:24:22,560
But, you know, seeing it, you know, seeing that person who's in your life do that

2006
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:27,680
and then understanding later just what they did do,

2007
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:31,560
I need no greater role model than my father.

2008
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,159
The ultimate leadership, isn't it?

2009
01:24:33,159 --> 01:24:38,000
When you reflect and think someone giving up their happiness to create a better life for you

2010
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:44,199
and, you know, I'm sure the pride in what you've gone on to do would be immense.

2011
01:24:44,199 --> 01:24:49,439
In the spirit of collaboration, Ange, is there anyone that you've looked at in any area of your life?

2012
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:53,439
I mean, clearly your professional life is such a big part of who you are.

2013
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:54,439
But have you looked across?

2014
01:24:54,439 --> 01:24:56,239
And maybe that isn't part of you.

2015
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:58,159
Maybe, as you said, you do tread your own path.

2016
01:24:58,159 --> 01:24:59,000
I use that word again.

2017
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:06,279
But has there been someone who thought, God, if I can collaborate with them in a part of your life, that stands out?

2018
01:25:06,279 --> 01:25:07,079
No, not specifically.

2019
01:25:07,079 --> 01:25:07,960
But I've always kind of...

2020
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:15,479
You know, loved and been inspired by watching people just do things, you know, that little bit differently

2021
01:25:15,479 --> 01:25:20,720
and, you know, go against the grain a little bit.

2022
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:32,720
And whether that's in sort of sport or in any kind of walk of life, you know, I take sort of...

2023
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:37,079
You know, I guess the curiosity kicks in, but I take great inspiration from that.

2024
01:25:37,079 --> 01:25:37,479
And...

2025
01:25:37,479 --> 01:25:37,960
And...

2026
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:55,399
But I've never been the one to kind of say, I wish I could sort of meet him and speak to him because I've had some experience in my life where I've met kind of people that I've thought of as heroes and I've left pretty underwhelmed and pretty disappointed.

2027
01:25:55,399 --> 01:26:02,319
And I've tried to limit that in my life, like that I want to keep them on that sort of pedestal.

2028
01:26:02,319 --> 01:26:04,119
I mean, I hope people don't feel like that about me.

2029
01:26:04,119 --> 01:26:07,800
Maybe they do sometimes, but it's one of those things.

2030
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,319
Where, you know, you kind of...

2031
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:17,880
You just want to look at it for what it is and appreciate it because ultimately we're all human beings, mate.

2032
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:18,979
We've all got flaws, you know.

2033
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,119
No one's perfect, you know.

2034
01:26:20,119 --> 01:26:22,079
Even the greatest of people, you know.

2035
01:26:22,619 --> 01:26:23,800
We all make mistakes.

2036
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,880
We all kind of make decisions that sometimes we know are the wrong decisions, but we still make them, you know.

2037
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,039
That's just...

2038
01:26:30,039 --> 01:26:30,720
You know, I...

2039
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:35,880
I really sort of lament sometimes when...

2040
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:37,380
Particularly today.

2041
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:44,220
In today's world where even some of our greatest achievers, you know, people will still go on,

2042
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:48,079
oh, but they had flaws, you know, because they made some bad decisions in their life.

2043
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:50,199
And I think, well, they're not flaws.

2044
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:51,979
They're just being a human being, mate, you know.

2045
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:54,300
That's just being a person, you know.

2046
01:26:54,319 --> 01:26:56,520
That's just living a life, you know.

2047
01:26:56,539 --> 01:26:58,899
Living a life means you're going to make mistakes, you know.

2048
01:26:58,899 --> 01:27:02,899
And I'm really conscious of that, particularly with young people today, that, you know, we...

2049
01:27:03,819 --> 01:27:05,899
Every mistake they make has such...

2050
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:11,760
Horrendous, sometimes, consequences in terms of what it can mean for their life.

2051
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:13,239
And I just...

2052
01:27:13,239 --> 01:27:14,520
You know, I...

2053
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:16,859
You know, I really struggle with it.

2054
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:18,859
It's a part of life I really struggle with these days.

2055
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:25,199
That we're not allowing people just to be human beings, just to make mistakes like we did when we were younger.

2056
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:26,060
I'm sure you...

2057
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:31,159
You did as much as I did, mate, did things that we go, Jesus, what was I thinking?

2058
01:27:31,319 --> 01:27:33,340
But, you know, we survived that.

2059
01:27:33,399 --> 01:27:34,399
And if anything, we learned from that.

2060
01:27:34,439 --> 01:27:35,939
We can't be a people because of that.

2061
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:37,199
And we're getting...

2062
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:37,680
That's a good point.

2063
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:43,359
And the reason I swing about that is that that's why, you know, when I talk about, you know, people say I'd like to collaborate.

2064
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:44,960
I just...

2065
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:48,180
I love to hear their story and listen to their story.

2066
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:53,760
I don't need to feel like I need to get to know them or get close to them.

2067
01:27:54,180 --> 01:28:00,760
In case maybe there is a character trait that I don't like in them, but not that I would judge them on it, but then I'd walk away thinking,

2068
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:05,779
you know, I wish I didn't know that about them or I wish they, you know, they just left it where it was.

2069
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:06,760
So, yeah.

2070
01:28:08,039 --> 01:28:10,199
That's kind of the space I sit in.

2071
01:28:10,279 --> 01:28:14,039
And that's why I've never really spoken about, you know, well, he's my mentor.

2072
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:15,779
I'd love to really collaborate with him.

2073
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:20,180
Not because of any other reason that, you know, there are plenty of people who are kind of my heroes.

2074
01:28:20,279 --> 01:28:25,140
And I'll make sure they stay that way by not meeting them.

2075
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:27,000
It's a brilliant answer, Ange.

2076
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:28,420
And listening to you, I'm not surprised.

2077
01:28:28,539 --> 01:28:29,340
It's uniquely you.

2078
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,619
And I don't think you can be any other way.

2079
01:28:32,619 --> 01:28:37,319
And your point about we made, you know, extraordinary mistakes, but they weren't.

2080
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:38,000
Highlighted.

2081
01:28:38,039 --> 01:28:41,699
We got to get away with them before everyone had a camera in their hand every single moment.

2082
01:28:41,699 --> 01:28:44,920
And you look back and you think, you know, you would have been cancelled.

2083
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:48,260
You wouldn't be sitting here having this conversation probably because of it.

2084
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:48,979
I'm with you.

2085
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:54,020
You get alarmed around how highlighted they are, you know, particularly in the sporting sphere.

2086
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:56,699
I feel the scrutiny is so intense now.

2087
01:28:56,779 --> 01:29:03,539
Young people have to pay in blood really for the mistakes that we all made and got away with without the public notice.

2088
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:06,619
So, not sure again how to put that genie back in the bottle.

2089
01:29:06,819 --> 01:29:06,939
But.

2090
01:29:06,939 --> 01:29:07,859
But I agree with you.

2091
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:09,500
It's being human and we all are.

2092
01:29:09,659 --> 01:29:18,060
And yours is, it's a uniquely human story, Ange, that we love your humility, love the fact that you're prepared to tell it so openly.

2093
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:20,239
And I'm sure lots of people will learn from it.

2094
01:29:20,659 --> 01:29:22,199
It's a unique path of success.

2095
01:29:22,199 --> 01:29:23,739
And we really appreciate your time.

2096
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:24,359
Thanks for joining us.

2097
01:29:24,699 --> 01:29:25,180
Good man, Luke.

2098
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:25,619
Thanks, mate.

2099
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:26,000
