00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:08,279
This week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast, Anita Jacoby, is a genuine pioneer

2
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:14,060
for female success in Australian media. Anita talks about consistently being overlooked for

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:19,000
promotion simply because she was female. Interesting to hear her thoughts on the world

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,280
of clickbait, fake news that we have today compared with long form investigative style

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,019
journalism that she made her name with. The story of her own father is fascinating,

6
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:34,299
had a huge positive influence in her life, a World War II refugee, the founder of Sony in

7
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:39,780
Australia, to then discover after his death a very dark and tragic side to his life that he

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,780
had never revealed previously. Worth listening to this story because it's a fascinating one

9
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,759
on so many levels. It's people like Anita Jacoby who inspire the work that we do at Alita. We'd

22
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,420
Anita Jacoby is one of the most respected and decorated producers in Australian television

23
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,239
history. A multi-award winning career spanning more than 40 years including renowned program

24
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,019
60 Minutes, Enough Rope, The Guru and Transfer as well as securing interviews with the likes

25
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:10,240
of Bill Clinton, Sir David Attenborough, Jerry Seinfeld, John Travolta, Elton John and many many more

26
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,300
before eventually being headhunted for the managing director role of the Australian arm of Britain's

27
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,719
ITV studios. Anita is a passionate advocate for women in media and leadership, is currently the

28
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:28,039
chair of the ABC's Advisory Council, a board member of Chief Executive Women, Documentary Australia

29
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:34,300
and Women in Media. In 2019 Anita was made a member of the Order of Australia for her incredible

30
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,060
contribution.

31
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:40,340
Anita it's great to catch up with you today. Can I start by saying it feels like you've come a long

32
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:47,580
way from the girl who was expelled as a 15 year old at PLC in year 10. Can I ask you first up if

33
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,500
you could go back and talk to your 15 year old self what would you say? Push the boundaries like

34
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,199
I did when I was 15 because that's how you achieve success and I think look I think a lot of young

35
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:02,919
people when they're starting out they are pushing boundaries because often they don't know who and

36
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,039
what they are and it's only through life.

37
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:10,139
You discover you know who and what your capabilities are. I was fortunate I think a bit

38
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:16,500
like you Luke that I had a very influential father and he allowed influential in my life. I don't mean

39
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,780
that generally I mean that in my life and he actually created sort of some boundaries for me

40
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,039
but he gave me a lot of freedom to find out exactly who I was. So I think lots of young

41
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,240
people rebel when they're young and then they grow up and work out that in life you've actually got

42
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,900
to conform to a degree and probably not say exactly what you think.

43
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:39,840
Nita you've been an incredible pioneer in the male dominated media industry in Australia. How

44
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,000
difficult has it been for when you look back into the 1980s and it just seemed to be an incredibly

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,419
challenging environment for women. Can you reflect on what that was like?

46
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:53,680
Yes look I think growing up in commercial television as you say in the 1980s was pretty

47
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,360
tough for young women. We didn't have any female role models. There were no female mentors. All of

48
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,020
our bosses and senior bosses were male and it was a culture that was very much

49
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:10,340
quite a bullying and harassing culture and you just had to find the inner strength to actually

50
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:16,399
survive it and I remember for example I was working at the Today Show which was the old

51
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,459
nine network. I'm talking about the nine network of old not the nine network of today and I was

52
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:27,480
working as a supervising producer. You know that's the two I see on a particular television show

53
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:34,199
and today being exactly what Carl Stepanovich and Sarah Albo host today and I was

54
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:41,100
put my hand up to become the executive producer, the head of the program. Not once, not twice but

55
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,240
three times and I was passed over because I was young and I was a female and there were no young

56
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,459
females that were running any shows at the time. Not in news, not in current affairs, not sports,

57
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,660
not any entertainment or any other drama. They just didn't exist. So it was quite a tough culture

58
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,959
to grow up in but in some ways I'm glad that I did because it actually pushed me as an individual

59
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,120
to find skills and to be able to do what I wanted to do. So I think it was a really tough culture.

60
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:11,000
I guess the resilience that I probably didn't realize that I had and I think those things are

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,100
I think resilience particularly is really important. And you look back Anita and you know you think of

62
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,699
how heartbreaking that must have been for you having the skills and clearly the

63
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:24,339
ability and the dedication to do those roles better than male counterparts but you would

64
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:29,980
looked up into management it would have been all male and there just genuinely was I know the word

65
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:35,100
for it apart from that misogyny at the time that was commonplace and it just wasn't even

66
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:40,600
considered probably and it's not that long ago and I think it's what I admire a lot about you Anita

67
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,819
not only have you got the resilience out of it but you've genuinely been a champion

68
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:49,000
for wanting to tell those stories and to mentor other women going forward. Is that where that's

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,819
born out of for you the hardship that you faced? I think so. I think because I recognize from an

70
00:05:54,819 --> 00:06:00,560
early stage that mentoring is really important. It actually empowers other individuals to recognize

71
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,120
their own skills and what they're capable of doing. So I think probably the most important thing is that

72
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:10,040
because I was so young and I was desperately looking for you know role models myself and my

73
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:16,759
role model was at home in my father but I didn't have any female role models whatsoever. So I've

74
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,540
gone into the industry and wherever possible I've mentored women. I also mentor you know men who are

75
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:28,000
in media industry as well because I find sometimes we just need others to tell us what we're really

76
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,019
good at and to point out what they can do and also to open door. Mentoring should also be about

77
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:35,120
opening doors as well to create a role model for women. I think that's a really important thing.

78
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:40,720
Opportunities for other people not just for yourself. So I'm really really passionate. I

79
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,060
co-chair an organization called Women in Media and that is all about empowering and mentoring

80
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:52,259
young women to find their capabilities, to find the resilience, the courage and to find where

81
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,420
their strengths lie and to go out into the workplace and really embrace whatever they

82
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:02,459
choose to do in life. And Anita the Jacoby Whatley scholarship is a great legacy as part of what you

83
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:04,519
do and and as you said the

84
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:10,079
change for me is that now you can see Anita Jacoby has been managing director. There actually

85
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,439
are those roles that you really pioneered and created and we've seen you know so many

86
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,779
brilliant females now that do the job as they could have done in the 80s had they been given

87
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:25,800
the opportunity. Has it changed where in 2023 are you comfortable with where the media shift because

88
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,699
it has been slow at times even from my experience working in the industry Anita. We've been slow

89
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:35,120
moving. We're happy to run programs on other people but not so much on the media. So I think

90
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:39,079
that's so good reflecting on our own space and we do it well enough now.

91
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:46,000
I certainly think it's it's a hell of a lot better than it was in the nineteen eighties. But I look at say for example commercial

92
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:59,800
network television. There has only been one female CEO of a commercial network and that has been Maureen Plasvick, who was in I think it was in 2001. So we're talking about now 22 years ago and there has not subsequently been a female CEO or maybe even a female CEO.

93
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:09,959
managing director of a commercial network in Australia. And so I feel that whilst we have

94
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:14,300
made a lot of progress, we haven't made enough progress in order to change that. And I still

95
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,980
think that the big companies, the major media players, their CEOs are predominantly men.

96
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,579
And until we change that, all of that culture and the way that we perceive things

97
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:29,779
flows from the top down. Yeah, it is a really great point you make. And obviously,

98
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,419
I spent a fair bit of time in the sporting world, Anita, in the AFL industry, and it feels like the

99
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,799
change there is happening a lot quicker. We've had several really successful presidents and

100
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:46,379
currently do of AFL clubs and CEOs currently in those roles and much more expanded across

101
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:52,179
board level and senior positions, albeit very slow in the 80s and 90s. So perhaps the media

102
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:58,120
industry still needs to put the mirror up and reflect back on its own performance. Can I go

103
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:04,399
back to Change Gear and talk to you about in the 1990s, you're working as a producer on 60 Minutes.

104
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:12,580
And you have horrific motorcycle accident results in having your leg amputated. Can you talk us

105
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:16,799
through what that experience was like? I mean, clearly horrible physically and emotional,

106
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,980
but how did you cope with that? Well, look, I've always from a very

107
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:27,639
young age been very fit and active, would throw myself into any sports. And I particularly love

108
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:32,120
surfing and diving and swimming. The ocean was my absolute retreat, and it still is.

109
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:38,539
I would always ride motorbikes up at a farm that we had, which was in far north,

110
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:44,139
western New South Wales. And unfortunately, I did, I was a pillion passenger and I had an accident,

111
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,340
which resulted in the loss of my leg. It was one of the most traumatic things that's happened to

112
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:57,259
me in my life. Not because I don't necessarily want to, it's just that I don't like to be branded

113
00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:03,740
in that way. And I think people who have had accidents or have disabilities are often branded

114
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:03,759
in that way. And I think people who have had accidents or have disabilities are often branded

115
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,399
in that way. And I think people who have had accidents or have disabilities are often branded

116
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:09,279
in that way. I think it's becoming less obvious. Yes, it's incredibly traumatic when you're

117
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:16,139
incredibly active to lose a limb. And especially when you're a young female, and you pride yourself

118
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:21,779
on what you wear, how you look, and especially working in an industry where image was everything.

119
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,940
You know, when you look at the media, and you look at television, image is everything that we

120
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:32,399
reflect. And so I found that very difficult to deal with it. But what I did was I just jumped

121
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,399
back into work at 60 minutes. And I think that's what I did. And I think that's what I did. And I

122
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:40,200
went off and travelled the world. And I just relied on my capabilities and my get up and go

123
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,419
in order to achieve what I could achieve. And I don't view that my career has suffered

124
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:51,620
in any way whatsoever as a result. Yeah, which is amazing. I guess you said the

125
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,279
resilience that you've had across your life to be able to deal with that and compartmentalise it,

126
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,039
not want to share it for those reasons, which I can understand completely. But to then,

127
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,240
as you said, go and travel the world and continue doing the work you're doing with

128
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,159
60 Minutes is quite remarkable. You're an incredible storyteller. And I look back and

129
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:13,539
look through your work and read a lot of what you've done. And some of your investigative

130
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:19,139
journalism has been brilliant, including a famous story you broke in 2001 that was titled

131
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,899
The Body Snatchers. Can you tell us a little bit about that and why proper storytelling has been

132
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:29,460
really important to you? Yes. I was working for the Sunday program. And I don't know how many

133
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,220
of your listeners and viewers remember Sunday. It was hosted by Jim Whaley. And it was like a

134
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,519
premier current affairs show on a Sunday morning. Kerry Packer was a huge supporter of it. And we

135
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,440
used to do long form stories, cover stories. And my executive producer had asked me to go and

136
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,419
research the area of organ donation. And I spent a few weeks going through all these files and

137
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:56,700
reading stuff. And I wasn't getting anywhere. And all of a sudden, I came across a story about what

138
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:02,059
they were called ratters. And what had happened was they had been stealing from corpses at the

139
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:03,820
Glebe Morgue in Sydney, which is our

140
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,879
largest morgue. And the ratters had been stealing from corpses, you know, small amounts of money,

141
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:14,899
sand shoes. And what had happened were they were investigated by ICAC, the Independent Commission

142
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:20,419
Against Corruption here in New South Wales. And they had been fined and, you know, ostracized as

143
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:25,980
a result of that. And I couldn't work out why would ICAC investigate some people that were

144
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:31,259
stealing $10 here or sand shoes here. It just didn't seem a big enough story. So I started

145
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:33,700
contacting the ratters just to have a conversation.

146
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,259
And what I discovered through three of these people that I contacted was there was a far

147
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:46,039
bigger story that ICAC had failed to investigate, which was the widespread theft of body parts

148
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:51,960
by doctors, registered doctors from Glebe Morgue, with no permission from any relatives whatsoever.

149
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:58,259
So Helen Daly, the reporter, and I set out to tell the story of a body parts supermarket

150
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:04,220
at Glebe here in New South Wales, our leading morgue, where wholesale theft of body parts,

151
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,519
and I think the power of storytelling to make a change was in this case, that story went to air.

152
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,200
And in fact, it went to air on Sunday, and it went to air on my old alma mater, 60 Minutes.

153
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:22,159
And it created so much interest and government interest that it managed to change number of

154
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:27,460
government acts. So good storytelling, really positive storytelling, and admittedly, this

155
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:33,200
wasn't a positive story per se, can actually lead to fundamental change. And I think that's the

156
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,220
really, that's the gift of storytelling. And I think that's the gift of storytelling.

157
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,039
And it does take investment, as you said, Anita, Kerry Packer, a great, a great supporter,

158
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,840
you know, at the very top of the chain saying we need to invest in long form current affairs. So

159
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:50,019
people like you have got the budget to be able to go and actually find those stories and bring

160
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:54,580
them to attention. And, you know, very distressing, disturbing, I imagine for families that

161
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:00,120
had their loved ones' body parts harvested. It's a pretty gruesome story when you when you think

162
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,220
about it. How do you compare that, Anita, to the sort of clickbait world of 20,

163
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,639
23, where we're sucked into a headline that has no relevance at all to the actual truth of a

164
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,460
story? And it feels like long form journalism that you cut your teeth on is a bit of a dying art.

165
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:21,220
Well, there's still Four Corners. And, you know, there's still other programs that do long form

166
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,860
journalism, thank God. But I think that the rise and rise of misinformation and worse,

167
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,059
disinformation is absolutely, it's a real battle between public interest journalism

168
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:34,220
and what's happening in the media. And I think that's a really, really good story.

169
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,399
Because social media platforms, there is, I go on there, I go on to Twitter, for example,

170
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,379
and read a lot of the, you know, what people are talking about and what all the, you know,

171
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:48,100
key issues of the day are. And there is so much misinformation out there. And it's actually quite

172
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:54,759
disturbing. And I know people or organizations like Google are actually spending more money and

173
00:14:54,759 --> 00:15:00,179
putting more money into actually media literacy, and actually combating misinformation and

174
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:04,200
disinformation, as do I'm involved with an organization called the Australian Journalist

175
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,019
and Media Authority. We are looking at misinformation and disinformation,

176
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,379
because it impacts on all of us. And we actually lose sight of what the truth is.

177
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:20,240
And that's good journalism, good journalism we need in a democracy, because it allows us to

178
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,419
understand the truth. And that's the fundamental core of all good story, all good storytelling and

179
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:29,080
journalism. And it's a really interesting time, Anita, on that front. And, you know,

180
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,039
passionate about leadership. And I feel going forward that the actual,

181
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,240
the search for facts and being able to verify that in a meaningful way is almost going to be a

182
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,039
currency going forward, because it's complex, isn't it? When you've got special interest and

183
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:49,840
huge amounts of money that have got an interest in maybe disinformation, as you said, or trying

184
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:58,940
to skew the truth, or even wholly owned independent advisory boards now that are infiltrated probably

185
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:04,200
by special interest at time as well to produce studies that favor better commercial outcomes,

186
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:10,320
it's, you know, the whole fake news, it sounds a bit like a pantomime at times, but it's now become

187
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,940
so hard, isn't it? We used to be able to sit around and have a debate, Anita, and say,

188
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:18,820
here's the facts, and we can disagree on our thoughts on what we should do with them. But

189
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,200
now we can't even agree on the facts. That seems like a hard genie to put back in the bottle.

190
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,820
That's right. It does. And then you look at America and what's happening with Trump,

191
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,440
and the rise and rise and rise of fake news. And it doesn't matter how many times,

192
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,200
you know, he's before the courts,

193
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,759
and he's, you know, there are the misdemeanors, and there are the charges and everything,

194
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,059
you know, the impeachment, still a percentage of the American population doesn't realize that

195
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:49,080
that's fake news. That's not just misinformation, it's disinformation. And it's deliberately going

196
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:54,480
out there. So it is actually infiltrating, it's impacting on the American culture more broadly.

197
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,100
That's a terrifying scenario in a democracy. It really is.

198
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,980
It is when you've got 74 million people who vote that way.

199
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:03,879
That's right.

200
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:10,119
And, you know, it's such a hotbed conversation. You'll get people who hear, you know, have a dog

201
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:16,039
in a fight to, apart from the fight for, as you said, factual information and truth, and it just

202
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:20,839
becomes so skewed, doesn't it? Any conversation used to be in America, you know, Democrats and

203
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:27,460
Republicans would be great friends and sit around at dinner and debate. Now we're armed, and we want

204
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:32,839
to actually, you know, kill each other because of our difference of opinion. It's, you know,

205
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,200
from a world where you came from,

206
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:41,180
where you genuinely could agree on how a good story was brought to the table. It is an interesting

207
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:45,980
time, isn't it? I don't know where it ends up. Well, I think it's quite scary in America,

208
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,200
because if you look at it, the country is so divided that, you know, it's almost, you think

209
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,859
to yourself, anything could start some sort of conflict within America, where I've always viewed

210
00:17:56,859 --> 00:18:03,039
America as the heart of democracy. But you can't really say that now. Yeah, amazing time. I want to

211
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,200
pivot now to, you know, I think it's a really important time for us to be able to talk about the

212
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,920
story of your incredible memoir that you've written, Secrets Beyond the Screen, and congratulations.

213
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:15,779
It's a brilliant piece of work and enjoyed reading through in preparation for the central to the

214
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:20,519
story. And you've already mentioned your father, Philip, who was a World War II refugee who escaped

215
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:26,559
Germany, self-made businessman, started Sony here in Australia, amongst other incredible things. But

216
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,339
firstly, you start there. Tell us about your relationship with your dad. Look, I was really

217
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:31,380
fortunate to have a father who was very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

218
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,180
very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very. And I think

219
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:39,599
have a father who was very worldly. He was a much older dad. He was, you know, about almost 50 when

220
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:47,079
the time I was born. And he, as you rightly said, he had escaped Nazi Germany and fled to Australia,

221
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,859
the farthest country he could get to, away from what was happening and about to happen in Europe.

222
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:59,619
And he arrived with nothing here in Australia. And I think we often don't recognise how he was

223
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:06,500
a political refugee fleeing Nazi Germany, but how we could view those that flee either persecution

224
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:12,700
or come as migrants, what it's like to arrive in a new country with nothing and set up on your own,

225
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:19,460
which is what my father did. He was a very clever businessman, and he managed to create a company

226
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:25,819
that was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. No mean feat, I don't think. And mind you, I'm

227
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:29,539
biased, of course. And you get this with your kids and your father and your...

228
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:38,000
Real relationships. But he was a very clever man, and he just taught me to feel very comfortable

229
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,220
as a young woman in my own skin. And I think if a parent can do that, particularly to a young woman

230
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:49,019
or, you know, to a young male, that's a really important thing. It sort of sets you up for the

231
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:52,920
life that you're going to pursue. He was a very, very strong role model for me.

232
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,380
And clearly, Anita, you've got great affection for your dad and the role that he played in your life,

233
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:58,720
which is...

234
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:02,799
As you said, what a gift, isn't it? You've got someone who has that influence over you. But you

235
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,920
open your book with a Nietzsche quote that I want to read back to you. Underneath this reality in

236
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,000
which we live and have our being, another and altogether different reality lies concealed. And

237
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,660
so you've uncovered through your research that there was a dark side to your dad and a past that

238
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:24,700
was somewhat disturbing is the only way I could describe it. How do you relate that to the person

239
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:29,339
that you loved and know when you've gone back and found out lots of things that you weren't able to

240
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:30,019
imagine yourself?

241
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:37,799
Look, I found that very difficult. I think most kids, a lot of kids have a very idealized version

242
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:42,819
of their parents and they accept their parents' life from when you're born and you move forward.

243
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,259
We very rarely ask our parents about their lives before you came on the scene. And then when you

244
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:55,559
come on the scene, it's all about going to tennis lessons or ballet or whatever. So about many years

245
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:59,599
after he'd passed away, I was at a dinner party. And I was at a dinner party and I was at a dinner party

246
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:04,180
and lots of lawyers and journalists, a lot of alcohol had been drunk. And all of a sudden,

247
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:09,039
one of the lawyers looks me directly in the face and said, do you know about this infamous court

248
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:15,380
case involving your father in the 1950s? And he bounced off some legal cases that we'd been

249
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:21,299
talking about. And when he said that about this infamous legal case in the 1950s, way before I was

250
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:27,519
born, I had no idea what he was talking about. And I, like most of us, thought that I knew my

251
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,680
parents and I knew my father and I knew him. And I thought, well, I don't know. I don't know. I don't

252
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,599
know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

253
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:33,460
know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. But I actually knew probably this of

254
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:41,700
that. And yes, I uncovered some really dark parts about his past that I had no knowledge of, which

255
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:48,559
is, as a storyteller and as a journalist and a producer, quite confronting to find after you've

256
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,779
told hundreds and hundreds of stories all over the world, only to find the most extraordinary story

257
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:59,380
in your own family, in your own backyard that you weren't aware of, was quite confronting.

258
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:06,140
And especially when I found out things about him that I'm not sure that he would have wanted me to

259
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:11,980
find out about, to be honest. Nietzsche was referring to the fact that we all have our

260
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:18,160
secrets, that we are like icebergs. You can see that top bit, but there's not a lot that you can

261
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,759
see below the surface. And we keep a lot of stuff to ourselves. And I think as a father,

262
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,299
you might appreciate some of that. I don't judge my father for the decisions that he made in his

263
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:35,819
life. But I really found that I was confronted by some of those decisions and found them quite

264
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:41,400
disturbing. Yeah, that's an incredible perspective you've got, Anita, that forgiving element to you.

265
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:47,660
I think most people would struggle when you uncover that two of his partners committed

266
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:53,900
suicide, not that long apart, and the same tragic way. And your half-sister at the age of four was

267
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,400
sent off to boarding school in what has to be a fairly brutal way. I mean, they're

268
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:04,460
not great reflections, are they, as an independent person looking at someone who was brilliant to

269
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:11,779
you. How do you sort of reconcile with that, that clearly he had an amazing impact on you in a

270
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:16,400
positive way, but perhaps didn't have that with others? It's a hard one to get your head around,

271
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:23,240
isn't it? It is. It is. And look, I recognise that we're all flawed individuals. Some have

272
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:29,140
greater flaws than others. I don't condone his behaviour, but I also

273
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:35,420
think maybe he was attracted to vulnerable women, as some men are. I don't try and rationalise it,

274
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:41,980
and I don't try and excuse what happened. It would have been a terrible circumstance to have been

275
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:48,180
in that position that he was. And I also, what I've learnt with my sister that you referred to

276
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:54,019
who was four when she was sent off to boarding school, I can rationalise that in the sense that

277
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:59,279
if you're a man who's arrived with nothing, and you have a young child, and you don't have

278
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:04,099
a mother for that child, and you have to try and somehow make an income during the war,

279
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:10,660
you know, and after the war, times were really tough for people. So I can step back and very

280
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:16,480
objectively try and look at that. What it's given me is an understanding of my sister better,

281
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,680
which I think is a gift in the sense that we get on much better now, because I understand some of

282
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,420
the factors that influenced her life when she was growing up, that I had no understanding of when I

283
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,180
was younger. Clearly, that resilience comes out in

284
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:29,279
you.

285
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:34,220
And all the storytelling, and I'm full of admiration for the way you handle it. Even

286
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,740
that story, I think, would sort of rock a lot of people. What are the traits you think that help

287
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:44,960
you to be able to get that perspective? I think because I'm quite pragmatic,

288
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,980
I like to get to the truth of whatever I'm doing. I think it's really important knowing truth,

289
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:57,819
not just as a journalist or television producer, but as an individual, understanding truth and

290
00:24:57,819 --> 00:24:59,279
getting to that, and then being able to put it into a story. And I think that's really important.

291
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:04,579
process that truth. And recognizing that's part of your heritage, that's part of your background.

292
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:10,740
It doesn't define who you are. But it's you, you come to a recognition that that has actually

293
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:16,660
shaped who and what you are. I, as I said earlier, I now see that my father was a much more flawed

294
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:23,859
and complex man than I ever imagined when I was growing up. Does it make me love him less? No,

295
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:28,960
it doesn't. I still love him very dearly. But I now see him with a different lens.

296
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:34,480
And I think that's, for me, at my age, when I think probably one of my greatest regrets is I

297
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,759
could never sit down and have this conversation with him and ask him all the dozens and dozens

298
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,720
and dozens of questions I'd love to ask him. Well, I can't do that now.

299
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:50,579
And as you said, we, yeah, sorry to interrupt. As you said, we are all, you know, flawed at every

300
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:56,960
level, to the core, all of us, isn't it? And we choose to show the parts of us to those that are

301
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
closest to us. And everyone has.

302
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:04,599
An element to them. It's, yeah, profound story the way that, as you said, you've been telling

303
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:08,779
stories all around the world. To have one so close to home that you didn't know about is quite

304
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:14,680
remarkable. I love what you've done, Anita, in the leadership space around mentoring women. And

305
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:21,240
I lifted off a whole range of actionable things that you do. You know, you look after and make

306
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,079
sure that people have a better opportunity and maybe an easier path than you've had.

307
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,000
When we sit down and talk to people like you,

308
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:34,140
I feel like there's some successfully clues, patterns around how people do have a successful

309
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,160
life. And we often start with this idea of self-leadership, but it's hard to actually

310
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,880
impact someone else without an idea of your own self-leadership. Does that make sense to you?

311
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,140
Yeah, it does. It does. I think self-leadership is actually living life with a purpose.

312
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:54,940
And I've always done that, actually, since I was fairly young. You know, I grew up in a household

313
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:59,180
where we did support, you know, those less privileged,

314
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:05,500
I think I mentioned my father was very successful. And so I was taught always to

315
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:13,220
support and help others that are less privileged than yourself. And I think I've applied that

316
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:18,680
throughout my life. And having a meaning and a purpose in life gives you a perspective on who

317
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,680
and what you are. And I think that's really for, you know, self-leadership, that's a really

318
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:29,180
important aspect of it. Having purpose and having purpose in leadership is really,

319
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:34,859
really important. And having purpose and meaning, you know, all feeds into one another,

320
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:40,220
but it comes directly from you as a leader and your personal values. And I think personal values

321
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:46,079
are getting increasingly important. I think, you know, in days gone by, we didn't really talk about

322
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:50,859
empathy and emotional quotient, and we might have talked about resilience and courage,

323
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:57,599
but we never talked about how you deal with people on an empathetic level. And I think increasingly,

324
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,279
what I'd call a human,

325
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:03,680
human principles of leadership are becoming more and more critical in the way that you

326
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,579
manage and interact with people. And that's why we love sharing these

327
00:28:07,579 --> 00:28:12,079
stories in lots of ways, Anita, because, you know, empathy is a skill in some ways. Some

328
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,960
people are born with a lot of natural empathy, but you can practice it. You can actually

329
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:21,359
pass that on and want to, you know, particularly in a position of power to be more empathetic.

330
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,319
There's no downside to that at all. And your description is really apt. How do you go about

331
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:29,220
positively impacting others in your

332
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,960
environment? You've been in a lot of diverse environments, and we see people really conscious

333
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,400
now about the impact they have on everyone on a daily basis.

334
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:40,940
Oh, I think it's an attitude of caring. I mean, if I would walk into an office every day,

335
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,680
and whoever's sitting on the reception desk or wherever, I will always say, hello,

336
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:52,259
how are you? Just those simple things that show that you care about them. And I'll engage in

337
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:57,619
conversations, not just on a work level, but on a social level, so I understand how people are

338
00:28:57,619 --> 00:28:59,200
feeling. I think

339
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,500
listening is a really important element of this. And I probably, because I've, you know,

340
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:07,819
worked with Andrew Denton and John Laws, and I've listened to great interviews,

341
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:15,099
the art of listening gets lost in a lot of leadership. It's not just hearing or thinking

342
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:19,660
that you're hearing what somebody's saying, but actually stepping back and trying to analyze what

343
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:25,579
they are really saying. And also the art of active listening, that, you know, the body language that

344
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:29,200
somebody's exhibiting is actually really interesting in probably, actually, I don't know,

345
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:34,759
showing you what they're not saying, as opposed to what they are saying. So I think there are some

346
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:39,619
certain leadership skills that are really important, that aren't hard to actually adopt in

347
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:45,519
your leadership style. And when you talk about empathy, I guess I'm fortunate in, or fortunate,

348
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:50,680
I've told stories with a lot of, in a lot of cases where there's been great tragedy,

349
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:56,500
and I've had to muster those skills of empathy and really apply them. For example, looking after

350
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,000
the families of the Ivermellat backpacker,

351
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,559
a case, you know, I looked after four of the families throughout three months of a trial here

352
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:09,619
in Sydney. That was one of the toughest things I ever worked on. Sitting in a court, hearing the

353
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:15,599
most appalling evidence day in, day out for three months, with four families and looking after those

354
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:21,900
families, you can't but not be empathetic to what they've experienced. And I think empathy comes

355
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:28,339
from actually understanding other people, and understanding that they are facing sometimes the

356
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:29,200
most horrendous of situations. And I think that's one of the things that I've worked on,

357
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:35,420
or less. It could be a drug and alcohol problem. It could be, you know, anything. You need to find

358
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,779
that empathy, and you need to learn to have empathy. And when we've all been in that situation,

359
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,079
that's what you want, isn't it, from those around you, is that just authentic sense that someone

360
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:49,680
cares. But clearly, you haven't done what you've done in your life, Anuta, without a clear vision

361
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:55,240
and a sense of purpose. How have you gone about sharing and creating that vision for your life

362
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,200
that has been pioneering, is the word I've used a couple of times.

363
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:07,519
Oh, look, I think I've always liked to look at innovation as a part of, you know, how am I going

364
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:13,920
to share a vision and create a vision. I was at one stage managing director of ITV, which is,

365
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:18,500
as you mentioned earlier, it's the Australian operation of the British conglomerate and,

366
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:24,519
you know, PLC company. And I walked in to start as managing director and found there was only

367
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:29,200
one commission, you know, which was only, was worth less than $2 million. We had a lot of

368
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:34,059
staff, a large number of contractors. So I immediately started to think, well, I have to

369
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:39,480
have a vision for this company. I have to actually have a strategic approach as a leader. And my

370
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,099
approach was literally to start hanging out the shingle to attract digital natives and creative

371
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:50,220
people, start building programs around known celebrities that networks would want to buy

372
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:57,200
programs from, you know, and featuring. I looked at the formats that ITV, not just me, it was with

373
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
a team. I don't want to take all the credit for this.

374
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,900
I worked with a team. We looked at some of the formats that ITV had internationally,

375
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:10,000
and we recognised that we could adapt them to the Australian marketplace. So I was providing

376
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,420
a vision and a direction on what this company could do. And as a result, we successfully,

377
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:20,819
I successfully sold I'm a Celebrity to 10, which is still on air today, and which has done very

378
00:32:20,819 --> 00:32:26,019
well for 10. We sold The Chase to Channel 7, which turned Channel 7's fortunes around.

379
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,059
So it was coming in and looking at an organisation,

380
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:35,700
and thinking, how can I take this organisation, which was Morabund, to the next level by looking

381
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:41,059
at those forces about the digital world, about digitising assets, looking at those things that

382
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:46,740
you could do as a leader, but setting an example and actually provoking discussion and ideas,

383
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,740
creative ideas, and creating a hotbed for ideas. Because that's what, at the end of the day,

384
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,700
in my industry, it's all about ideas and creativity.

385
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:59,200
And the courage to get them, you know, to the line, isn't it?

386
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,980
It's a lot of fail. And then, as you said, there are a couple of huge transformative

387
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:10,460
success stories, I'm a Celebrity and The Chase for both those networks. But in a competitive space,

388
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:16,079
you can't have too many misses. And I always admire, as you said, the creative space of being

389
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:21,019
able to do that regularly, to me, is a skill that's really fascinating to understand. And

390
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:25,259
clearly, you've done a great job with that. We see leaders that have the success, like we've

391
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:28,819
just talked about with you, are really curious. And through curiosity, that's how they

392
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,819
think about constantly learning and get better. What do you think about curiosity?

393
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:40,380
Oh, I think it's, well, I'm a journalist. I go to a dinner party, and I never, it's interesting,

394
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,460
I'm sitting talking to you today, but I'll go to a dinner party, and I'll ask whoever's sitting

395
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:50,160
around me a thousand questions, but I'll never say anything. I think curiosity is really, really

396
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:55,319
vital. Because, I mean, if you're not curious about the world, curious about the people you

397
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:59,140
associate with, curious about the business that you're running, curious about being,

398
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:04,759
you know, a good leader, then how can we possibly succeed? Curiosity should be at the heart of

399
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:05,779
everything that we do.

400
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:10,820
Beautifully, beautifully said. You're in the communications business as well, and we see

401
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:16,139
now communicating with clarity is a skill that a lot of leaders are really passionate about.

402
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:21,559
That's been your stock standard trade from day one. How have you gone about it?

403
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:29,139
Well, communication to me is about telling stories. So it's really about informing and,

404
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:34,900
you know, entertaining audiences, but also it's really about listening. Again, what I was saying

405
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:39,059
earlier, in order to communicate, you need to listen, because you need to understand what

406
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:44,340
somebody is saying in order to communicate back to them. And as I said earlier, it's actually about

407
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:50,079
often what people are not saying rather than what they are saying. And look, I've been fortunate to

408
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,599
be involved with, you know, hundreds and hundreds of interviews from Bill Clinton to some of the

409
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,960
people that you named earlier. I've listened to some of the great communicators of the world,

410
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:04,420
communicate. They're very clear, they're very sharp, they're on message. They've got, you know,

411
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,380
what they're setting out to say, whatever that is, very clearly. And you can tell in interviews,

412
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:14,960
and I've listened to enough of them to know what that message is. So that's what communicating is

413
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,860
about. It's being able to actually talk to somebody on a one-on-one and come away and,

414
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,460
you know, really feel like you've both gained something from that communication, whatever that

415
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,119
is. I'm sorry, it sounds a bit naff, but I think...

416
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:31,579
I think communication's at the heart of everything that we do.

417
00:35:32,179 --> 00:35:36,539
I agree wholeheartedly. And, you know, we love sharing the different perspectives on it,

418
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:40,019
isn't it, from someone that is in the communications industry, but it's overlooked

419
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:46,679
often in other spheres around just how much you can achieve by consistently communicating well

420
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:52,360
with your team or being, you know, informed. And you look at people in different areas and

421
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,800
different spaces. The ones that succeed consistently are really, really understanding.

422
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,900
You don't have to be a naturally great orator,

423
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:03,440
or, you know, come up with brilliant inspirational quotes, but it's just the

424
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,880
consistency of it, I think, in lots of ways, Anita, is a real pattern that we're seeing.

425
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,340
Likewise with collaboration. How important has collaboration been for you?

426
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:17,280
Oh, incredibly important. I mean, I've been fortunate to collaborate with some very

427
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,340
talented and creative people. I spent 10 years collaborating with Andrew Dent, and

428
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:28,780
that was one of... That was a fantastic partnership. You know, we collaborated on enough rope,

429
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:33,400
which was a very successful interview show. We collaborated on the Gruen Transfer,

430
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:38,059
which was a very innovative program. Can you imagine going to the ABC and trying to sell

431
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:44,159
a program on advertising when you've got a charter that says you can't have ads on the ABC?

432
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,880
It's genius, isn't it, Anita? I'd love to, sorry, just jump in there. And Gruen,

433
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:54,159
with my great old mate, Will Anderson as host, is still just brilliant. And, you know,

434
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:58,920
that creative idea that came out of your space with Andrew Dent, it's brilliant, isn't it? To take

435
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:06,159
to the ABC was such success. Worth pressing pause for a moment to understand how good that was.

436
00:37:06,579 --> 00:37:11,340
Well, but I've got to say, Luke, it originally started, the Gruen Transfer originally started

437
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:16,940
as three one-hour documentaries. And then what we realised was there was so much material there,

438
00:37:17,139 --> 00:37:20,960
it then became apparent that you could build a panel show. But yes, as I said,

439
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,159
going into pitch that day, the Gruen Transfer to the head of editorial policy and the director

440
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:28,860
of television, and they're sitting there looking at us, they're like,

441
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,199
this is brilliant. This is brilliant. This is brilliant. This is brilliant. This is brilliant.

442
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:33,719
15 years ago now, it's been on air. I think this is heading into its 15th season.

443
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:38,960
They just looked at us blankly, like, how could you possibly, how could we possibly

444
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,360
put ads on the ABC? But then they came around to recognising that what we were doing was actually

445
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:49,800
looking at the psychology of people and what advertising tells us about ourselves. And so

446
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,480
once we were able to flip it and show them, they embraced the idea straight away. And Will

447
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,460
Anderson has been absolutely fabulous as a host. He's a brilliant host. And

448
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:58,860
Yeah.

449
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:03,159
Russell Howcroft, I love those, the most passionate person about advertising,

450
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:09,300
having Russ sitting there on the ABC, brilliantly cast and a great piece of creativity.

451
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,699
And then who's been the greatest leader in your life?

452
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:20,420
The greatest leader, I think, probably a man called Kevin Weldon. Kevin Weldon,

453
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:26,119
to your audience, if they don't know of him, he formed and founded a company called Paul

454
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:28,840
Hamlins here in Australia. It was one of the largest book publishing,

455
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:35,019
publishing companies in Australia, extremely successful. And I worked with Hamlins when I

456
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:40,519
first came out of school. And Kevin was an incredibly entrepreneurial man. So I was about

457
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:47,119
18. And I started there and we were given mini minors and we were dressed up in outfits and

458
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,920
sent out to sell books because he was such an entrepreneurial character. But what he taught

459
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:58,719
me really was to always not to be afraid of risks at all. At 18, he gave us all an

460
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:02,679
assignment. There were eight of us, eight marketing trainees that he brought on straight

461
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:08,039
out of school. And the assignment was that we had to go and ring somebody important and set up an

462
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:12,880
interview and go and interview them. Now you can imagine at 18, I was pretty intimidated by that,

463
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:19,019
even having had a very strong father. I was given Sir Robert Norman, who was then the CEO of the

464
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:24,300
Bank of New South Wales, which is now the Westpac Bank. And I went home and I did all my research

465
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,699
and I spent an hour with Sir Robert Norman talking about the economy. I knew nothing,

466
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:35,739
about the economy, I've got to say. I just sat there and actually spent an hour talking to him.

467
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:41,679
What it taught me was that anybody's accessible. And Kevin Weldon gave me these great skills to

468
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:49,940
recognise resilience, courage, entrepreneurial, being entrepreneurial. He was just a terrific

469
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:56,039
boss to have at a young age in my life. And he informed a lot of my thinking about the way to

470
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:57,719
approach business and be a leader.

471
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:58,559
Yeah, what a great,

472
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:03,800
what a great idea, isn't it? Have an 18-year-old go and interview someone at that level of CEO of a

473
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:09,139
bank in that time. It must have been transformative. It can clearly set you on a path too, didn't it,

474
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:15,099
to securing interviews with people. As you said, everyone's human, everyone has got a story to tell

475
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:19,900
and why not with you? And that's formed a big part of your life. If you could collaborate with

476
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:26,519
anyone on anything, as you said, you have worked with Andrew Denton and John Laws and, as you said,

477
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:27,960
back to the Kerry Packer era.

478
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:33,739
Through Current Affair, has it been someone you thought, God, this would be in any area of your

479
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:35,260
life that you'd love to collaborate with?

480
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:40,340
Do you know who I wished I'd been able to collaborate with when he was much younger

481
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:49,239
was Sir David Attenborough. Because I just feel here he is, he's 95 or 96. And he had a recognition

482
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:54,460
about endangered species. And he had a recognition about the way that the planet was changing with

483
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,559
climate. And I wish we'd been able to tell that story about 30 years ago.

484
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:04,559
So when my collaboration is actually a retrospective of going back and being able to actually inform

485
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:09,460
people far earlier than we really started to become aware of this issue. And I think he was

486
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:14,940
one of the shining lights, both an endangered species and the nature of climate change. And

487
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:20,320
I would love to have collaborated with him to tell stories then in order to educate audiences

488
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:25,960
about how audiences, the whole of society, about how important these issues are.

489
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,699
Remarkable human being in every sense of the word.

490
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:35,960
And still creating incredible stories and wisdom around, as you said, someone that picked that

491
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,739
many, many, many years ago. Anita, it's a great story of yours. I love

492
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:47,280
listening to it, understanding the industry a little bit and what you were able to do to break

493
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,760
new ground for so many females. And what I love even more as much is just how you are passing

494
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:58,699
that on and in a really profound way of mentoring the next generation to break through what was a

495
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:04,900
challenging situation. And congratulations on all your work and your book is fantastic. Have a

496
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:11,119
look at it. It's genuinely worth a read, a great memoir and a fascinating, intriguing story along

497
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,860
the way. I couldn't believe the twist and turn. So thanks for joining me today.

498
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,380
Isn't it incredible? I mean, every chapter, every time I sat down to write a chapter,

499
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:23,340
I realised there was another story. So it's just, in some ways, as I said earlier,

500
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,800
it's really easily the hardest story I've told.

501
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,639
Secrets beyond the screen with Anita.

502
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:29,960
Jacoby, thanks for joining me today.

503
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,639
Luke, thank you so much for your time. I appreciate it.
