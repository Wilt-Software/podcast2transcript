00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:12,119
This week's conversation is with a truly incredible young Australian, Ariane Titmuss.

2
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,920
You know the name from her remarkable achievements in the pool at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,320
She won two gold medals, defeating one of the greatest Olympians of all time,

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,199
Katie Ledecky from the US in the 400 metre freestyle.

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,480
I found this conversation incredibly valuable, not only from a sporting context,

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:36,460
but the hacks and life lessons you learn from a 21-year-old who has achieved incredible success.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,320
What was unique about it and something that I loved was hearing Ariane's approach to life post-Olympics

8
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:45,719
and her unique perspective on chasing the perfect race

9
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,899
and how she sees the opportunity for constant and never-ending self-improvement.

10
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:55,560
I always find it incredibly interesting listening and learning and talking to sports people like Ariane

11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,380
and how they approach their life and leading in their own world.

12
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,840
It's really the basis for the work that we do in our leadership business, Alita.

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,140
And we've had the great pleasure of working with incredible leaders like Ariane,

14
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,659
Ange-Posta Coglou, Mikel Arteta from Arsenal, just to name a few.

15
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:14,780
And we would encourage you to check out our signature Alita Connect program,

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,219
Head to alitacollective.com.

19
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,319
At 21 years of age, Ariane Titmuss has remarkably etched her name in the history books

20
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,780
as one of Australia's most decorated athletes.

21
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:49,980
Arnie, as you're affectionately known, you just told me you feel like you're in trouble

22
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,939
if we refer to you as Ariane.

23
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:54,780
It's an amazing story of success and dedication.

24
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:56,719
I really appreciate you joining me today.

25
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,500
No, thanks for having me.

26
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,239
It takes enormous dedication and discipline to swim the case that you did to push yourself

27
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,959
through that enormous pain every day to achieve what you have.

28
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,620
Can I ask you?

29
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,139
How have you found that sense of leadership and discipline within yourself?

30
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,500
I think that it came quite naturally to me.

31
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,460
I mean, I've been doing this since I was quite young.

32
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,120
I went on my first overseas trip when I was 14 for World Juniors.

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,860
So I think that it's just something I've grown up with.

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,240
And I had to really become used to it quite quickly, you know,

35
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,840
especially doing school as well as training as a professional athlete.

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,020
I think you have to kind of take it in your stride.

37
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,500
And if you want to achieve something great and, you know,

38
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,139
I had to.

39
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,039
I understand that if this is the path I wanted to go down,

40
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:43,099
I had to get used to it pretty quickly,

41
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,879
handling the training and everything else going on in my life.

42
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:52,680
But I feel like, I don't know, I just, I think I'm a very scheduled person.

43
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,860
I am very routined.

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,340
And I think that in my nature, it came quite easy.

45
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,639
Before we just start, press record, I said, hello, how's your day?

46
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,300
And you said, oh, it's really quiet for me at the moment.

47
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:04,740
But you have been in the pool.

48
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:05,860
You've done a gym session.

49
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,919
And as you said, there's a bit of a gap between,

50
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,020
now and the world championships in July next year.

51
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,520
Do you still have like normal people, your days where you go,

52
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,439
I just don't want to get out of bed today?

53
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,539
Or do you find that easy?

54
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:19,139
I think those are the days I'm having at the moment.

55
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:24,539
I think after having a break and sleeping in and having to quickly set the alarm

56
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:28,120
to quarter to six, it's tough getting back into it.

57
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:32,699
But it's very rare that I wake up not wanting to go training

58
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:38,139
or it's very rare in the afternoon I wake up from a nap and I'm not motivated.

59
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,699
I feel really motivated to go to training.

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,780
And obviously in the middle of the year, it's such a grind and I'm tired all the time.

61
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,419
But I always believe there's a purpose for every session.

62
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,599
And I freak out if I'm not going to go to one.

63
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,439
You know, there's money in the bank that I haven't stashed.

64
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:57,840
So I never really, you know, feel like that.

65
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,180
And every session, especially in like swimming, every session has its purpose.

66
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,719
And I, yeah, I don't really want to miss one.

67
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,500
Go back to 2019.

68
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,900
And Katie Ledecky and you get mentioned in the same sentence.

69
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,120
I think every time someone speaks to you at that stage,

70
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:16,980
she was a 15-time world champion, a five-time gold medalist

71
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,600
and one of the world's greatest ever Olympians.

72
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,560
And you beat her at the world championships.

73
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,180
But for me to then go into the Olympics, you know, a short time later,

74
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,740
in effect a couple of years later and win the 200 and 400

75
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,759
with all of that pressure coming your way,

76
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:35,379
there was so much expectation, performance anxiety.

77
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:37,079
I mean, can you pass on to us?

78
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,459
How did you cope with that?

79
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,699
All of us deal with pressure, but that was extreme pressure

80
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,899
and you seemed to take it in your stride.

81
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,399
Yeah, I think that looking back now,

82
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,759
I don't think I realised how much weight was on my shoulders.

83
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,240
And I think kind of being in a bit of a bubble because of COVID

84
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,939
prior to the Olympics in the lead up,

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,300
I think that we didn't actually see everything that was being said in the media

86
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,259
or we didn't really, we weren't really immersed in society.

87
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:06,879
So we weren't really feeling, you know, the angst around the Olympics.

88
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,480
And the expectation.

89
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,720
And so I think looking back now, that probably helped me.

90
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,620
But I like to think that the pressure that I put on myself

91
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,279
and that my coach puts on me is somewhat higher than external pressures.

92
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,759
And I think that if I can deal with that, then I can deal with anything really.

93
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,120
And, you know, I think I'm pretty good at sticking in my lane

94
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,120
and doing what I have to do.

95
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,579
But looking back now, it was a pressure cooker situation.

96
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,139
Olympics is like nothing else.

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,879
The rivalry.

98
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,939
The rivalry between Katie and I, I know, was definitely highlighted.

99
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,660
And I did feel the pressure.

100
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:47,199
Like I was worried, you know, if I don't win, what the, you know,

101
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,639
what the reaction is going to be.

102
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,959
But I'm happy that it all went to plan.

103
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,740
And we fell in love with you and your story at the Tokyo Olympics.

104
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,680
And for me, not only the victory,

105
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:02,959
but the grace and the sportsmanship you show was equally as impressive.

106
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,959
I don't think you're even out of the pool and someone had asked you about your

107
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,420
arrival, who we just spoke about.

108
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,180
And I think the words attributed you were, I couldn't be here without her.

109
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,620
She set the standard.

110
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,459
It's impressive at any age to show that sort of composure and humility.

111
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:19,259
Where does that come from within you?

112
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,279
I think I'm quite a deep thinker.

113
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,240
I keep my emotions to myself.

114
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:27,839
You know, I don't really like talking about swimming.

115
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,680
I like to keep things inside.

116
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,459
And I'm not sure.

117
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,060
I just become composed in those really hectic situations, I think,

118
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:36,939
in other areas of my life.

119
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,680
I'm quite a flamboyant person.

120
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,920
I'm quite outgoing, extroverted.

121
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,439
But then I think with my job and my role as a swimmer,

122
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,000
I can really zone in and switch on and set my mind into the zone that it had

123
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,779
to be in for those events.

124
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,360
And I feel like that's definitely a tool that I have.

125
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,220
But for me, answering those questions about Katie was so easy because she's

126
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,639
definitely changed the way that females swim, middle distance freestyle.

127
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,779
And it was very easy for me to,

128
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:10,000
you know, compliment her and be grateful for the standard that she had set.

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,500
Because I don't think if she wasn't swimming as fast as she was,

130
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,379
there's no way that I would be swimming as fast as this.

131
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:19,480
So those questions are easy for me to answer.

132
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,839
You mentioned that part of your makeup is this ability under pressure to be

133
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:29,120
able to compartmentalize and that's swimming and that's what I do and keep

134
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,519
out the external noise.

135
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,220
Is there anything that you can share with us?

136
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,480
I mean, a lot of people use mindfulness and meditation or have got, you know,

137
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,860
abilities and techniques that really focus them in and they do that.

138
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,500
Is it, is there strategies that you use or is it just part of how you go about it?

139
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,180
I remember it would have been probably two years out from what would have been

140
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,240
Tokyo 2020 before the Olympics were postponed.

141
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,240
And I went over to Dean's house and I cooked him dinner and we sat down in his

142
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,759
lounge room and we wanted to make a set of like self affirmations that I could

143
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,439
read to myself every day, because I think that the inner belief in yourself is

144
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,360
kind of the,

145
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,259
the factor that can sometimes be make or break.

146
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,379
I think if you go into a race without the belief that you can win,

147
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,019
you're definitely not going to win.

148
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:19,759
So I think for me, especially racing someone who is what I believe the goat,

149
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,699
I think I had to have this extraordinary belief in myself to actually believe

150
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:24,600
that I could beat her.

151
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:31,019
So we sat down and wrote down all these self affirmations and it was in first

152
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,440
person. It was in, you know, Ariant hypnosis or I am,

153
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,460
and we made these cards.

154
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,659
And it was four different areas of my life.

155
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,519
It was who I am as a person, who I am as a swimmer,

156
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,639
what I'm proud of and what I have to work on.

157
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:51,580
And we made 10 of each and I printed them off and I had one in the glove box of

158
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,320
my car. So sometimes I would read them before going into a session.

159
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,759
I had one in my bedroom and, or just be, you know,

160
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:02,200
in the bathroom drawer and when I'm cleaning my teeth,

161
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,279
pull them out and look in the mirror and read them to myself.

162
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,360
And it sounds,

163
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,799
it sounds stupid,

164
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,200
but I think when you start reading these things like I have the best backend in

165
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,740
the world, I, um, have the best strength in the world.

166
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,740
Um, I'm a good person. I'm a humble person.

167
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,980
I think reading these things,

168
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,779
eventually you start to become that and you,

169
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:25,860
you feel this extra belief in yourself.

170
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,799
And I think for me that really helped, you know, going to Olympics,

171
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:34,580
my mindset was, um, you know, for me to win, they have to beat me.

172
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,840
It's not, you know,

173
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,980
me having to beat them.

174
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,799
They have to beat me.

175
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:41,580
And I think that that's really the only way that you can have your mind going

176
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,799
into an Olympic final,

177
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,519
um, fighting for a gold medal.

178
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,360
I love you sharing that,

179
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,539
uh, and it's brilliant.

180
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:51,139
It's, it's far from a stupid and it's such a transferable thing.

181
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,059
They say we have 80,000 thoughts a day and the,

182
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:57,100
and the human consciousness often is towards the negative,

183
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,500
isn't it?

184
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,080
That you can,

185
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,659
that's where,

186
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,539
when that multiplies the self-doubt creeps in and the anxiety goes up.

187
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:03,299
But for you to,

188
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,620
to practice that in your car and your bathroom,

189
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:05,799
and I,

190
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,600
I love the way you and your coach,

191
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,360
Dean Boxer,

192
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,639
who we really want to talk about,

193
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,440
uh, in a moment's time,

194
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,419
we're able to just systematically do that.

195
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:15,039
And also about you as a person too,

196
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,200
that you're bigger than that as a swimmer and,

197
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,620
and,

198
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:17,919
you know,

199
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,179
to have you as the whole person,

200
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:19,600
I suppose,

201
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,080
was that really fundamental to you as well to say,

202
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:22,740
you know what,

203
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,879
regardless of what happens,

204
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,440
I'm going to do my best and I'm still a great person is a

205
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,720
pretty profound thing to do as well.

206
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:28,200
Yeah,

207
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,759
for sure.

208
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,139
I mean,

209
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:32,559
swimming is definitely something that I've loved my whole life and I'm

210
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:35,500
very fortunate now that I've turned it into a career.

211
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:35,779
And I,

212
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:38,320
I've pretty much achieved everything I've wanted to in the sport,

213
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,620
but I'm also beyond that,

214
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:40,899
you know,

215
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:43,779
I want people to know who I am more than just Ariane Titmuss,

216
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:44,200
the swimmer.

217
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,039
I'm,

218
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,480
I believe I'm a lot more than that.

219
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:46,840
And I,

220
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,259
I try to portray that in the media as best as I can.

221
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:50,200
And when I'm meeting people,

222
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,460
I try to be my complete self and show people my other interests.

223
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,179
Um,

224
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:56,500
because swimming is not forever.

225
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:57,399
I mean,

226
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,559
I probably will be done before the age of 30.

227
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,399
So,

228
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,299
um,

229
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:04,279
I think it's really important for people to understand that athletes also

230
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,200
have feelings as well.

231
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,700
And,

232
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,200
uh,

233
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
people beyond,

234
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,460
um,

235
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,299
their sport.

236
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:08,820
Uh,

237
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,600
beautifully said.

238
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:09,840
And,

239
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,320
uh,

240
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,519
you know,

241
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:14,539
it's why so interested to talk to you as the whole person and the 21

242
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:15,179
year old,

243
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:15,360
uh,

244
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,220
incredible achiever,

245
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,159
but incredible leader,

246
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,639
because that comes out in all the,

247
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,399
the interviews I hear with you.

248
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,759
And I wanted to ask you about this.

249
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:24,120
It was interesting to you to say in some ways for you,

250
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,179
COVID and lockdown ended up being of benefit because you're so focused and

251
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:31,120
you're able to really drill into the Olympics coming up.

252
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,080
But for a lot of young people,

253
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,000
it's been incredibly traumatic time and time away from school.

254
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,399
And,

255
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,240
uh,

256
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,779
teenage girls in particular,

257
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:38,639
the bracket in there,

258
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:38,879
the,

259
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,679
the,

260
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,759
the data we're seeing is that there was lots of,

261
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:42,399
you know,

262
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,919
eating disorders and challenges,

263
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,419
you know,

264
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:46,580
for you and your story grew up in Tasmania.

265
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,059
It's the most unlikely place,

266
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:48,639
uh,

267
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,419
for an Olympic gold medalist in some ways,

268
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:53,580
what advice would you pass on to perhaps those that have been through a

269
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,860
challenging time about,

270
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:55,139
you know,

271
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:56,519
following something they're passionate about?

272
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,659
Well,

273
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:59,879
I think looking at COVID firstly,

274
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:00,659
for me,

275
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,200
um,

276
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,440
I was in denial of lockdown and training finishing.

277
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,399
I remember getting the message,

278
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:05,519
um,

279
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,440
my phone I'd woken up from my nap.

280
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,399
Um,

281
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:08,720
you know,

282
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,460
I sleep from 11 to one every day on a,

283
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,960
on a day that I trained twice.

284
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,899
And I woke up and had all these messages saying trainings off the Olympics

285
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:17,279
are off.

286
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,720
And I didn't believe it.

287
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,019
I still went to the pool and,

288
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:20,559
um,

289
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:20,879
was like,

290
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:21,100
not,

291
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,659
I'm getting in.

292
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,519
Like the Olympics will happen.

293
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,419
I'm still training.

294
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,639
And it wasn't until,

295
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:25,980
you know,

296
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,840
the pool was not really open that I,

297
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,480
it kind of switched flicked.

298
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,659
And I pretty much cried for the next four days because I was so out

299
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:34,320
of routine.

300
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,379
But in terms of,

301
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,000
of young girls,

302
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,240
I mean,

303
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,159
I saw it firsthand.

304
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:39,740
My sister was finishing year 12 in 2020,

305
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,879
and I don't think that there was anything more challenging than having to

306
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,419
finish your final year of school in lockdown.

307
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:47,940
Um,

308
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,659
she was quite sick before COVID even happened.

309
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:52,899
And so she wasn't at school.

310
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:56,240
And then for it to be pretty much most of the year,

311
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:56,879
um,

312
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:01,639
doing lessons on a laptop and not really having a proper formal and not

313
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,620
really having,

314
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:02,879
you know,

315
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,240
all those end of year celebrations that you usually have.

316
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,340
I,

317
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,080
I think it definitely puts definitely puts a damper on things.

318
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,159
And I mean,

319
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,840
I'm quite an outlier for,

320
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:11,340
um,

321
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:13,139
my upbringing as a teenage girl,

322
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:13,379
you know,

323
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:17,100
I didn't care that I had to miss out on parties or I

324
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,200
didn't care that I wasn't doing what they were doing because I

325
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,779
was so invested in my swimming,

326
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,240
but I can see how socially,

327
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:24,899
um,

328
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,500
COVID would have played a big role in people's self-confidence.

329
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,220
They can't get out,

330
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,019
they can't move.

331
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:33,000
And I think exercise especially is really good for your mental health.

332
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,159
So I guess my advice would be,

333
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,559
when you can't do the things that you would usually do,

334
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,720
switch your mind to focus on something else.

335
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,340
And so for me,

336
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,539
while I couldn't swim,

337
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:44,700
I tried to take up other things.

338
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,679
And as much as I wasn't great at it,

339
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:46,919
um,

340
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,700
I tried knitting,

341
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,639
I tried coloring in like just really small things.

342
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,000
Um,

343
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,940
it keeps your mind busy and it gets your mind off,

344
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,539
you know,

345
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:57,179
stops thoughts wandering around in there.

346
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:58,980
And I think that's really important.

347
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,399
And I think it's also important as much as lockdown was hard.

348
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,299
I think it's also,

349
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:03,600
um,

350
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,940
important to be able to,

351
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,639
important to be grateful and think about the things that you do have that

352
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,139
are still going for you in your life.

353
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:09,500
And,

354
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,379
um,

355
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:12,919
so I think that can always kind of lift you up a little bit.

356
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:13,679
Oh,

357
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,340
what a great way to sum it up.

358
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,679
Isn't it?

359
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,080
When you flick the mind to being grateful and particularly for those of us

360
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,539
living in a country like Australia,

361
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:22,840
and you don't have to look too far to see what a privilege it is,

362
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,320
even in the most challenging times.

363
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,940
And,

364
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,840
and as you do,

365
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,919
you're often thinking about someone else.

366
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,440
And when you're in that mindset as well around supporting other people,

367
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,059
it's very hard to feel sad and,

368
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:33,440
and,

369
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,179
and depressed.

370
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:34,320
And,

371
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,840
and I love talking to people like you who've achieved extraordinary success,

372
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,639
but they're humble enough.

373
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:42,799
They don't necessarily see themselves as leaders and role models.

374
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,039
I mean,

375
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:43,580
to me,

376
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,220
your story is the ultimate leader for your generation.

377
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,860
You describe yourself just then as an outlier because you know what,

378
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,080
you are a bit different in that you don't tend to worry about the stuff you're

379
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,179
missing out on because your focus is so strong.

380
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,559
Is that something that you embrace being,

381
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,379
being a young leader?

382
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:58,940
Yeah,

383
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,659
I think that I'm quite relatable,

384
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,320
um,

385
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,779
to girls my age or growing up.

386
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,299
Um,

387
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,919
I've always seen myself as a very normal person.

388
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:08,519
I've never,

389
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:09,419
you know,

390
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:12,899
I was finishing year 12 the year that I went to commonwealth games and,

391
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,460
um,

392
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,440
you know,

393
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,419
one gold medals there.

394
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:18,799
And I guess it was kind of my breakout meeting the next week I was back at

395
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,600
school and,

396
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:20,299
um,

397
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:21,559
in class with everyone.

398
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:25,159
And so I think I was relatable to people to see that,

399
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,919
um,

400
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,759
doesn't matter how much you have on your plate.

401
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,519
Doesn't matter what's going on in your,

402
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,559
not in your life.

403
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,080
Um,

404
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,039
you can always kind of figure things out and,

405
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,200
and achieve your goals.

406
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,580
And I think for me,

407
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:35,940
um,

408
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,419
I always get asked in school,

409
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:39,240
how did you do school and swimming and,

410
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:39,980
you know,

411
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,779
time management was a really big thing for me.

412
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:42,059
And,

413
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:42,879
um,

414
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,240
I think that's something that I think has helped people,

415
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:46,220
um,

416
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:46,519
you know,

417
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,279
learning to,

418
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,919
to juggle a lot of things in life was really hard.

419
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,320
So,

420
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,639
I mean,

421
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,159
I made the decision to do year 12 over two years,

422
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:53,860
which,

423
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,659
um,

424
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:54,879
you know,

425
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,519
I was away from school for 15 weeks,

426
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,379
the last year of school.

427
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:00,960
So I decided to do that and stay back.

428
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,240
And,

429
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,000
um,

430
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,279
yeah,

431
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,179
I think that for me,

432
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,820
I am like I said,

433
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,080
I was,

434
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,740
I'm an outlier.

435
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,700
I don't think I think the same as a lot of people,

436
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,259
my age,

437
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:13,620
I think I'm beyond my years because I've been on the national team with older

438
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,700
people around me since I was 16.

439
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,679
So,

440
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,379
um,

441
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:21,379
but I still think I'm quite relatable in the sense that I'm very normal person

442
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:22,200
still.

443
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:23,200
Can you share with us,

444
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,759
uh,

445
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,379
you know,

446
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:27,320
managing your time and clearly for you,

447
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:27,580
you know,

448
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,879
when you're building up to a big mate,

449
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,200
every second of time is,

450
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,960
is precious,

451
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,080
but you've still got to balance and live a normal life and you block out the

452
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,559
two hours.

453
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,759
You sleep from 11 to one.

454
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,980
We just heard that before.

455
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,000
How do you go about managing your time?

456
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,799
What's the system use?

457
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:43,539
I think it's just prioritizing the things that are most important to you that

458
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:44,360
day.

459
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,899
Like for me on Monday,

460
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:46,259
Tuesday,

461
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:46,799
Thursdays,

462
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,580
when I have swimming in the morning and swimming in the afternoon.

463
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,000
And I mean,

464
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,879
all up training those days is about eight hours.

465
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,840
Um,

466
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,100
swimming is my number one.

467
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,620
So my manager knows not to call me between 11 and one or,

468
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,779
um,

469
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:01,080
you know,

470
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,079
everything I plan for that day is to make sure that I'm performance,

471
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,380
ready,

472
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,339
especially in that afternoon after the session in the morning.

473
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,799
Whereas Wednesdays and Fridays,

474
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,200
when I have nothing on in the afternoon,

475
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,319
it's about prioritizing other things in my life,

476
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:17,460
whether it's getting a coffee with a friend or catching up on some errands or,

477
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:17,700
you know,

478
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,440
getting a massage and doing those things.

479
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,059
I think it's really laying things out and prioritizing the more important

480
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,460
things in your life at that time.

481
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,079
And,

482
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,839
um,

483
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,640
I also try to keep as busy as I can.

484
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,720
I think I work better under pressure.

485
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:31,960
Um,

486
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,059
so I think that also helps.

487
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,619
So now post the Olympics,

488
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:37,839
you know,

489
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:38,819
21 years of age,

490
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:39,059
it's,

491
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:43,319
it's incredible to see what you've done in that short space of time.

492
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,319
But you're a household name.

493
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:48,200
Now people recognize you down the street and everywhere you go.

494
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,599
How,

495
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,799
how has life changed for you?

496
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:50,640
I mean,

497
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,839
it's definitely changed.

498
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,380
I,

499
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,660
I often go to the supermarket and it's,

500
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,380
um,

501
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,559
it's actually a lot of the time,

502
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:56,880
you know,

503
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,740
older people that come up to me and go like,

504
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:04,039
I remember where I was when you race and it's like my Nana coming up and patting me on the back.

505
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:04,539
And,

506
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:05,240
um,

507
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,740
it makes me feel really good inside,

508
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,880
but I never thought that I would be one of those people.

509
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,220
That's,

510
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,200
that's not why I swam.

511
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,900
I never dreamt of the fame and the glory.

512
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,000
I just swam because I loved it.

513
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,460
And I had dreams that I wanted to achieve,

514
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,319
but I think it's quite humbling.

515
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:21,799
Um,

516
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:22,279
I,

517
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,660
you know,

518
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,799
especially during the Olympics,

519
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:25,299
most of the country was in lockdown.

520
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:32,519
And the amount of people that have said to me what you knew on TV while we were stuck inside really brought some joy to our household.

521
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,019
And I think,

522
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:34,160
you know,

523
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,519
it makes me feel good inside that I played a role in that.

524
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,119
I wasn't just swimming for myself.

525
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,519
I was genuinely swimming for the country.

526
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,119
And so,

527
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:41,660
um,

528
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,160
that makes me feel really special.

529
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:45,140
I have to ask you about,

530
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:45,500
uh,

531
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,099
the coach,

532
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:46,700
Dean Boxall,

533
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,660
and your relationship.

534
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,140
Uh,

535
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,359
it's one of the great celebrations we've ever seen.

536
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,819
I know you've spoken about it a lot.

537
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:54,140
I loved every bit of it.

538
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,519
It's a good point that you made.

539
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,019
A lot of us,

540
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:56,660
you know,

541
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,200
we're,

542
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,420
uh,

543
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:57,660
you know,

544
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,579
challenged by lockdown at that stage and to see that sort of joy going on and,

545
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,279
you know,

546
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,500
rip his mask off and break the rules and,

547
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,000
and go nuts.

548
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,519
It was Brett.

549
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:06,660
Did,

550
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,980
did you see that coming in him?

551
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,519
Did you have a sense that he was going to go cocoa bananas like that?

552
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:12,559
Well,

553
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:16,279
I think it's very funny to see the reactions of everyone else that doesn't know Dean.

554
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,940
I was so surprised and,

555
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,240
you know,

556
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,880
it was so out there and I mean it was,

557
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,420
but that is totally what he is like every day.

558
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,279
Like there is always something happening,

559
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:27,240
happening at training.

560
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,299
And I think for us,

561
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:32,259
it was more just a massive energy release that he had.

562
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,059
I mean,

563
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:34,079
if anyone knows Dean,

564
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,059
they know that he works harder than anyone.

565
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,799
Like he'll come into training and be like,

566
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,299
couldn't sleep last night.

567
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,000
He was,

568
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:41,039
I was up at 2 AM,

569
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:42,119
sat up in bed,

570
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:42,660
just,

571
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:42,900
you know,

572
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,680
you didn't do the race,

573
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,420
right.

574
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:44,619
And,

575
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:44,940
um,

576
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,339
you know,

577
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:48,539
like he's just completely invested in,

578
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,480
in the sport.

579
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,079
And so for us to have a plan for years and for me to execute the race almost

580
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:55,799
perfectly,

581
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:58,859
I think it was just this release of energy that,

582
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,220
you know,

583
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,859
Ava overcame him and it came out and,

584
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:02,259
um,

585
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,160
you know,

586
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,180
he gets annoyed when people ask him to do it again because he goes like,

587
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,019
I can't,

588
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:07,779
it just happened.

589
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:09,460
Like I didn't even know what was happening.

590
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,259
Um,

591
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,880
but I'm glad that people got to see that side of him because,

592
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,440
um,

593
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,859
I think sometimes he gets misunderstood as this crazy hard task master who sets

594
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:18,700
these,

595
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:18,839
um,

596
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:22,319
insane sessions and has incredibly high standards of which he does,

597
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,519
but he has a very soft side to him and a funny side.

598
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:25,779
And,

599
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:26,380
um,

600
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,779
I'm glad that people got to see that.

601
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:28,740
Yeah.

602
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,319
And I love the message for it too.

603
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,559
I need to see,

604
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,140
uh,

605
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,380
you know,

606
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,019
brilliant celebration and joy.

607
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:34,319
It's,

608
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,500
you know,

609
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:38,200
I played sport in an era where you weren't allowed to celebrate a win

610
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,740
because it looked like you were getting carried away.

611
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,519
And only if you won a premiership at the end of the season,

612
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,380
that was a time.

613
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,519
And for those that didn't win one,

614
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,759
did that mean that you didn't have any success or any joy along the way?

615
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:49,720
And so I think it's such a healthier,

616
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,539
uh,

617
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:51,440
attitude now.

618
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,420
And we see the next generation do generally because that's what it's about,

619
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:54,720
isn't it?

620
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,019
It's about enjoying those moments.

621
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:58,640
If you can't celebrate what you achieved at that time,

622
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,339
I'm not sure when,

623
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,299
when you ever can.

624
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,279
So I loved it.

625
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:02,119
I thought it was just,

626
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,940
it was just a magic moment.

627
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,500
I love hearing you talk about it and share it.

628
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:06,279
I did read,

629
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:06,599
Arnie,

630
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:06,960
that,

631
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:07,380
um,

632
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,480
as young as 12,

633
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,480
uh,

634
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,440
in Tassie that,

635
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:10,680
uh,

636
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,079
you'd bump into people and you had a pool in your house that you would tell

637
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,799
people I'm on my way to the Olympics.

638
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,460
You had that vision at that young age.

639
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:17,640
Is,

640
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,259
is that true?

641
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:18,920
Yeah,

642
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,660
I was pretty set in my way on,

643
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,319
on becoming an Olympic swimmer and becoming Olympic champion.

644
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,000
Um,

645
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:24,880
I don't know.

646
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,019
I,

647
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:25,319
I mean,

648
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,839
I did a lot of sports growing up.

649
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,519
I had horses.

650
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:27,799
I,

651
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:28,740
I,

652
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,039
um,

653
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,440
you know,

654
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,279
road and I got to high,

655
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:32,019
I got high school.

656
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,420
And the horses weren't getting much,

657
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,420
much exercise.

658
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:35,099
And so I had,

659
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,359
we had,

660
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,619
we sold them all and swimming kind of became my number one.

661
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:38,920
And,

662
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:39,279
um,

663
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:39,559
yeah,

664
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:43,359
I for sure wasn't shy in telling people that swimming is what I wanted to

665
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:43,579
do.

666
00:21:43,579 --> 00:21:46,019
And I wanted to be on the national team and,

667
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:46,400
you know,

668
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,160
looking back now,

669
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,420
it's so naive to say something like that at 12 years old,

670
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,740
because you have no understanding of the work that goes into becoming

671
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,519
Olympic champion.

672
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:55,920
And,

673
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:56,779
um,

674
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,119
you know,

675
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,480
even now looking back on the prep that I did for Tokyo,

676
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,759
I can't even fathom some of the things that I did.

677
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,000
And,

678
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,440
and what I'm going to have to do,

679
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,319
um,

680
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,339
for the next Olympics.

681
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:05,819
But,

682
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:06,519
you know,

683
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:06,740
I'm,

684
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,019
I'm proud that I was,

685
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,700
and I had that confidence in myself to say that at that age.

686
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,000
And I,

687
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:12,440
I stuck with it and I did it.

688
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,720
A lot of people will probably turn their nose up or,

689
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:15,460
you know,

690
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,700
a bit of tall poppy syndrome,

691
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,759
that type of thing.

692
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,880
I definitely copped it.

693
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:19,339
Um,

694
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,759
being a young swimmer coming through and trying to keep up with the boys

695
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:25,319
and not being afraid to take it to the older guys.

696
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:26,460
Um,

697
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:28,599
but I'm proud of myself for,

698
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:28,960
um,

699
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
that work ethic and,

700
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,619
and really sticking with it.

701
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,440
Well,

702
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,339
there's a perfect storm.

703
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,700
It seems when you listen back to you talk and,

704
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:35,960
you know,

705
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,420
as an old saying,

706
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,519
be careful what you wish for,

707
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:39,519
because it might just come true.

708
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,279
But to have that dream and then,

709
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:41,579
you know,

710
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:43,259
the positive affirmations you talked about,

711
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:45,119
and then to have a coach that's equally as fanatical,

712
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,380
and then the capacity to do those sessions and push through the pain,

713
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:51,279
things like you achieved don't happen by mistake,

714
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:51,660
do they?

715
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:51,900
It's,

716
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,160
it's,

717
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:52,660
you know,

718
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,680
you described the outlier part resonates with me because,

719
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:56,420
you know,

720
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,539
not everyone has got the capacity to do it,

721
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:01,200
but I think we can learn so much just even our daily lives.

722
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,880
If there are things,

723
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,500
we want to achieve or we want to be a better version of ourselves that,

724
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:06,720
do you see that applying to other areas?

725
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:08,880
We've heard you talk about you're passionate about your cooking.

726
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,460
You love your,

727
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,079
your,

728
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,519
your family influence is enormous.

729
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,079
You have got a range of other interests.

730
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,140
Do you see those skillsets applying to,

731
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:16,839
to you outside of just the pool?

732
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,599
For sure.

733
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,460
I think that,

734
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,319
um,

735
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:19,680
you know,

736
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,779
people always ask me like,

737
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:24,099
how'd you learn how to train hard or how'd you teach yourself to,

738
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:24,900
um,

739
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,339
you know,

740
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:27,039
I guess be fanatical about something.

741
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,359
And I think it's in your makeup and I'm,

742
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,839
I'm like it in a lot of areas.

743
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,380
In my life.

744
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:32,640
I mean,

745
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,579
I'm definitely not as competitive as I am with swimming as I am with

746
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:36,539
cooking or,

747
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:37,079
um,

748
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,299
anything else like that.

749
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:40,880
But I think anything that I do do in life,

750
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,140
I want to make sure I do it properly.

751
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,519
And I say to myself,

752
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:43,900
you know,

753
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,519
if there's a hundred stones to turn over,

754
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,420
you turn over a hundred.

755
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,819
I could never go into anything knowing that I could have done it better.

756
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:51,920
And I think,

757
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:52,619
um,

758
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,839
that's something that I don't want to,

759
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:55,119
you know,

760
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,680
leave the sport or leave anything behind with any regrets.

761
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,240
And so,

762
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,019
um,

763
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:01,839
I think it's really important to put your best foot forward in,

764
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,819
in everything you do.

765
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:04,500
And I hope people can,

766
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:04,960
um,

767
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:05,680
you know,

768
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,259
learn from that as well.

769
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,700
Certainly can.

770
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:09,180
Uh,

771
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,819
I find it,

772
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,180
um,

773
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:10,680
just a,

774
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,140
such a compelling thing to listen to firsthand and,

775
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,380
uh,

776
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:14,700
congratulations again,

777
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
that everything that you've achieved,

778
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:19,599
I want to ask you a handful of questions around leadership.

779
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:21,299
And I love your story of,

780
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:24,000
of leadership and dimensions of what we see great leadership and great

781
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,319
leaders,

782
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,079
whether it be an Olympic gold medalist like you or someone running a,

783
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:31,559
a social venture or a business person or someone from other sports as

784
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:31,859
well.

785
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,099
And we think most people who achieve things like you have got a great

786
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,140
sense of self leadership.

787
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,539
And I,

788
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:37,619
I can certainly hear that,

789
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:38,319
uh,

790
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,440
coming out in all that you say,

791
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,400
does that resonate with you?

792
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:40,799
The sense,

793
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,980
the self leadership idea?

794
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:42,640
Yeah,

795
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,220
for sure.

796
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,240
And I think that leaders especially don't need a label to be a leader.

797
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:47,720
I mean,

798
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,579
I am not as such a leader on the team.

799
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,099
Um,

800
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:52,400
I mean,

801
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,279
I've always been a younger athlete on the team,

802
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:58,559
but I guess now I've been on the national team for a while now.

803
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,359
I'm kind of,

804
00:24:59,359 --> 00:24:59,619
you know,

805
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:01,240
becoming part of that leadership group,

806
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,500
but,

807
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,940
but I think you can lead,

808
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:03,660
um,

809
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,400
without having to say anything through your work ethic.

810
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:07,039
I mean,

811
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:07,500
at training,

812
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:08,759
you can be a leader by,

813
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:09,859
um,

814
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:11,140
just going there,

815
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,259
putting your best foot forward,

816
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,539
doing the best you can for the day and creating a great environment around

817
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:15,900
you.

818
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:18,859
I think that's been a leader without even knowing it.

819
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,680
So I think it's for sure being,

820
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,180
um,

821
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:25,980
sure of yourself and being empowered within yourself,

822
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,819
I think can create leadership qualities and can help others around you.

823
00:25:30,339 --> 00:25:30,740
Yeah.

824
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,420
I love what you said,

825
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:31,700
Dan,

826
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,339
around not needing a title to be a leader.

827
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,480
And that's exactly what we,

828
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:35,720
we,

829
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,039
we sense it's the old model of having to be the boss and the hierarchical model.

830
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:40,619
It's,

831
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,079
it's,

832
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:41,440
you know,

833
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:41,980
absolutely.

834
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,480
We see the impact someone you could have at 15 years of age,

835
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:45,819
uh,

836
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:46,940
Arnie in a swim team,

837
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,380
just by your behaviors and the way that you're training would have,

838
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,680
uh,

839
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:50,339
you know,

840
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:52,900
shown enormous leadership in that discipline and sense of self.

841
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:53,400
Um,

842
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:53,880
as we said,

843
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,039
is a great story.

844
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,859
We see leaders also positively,

845
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:57,779
um,

846
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,299
or thinking about how they can positively impact others in their environment.

847
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:04,259
I suppose your sport is a solo sport at one level.

848
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:07,380
You join a swim team and you get into relays and you compete against,

849
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,240
you know,

850
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,019
sometimes people in your own squad for,

851
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:10,680
for position.

852
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,839
So how do you go about positively impacting others in your environment?

853
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,359
Yeah.

854
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,720
I mean,

855
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,339
swimming definitely can be a lonely sport.

856
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:18,900
Um,

857
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,039
but in my case,

858
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:21,500
it's not,

859
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,799
I'm part of a huge squad.

860
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,500
We're one of the biggest high performance programs in the country.

861
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:27,859
I think we have about 20 of us.

862
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,480
And I think for me,

863
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,240
something that I always want to stick to,

864
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:34,680
is it doesn't matter who you're racing and who your competitors are.

865
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
Don't look at them as a competitor personally.

866
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:37,799
And for me,

867
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,180
that's something that's really important.

868
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:43,779
There's girls in my squad that I race and that are competitors of mine,

869
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:45,779
or there's younger girls that are coming up.

870
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:49,099
And I think some people can get caught in the trap of,

871
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:49,519
um,

872
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:50,519
you know,

873
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:53,200
taking their competitiveness out on someone,

874
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,880
not for the,

875
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:54,920
who they are as a person,

876
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:56,200
but who they are as a swimmer and,

877
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:57,519
um,

878
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:59,700
might not treat them the way they deserve to be treated.

879
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,940
And for me,

880
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,200
um,

881
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:02,900
I try to separate those two things.

882
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,839
And I think everyone in the squad does that really well.

883
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:05,059
And,

884
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:05,880
um,

885
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:06,980
you know,

886
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,099
I think that that creates a great environment.

887
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:10,660
And speaking of leaders,

888
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,859
I think that shows great leadership qualities as well.

889
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,299
So I feel very fortunate that I'm in that environment.

890
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,079
Um,

891
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:16,980
and then,

892
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,400
you know,

893
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:18,420
relays as well.

894
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:20,500
Swimming's bizarre when you think about it,

895
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:21,059
you know,

896
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:24,359
a relay of four girls coming together to be part of one team,

897
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,220
to do something great.

898
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,079
And usually those four girls are,

899
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:28,720
you know,

900
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,019
tough competitors racing for the two,

901
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:31,920
individual spots.

902
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,039
And then you've got to come together and work as a team and,

903
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:35,880
and,

904
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,180
you know,

905
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:36,960
hopefully win.

906
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,200
So I think that learning to separate personal from competitive is,

907
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
is really important.

908
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,619
Yeah.

909
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:45,359
I love the way that you go about that,

910
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:45,720
Arnie,

911
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,019
and I'm sure it's going to resonate with lots of people listening to this,

912
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:51,359
that even in our own workplaces or our own schools,

913
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:52,240
we can sometimes,

914
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:53,359
you know,

915
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:55,180
get competitive with other people.

916
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,400
And that causes a breakdown in relationships.

917
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:57,640
I mean,

918
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,359
no one could be more competitive than you,

919
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:00,960
but yet,

920
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:01,440
the way,

921
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:04,160
and you've got this great rival we love talking about,

922
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:07,980
but there wasn't any nastiness or you didn't feel the need to stare her down

923
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,099
in the warmup room or,

924
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:12,099
or do anything like that or same in your lane.

925
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,480
And so I think you're showing people that how you can be as competitive.

926
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,059
This is a,

927
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:16,980
is a great thing,

928
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,359
but you don't need to take that out negatively on someone else.

929
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:19,680
Is that,

930
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:21,799
is that a fair summation of the way you think or?

931
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:22,500
Yeah,

932
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:23,019
for sure.

933
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:23,440
And I mean,

934
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,480
I think it helps that I'm a distance freestyler.

935
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,900
I think that the sprint boys may be a bit different,

936
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:30,819
but maybe us distance girls,

937
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:31,619
you know,

938
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,799
a bit more subdued in the,

939
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:33,799
in the marshalling room,

940
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:34,819
but no,

941
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:36,059
for sure.

942
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,859
And also like,

943
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,539
I think you want to save your competitive energy for when you need it.

944
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:39,819
Like I'll,

945
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:46,579
I'll say good luck to Katie that one minute before we walk out on pool deck to race.

946
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:51,440
I think that that makes me feel good inside knowing that I've said good luck to my biggest rival.

947
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,660
And she says,

948
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,700
good luck back to me.

949
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,039
And then you go out there and you really do your job and,

950
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,019
and show what you,

951
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,819
what you're made of.

952
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,640
And that's really important to me.

953
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,420
We see leaders are really conscious of how they create and share their vision.

954
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,579
You had a dream as a 12 year old to be an Olympian,

955
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:17,839
and then you don't become an Olympic gold medalist twice without,

956
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,400
you know,

957
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,380
a really clear vision.

958
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,200
Can you tell us about how you've gone about that,

959
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:22,519
you know,

960
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,240
vision and,

961
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,099
and what sort of things you've put in place to,

962
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:26,339
to,

963
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,039
to achieve that?

964
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:27,559
Yeah.

965
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:27,779
Well,

966
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:28,259
I mean,

967
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,539
most people know my story.

968
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:36,240
I guess I grew up in Launceston and Tassie and swimming down there is definitely not a dominant sport,

969
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,539
but,

970
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,460
but I feel very fortunate that my family,

971
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:39,839
I guess,

972
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,980
saw something in me at 14 years of age,

973
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
which looking at a 14 year old now they're in year eight.

974
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,400
And I,

975
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,500
I think to myself,

976
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:51,779
how did my parents have the guts to pack up everything and move into state really?

977
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,279
But yeah,

978
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:53,920
that was a big,

979
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,720
a big shift and a big move for us.

980
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:56,019
I,

981
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:57,819
I was very vocal in,

982
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,319
in telling mom and dad that swimming was what I wanted to do.

983
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:04,119
And I wanted to give it a red hot crack and I feel enormously grateful that they,

984
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:07,200
they backed me and we packed up and moved to Brisbane and moved,

985
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,759
moved up here to Queensland and,

986
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:10,539
you know,

987
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:12,420
started training with Dean.

988
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:19,059
And I think that was one big major factor that was part of the plan that has led me to where I am today.

989
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,339
But I think I've always been quite a,

990
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:22,900
a goal driven person.

991
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:23,559
I remember,

992
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:27,759
it must've been my first national team.

993
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:30,099
I made the qualifying times came out and I,

994
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:30,640
you know,

995
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:35,759
I wrote them on pieces of paper and stuck them on my roof and I'd look at them going to sleep every night,

996
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:37,119
or I'd write,

997
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,160
I'd type up like little goals for the month and then,

998
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,700
you know,

999
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,099
bigger goals and goals for the next few years.

1000
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:45,599
And I think that it's important to not just make big goals,

1001
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,440
but little goals that are going to help you make those big goals.

1002
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:51,240
And so I've always been quite a,

1003
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,440
yeah,

1004
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,799
someone that likes to keep those in the front of my mind.

1005
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:59,779
I think if you get lost in training and you're having a bad session or your,

1006
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:01,319
your mind's wandering a little bit,

1007
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:04,980
I think having those goals in there really helps you realign your focus.

1008
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,619
So that's something that,

1009
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:07,480
that I've done.

1010
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:08,680
I mean,

1011
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:08,920
it's,

1012
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:12,380
I can't talk through like the whole plan of everything.

1013
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,480
It's too long,

1014
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,579
but I mean,

1015
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:18,559
certainly there are a few ways that I think I've found,

1016
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,000
found myself to where I am today.

1017
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,759
I didn't want to touch on the family piece,

1018
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:24,000
picking up on the back of what you said,

1019
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:24,619
then it's,

1020
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,720
I'm always fascinated in this and I love talking parenting in this podcast and,

1021
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,519
and for your family commitment to move the whole family,

1022
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:33,859
to follow your dream.

1023
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,180
As I said,

1024
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,819
you're in year eight,

1025
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,019
you're a 14 year old.

1026
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:36,200
And,

1027
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,460
and,

1028
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:36,779
and the,

1029
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:37,380
you know,

1030
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,960
there's a fair bit of pressure that comes with that.

1031
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:40,599
You would be very aware that your family,

1032
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:42,480
mom and dad had to find new jobs.

1033
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,339
Your younger sister had to leave school as well,

1034
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:44,720
all for,

1035
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:45,559
for your dream.

1036
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:45,740
And,

1037
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:46,319
you know,

1038
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:49,940
some of the parenting I'm a father of four and always conscious around,

1039
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:50,559
you know,

1040
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,519
your love and support for your kids,

1041
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:55,000
but not wanting to overlay your wishes on them as well.

1042
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:55,240
Did,

1043
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:57,619
did that subtlety exist there?

1044
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,480
Clearly it's worked incredibly for you,

1045
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,000
but did you feel that pressure or was it always,

1046
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,980
we're just here to support you?

1047
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:03,140
Even,

1048
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,259
even if in two years time you wanted to give it up,

1049
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,160
did you feel like,

1050
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,319
that option was available to you?

1051
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,660
I think that,

1052
00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:09,099
um,

1053
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,460
I literally hit the jackpot with the best parents for athletes.

1054
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,460
My mom was a sprinter,

1055
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,099
um,

1056
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:15,940
you know,

1057
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,759
track and field athlete.

1058
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,420
She kind of has the mindset of an athlete and my,

1059
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:19,980
my dad,

1060
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:20,380
um,

1061
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,119
did sport as well.

1062
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,619
But regardless of that,

1063
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,599
I think that they were the perfect parents to parent a professional athlete.

1064
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:27,599
I think that they,

1065
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,519
um,

1066
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:32,960
had a great balance of being enough of a driving force to keep you motivated,

1067
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,859
but never became the coach.

1068
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:35,440
And,

1069
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:35,940
um,

1070
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,339
stuck to the sidelines.

1071
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:37,640
And I,

1072
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:38,579
you know,

1073
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:39,579
the question about,

1074
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:40,019
um,

1075
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,119
packing up and moving to Queensland because of my swimming,

1076
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:45,759
obviously it was a massive sacrifice to my family.

1077
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:50,660
My dad lived in Tassie still for six months while we moved up here while he was still looking for work.

1078
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:52,559
So that was a big sacrifice.

1079
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,640
We literally had all our furniture and storage for 12 months.

1080
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,180
We lived in this tiny apartment.

1081
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:57,900
Um,

1082
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,019
it was,

1083
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,240
it was a huge decision,

1084
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,559
but not once did I ever feel that I had to perform because of the sacrifice of my family.

1085
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:05,920
And that's,

1086
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,279
that's something that I'm very grateful for.

1087
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,480
And I've always said that if I said I wanted to retire tomorrow,

1088
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,059
they would not stop me.

1089
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,220
And,

1090
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:12,940
um,

1091
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,779
that never be,

1092
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,480
you know,

1093
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:16,460
parents that come home from a competition.

1094
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,059
And obviously that ask how I go,

1095
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,359
but there'd never be parents that would be too involved in,

1096
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,400
you know,

1097
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,940
write down the splits or understand what's going on.

1098
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,359
I mean,

1099
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,099
I think those parents are damaging to athletes.

1100
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:29,640
And so,

1101
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:30,440
um,

1102
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,940
I feel really grateful that my parents have just created an environment for me that has been helpful.

1103
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,440
And making sure I get the best recovery.

1104
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,619
I've got a stable environment to make sure that training is my number one priority,

1105
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,839
but I've never,

1106
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:46,339
ever felt the pressure to perform.

1107
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:47,059
Yeah.

1108
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:47,279
What a,

1109
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,000
what a brilliant,

1110
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:48,480
as you said,

1111
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,380
you hit the jackpot,

1112
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:49,640
don't you?

1113
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,119
When you get that combination,

1114
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,039
the love and support,

1115
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:53,039
but also not the,

1116
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,140
the overlay,

1117
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:54,440
you know,

1118
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,220
passion of mine,

1119
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:55,559
you know,

1120
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:00,319
with four kids are all active in sport and the ugly parenting is alive and well,

1121
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:00,960
and it's,

1122
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,799
it's often well meaning and where people just care so much about their kids,

1123
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:04,920
but,

1124
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,420
but it spills over into junior sport.

1125
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,139
And I'm sure you would have seen that at swimming,

1126
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:10,599
but in junior football,

1127
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:16,159
we see parents screaming at umpires and this crazy obsession with winning an under nine grand final.

1128
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:16,860
And that means,

1129
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,219
you know,

1130
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:17,519
putting,

1131
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,219
putting one kid on the bench for the whole guy.

1132
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:21,239
And then have you seen a bit of that?

1133
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:21,780
Because,

1134
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,260
um,

1135
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:22,500
you know,

1136
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:22,880
as you said,

1137
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,880
if you hit the jackpot,

1138
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,079
but it's out there,

1139
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:25,440
isn't it?

1140
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,679
A lot where we need to probably reeducate parents a little bit along the lines of what you,

1141
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:30,599
you benefited from.

1142
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:31,539
Oh,

1143
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:32,159
for sure.

1144
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:32,639
I mean,

1145
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,780
I think a lot of parents want to live through their kids,

1146
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,440
success.

1147
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,480
And I think in swimming,

1148
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:37,719
you,

1149
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,079
you,

1150
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,519
you do get those,

1151
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:40,000
I mean,

1152
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,019
I don't want to say it,

1153
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:43,960
but crazy parents and the coaches have to have to deal with them.

1154
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:50,840
And unfortunately most cases that I've seen the swimmer gets burnt out and they're done by the age of 15,

1155
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,420
because the pressure has been too much,

1156
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,699
or it's the parents don't think that,

1157
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:55,179
you know,

1158
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:58,960
the coach is doing enough for them at training and they're taking them home and making them do extra.

1159
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,260
And I think that it's just recipe for disaster really.

1160
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,099
And I think that,

1161
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:03,880
I mean,

1162
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,639
I know that my parents,

1163
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:06,739
my parents have so much knowledge on,

1164
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:07,699
I guess,

1165
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:08,539
how to,

1166
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:09,679
to parents and athlete.

1167
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:12,380
And I think it could certainly help a lot of people.

1168
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,139
And I think because I was quite young and on the rise,

1169
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,719
I didn't make the national team at 21.

1170
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:18,079
I've been,

1171
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,380
I've been representing Australia since I was 14,

1172
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:21,739
really.

1173
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:29,199
So I think actually having to parent through those really important stages of life,

1174
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:31,159
growing up socially as well,

1175
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,420
going through high school,

1176
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:32,900
all that,

1177
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,340
I think that balancing act,

1178
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:36,139
my mum and dad,

1179
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:36,980
yeah,

1180
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,820
did amazing.

1181
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,019
I'd have to speak to them,

1182
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:39,519
Arnie.

1183
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:39,820
It's a,

1184
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,159
it's a,

1185
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:45,920
it's another project I'm interested in actually sharing those stories of what great parenting looks like as well,

1186
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,800
particularly around around sport,

1187
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,079
which has got a bit out of hand in what I've seen in recent years.

1188
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:53,480
We see leaders are really curious.

1189
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,440
The word comes up a lot,

1190
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,199
curiosity and through that curiosity,

1191
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:57,699
it's how they approach getting better.

1192
00:35:58,019 --> 00:36:01,500
They're learning and development and constantly seeking improvement.

1193
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,860
Does that resonate with you?

1194
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,260
The thought of curiosity?

1195
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:04,619
Yeah,

1196
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:05,199
for sure.

1197
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,019
I mean,

1198
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:07,219
people always ask me,

1199
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:08,139
um,

1200
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:09,860
especially after the Olympics,

1201
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,900
winning Olympic gold,

1202
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,179
you know,

1203
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:12,019
you've won your,

1204
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:13,280
you've won Olympics.

1205
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,300
What else can you do now?

1206
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:14,840
And,

1207
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,739
and the answer was,

1208
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:16,400
well,

1209
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,840
I haven't got a long course world record yet for an individual race.

1210
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,400
And that kept me motivated.

1211
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,780
And then I put my head down this year and broke the world record in the 400.

1212
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,800
And then the question was,

1213
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,099
you know,

1214
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:28,659
you've,

1215
00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:30,039
you've actually done everything now.

1216
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:30,559
Like what,

1217
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:31,760
what keeps you motivated?

1218
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,099
And it's the personal,

1219
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:34,519
um,

1220
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:36,980
gratification and the pursuit of perfection,

1221
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,199
really that that keeps me in the sport.

1222
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:43,300
And I think that it's also trying to find the limit within yourself.

1223
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:47,039
And I believe that I've got so much more left to give to the sport,

1224
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,400
not just in the pool,

1225
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,340
but outside the pool.

1226
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:49,940
And,

1227
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,179
and,

1228
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:51,239
and that's why I do it.

1229
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:51,500
And,

1230
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,099
um,

1231
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:53,460
I guess curiosity is in there.

1232
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:53,639
Like,

1233
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:55,280
I'm curious to see how good I can,

1234
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,900
how much faster I can get.

1235
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,619
Um,

1236
00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:02,199
I don't want to put a limit on how much I can achieve and how much I can get

1237
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:02,960
out of myself.

1238
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,239
And,

1239
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,039
um,

1240
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:04,500
you know,

1241
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:05,019
in the,

1242
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:07,340
in the hard times of in training,

1243
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,840
it's obviously tough in the moment,

1244
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:12,039
but when you're finished and you've achieved something great in that session,

1245
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:13,380
just the,

1246
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,199
the satisfaction of,

1247
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:15,440
um,

1248
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,719
doing something great in training is like no other.

1249
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:18,199
And,

1250
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,199
and I love that feeling.

1251
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,780
So I guess that's why,

1252
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,340
um,

1253
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,639
I'm sticking at it.

1254
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,320
I can see the smile come to your face.

1255
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:24,639
And,

1256
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:24,980
uh,

1257
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,900
when my mind was going in,

1258
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,199
this is,

1259
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,480
this is going to feel like off a tangent,

1260
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:28,760
Arnie,

1261
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,059
but,

1262
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:29,420
uh,

1263
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,920
so Donald Bradman,

1264
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,059
you know,

1265
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:31,699
maybe,

1266
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:32,300
uh,

1267
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:32,659
you know,

1268
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:34,460
the most outstanding Australian,

1269
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,400
athlete ever,

1270
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:35,840
and,

1271
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,099
and used to listen and read a lot about what he would talk about,

1272
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:43,199
which was he could make 250 in an innings in England.

1273
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:46,880
And the papers would talk about it as the most masterful innings that had been,

1274
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:47,599
uh,

1275
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,380
they'd ever seen,

1276
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:53,239
but he would come off and he would know the six mistakes in his mind that he could get better at.

1277
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:53,840
And for him,

1278
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,519
that might've been,

1279
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,960
he still hit the ball for four,

1280
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:59,059
but he wanted it to go three meters to the left of where it was.

1281
00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:00,699
That was what he was chasing in his mind,

1282
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:01,400
that perfection.

1283
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,360
And he was trying to play the perfect innings all the time.

1284
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:04,440
And,

1285
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,179
and hearing you speak,

1286
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:06,719
I can,

1287
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,800
I can see that chasing perfection may be a dream.

1288
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,000
That's the impossible dream,

1289
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,619
but certainly gets you out of bed.

1290
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:14,460
I'm assuming.

1291
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,139
I've got a pretty funny story actually.

1292
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:16,980
Um,

1293
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,000
in 2019,

1294
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,239
when I became world champion for the first time in the 400,

1295
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:22,619
I remember,

1296
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:23,460
um,

1297
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:23,880
you know,

1298
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,019
once you get out of the pool,

1299
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:27,000
you do a little bit of warm down,

1300
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,320
you do the metal ceremony,

1301
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,400
drug testing.

1302
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,320
And then I had a press conference and I hadn't gone through the race with Dean.

1303
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:34,739
And you know,

1304
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:38,219
you look at your splits and your stroke rates and I just saw the time I did,

1305
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:39,360
which I thought was great.

1306
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,900
But,

1307
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,380
um,

1308
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,699
looking back at the actual race now,

1309
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:44,880
I didn't really race it the way we had planned.

1310
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,219
And I remember I was sitting up,

1311
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:47,820
you know,

1312
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,360
on the,

1313
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,980
at the front answering questions and,

1314
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:53,219
and Dean walks into the room and he,

1315
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:53,760
um,

1316
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,300
he,

1317
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:54,599
you know,

1318
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:55,139
it says,

1319
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:55,539
you know,

1320
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:57,179
when he walks in my face lights up,

1321
00:38:57,179 --> 00:38:59,219
like I hadn't seen him since the race.

1322
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,519
And he walks to the back of the room where the cameras were,

1323
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,260
and he's just mouthing,

1324
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:04,860
like dog,

1325
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,500
shit,

1326
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:05,820
dog,

1327
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,659
shit,

1328
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:07,500
dog shit.

1329
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,340
Because,

1330
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,639
because the race that I put together,

1331
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,139
wasn't the way that we'd planned.

1332
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:17,460
And I had just become world champion beaten Katie Ledecky for the first time in

1333
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,639
like nearly 10 years.

1334
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:20,639
And,

1335
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:21,360
um,

1336
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,699
it was dog shit because we have two standards,

1337
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:23,940
dog,

1338
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,139
shit and outstanding.

1339
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:26,219
And,

1340
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:26,760
um,

1341
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,320
I'll never forget that moment.

1342
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:28,980
Um,

1343
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,739
but I think that's a good way to sum up our relationship.

1344
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,179
And how did you cope with that?

1345
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:33,760
Because that,

1346
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,000
that,

1347
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,500
you know,

1348
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,000
at the,

1349
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,800
at the moment where there is some celebration,

1350
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,639
did you,

1351
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:39,579
did we were upset by that?

1352
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:39,900
Did you,

1353
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,820
did you see it for what it was or are you smiling about it now?

1354
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,940
But at the time,

1355
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,239
was it,

1356
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:45,239
was it a bit of a body block?

1357
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:45,760
Well,

1358
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,719
I agreed with him.

1359
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:47,500
Like I looked,

1360
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:47,980
I'm,

1361
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,519
I'm like,

1362
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,460
you were talking about Sir Dawn Bradman and I'm the same.

1363
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:51,639
I,

1364
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,099
I look back at races and go,

1365
00:39:54,139 --> 00:39:54,639
Oh,

1366
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:55,679
I could have done that there.

1367
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:57,400
Like I could have fixed that easily.

1368
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:57,699
And,

1369
00:39:57,699 --> 00:39:58,719
um,

1370
00:39:58,719 --> 00:39:59,019
you know,

1371
00:39:59,019 --> 00:39:59,420
so that,

1372
00:39:59,420 --> 00:39:59,679
that,

1373
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:00,559
that excites me though.

1374
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:02,559
Like looking back at races from the Olympics,

1375
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:03,639
um,

1376
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:04,199
you know,

1377
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:05,639
I can see so many areas,

1378
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:06,780
areas for improvement.

1379
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,079
And,

1380
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:07,300
um,

1381
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,460
in the moment you really have to like relish,

1382
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,000
um,

1383
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,840
the win,

1384
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,679
but then,

1385
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:11,940
you know,

1386
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,619
whenever all that time passes and you look back on races now,

1387
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:16,539
I think it's exciting to see,

1388
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,000
um,

1389
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,059
areas for improvement.

1390
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:19,179
Oh,

1391
00:40:19,179 --> 00:40:23,599
what a great story and an incredible insight into the person that you are and

1392
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,039
your coach at the same time as well.

1393
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:26,840
I love it.

1394
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,000
We see leaders are really,

1395
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,400
um,

1396
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,300
understanding of how they communicate and,

1397
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,500
and talking to you today,

1398
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,639
you can see even in pressure,

1399
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,340
situations,

1400
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,039
you've got a great,

1401
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,099
as we mentioned before,

1402
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:39,840
composure and you get your words out and in a brilliant way for such a

1403
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,420
young person.

1404
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:40,539
Have you,

1405
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:42,940
have you put some time and effort into how you communicate?

1406
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:43,960
Not really.

1407
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,619
I mean,

1408
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:46,900
I grew up with a dad who's a journalist.

1409
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,679
And so,

1410
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:48,719
um,

1411
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:50,320
I guess I've been exposed to it,

1412
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,500
but I think potentially growing up in Tassie and,

1413
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,159
um,

1414
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:56,800
as an 11 year old becoming state champion,

1415
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,179
I got the back page of the paper.

1416
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:03,420
And so I think I was exposed to the media quite young.

1417
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:03,619
And,

1418
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:06,219
and so I feel like I handle it quite well,

1419
00:41:06,219 --> 00:41:07,039
but,

1420
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:07,619
um,

1421
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:08,320
I've never really,

1422
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,760
it's never really been something I've worked on.

1423
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,619
I think it's just in my nature of being able to speak to people and meet

1424
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:13,840
people and,

1425
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,500
and mingle quite easily.

1426
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:15,800
And,

1427
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,579
um,

1428
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:18,099
I don't get camera shy.

1429
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:19,420
And so I,

1430
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:19,920
um,

1431
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,260
yeah,

1432
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,699
I think that's something I'm quite proud of.

1433
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:21,960
I,

1434
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,239
you know,

1435
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,960
if I walked into a room and I didn't know anyone,

1436
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,880
I think I could easily start a conversation with someone and get to know

1437
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:28,699
them and what's going on in their life.

1438
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:28,960
And,

1439
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,639
um,

1440
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:30,679
that's exciting though.

1441
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:31,239
Um,

1442
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,039
I think it's always really cool to,

1443
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:33,380
you know,

1444
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,940
learn things about other people and,

1445
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,619
and meet people that you would never usually get to meet.

1446
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:37,980
So,

1447
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:38,539
um,

1448
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:39,380
yeah.

1449
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:39,920
Arnie,

1450
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,739
we see leaders are really conscious of collaboration now more,

1451
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:43,639
more than ever.

1452
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:43,940
And,

1453
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,920
and listening to you and even before we started,

1454
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,159
you know,

1455
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:47,420
I asked you about,

1456
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:47,619
you know,

1457
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:49,320
you've been asked a lot of questions and you said,

1458
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:49,519
no,

1459
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:51,320
I see what I do as a partnership.

1460
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:51,619
And you,

1461
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:51,860
you,

1462
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:55,539
you make sure that the Dean comes up in conversation,

1463
00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:55,940
your coach,

1464
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,599
Dean Boxall.

1465
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:57,199
I mean,

1466
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:59,719
it is a collaboration in lots of ways.

1467
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:02,820
Is that how you've approached the whole performance for you?

1468
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,280
That it's not,

1469
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,400
just you out there doing it,

1470
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,780
that you've got a team behind you and how have you gone about it?

1471
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,219
Yeah.

1472
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:07,719
I mean,

1473
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:09,280
certainly Dean is my biggest,

1474
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,960
biggest partner through all of this.

1475
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,679
There's obviously a lot of other people that play a big role.

1476
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:14,340
Um,

1477
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:18,519
but he is someone who we made this deal.

1478
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:19,119
Um,

1479
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,880
if he writes the program the best that he can,

1480
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,760
I will execute it the best that I can.

1481
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,980
And so it certainly is a partnership.

1482
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,880
I couldn't do it without him.

1483
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:27,940
I,

1484
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:32,719
he's quite an eccentric personality and I don't think that he would work well

1485
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:33,739
with some people,

1486
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,639
um,

1487
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:38,860
because he does set such high standards and he has quite an out there

1488
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,559
personality,

1489
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:41,179
but for some reason,

1490
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:41,780
um,

1491
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,460
he just found the key to me and,

1492
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,360
um,

1493
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,860
we just clicked straight away.

1494
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,000
And I think our personalities just gel perfectly.

1495
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,639
I mean,

1496
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:52,119
you'd think that they'll probably clash because I'm quite,

1497
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:53,579
um,

1498
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:55,760
opinionated and out there and,

1499
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,960
um,

1500
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,280
you know,

1501
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,159
quite fiery,

1502
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:58,920
but,

1503
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,199
but it just works.

1504
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:02,699
And I think probably because of our work ethic,

1505
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:03,260
um,

1506
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,579
we work really well together.

1507
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:04,960
Um,

1508
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,619
he gets quite frustrated if he sees things not being done the best that they

1509
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:10,219
can be.

1510
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:14,539
And so I try to do everything as best I can to keep the peace as well.

1511
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:15,380
Um,

1512
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,059
but it's more so with us,

1513
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:19,159
it's about making deals.

1514
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:19,760
And so,

1515
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,039
I mean,

1516
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:20,900
even this week,

1517
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,739
um,

1518
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:23,840
I've just come back from break and he said to me,

1519
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,679
you know,

1520
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:26,480
are you giving me the green light to go?

1521
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,699
Like we've got less than two years.

1522
00:43:28,699 --> 00:43:31,820
Are you giving me the green light to go and put you under pressure?

1523
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,820
And,

1524
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,820
um,

1525
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,820
go through those hard moments again.

1526
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,820
And,

1527
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,820
and for me,

1528
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,820
it's not even a question,

1529
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:38,820
um,

1530
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,820
for sure.

1531
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,820
Like if he,

1532
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,820
he's got to do it,

1533
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,820
he's got to do to get the best out of me.

1534
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,820
And some people can't handle that,

1535
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,820
but,

1536
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,820
um,

1537
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,820
I'm,

1538
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,820
I'm open to anything to get,

1539
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:48,820
get more out of me and,

1540
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,820
and reach my potential.

1541
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,820
And I,

1542
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:51,820
he just knows how to,

1543
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:52,820
how to get that.

1544
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,820
And I love hearing that he does ask that question,

1545
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,820
and he's,

1546
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,820
and he knows the answer,

1547
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,820
I'm assuming,

1548
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,820
but without asking it,

1549
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:00,820
you're not part of the process,

1550
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:01,820
are you?

1551
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,820
Hey,

1552
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,820
I've signed up to that.

1553
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:06,820
He's done his best and he's working overtime and not sleeping at night.

1554
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,820
I'm going to hold up my end of the bargain as,

1555
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,820
as best I can.

1556
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,820
It's great.

1557
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,820
You know,

1558
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,820
we're a bit obsessed with leadership and leadership stories,

1559
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:16,820
but in the past that wouldn't have been a coach relationship is having you part of the,

1560
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,820
once you sign on,

1561
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,820
I'm assuming all bets are off,

1562
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,820
you know,

1563
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,820
you then do your best,

1564
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:22,820
but,

1565
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,820
uh,

1566
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,820
it sounds like you're included in it,

1567
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,820
uh,

1568
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,820
to that point.

1569
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:27,820
Yeah.

1570
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,820
Well,

1571
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,820
he always says that,

1572
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,820
um,

1573
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,820
I want to win at national age and he goes,

1574
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,820
okay,

1575
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,820
if you want to win,

1576
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,820
then you have to understand what that's going to take.

1577
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,820
So,

1578
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,820
um,

1579
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,820
are you ready to sign on to what I'm going to have to do to get the best out of you?

1580
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,820
And,

1581
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,820
and they go,

1582
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,820
yeah,

1583
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:46,820
yeah,

1584
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,820
yeah.

1585
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,820
And then,

1586
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,820
you know,

1587
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,820
training happens and they get put under pressure and they've got to repeat things and,

1588
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,820
and they don't like it.

1589
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,820
And,

1590
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:53,820
you know,

1591
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:54,820
he goes,

1592
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,820
well,

1593
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:56,820
you're the one that came to me and said,

1594
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:57,820
do you want to win?

1595
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,820
He said,

1596
00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:59,820
you telling me you want to win is the worst thing you can tell me,

1597
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,820
the right to go after you and try and get the best out of you.

1598
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,820
But for me,

1599
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:04,820
um,

1600
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,820
I love it.

1601
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,820
I love being pushed to the limit.

1602
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,820
I love doing the repeats.

1603
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:13,820
I love having the feeling of knowing that while my competitors are done training and,

1604
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,820
or asleep on the other side of the world,

1605
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,820
I'm here doing the extra.

1606
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,820
And,

1607
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,820
um,

1608
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,820
I think that's why we work so well together.

1609
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:21,820
Now,

1610
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:22,820
I think I'm,

1611
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,820
uh,

1612
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,820
got a guess at,

1613
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,820
uh,

1614
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:26,820
these two final questions and where you might head with them.

1615
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,820
But I've been asking these,

1616
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,820
uh,

1617
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,820
a lot of people about the privilege of sitting down with,

1618
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,820
and I've,

1619
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,820
I've loved,

1620
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:33,820
uh,

1621
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,820
listening to you today.

1622
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,820
Final two questions.

1623
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,820
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1624
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:37,820
Well,

1625
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,820
I,

1626
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,820
Dean is definitely there,

1627
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,820
but I,

1628
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:41,820
I would say my,

1629
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,820
probably my mom.

1630
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,820
Um,

1631
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,820
she is more competitive than me.

1632
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,820
She,

1633
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:48,820
um,

1634
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:49,820
is super fiery.

1635
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:50,820
Um,

1636
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,820
she stands for what she believes in.

1637
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,820
And I think that she has just been,

1638
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,820
she just knew how to be the perfect mom to me,

1639
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:58,820
um,

1640
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:59,820
growing up,

1641
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:00,820
um,

1642
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:01,820
you know,

1643
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:02,820
as an athlete and also as a,

1644
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:03,820
as a teenager,

1645
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,820
she'd never forgot who I was as a person,

1646
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:06,820
um,

1647
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,820
as well as who I,

1648
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:08,820
as an,

1649
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,820
as a,

1650
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:10,820
who,

1651
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:11,820
who I am as a swimmer.

1652
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:12,820
And,

1653
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:13,820
um,

1654
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:14,820
she's an incredibly hard worker as well.

1655
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:15,820
And I think she set the standard for me.

1656
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:16,820
So I'd probably say my mom,

1657
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:17,820
um,

1658
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:18,820
Dean is definitely there though.

1659
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:19,820
I look up to him like my,

1660
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:20,820
my second dad and,

1661
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,820
and my coach,

1662
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,820
and I trust him with my life.

1663
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,820
But,

1664
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:24,820
um,

1665
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:25,820
I think my mom.

1666
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,820
What a great answer.

1667
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,820
And,

1668
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:28,820
and,

1669
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:29,820
and I think I think it's,

1670
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,820
it's,

1671
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:31,820
it's a great story about,

1672
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,820
about that context of,

1673
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:33,820
uh,

1674
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,820
your mom just treading that line beautifully between inspiration,

1675
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:36,820
but not overlaying,

1676
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:37,820
you know,

1677
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,820
her,

1678
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,820
uh,

1679
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,820
her world on your world.

1680
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,820
That's,

1681
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:42,820
um,

1682
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:43,820
an incredible story in itself.

1683
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:44,820
If,

1684
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,820
if you could collaborate,

1685
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:46,820
uh,

1686
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:47,820
Arnie with anyone in any area of your life.

1687
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:48,820
And we,

1688
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:49,820
we've seen and read about your passion for a range of different things,

1689
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,820
um,

1690
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:51,820
from cooking and you might head to,

1691
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:52,820
to swimming,

1692
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,820
or is there someone in your world that you thought I'd love to,

1693
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,820
uh,

1694
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:55,820
spend some time with them and that would make me,

1695
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:56,820
uh,

1696
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:03,199
person in any area of your life is there someone that springs to mind um I'm trying to think really

1697
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:12,679
I mean I love hearing um other athletes stories and and what they have gone through um to get to

1698
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:17,820
where they are I mean someone who I've spent a little bit of time talking to is Ian Thorpe I mean

1699
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:25,360
um I feel like he was under enormous pressure at such a young age as well and um you know learning

1700
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:31,579
a little bit about him and and getting to know him I've really loved um but in terms of collaborating

1701
00:47:31,579 --> 00:47:35,780
I mean I'm not really sure I'm always just open to learning new things and finding new ways to

1702
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:41,300
get better and um sometimes people pop into your life for a reason and and you know I believe that

1703
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:48,019
everything happens for a reason and so um I'm not going to put my finger on anyone but um we'll see

1704
00:47:48,019 --> 00:47:54,199
I love your open do you follow other sports I mean Ian Thorpe uh makes a lot of sense doesn't

1705
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:55,340
he given what he's done

1706
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,639
and the person that he is but do you do you follow other sports you take inspiration from

1707
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:05,599
other athletes in other parts of the world um I mean my biggest idol um in the world is Rafa Nadal

1708
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:11,840
um you got to meet recently didn't you yeah I got to meet him and I um recently went to his academy

1709
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:17,420
in Spain which was amazing but I look up to him I believe he has the he's the epitome of what high

1710
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:23,300
performance is just his attitude to tennis I I love his passion and so um yeah I definitely follow

1711
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,179
him and I think he's a great guy and I think he's a great guy and I think he's a great guy and I think

1712
00:48:28,179 --> 00:48:34,719
I got corrupted by the Hawks my um my whole family on my mom's side dating back to my grandfather's

1713
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:40,760
father is Richmond all the way down the family um and I got corrupted it was footy colors day

1714
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:46,400
in prep and half the class was Hawthorne and so um I went and I switched to Hawthorne and

1715
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,460
and still go for the Hawks um but living in Queensland you don't really get to see

1716
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:55,219
the foot the footy as much up here so it's more

1717
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:00,340
rugby league up here um which I've started to get into a little bit but um not so much I I

1718
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:05,519
definitely follow AFL more I love your language they're corrupted uh by the Hawks who had their

1719
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:10,179
home second home base down in Launceston where we grew up and they did a good job of uh getting a

1720
00:49:10,179 --> 00:49:15,800
lot of that part of uh of Tassie on board with the Hawks I have four kids we live in Hawthorne

1721
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,900
Arnie and that'll go to junior clinics and 90% of the kids are wearing Hawthorne gear and they'd

1722
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:23,980
come home and they'd say do you know what I I think I want to back for Hawthorne I'd say that's

1723
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:30,199
fine a new family and a new house because there's no way that's ever going to happen that was one

1724
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:36,159
thing I wasn't prepared to uh to bend on at all um it's been uh unbelievable to chat to you I love
