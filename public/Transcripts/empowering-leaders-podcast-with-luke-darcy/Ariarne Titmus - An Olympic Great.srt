00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:12,119
This week's conversation is with a truly incredible young Australian, Ariane Titmuss.

2
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,920
You know the name from her remarkable achievements in the pool at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,320
She won two gold medals, defeating one of the greatest Olympians of all time,

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,199
Katie Ledecky from the US in the 400 metre freestyle.

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,480
I found this conversation incredibly valuable, not only from a sporting context,

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:36,460
but the hacks and life lessons you learn from a 21-year-old who has achieved incredible success.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,320
What was unique about it and something that I loved was hearing Ariane's approach to life post-Olympics

8
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:45,719
and her unique perspective on chasing the perfect race

9
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,899
and how she sees the opportunity for constant and never-ending self-improvement.

10
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:55,560
I always find it incredibly interesting listening and learning and talking to sports people like Ariane

11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,380
and how they approach their life and leading in their own world.

12
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,840
It's really the basis for the work that we do in our leadership business, Alita.

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,140
And we've had the great pleasure of working with incredible leaders like Ariane,

14
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,659
Ange-Poster Coglou, Mikel Arteta from Arsenal, just to name a few.

15
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:14,780
And we would encourage you to check out our signature Alita Connect program,

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,219
Head to alitacollective.com.

19
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,319
At 21 years of age, Ariane Titmuss has remarkably etched her name in the history books

20
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,780
as one of Australia's most decorated athletes.

21
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:49,980
Arnie, as you're affectionately known, you just told me you feel like you're in trouble

22
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,939
if we refer to you as Ariane.

23
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:54,780
It's an amazing story of success and dedication.

24
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:56,719
I really appreciate you joining me today.

25
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,500
No, thanks for having me.

26
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,239
It takes enormous dedication and discipline to swim the case that you did to push yourself

27
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,959
through that enormous pain every day to achieve what you have.

28
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,620
Can I ask you?

29
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,139
How have you found that sense of leadership and discipline within yourself?

30
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,500
I think that it came quite naturally to me.

31
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,460
I mean, I've been doing this since I was quite young.

32
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,120
I went on my first overseas trip when I was 14 for World Juniors.

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,860
So I think that it's just something I've grown up with.

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,240
And I had to really become used to it quite quickly, you know,

35
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,840
especially doing school as well as training as a professional athlete.

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,020
I think you have to kind of take it in your stride.

37
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,500
And if you want to achieve something great and, you know,

38
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,139
I had to.

39
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,039
I understand that if this is the path I wanted to go down,

40
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:43,099
I had to get used to it pretty quickly,

41
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,879
handling the training and everything else going on in my life.

42
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:52,680
But I feel like, I don't know, I just, I think I'm a very scheduled person.

43
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,860
I am very routined.

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,340
And I think that in my nature, it came quite easy.

45
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,639
Before we just start, press record, I said, hello, how's your day?

46
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,300
And you said, oh, it's really quiet for me at the moment.

47
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:04,740
But you have been in the pool.

48
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:05,860
You've done a gym session.

49
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,919
And as you said, there's a bit of a gap between,

50
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,020
now and the world championships in July next year.

51
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,520
Do you still have like normal people, your days where you go,

52
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,439
I just don't want to get out of bed today?

53
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,539
Or do you find that easy?

54
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:19,139
I think those are the days I'm having at the moment.

55
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:24,539
I think after having a break and sleeping in and having to quickly set the alarm

56
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:28,120
to quarter to six, it's tough getting back into it.

57
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:32,699
But it's very rare that I wake up not wanting to go training

58
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:38,139
or it's very rare in the afternoon I wake up from a nap and I'm not motivated.

59
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,699
I feel really motivated to go to training.

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,780
And obviously in the middle of the year, it's such a grind and I'm tired all the time.

61
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,419
But I always believe there's a purpose for every session.

62
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,599
And I freak out if I'm not going to go to one.

63
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,439
You know, there's money in the bank that I haven't stashed.

64
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:57,840
So I never really, you know, feel like that.

65
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,180
And every session, especially in like swimming, every session has its purpose.

66
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,719
And I, yeah, I don't really want to miss one.

67
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,500
Go back to 2019.

68
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,900
And Katie Ledecky and you get mentioned in the same sentence.

69
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,120
I think every time someone speaks to you at that stage,

70
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:16,980
she was a 15-time world champion, a five-time gold medalist

71
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,600
and one of the world's greatest ever Olympians.

72
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,560
And you beat her at the world championships.

73
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,180
But for me to then go into the Olympics, you know, a short time later,

74
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,819
in effect a couple of years later and win the 200 and 400

75
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:32,759
with all of that pressure coming your way,

76
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:35,379
there was so much expectation, performance anxiety.

77
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,079
I mean, can you pass on to us?

78
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,459
How did you cope with that?

79
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,699
All of us deal with pressure, but that was extreme pressure

80
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,899
and you seemed to take it in your stride.

81
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,399
Yeah, I think that looking back now,

82
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,759
I don't think I realised how much weight was on my shoulders.

83
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,240
And I think kind of being in a bit of a bubble because of COVID

84
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,939
prior to the Olympics in the lead up,

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,300
I think that we didn't actually see everything that was being said in the media

86
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,259
or we didn't really, we weren't really immersed in society.

87
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:06,879
So we weren't really feeling, you know, the angst around the Olympics.

88
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,480
And the expectation.

89
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,720
And so I think looking back now, that probably helped me.

90
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,620
But I like to think that the pressure that I put on myself

91
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,279
and that my coach puts on me is somewhat higher than external pressures.

92
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,759
And I think that if I can deal with that, then I can deal with anything really.

93
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,120
And, you know, I think I'm pretty good at sticking in my lane

94
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,120
and doing what I have to do.

95
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,579
But looking back now, it was a pressure cooker situation.

96
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,139
Olympics is like nothing else.

97
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:36,879
The rivalry.

98
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,939
The rivalry between Katie and I, I know, was definitely highlighted.

99
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,660
And I did feel the pressure.

100
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:47,199
Like I was worried, you know, if I don't win, what the, you know,

101
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,639
what the reaction is going to be.

102
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,959
But I'm happy that it all went to plan.

103
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,740
And we fell in love with you and your story at the Tokyo Olympics.

104
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,680
And for me, not only the victory,

105
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:02,959
but the grace and the sportsmanship you show was equally as impressive.

106
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,959
I don't think you're even out of the pool and someone had asked you about your

107
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,420
arrival, who we just spoke about.

108
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,180
And I think the words attributed you were, I couldn't be here without her.

109
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,620
She set the standard.

110
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,459
It's impressive at any age to show that sort of composure and humility.

111
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:19,259
Where does that come from within you?

112
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,279
I think I'm quite a deep thinker.

113
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,240
I keep my emotions to myself.

114
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:27,839
You know, I don't really like talking about swimming.

115
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,680
I like to keep things inside.

116
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,459
And I'm not sure.

117
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,060
I just become composed in those really hectic situations, I think,

118
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:36,939
in other areas of my life.

119
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,680
I'm quite a flamboyant person.

120
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,920
I'm quite outgoing, extroverted.

121
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,439
But then I think with my job and my role as a swimmer,

122
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,000
I can really zone in and switch on and set my mind into the zone that it had

123
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,779
to be in for those events.

124
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,360
And I feel like that's definitely a tool that I have.

125
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,220
But for me, answering those questions about Katie was so easy because she's

126
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,639
definitely changed the way that females swim, middle distance freestyle.

127
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,779
And it was very easy for me to,

128
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:10,000
you know, compliment her and be grateful for the standard that she had set.

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,500
Because I don't think if she wasn't swimming as fast as she was,

130
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,379
there's no way that I would be swimming as fast as this.

131
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:19,480
So those questions are easy for me to answer.

132
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,839
You mentioned that part of your makeup is this ability under pressure to be

133
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:29,120
able to compartmentalize and that's swimming and that's what I do and keep

134
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,519
out the external noise.

135
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,220
Is there anything that you can share with us?

136
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,480
I mean, a lot of people use mindfulness and meditation or have got, you know,

137
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,860
abilities and techniques that really focus them in and they do that.

138
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,500
Is it, is there strategies that you use or is it just part of how you go about it?

139
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,180
I remember it would have been probably two years out from what would have been

140
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,240
Tokyo 2020 before the Olympics were postponed.

141
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,240
And I went over to Dean's house and I cooked him dinner and we sat down in his

142
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,759
lounge room and we wanted to make a set of like self affirmations that I could

143
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,819
read to myself every day.

144
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,360
Because I think that the inner belief in yourself is kind of the,

145
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,259
the factor that can sometimes be make or break.

146
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,379
I think if you go into a race without the belief that you can win,

147
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,019
you're definitely not going to win.

148
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:19,759
So I think for me, especially racing someone who is what I believe the goat,

149
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,699
I think I had to have this extraordinary belief in myself to actually believe

150
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:24,600
that I could beat her.

151
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:31,019
So we sat down and wrote down all these self affirmations and it was in first

152
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,100
person.

153
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,440
It was in, you know, Ariant hypnosis or I am.

154
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,320
And we made these cards.

155
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,659
And it was four different areas of my life.

156
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,519
It was who I am as a person, who I am as a swimmer,

157
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,639
what I'm proud of and what I have to work on.

158
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:51,580
And we made 10 of each and I printed them off and I had one in the glove box of

159
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,039
my car.

160
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,320
So sometimes I would read them before going into a session.

161
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,759
I had one in my bedroom and, or just be, you know,

162
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:02,200
in the bathroom drawer and when I'm cleaning my teeth,

163
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,279
pull them out and look in the mirror and read them to myself.

164
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,360
And it sounds,

165
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,799
it's stupid,

166
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,080
but I think when you start reading these things,

167
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:11,600
like I have the best backend in the world,

168
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,759
I have the best strength in the world.

169
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,360
I'm a good person.

170
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,740
I'm a humble person.

171
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,980
And I think reading these things,

172
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,799
eventually you start to become that and you,

173
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,860
you feel this extra belief in yourself.

174
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,179
And I think for me,

175
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:27,960
that really helped,

176
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:28,740
you know,

177
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,799
going to Olympics,

178
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,159
my mindset was,

179
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,519
you know,

180
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,320
for me to win,

181
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,580
they have to beat me.

182
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,159
It's not,

183
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:35,860
you know,

184
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,379
me having,

185
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:36,919
they have to beat them.

186
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,779
They have to beat me.

187
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,480
And I think that that's really the only way that you can have your mind going

188
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,620
into an Olympic final,

189
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,340
fighting for a gold medal.

190
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:46,320
I love you sharing that,

191
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:46,679
Arnie.

192
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:47,440
It's brilliant.

193
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:47,759
It's,

194
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,059
it's far from stupid and it's such a transferable thing.

195
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:54,039
They say we have 80,000 thoughts a day and the,

196
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,000
and the human consciousness often is towards the negative,

197
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:57,480
isn't it?

198
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,019
That you can,

199
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,580
that's where,

200
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,980
when that multiplies,

201
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:02,539
the self-doubt creeps in and the anxiety goes up.

202
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:03,279
But for you to,

203
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,539
to practice that in your car and your bathroom,

204
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,440
and I love the way,

205
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,559
you and your coach,

206
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,100
Dean Boxer,

207
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,360
who we really want to talk about in a moment's time,

208
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,379
we're able to just systematically do that.

209
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:15,000
And also about you as a person too,

210
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:17,179
that you're bigger than that as a swimmer and,

211
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:17,460
and,

212
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:17,879
you know,

213
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,120
to have you as the whole person,

214
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,519
I suppose,

215
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,000
was that really fundamental to you as well to say,

216
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,720
you know what,

217
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:23,759
regardless of what happens,

218
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,059
I'm going to do my best and,

219
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:27,659
and I'm still a great person is a pretty profound thing to do as well.

220
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:28,159
Yeah,

221
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,679
for sure.

222
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,120
I mean,

223
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,759
swimming is definitely something that I've loved my whole life and I'm very

224
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,440
fortunate now that I've turned it into a career and I've pretty much,

225
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,200
achieved everything I've wanted to in the sport,

226
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,639
but I'm also beyond that.

227
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:40,899
You know,

228
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,620
I want people to know who I am more than just Ariantip,

229
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:43,840
Mr.

230
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,139
Swimmer.

231
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:44,500
I'm,

232
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,500
I believe I'm a lot more than that.

233
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:46,799
And I,

234
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,259
I try to portray that in the media as best as I can.

235
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,159
And when I'm meeting people,

236
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,360
I try to be my complete self and show people my other interests.

237
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:56,279
Because swimming is not forever.

238
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:56,980
I mean,

239
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,500
I probably will be done before the age of 30.

240
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:04,240
So I think it's really important for people to understand that athletes also

241
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,179
have feelings as well.

242
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:06,179
And people,

243
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,080
people beyond their sport.

244
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,539
Beautifully said.

245
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:10,539
And you know,

246
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,659
it's why I'm so interested to talk to you as the whole person and the 21 year

247
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:15,080
old,

248
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:16,179
incredible achiever,

249
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,100
but incredible leader,

250
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,340
because that comes out in all the interviews I hear with you.

251
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,720
And I wanted to ask you about this.

252
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,059
It was interesting to say in some ways for you,

253
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,179
COVID and lockdown ended up being of benefit because you're so focused and

254
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:31,100
you're able to really drill into the Olympics coming up.

255
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,019
But for a lot of young people,

256
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:35,179
it's been incredibly traumatic time and time away from school and,

257
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:36,179
uh,

258
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:37,799
teenage girls in particular,

259
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,679
the bracket in there,

260
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,139
the,

261
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:39,639
the,

262
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,799
the data we're seeing is that there was lots of,

263
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,419
you know,

264
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:43,919
eating disorders and challenges,

265
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,419
you know,

266
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:46,620
for you and your story grew up in Tasmania.

267
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,059
It's the most unlikely place,

268
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,659
uh,

269
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:50,460
for an Olympic gold medalist in some ways.

270
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,620
What advice would you pass on to perhaps those that have been through a

271
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,899
challenging time about,

272
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,179
you know,

273
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:56,580
following something they're passionate about?

274
00:11:57,139 --> 00:11:57,679
Well,

275
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,679
I think looking at COVID firstly for me,

276
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,220
um,

277
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,460
I was in denial of lockdown and training finishing.

278
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,139
I remember getting the message on my phone.

279
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:07,460
I'd woken up from my nap.

280
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,419
Um,

281
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:08,740
you know,

282
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,480
I sleep from 11 to one every day on a,

283
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:12,960
on a day that I trained twice.

284
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,519
And I woke up and had all these messages saying,

285
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,259
trainings off the Olympics are off.

286
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:18,740
And I didn't believe it.

287
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,000
I still went to the pool and,

288
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:20,539
um,

289
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:20,879
was like,

290
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:21,639
not I'm getting in.

291
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,519
Like I've the Olympics will happen.

292
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,399
I'm still training.

293
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,639
And it wasn't until,

294
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:25,980
you know,

295
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,840
the pool was not really open that I,

296
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,480
it kind of switched flicked.

297
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,539
And I pretty much cried for the next four days.

298
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:34,299
Cause I was so out of routine,

299
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:36,019
but in terms of young girls,

300
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:36,120
I mean,

301
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:37,019
I saw it firsthand.

302
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,399
My sister was finishing year 12 in 2020.

303
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,919
And I don't think that there was anything more challenging than having to

304
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:47,100
finish your final year of school in lockdown.

305
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,600
she was quite sick before COVID even happened.

306
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,860
And so she wasn't at school.

307
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,200
And then for it to be pretty much most of the year,

308
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,820
um,

309
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,639
doing lessons on a laptop and not really having a proper formal and not

310
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,399
really having,

311
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:02,879
you know,

312
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,240
all those end of year celebrations that you usually have.

313
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,120
I think it definitely,

314
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:08,019
definitely puts a damper on things.

315
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:09,120
And I mean,

316
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,700
I'm quite an outlier for,

317
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,240
um,

318
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,080
my upbringing as a teenage girl,

319
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:13,360
you know,

320
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,460
I didn't care that I had to miss out on parties or I didn't care that I

321
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,639
wasn't doing what they were doing because I was so invested in my swimming,

322
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:24,000
but I can see how socially,

323
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,840
um,

324
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:28,320
COVID would have played a big role in people's self-confidence.

325
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,159
They can't get out.

326
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,980
They can't move.

327
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,940
And I think exercise especially is really good for your mental health.

328
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,120
So I guess my advice would be when you can't,

329
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:37,899
do the things that you would usually do,

330
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:40,059
switch your mind to focus on something else.

331
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:41,720
And so for me,

332
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,019
while I couldn't swim,

333
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,100
I tried to take up other things.

334
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,960
And as much as I wasn't great at it,

335
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,240
um,

336
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,080
I tried knitting,

337
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,019
I tried coloring in like just really small things.

338
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:51,860
Um,

339
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,320
it keeps your mind busy and it gets your mind off,

340
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,220
you know,

341
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,519
stops thoughts wandering around in there.

342
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,379
And I think that's really important.

343
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:02,740
And I think it's also important as much as lockdown was hard.

344
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,679
I think it's also,

345
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:04,620
um,

346
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,100
important to be grateful and think about,

347
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,159
about the things that you do have that are still going for you in your life.

348
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:09,519
And,

349
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,059
um,

350
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,940
so I think that can always kind of lift you up a little bit.

351
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:13,659
Oh,

352
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:15,340
what a great way to sum it up.

353
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,659
Isn't it?

354
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:19,240
When you flick the mind to being grateful and particularly for those of us live

355
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,799
in a country like Australia and,

356
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:20,879
uh,

357
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:23,440
you don't have to look too far to see what a privilege it is even in the most

358
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,340
challenging times.

359
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:24,940
And,

360
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,840
and as you do,

361
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,899
you're often thinking about someone else.

362
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,460
And when you're in that mindset as well around supporting other people,

363
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,179
it's very hard to feel sad and depressed.

364
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:35,879
And I love talking to people like you,

365
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:38,820
who've achieved extraordinary success,

366
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,639
but they're humble enough.

367
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:41,100
They don't necessarily see themselves as,

368
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,779
as leaders and role models.

369
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:43,019
I mean,

370
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:43,559
to me,

371
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:46,200
your story is the ultimate leader for your generation.

372
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,259
You describe yourself just then as an outlier because you know what you are a

373
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:53,519
bit different in that you don't tend to worry about the stuff you're missing out

374
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,139
on because your focus is so strong.

375
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,580
Is that something that you embrace being,

376
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,379
being a young leader?

377
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:58,919
Yeah,

378
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:00,659
I think that I'm quite relatable,

379
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,320
um,

380
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,779
to girls my age or growing up.

381
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,559
Um,

382
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:05,700
I've always,

383
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,919
seen myself as a very normal person.

384
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:08,500
I've never,

385
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:09,379
you know,

386
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:12,899
I was finishing year 12 the year that I went to Commonwealth games and,

387
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,460
um,

388
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,379
you know,

389
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:15,419
won gold medals there.

390
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:19,600
And I guess it was kind of my breakout meeting the next week I was back at school and,

391
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,220
um,

392
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,559
in class with everyone.

393
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:25,159
And so I think I was relatable to people to see that,

394
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,820
um,

395
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,759
doesn't matter how much you have on your plate.

396
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,500
Doesn't matter what's going on in your,

397
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,559
not in your life.

398
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,039
Um,

399
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,039
you can always kind of figure things out and,

400
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,200
and achieve your goals.

401
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,580
And I think for me,

402
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:35,860
um,

403
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:37,379
I always get asked in school,

404
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:39,000
how did you do school and swimming?

405
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,940
And you know,

406
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,759
time management was a really big thing for me.

407
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,059
And,

408
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,639
um,

409
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,179
I think that's something that I think has helped people.

410
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:45,659
Um,

411
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:46,500
you know,

412
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,879
learning to juggle a lot of things in life was really hard.

413
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:50,259
So,

414
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:50,620
I mean,

415
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,120
I made the decision to do year 12 over two years,

416
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,620
which,

417
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,360
um,

418
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:54,840
you know,

419
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,460
I was away from school for 15 weeks,

420
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,360
the last year of school.

421
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,919
So I decided to do that and stay back.

422
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,419
And,

423
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:01,919
um,

424
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,259
yeah,

425
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:04,559
I think that for me,

426
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,580
I,

427
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,759
like I said,

428
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:06,980
I was,

429
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,620
I'm an outlier.

430
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,159
I don't think I think the same as a lot of people my age.

431
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,539
I think I'm beyond my years because I've been on the national team with older

432
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,600
people around me since I was 16.

433
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:16,580
So,

434
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,279
um,

435
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,860
but I still think I'm quite relatable in the sense that I'm a very normal

436
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,700
person still.

437
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,100
Can you share with us,

438
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,639
uh,

439
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,200
you know,

440
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,240
managing your time and clearly for you,

441
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,480
you know,

442
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,100
when you're building up to a big meet every second of time is,

443
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,860
is precious,

444
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,899
but you've still got to balance and live a normal life.

445
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:35,279
And you block out the two hours you sleep from 11 to 11,

446
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,960
we just heard that before.

447
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,940
How do you go about managing your time?

448
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,779
What's the system use?

449
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,480
I think it's just prioritizing the things that are most important to you that

450
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,320
day.

451
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,240
Like for me,

452
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,840
on Monday,

453
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,200
Tuesday,

454
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,580
Thursday is when I have swimming in the morning and swimming in the,

455
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,519
in the afternoon.

456
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:50,960
And I mean,

457
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,820
all up training those days is about eight hours.

458
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:54,840
Um,

459
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,039
swimming is my number one.

460
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:59,580
So my manager knows not to call me between 11 and one or,

461
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,720
um,

462
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,019
you know,

463
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:04,380
everything I plan for that day is to make sure that I'm performance ready,

464
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,160
especially in that,

465
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,380
that afternoon after the session in the morning,

466
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,819
whereas Wednesdays and Fridays,

467
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,220
when I have nothing on in the afternoon,

468
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,339
it's about prioritizing other things in my life,

469
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:17,460
whether it's getting a coffee with a friend or catching up on some errands or,

470
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:17,720
you know,

471
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,460
getting a massage and doing those things.

472
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:24,099
I think it's really playing things out and prioritizing the more important

473
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:25,500
things in your life at that time.

474
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,240
And,

475
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,880
um,

476
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,680
I also try to keep as busy as I can.

477
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,759
I think I work better under pressure.

478
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:31,859
Um,

479
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,680
so I think that also helps as well.

480
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,720
So now post the Olympics,

481
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:37,940
you know,

482
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,920
21 years of age,

483
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,140
it's,

484
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,400
it's incredible to see what you've done in that short space of time,

485
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
but you're a household name.

486
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,299
Now people recognize you down the street and everywhere you go.

487
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:48,680
How,

488
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,900
how has life changed for you?

489
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:50,720
I mean,

490
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,920
it's definitely changed.

491
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,440
I,

492
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,779
I often go to the supermarket and it's,

493
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:55,440
um,

494
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,640
it's actually a lot of the time,

495
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:56,940
you know,

496
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,859
older people that come up to me and go like,

497
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:04,220
I remember where I was when you race and it's like my Nana coming up and patting me on the back.

498
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,500
And,

499
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,140
um,

500
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,720
it makes me feel really good inside,

501
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,900
but I never thought that I would be one of those people.

502
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,220
That's,

503
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,200
that's not why I swam.

504
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,920
I never dreamt of the fame and the glory.

505
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,440
I just swam because I loved it and I had dreams that I wanted to achieve,

506
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,299
but I think it's quite humbling.

507
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:21,779
Um,

508
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:22,259
I,

509
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:22,680
you know,

510
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,819
especially during the Olympics,

511
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:27,000
most of the country was in lockdown and the amount of people that have said to me,

512
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,519
what you knew on TV while we were stuck inside really brought some joy to our household.

513
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,119
And I think,

514
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,160
you know,

515
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,539
it makes me feel good inside that I played a role in that.

516
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,119
I wasn't just swimming for myself.

517
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,519
I was genuinely swimming for the country.

518
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,119
And so,

519
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:41,660
um,

520
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,160
that makes me feel really special.

521
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,160
I have to ask you about,

522
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,500
uh,

523
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,099
the coach,

524
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:46,700
Dean Boxall,

525
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,660
and your relationship.

526
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,140
Uh,

527
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,359
it's one of the great celebrations we've ever seen.

528
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,819
I know you've spoken about it a lot.

529
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,140
I loved every bit of it.

530
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,519
It's a good point that you made.

531
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,019
A lot of us,

532
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:56,660
you know,

533
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,160
we're,

534
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,400
uh,

535
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:57,660
you know,

536
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,579
challenged by lockdown at that stage and to see that sort of joy going on and,

537
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,279
you know,

538
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,019
rip his mask off and break the rules.

539
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:04,380
And,

540
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,940
and go nuts.

541
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,299
It was,

542
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,839
did you see that coming in?

543
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,460
Did you have a sense that he was going to go cocoa bananas like that?

544
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,380
Well,

545
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,200
I think it's very funny to see the reactions of everyone else that doesn't know Dean.

546
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,940
I was so surprised and,

547
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:18,200
you know,

548
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,240
it was so out there and I mean,

549
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:20,759
it was,

550
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,380
but that is totally what he is like every day.

551
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,180
Like there is always something happening,

552
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,119
happening at training.

553
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:29,279
And I think for us,

554
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,279
it was more just a massive energy release that he had.

555
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:32,579
I mean,

556
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,000
if anyone knows Dean,

557
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:36,000
they know that he works harder than anyone.

558
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,799
Like he'll come into training and be like,

559
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:39,319
couldn't sleep last night.

560
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:39,900
He,

561
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,960
I was up at 2am,

562
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,039
sat up in bed,

563
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:42,579
just,

564
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:42,920
you know,

565
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,019
he didn't do the race right.

566
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:44,660
And,

567
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:44,960
um,

568
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,299
you know,

569
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:48,440
like he's just completely invested in,

570
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:49,440
in the sport.

571
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,440
And so for us to have a plan for years and for me to execute the race almost

572
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:55,619
perfectly,

573
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:58,779
I think it was just this release of energy that,

574
00:19:58,859 --> 00:19:59,220
you know,

575
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,880
overcame him and it came out and,

576
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,339
um,

577
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:03,119
you know,

578
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,319
he,

579
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:06,220
he gets annoyed when people ask him to do it again because he goes like,

580
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,039
I can't,

581
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,779
it just happened.

582
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:09,480
Like I didn't even know what was happening.

583
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,259
Um,

584
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,880
but I'm glad that people got to see that side of him because,

585
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,460
um,

586
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,859
I think sometimes he gets misunderstood as this crazy hard task master who sets

587
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:18,680
these,

588
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:18,859
um,

589
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:22,319
insane sessions and has incredibly high standards of which he does,

590
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,539
but he has a very soft side to him and a funny side.

591
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:25,799
And,

592
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:26,380
um,

593
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,799
I'm glad that people got to see that.

594
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:28,759
Yeah.

595
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:30,339
And I love the message for it too,

596
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:30,740
Arnie,

597
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,579
to see,

598
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,140
uh,

599
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,339
you know,

600
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:33,299
brilliant celebration.

601
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,000
And joy.

602
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:34,319
It's,

603
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,500
you know,

604
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:38,200
I played sport in an era where you weren't allowed to celebrate a win

605
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,740
because it looked like you were getting carried away.

606
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,519
And only if you won a premiership at the end of the season,

607
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,380
that was a time.

608
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,519
And for those that didn't win one,

609
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,759
did that mean that you didn't have any success or any joy along the way?

610
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:49,720
And so I think it's such a healthier,

611
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,539
uh,

612
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:51,420
attitude now.

613
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,420
And we see the next generation do generally because that's what it's about,

614
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:54,720
isn't it?

615
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,019
It's about enjoying those moments.

616
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:58,640
If you can't celebrate what you achieved at that time,

617
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,339
I'm not sure when,

618
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,299
when you ever can.

619
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,279
So I loved it.

620
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:02,940
I thought it was just a magic moment.

621
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:03,279
I love,

622
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,500
I love hearing you talk about it and share it.

623
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:06,279
I did read,

624
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:06,599
Arnie,

625
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:06,960
that,

626
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:07,380
um,

627
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,480
as young as 12,

628
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,480
uh,

629
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,440
in Tassie that,

630
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:10,680
uh,

631
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,079
you'd bump into people and you had a pool in your house that you would tell

632
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,819
people I'm on my way to the Olympics.

633
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,460
You had that vision at that young age.

634
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:17,640
Is,

635
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,259
is that true?

636
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:18,920
Yeah,

637
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,660
I was pretty set in my way on,

638
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,359
on becoming an Olympic swimmer and becoming Olympic champion.

639
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,000
Um,

640
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:24,880
I don't know.

641
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,019
I,

642
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:25,319
I mean,

643
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,839
I did a lot of sports growing up.

644
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,519
I had horses.

645
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:27,799
I,

646
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:28,740
I,

647
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:29,079
um,

648
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,440
you know,

649
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,279
rode and I got to high,

650
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:33,039
I got high school and the horses weren't getting

651
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:33,400
much,

652
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,420
much exercise.

653
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,099
And so I had,

654
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,359
we had,

655
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,619
we sold them all and swimming kind of became my number one.

656
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:38,920
And,

657
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:39,279
um,

658
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:39,539
yeah,

659
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:43,359
I for sure wasn't shy in telling people that swimming is what I wanted to

660
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:43,579
do.

661
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:46,000
And I wanted to be on the national team and,

662
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,400
you know,

663
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,140
looking back now,

664
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,420
it's so naive to say something like that at 12 years old,

665
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,740
because you have no understanding of the work that goes into becoming

666
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,519
Olympic champion.

667
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:55,920
And,

668
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:56,779
um,

669
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,119
you know,

670
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,500
even now looking back on the prep that I did for Tokyo,

671
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,680
I can't even fathom some of the things that I did and what I'm going

672
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,019
after.

673
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:03,400
Um,

674
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,339
for the next Olympics.

675
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:05,819
But,

676
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:06,519
you know,

677
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:06,759
I'm,

678
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,019
I'm proud that I was,

679
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,700
and I had that confidence in myself to say that at that age.

680
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,000
And I,

681
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:12,440
I stuck with it and I did it.

682
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,720
A lot of people will probably turn their nose up or,

683
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:15,460
you know,

684
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,700
a bit of tall poppy syndrome,

685
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,759
that type of thing.

686
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:18,859
I definitely copped it.

687
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,339
Um,

688
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,500
being a young swimmer coming through and trying to keep up with the

689
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,859
boys and not being afraid to take it to the older guys.

690
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:26,460
Um,

691
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,619
but I'm proud of myself for,

692
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:28,960
um,

693
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
that work ethic and,

694
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,640
and really sticking with it.

695
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:32,480
Well,

696
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,339
there's a perfect storm.

697
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:35,700
It seems when you listen back to you talk and,

698
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:35,960
you know,

699
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:36,420
as an old saying,

700
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,519
be careful what you wish for,

701
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:39,519
because it might just come true.

702
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:41,259
But to have that dream and then,

703
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:41,579
you know,

704
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:43,259
the positive affirmations you talked about,

705
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:45,119
and then to have a coach that's equally as fanatical,

706
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,380
and then the capacity to do those sessions and push through the pain,

707
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:51,279
things like you achieved don't happen by mistake,

708
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:51,660
do they?

709
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:51,900
It's,

710
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,160
it's,

711
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,660
you know,

712
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,680
you described the outlier part resonates with me because,

713
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:56,420
you know,

714
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,539
not everyone has got the capacity to do it,

715
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,200
but I think we can learn so much just even our daily lives.

716
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,460
If there are things we want to achieve,

717
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,500
or we want to be a better version of ourselves that,

718
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:06,700
do you see that applying to other areas?

719
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,880
We've heard you talk about you're passionate about your cooking.

720
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:09,460
You love your,

721
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,059
your,

722
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:11,519
your family influence is enormous.

723
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,079
You have got a range of other interests.

724
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,140
Do you see those skillsets applying to,

725
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,819
to you outside of just the pool?

726
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:17,599
For sure.

727
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,480
I think that,

728
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,319
um,

729
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:19,680
you know,

730
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,779
people always ask me like,

731
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:24,099
how'd you learn how to train hard or how'd you teach yourself to,

732
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:24,900
um,

733
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,339
you know,

734
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:27,039
I guess be fanatical about something.

735
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,359
And I think it's in your makeup and I'm,

736
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,359
I'm like it in a lot of areas of my life.

737
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:32,460
I'm,

738
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:32,640
I mean,

739
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,579
I'm definitely not as competitive as I am with swimming as I am with

740
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:36,519
cooking or,

741
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:37,079
um,

742
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,299
anything else like that.

743
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:40,880
But I think anything that I do do in life,

744
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,140
I want to make sure I do it properly.

745
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,519
And I say to myself,

746
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:43,900
you know,

747
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,519
if there's a hundred stones to turn over,

748
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,420
you turn over a hundred.

749
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,819
I could never go into anything knowing that I could have done it better.

750
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:51,900
And I think,

751
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,599
um,

752
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,839
that's something that I don't want to,

753
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:55,119
you know,

754
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,680
leave the sport or leave anything behind with any regrets.

755
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,240
And so,

756
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,019
um,

757
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:01,839
I think it's really important to put your best foot forward in,

758
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,400
in everything,

759
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:02,799
you do.

760
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,519
And I hope people can,

761
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:04,960
um,

762
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:05,680
you know,

763
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,259
learn from that as well.

764
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,700
Certainly can.

765
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:09,180
Uh,

766
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,819
I find it,

767
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,180
um,

768
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:10,660
just a,

769
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,140
such a compelling thing to listen to firsthand and,

770
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,380
uh,

771
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:14,700
congratulations again,

772
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:16,220
that everything that you've achieved,

773
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,599
I want to ask you a handful of questions around leadership.

774
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,279
And I love your story of,

775
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:24,000
of leadership and dimensions of what we see great leadership and great

776
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,319
leaders,

777
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,079
whether it be an Olympic gold medalist like you or someone running a,

778
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:31,559
a social venture or a business person or someone from other sports as

779
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:31,819
well.

780
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,359
And we think,

781
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,519
most people who achieve things like you have got a great sense of

782
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,259
self-leadership.

783
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:36,539
And I,

784
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:37,619
I can certainly hear that,

785
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:38,319
uh,

786
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,440
coming out in all that you say,

787
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,400
does that resonate with you?

788
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:40,799
The sense,

789
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,980
the self-leadership idea?

790
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:42,640
Yeah,

791
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,220
for sure.

792
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,059
And I think that leaders especially don't need a label to be a

793
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:47,240
leader.

794
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:47,720
I mean,

795
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,579
I am not as such a leader on the team.

796
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,099
Um,

797
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:52,400
I mean,

798
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,279
I've always been a younger athlete on the team,

799
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,559
but I guess now I've been on the national team for a while now.

800
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,359
I'm kind of,

801
00:24:59,359 --> 00:24:59,619
you know,

802
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:01,240
becoming part of that leadership group,

803
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,220
but I think,

804
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:02,940
I think you can lead,

805
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,660
um,

806
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,400
without having to say anything through your work ethic.

807
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,039
I mean,

808
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:07,500
at training,

809
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:08,759
you can be a leader by,

810
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,859
um,

811
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:11,140
just going there,

812
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,259
putting your best foot forward,

813
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,180
doing the best you can for the day and creating a great environment

814
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,900
around you.

815
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:18,859
I think that's been a leader without even knowing it.

816
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,680
So I think it's for sure being,

817
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,200
um,

818
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:25,960
sure of yourself and being empowered within yourself,

819
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,799
I think can create leadership qualities and can help others around you.

820
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:30,759
Yeah.

821
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:31,940
I love what you said then around,

822
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:32,140
not,

823
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,380
creating a title to be a leader.

824
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,299
And that's exactly what we sense.

825
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:40,220
It's the old model of having to be the boss and the hierarchical model.

826
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:40,619
It's,

827
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:41,099
it's,

828
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:41,480
you know,

829
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:42,140
absolutely.

830
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,539
We see the impact someone you could have at 15 years of age,

831
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:45,779
uh,

832
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:46,980
Arnie in a swim team,

833
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,380
just by your behaviors and the way that you're training would have,

834
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,059
uh,

835
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:50,339
you know,

836
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:53,000
shown enormous leadership and that discipline and sense of self,

837
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:53,440
um,

838
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,000
as we said is,

839
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,140
is a great story.

840
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,180
We see leaders also positively,

841
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,200
um,

842
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:01,440
or thinking about how they can positively impact others in their environment.

843
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,200
I suppose your sport,

844
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,299
your sport is a solo sport at one level,

845
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:07,440
you join a swim team and you get into relays and you compete against,

846
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,259
you know,

847
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:10,019
sometimes people in your own squad for,

848
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:10,880
for position.

849
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,880
So how do you go about positively impacting others in your environment?

850
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,400
Yeah.

851
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:15,700
I mean,

852
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,440
swimming definitely can be a lonely sport.

853
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,000
Um,

854
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,039
but in my case,

855
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:21,539
it's not,

856
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:25,019
I'm part of a huge squad where one of the biggest high performance programs in

857
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:25,559
the country,

858
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,900
I think we have about 20 of us.

859
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,519
And I think for me,

860
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:32,039
something that I always want to stick to is it doesn't matter who,

861
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,700
who you're racing and who your competitors are.

862
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,700
Don't look at them as a competitor personally.

863
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:37,799
And for me,

864
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,180
that's something that's really important.

865
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:43,779
There's girls in my squad that I race and that are competitors of mine,

866
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:45,779
or there's younger girls that are coming up.

867
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:49,119
And I think some people can get caught in the trap of,

868
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:49,500
um,

869
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:50,519
you know,

870
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:53,220
taking their competitiveness out on someone,

871
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:53,880
not for the,

872
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,940
who they are as a person,

873
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,119
but who they are as a swimmer and,

874
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:57,500
um,

875
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,700
might not treat them the way they deserve to be treated.

876
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,920
And for me,

877
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,359
um,

878
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:01,900
I try to,

879
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,880
I separate those two things.

880
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,839
And I think everyone in the squad does that really well.

881
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:05,059
And,

882
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:05,859
um,

883
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:06,980
you know,

884
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,079
I think that that creates a great environment.

885
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,660
And speaking of leaders,

886
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,859
I think that shows great leadership qualities as well.

887
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,299
So I feel very fortunate that I'm in that environment.

888
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,079
Um,

889
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:16,960
and then,

890
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,400
you know,

891
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:18,420
relays as well.

892
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:20,500
Swimming's bizarre when you think about it,

893
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:21,059
you know,

894
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:24,359
a relay of four girls coming together to be part of one team,

895
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,220
to do something great.

896
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,079
And usually those four girls are,

897
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:28,720
you know,

898
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,859
tough competitors racing for the two individual spots.

899
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,980
And then you've got to come together and work as a team and,

900
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:35,660
and,

901
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,140
you know,

902
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,880
hopefully win.

903
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,180
So I think that learning to separate personal from competitive is,

904
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,059
is really important.

905
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:43,579
Yeah.

906
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:45,319
I love the way that you go about that,

907
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:45,660
Arnie.

908
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:47,400
And I'm sure it's going to resonate with,

909
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:47,759
uh,

910
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:48,980
lots of people listening to this,

911
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,259
that even in our own workplaces or our own schools,

912
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:52,099
we can sometimes,

913
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:53,140
you know,

914
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,980
get competitive with other people.

915
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,319
And,

916
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,240
and that causes a breakdown in relationships.

917
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,599
I mean,

918
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:00,160
no one could be more competitive than you,

919
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:01,460
but yet the way,

920
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,160
and you've got this great rival we love talking about,

921
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,119
but there wasn't any nastiness or you didn't feel the need to stare her down in

922
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,099
the warmup room or,

923
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,099
or do anything like that or same in your lane.

924
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,440
And so I think you're showing people that how you can be as competitive.

925
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,059
This is a,

926
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:16,980
is a great thing,

927
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,359
but you don't need to take that out negatively on someone else.

928
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:19,680
Is that,

929
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:21,819
is that a fair summation of the way you think or?

930
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:22,500
Yeah,

931
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:23,019
for sure.

932
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:23,440
And I mean,

933
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,480
I think it helps that I'm a distance freestyler.

934
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,920
I think that the sprint boys may be a bit different.

935
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,099
Um,

936
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:31,079
but maybe us distance girls are,

937
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:31,619
you know,

938
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,799
a bit more subdued in the,

939
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:33,799
in the marshalling room,

940
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:34,640
but,

941
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,099
um,

942
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:35,519
no,

943
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,059
for sure.

944
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,859
And also like,

945
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,539
I think you want to save your competitive energy for when you need it.

946
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:40,660
Like I'll,

947
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,680
I'll say good luck to Katie.

948
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,380
Um,

949
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:46,579
that one minute before we walk out on pool deck to race,

950
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:51,440
I think that that makes me feel good inside knowing that I've said good luck to my biggest rival.

951
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,660
And she says,

952
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,700
good luck back to me.

953
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,039
And then you go out there and you really do your job and,

954
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,019
and show what you,

955
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,819
what you're made of.

956
00:28:57,859 --> 00:28:58,019
And,

957
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:58,559
um,

958
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,660
that's really important to me.

959
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,460
We said,

960
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,420
your leaders are really conscious of how they create and share their vision.

961
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,579
You had a dream as a 12 year old to be an Olympian,

962
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:16,160
and then you don't become an Olympic gold medalist,

963
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,519
uh,

964
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,119
twice,

965
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,539
uh,

966
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:17,900
without,

967
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,400
you know,

968
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,380
a really clear vision.

969
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,200
Can you tell us about how you've gone about that,

970
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,519
you know,

971
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,240
vision and,

972
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,400
and,

973
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,359
and what sort of,

974
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:24,660
uh,

975
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,079
things you've put in place to,

976
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:26,319
to,

977
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,039
to achieve that?

978
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:27,559
Yeah.

979
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:27,779
Well,

980
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:28,259
I mean,

981
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,259
most people know,

982
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:29,859
um,

983
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:30,559
my story,

984
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,859
I guess I grew up in Launceston and Tassie and,

985
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:33,839
um,

986
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,240
swimming down there is definitely not a dominant sport,

987
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,380
but,

988
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:37,799
um,

989
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,460
I feel very fortunate that my family,

990
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,980
I guess saw something in me at 14 years of age,

991
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:44,980
which looking at a 14 year old now they're in year eight.

992
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:45,400
And I,

993
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,500
I think to myself,

994
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:51,440
how did my parents have the guts to pack up everything and move into state

995
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:51,779
really?

996
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:52,359
Um,

997
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,279
but yeah,

998
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:53,920
that was a big,

999
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,720
a big shift and a big move for us.

1000
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:56,019
I,

1001
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:57,799
I was very vocal in,

1002
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,319
in telling mom and dad that swimming was what I wanted to do.

1003
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:03,920
And I wanted to give it a red hot crack and I feel enormously grateful that

1004
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,119
they,

1005
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:07,460
they backed me and we packed up and moved to Brisbane and moved up here.

1006
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:07,799
Um,

1007
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,759
to Queensland and,

1008
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:10,519
you know,

1009
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,279
um,

1010
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:12,420
started training with Dean.

1011
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,859
And I think that was one big major factor that,

1012
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:16,440
um,

1013
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,059
was part of the plan that has led me to where I am today.

1014
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:21,299
But I think I've always been quite a,

1015
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:22,900
a goal driven person.

1016
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,500
I remember,

1017
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,460
um,

1018
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,759
it must've been my first national team.

1019
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:30,079
I made the qualifying times came out and I,

1020
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:30,640
you know,

1021
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,799
I wrote them on pieces of paper and stuck them on my roof and I'd look at

1022
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:37,140
them going to sleep every night or I'd write,

1023
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,140
I'd type up like little goals for the month and then,

1024
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,700
you know,

1025
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,099
bigger goals and goals for the next few years.

1026
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:45,619
And I think that it's important to not just make big goals,

1027
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:48,460
but little goals that are going to help you make those big goals.

1028
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:48,920
And so,

1029
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:49,759
um,

1030
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:51,220
I've always been quite a,

1031
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:51,900
um,

1032
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,460
yeah,

1033
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,819
someone that likes to keep those in the front of my mind.

1034
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,839
I think if you get lost in training and,

1035
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:57,640
um,

1036
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,759
you're having a bad session or your,

1037
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,319
your mind's wandering a little bit,

1038
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:04,980
I think having those goals in there really helps you realign your focus.

1039
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,599
So that's something that,

1040
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,460
that I've done.

1041
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:08,180
Um,

1042
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:08,680
I mean,

1043
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:08,920
it's,

1044
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:12,380
I can't talk through like the whole plan of everything.

1045
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,460
It's too long,

1046
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,339
but,

1047
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:14,859
um,

1048
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:15,599
I mean,

1049
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:18,559
certainly there are a few ways that I think I've found,

1050
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,000
found myself to where I am today.

1051
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,759
I didn't want to touch on the family piece,

1052
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:24,000
picking up on the back of what you said,

1053
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:24,619
then it's,

1054
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,700
I'm always fascinated in this and I love talking parenting in this podcast and,

1055
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,519
and for your family commitment to move the whole family,

1056
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,859
to follow your dream.

1057
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,180
As I said,

1058
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,819
you're in year eight,

1059
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,019
you're a 14 year old.

1060
00:31:36,339 --> 00:31:36,400
and,

1061
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:36,779
and the,

1062
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:37,380
you know,

1063
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,960
there's a fair bit of pressure that comes with that.

1064
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,599
You would be very aware that your family,

1065
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:42,480
mom and dad had to find new jobs.

1066
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,339
Your younger sister had to leave school as well,

1067
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:44,720
all for,

1068
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:45,559
for your dream.

1069
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:45,740
And,

1070
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,319
you know,

1071
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:49,940
some of the parenting I'm a father of four and always conscious around,

1072
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:50,559
you know,

1073
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,519
your love and support for your kids,

1074
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:55,000
but not wanting to overlay your wishes on them as well.

1075
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:55,240
Did,

1076
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:57,619
did that subtlety exist there?

1077
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,480
Clearly it's worked incredibly for you,

1078
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,000
but did you feel that pressure or was it always,

1079
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,980
we're just here to support you?

1080
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:03,140
Even,

1081
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,259
even if in two years time you wanted to give it up,

1082
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,299
did you feel like that?

1083
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,200
Option was available to,

1084
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,640
I think that,

1085
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,099
um,

1086
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,480
I literally hit the jackpot with the best parents for athletes.

1087
00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:14,480
My mom was a sprinter,

1088
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,119
um,

1089
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:15,940
you know,

1090
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,779
track and field athlete.

1091
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:19,420
She kind of has the mindset of an athlete and my,

1092
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,000
my dad,

1093
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:20,380
um,

1094
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,119
did sport as well.

1095
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,619
But regardless of that,

1096
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:26,599
I think that they were the perfect parents to parent a professional athlete.

1097
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:27,619
I think that they,

1098
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,500
um,

1099
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,960
had a great balance of being enough of a driving force to keep you motivated,

1100
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,460
but never became the coach and,

1101
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:35,920
um,

1102
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,339
stuck to the sidelines.

1103
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:37,660
And I,

1104
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:38,579
you know,

1105
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:39,559
the question about,

1106
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:40,019
um,

1107
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:43,119
packing up and moving to Queensland because of my swimming,

1108
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:45,779
obviously it was a massive sacrifice to my family.

1109
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,559
My dad lived in Tassie still for six months while we moved up here while he

1110
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,660
was still looking for work.

1111
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,599
So that was a big sacrifice.

1112
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:55,660
We literally had all our furniture and storage for 12 months.

1113
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,200
We lived in this tiny apartment.

1114
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:57,900
Um,

1115
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,019
it was,

1116
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,240
it was a huge decision,

1117
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,019
but not once did I ever feel that I had to perform because of the sacrifice of

1118
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:05,559
my family.

1119
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:05,859
And that,

1120
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,279
it's something that I'm very grateful for.

1121
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,480
And I've always said that if I said I wanted to retire tomorrow,

1122
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,059
they would not stop me.

1123
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,220
And,

1124
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:12,940
um,

1125
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,779
that never be,

1126
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,480
you know,

1127
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:16,460
parents that come home from a competition.

1128
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,059
And obviously that ask how I go,

1129
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:21,359
but there'd never be parents that would be too involved in,

1130
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:22,400
you know,

1131
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:25,940
write down the splits or understand what's going on.

1132
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:26,359
I mean,

1133
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,099
I think those parents are damaging to athletes.

1134
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:29,640
And so,

1135
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:30,460
um,

1136
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,160
I feel really grateful that my parents have just created an environment for me

1137
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,059
that has been helpful.

1138
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:38,240
It's helpful in making sure I get the best recovery.

1139
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,799
I've got a stable environment to make sure that training is my number one

1140
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:42,319
priority,

1141
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,119
but I've never ever felt the pressure to perform.

1142
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,000
Yeah.

1143
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:47,299
What a,

1144
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:47,900
what a brilliant,

1145
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,460
as you said,

1146
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,319
you hit the jackpot,

1147
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:49,619
don't you?

1148
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,960
When you get that combination,

1149
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:51,940
the love and support,

1150
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,960
but also not the,

1151
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:53,920
the overlay,

1152
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:54,400
you know,

1153
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,200
passion of mine,

1154
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:55,579
you know,

1155
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:57,420
with four kids are all active in sport,

1156
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:00,220
Narnie and the ugly parenting is alive and well,

1157
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:00,940
and it's,

1158
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,220
it's often well-meaning and,

1159
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,740
and where people just care so much about their kids,

1160
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,299
but it spills over into junior sport.

1161
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:09,059
And I'm sure you would have seen that at swimming,

1162
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:10,480
but in junior football,

1163
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:14,619
we see parents screaming at umpires and this crazy obsession with winning an

1164
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,000
under nine grand final.

1165
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:16,760
And that means,

1166
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,119
you know,

1167
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,440
putting,

1168
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,280
putting one kid on the bench for the whole game.

1169
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,199
And have you seen a bit of that?

1170
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,659
Because,

1171
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,139
um,

1172
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:22,500
you know,

1173
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:22,860
as you said,

1174
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,000
you,

1175
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:23,840
you hit the jackpot,

1176
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,059
but it's out there,

1177
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:25,420
isn't it?

1178
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,840
A lot where we need to probably reeducate parents a little bit along the

1179
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,539
lines of what you,

1180
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,579
you benefited from.

1181
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:31,500
Oh,

1182
00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:32,079
for sure.

1183
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:32,559
I mean,

1184
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:34,579
I think a lot of parents want to live through,

1185
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:34,639
you know,

1186
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,659
their kid's success.

1187
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,659
And I think in swimming,

1188
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,199
you,

1189
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:38,519
you,

1190
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:39,760
you do get those,

1191
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,199
I mean,

1192
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,880
I don't want to say,

1193
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,360
but say it,

1194
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,280
but crazy parents and the coaches have,

1195
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,239
have to deal with them.

1196
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,820
And unfortunately,

1197
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,699
most cases that I've seen the,

1198
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:48,159
the,

1199
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,539
the swimmer gets burnt out and they're done by the age of 15 because the

1200
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:52,679
pressure has been too much,

1201
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,920
or it's the parents don't think that,

1202
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:55,400
you know,

1203
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,840
the coach is doing enough for them at training and they're taking them

1204
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,119
home and making them do extra.

1205
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,480
And I think that it's just recipe for disaster really.

1206
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,360
And I think that,

1207
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:04,159
I mean,

1208
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:04,500
I know that,

1209
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,639
I know that my parents have so much knowledge on,

1210
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:07,639
I guess,

1211
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:08,320
how to,

1212
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,539
to parent an athlete.

1213
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:12,280
And I think it could certainly help a lot of people.

1214
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,059
And I think because I was quite young and on the rise,

1215
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,559
I didn't make the national team at 21.

1216
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:18,039
I've been,

1217
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:21,239
I've been representing Australia since I was 14,

1218
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:21,599
really.

1219
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:28,500
So I think actually having to parent through those really important stages

1220
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,139
of life,

1221
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,099
growing up socially as well,

1222
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:32,300
going through high school,

1223
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:32,840
all that,

1224
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,260
I think that balancing act,

1225
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,079
my mum and dad,

1226
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:36,900
yeah,

1227
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,639
did amazing.

1228
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:38,179
Well,

1229
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:38,980
I have to speak to them,

1230
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:39,480
Arnie.

1231
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:39,820
It's a,

1232
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,119
it's a,

1233
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,280
it's another project I'm,

1234
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:44,760
I'm interested in actually sharing those stories of what great parenting

1235
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,900
looks like as well,

1236
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,699
particularly around,

1237
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,719
around sport,

1238
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,039
which has got a bit out of hand in what I've seen in recent years.

1239
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,840
We see leaders are really curious.

1240
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:54,400
The word comes up a lot,

1241
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:55,000
curiosity.

1242
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,079
And through that curiosity,

1243
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,639
it's how they approach getting better.

1244
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,340
They're learning and development and constantly seeking improvement.

1245
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,860
Does that resonate with you?

1246
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,059
The,

1247
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:04,199
the thought of curiosity?

1248
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:04,659
Yeah,

1249
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:05,159
for sure.

1250
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:05,639
I mean,

1251
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:07,260
people always ask me,

1252
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,880
especially after the Olympics winning Olympic gold,

1253
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,179
you know,

1254
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:11,820
you've won your,

1255
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:13,219
you've won Olympics.

1256
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,300
What else can you do now?

1257
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:14,480
And,

1258
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,739
and the answer was,

1259
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,059
well,

1260
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,840
I haven't got a long course world record yet for an individual race.

1261
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,260
And that kept me motivated.

1262
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:25,059
And then I put my head down this year and,

1263
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:26,559
and broke the world record in the 400.

1264
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,820
And then the question was,

1265
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,079
you know,

1266
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:28,400
you've,

1267
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,059
you've actually done everything now.

1268
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:30,500
Like what,

1269
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:31,639
what keeps you motivated?

1270
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,260
And it's the personal,

1271
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,260
um,

1272
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,840
gratification and the pursuit of perfection,

1273
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,519
really that,

1274
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:39,119
that keeps me in the sport.

1275
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,079
And I think that it's also trying to find the limit within yourself.

1276
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:46,960
And I believe that I've got so much more left to give to the sport,

1277
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,360
not just in the pool,

1278
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,280
but outside the pool.

1279
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,460
And,

1280
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,139
and,

1281
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,239
and that's why I do it.

1282
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:51,460
And,

1283
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:51,840
um,

1284
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:53,420
I guess curiosity is in there.

1285
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,239
Like I'm curious to see how good I can,

1286
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,840
how much faster I can get.

1287
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,139
Um,

1288
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:02,059
I don't want to put a limit on how much I can achieve and how much I can

1289
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:02,800
get out of myself.

1290
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,159
And,

1291
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:03,599
um,

1292
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:04,360
you know,

1293
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:04,940
in the,

1294
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,079
in the hard times of in training,

1295
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:08,739
it's obviously tough in the moment,

1296
00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:11,500
but when you're finished and you've achieved something great in that

1297
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:11,920
session,

1298
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,659
just the,

1299
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,159
the satisfaction of,

1300
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:15,400
um,

1301
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,619
doing something great in training is like no other.

1302
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:17,880
And,

1303
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,079
and I love that feeling.

1304
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,739
So I guess that's why,

1305
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,099
um,

1306
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,260
I'm sticking at it.

1307
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,260
I can see the smile come to your face.

1308
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:24,559
And,

1309
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:24,960
uh,

1310
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,719
when my mind was going,

1311
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,139
and this is,

1312
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,380
this is going to feel like off a tangent,

1313
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:28,679
Arnie,

1314
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,019
but,

1315
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:29,400
uh,

1316
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,320
so Donald Bradman,

1317
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,099
you know,

1318
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:31,440
maybe,

1319
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:32,219
uh,

1320
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:32,619
you know,

1321
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:34,179
the most outstanding Australian,

1322
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,159
athlete ever,

1323
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:35,699
and,

1324
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:35,840
and,

1325
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,039
and used to listen and read a lot about what he would talk about,

1326
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:40,559
which was,

1327
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:43,079
he could make 250 in an innings in England.

1328
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:46,500
And the papers would talk about it as the most masterful innings that had

1329
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:46,840
been,

1330
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,599
uh,

1331
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,320
they'd ever seen,

1332
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,880
but he would come off and he would know the six mistakes in his mind

1333
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,219
that he could get better at.

1334
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:53,800
And for him,

1335
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,460
that might've been,

1336
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,860
he still hit the ball for four,

1337
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:59,000
but he wanted it to go three meters to the left of where it was.

1338
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:00,659
That was what he was chasing in his mind,

1339
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:01,239
that perfection.

1340
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:04,300
And he was trying to play the perfect innings all the time.

1341
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:04,480
And,

1342
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:04,860
and,

1343
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,219
you know,

1344
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:06,039
hearing you speak,

1345
00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:06,420
I can,

1346
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,780
I can see that,

1347
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,039
uh,

1348
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:08,920
chasing perfection,

1349
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,840
uh,

1350
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,639
may be a dream.

1351
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:11,800
That's the impossible dream,

1352
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,099
but,

1353
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:12,480
uh,

1354
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:13,480
certainly gets you out of bed.

1355
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:13,860
I'm assuming.

1356
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,820
I've got a pretty funny story actually.

1357
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:16,360
Um,

1358
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,559
in 2019,

1359
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:20,780
when I became world champion for the first time in the 400,

1360
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,179
I remember,

1361
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:22,920
um,

1362
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:23,659
you know,

1363
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:24,820
once you get out of the pool,

1364
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,679
you do a little bit of warm down,

1365
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,920
you do the metal ceremony,

1366
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:28,960
drug testing.

1367
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,900
And then I had,

1368
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,159
um,

1369
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,079
a press conference and I hadn't gone through the race with Dean.

1370
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:34,360
And,

1371
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:34,679
you know,

1372
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,480
you look at your splits and your stroke rates.

1373
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,139
And I just saw the time I did,

1374
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:39,159
which I thought was great.

1375
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:39,539
But,

1376
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,219
um,

1377
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,559
looking back at the actual race now,

1378
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,639
I didn't really race it the way we had planned.

1379
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:47,099
And I remember I was sitting up,

1380
00:38:47,179 --> 00:38:47,519
you know,

1381
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:48,119
on the,

1382
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:49,840
at the front answering questions and,

1383
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,519
and Dean walks into the room and he,

1384
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:53,480
um,

1385
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:54,000
he,

1386
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:54,519
you know,

1387
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:54,920
says,

1388
00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:55,420
you know,

1389
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,099
when he walks in,

1390
00:38:56,139 --> 00:38:57,099
my face lights up,

1391
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,059
like I hadn't seen him since the race.

1392
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,360
And he walks to the back of the room where the cameras were.

1393
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:03,519
And he's just mouthing,

1394
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,139
like dog shit,

1395
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:06,219
dog shit,

1396
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:07,340
dog shit.

1397
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:08,000
Because,

1398
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,059
because the race that I put together wasn't the way that we'd planned.

1399
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,780
And I had just become world champion,

1400
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:19,440
beaten Katie Ledecky for the first time in like nearly 10 years.

1401
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:20,559
And,

1402
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:21,099
um,

1403
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,059
it was dog shit because we have two standards,

1404
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,659
dog shit and outstanding.

1405
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:26,079
And,

1406
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:26,679
um,

1407
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:28,159
I'll never forget that moment.

1408
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:28,900
Um,

1409
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,400
but I think that's a good way to sum up our relationship.

1410
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,139
And how did you cope with that?

1411
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:33,719
Because that,

1412
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:33,940
that,

1413
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,340
you know,

1414
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,719
at the,

1415
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,659
at the moment where there is some celebration,

1416
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,219
did you,

1417
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,500
we were upset by that.

1418
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:39,820
Did you,

1419
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,719
did you see it for what it was or are you smiling about it now?

1420
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,860
But at the time,

1421
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,139
was it,

1422
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:45,119
was it a bit of a body block?

1423
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:45,599
Well,

1424
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:46,639
I agreed with him.

1425
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:47,360
Like I looked,

1426
00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:47,780
I'm,

1427
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,460
I'm like,

1428
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,360
you were talking about Sir Don Bradman and I'm the same.

1429
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,880
I look back at races and go,

1430
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:54,380
Oh,

1431
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:55,599
I could have done that there.

1432
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,260
Like I could have fixed that easily.

1433
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:57,599
And,

1434
00:39:57,699 --> 00:39:58,059
um,

1435
00:39:58,679 --> 00:39:58,960
you know,

1436
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,400
so that,

1437
00:39:59,400 --> 00:39:59,579
that,

1438
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:00,500
that excites me though.

1439
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,139
Like looking back at races from the Olympics,

1440
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:02,940
um,

1441
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,900
you know,

1442
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:05,579
I can see so many areas,

1443
00:40:05,659 --> 00:40:06,639
areas for improvement.

1444
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,000
And,

1445
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:07,300
um,

1446
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,340
in the moment you really have to like relish,

1447
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:09,860
um,

1448
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,400
the win,

1449
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,300
but then,

1450
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:11,900
you know,

1451
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,559
whenever all that time passes and you look back on races now,

1452
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,139
I think it's exciting to see,

1453
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:16,960
um,

1454
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,960
areas for improvement.

1455
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:19,159
Oh,

1456
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:23,980
what a great story and an incredible insight into the person that you are and your coach

1457
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,400
at the same time as well.

1458
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:26,780
I love it.

1459
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,719
We see leaders are really,

1460
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:28,340
um,

1461
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,239
understanding of how they communicate and,

1462
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:31,440
and talking to you today,

1463
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,000
you can see,

1464
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:32,920
even in,

1465
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,360
in pressure situations,

1466
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,019
you've got a great,

1467
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:36,099
as we mentioned before,

1468
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:40,059
composure and you get your words out and in a brilliant way for such a young

1469
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:40,420
person.

1470
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:40,559
Have you,

1471
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:42,960
have you put some time and effort into how you communicate?

1472
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:43,980
Not really.

1473
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,619
I mean,

1474
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:47,659
I grew up with a dad who's a journalist and so,

1475
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:48,519
um,

1476
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:50,320
I guess I've been exposed to it,

1477
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,500
but I think potentially growing up in Tassie and,

1478
00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:54,159
um,

1479
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:56,800
as an 11 year old becoming state champion,

1480
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,199
I got the back page of the paper.

1481
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:02,679
And so I think I was exposed to the media,

1482
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:03,440
like quite young.

1483
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,219
And so I feel like I handle it quite well,

1484
00:41:06,219 --> 00:41:06,840
but,

1485
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,599
um,

1486
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,320
I've never really,

1487
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,760
it's never really been something I've worked on.

1488
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,119
I think it's just in my nature of being able to speak to people and meet people

1489
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:13,840
and,

1490
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,519
and mingle quite easily.

1491
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:15,820
And,

1492
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,559
um,

1493
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,099
I don't get camera shy.

1494
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:19,420
And so I,

1495
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:19,920
um,

1496
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,260
yeah,

1497
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,699
I think that's something I'm quite proud of.

1498
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:21,960
I,

1499
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,239
you know,

1500
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,940
if I walked into a room and I didn't know anyone,

1501
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,519
I think I could easily start a conversation with someone and get to know them

1502
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:28,679
and what's going on in their life.

1503
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:28,960
And,

1504
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,619
um,

1505
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:30,679
that's exciting though.

1506
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:31,239
Um,

1507
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,659
I think it's always really cool to,

1508
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:33,320
you know,

1509
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,960
learn things about other people and,

1510
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,619
and meet people that you would never usually get to meet.

1511
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:38,460
So,

1512
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,460
um,

1513
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,460
yeah.

1514
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,460
Arnie,

1515
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,460
we see leaders are really conscious of collaboration now,

1516
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,460
more,

1517
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,460
more than ever.

1518
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,460
And,

1519
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,460
and listening to you,

1520
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,460
and even before we started,

1521
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,460
you know,

1522
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,460
I asked you about,

1523
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,460
you know,

1524
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,460
you've been asked a lot of questions and you said,

1525
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,460
no,

1526
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,460
I see what I do as a partnership.

1527
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,460
And you,

1528
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,460
you,

1529
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,460
you make sure that the Dean comes up in conversation,

1530
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,460
your coach,

1531
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,460
Dean Boxall.

1532
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,460
I mean,

1533
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,460
it is a collaboration in lots of ways.

1534
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,460
Is that how you've approached the whole performance for you?

1535
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,460
Um,

1536
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,460
that it's not just you out there doing it,

1537
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,460
that you've got a team behind you and how have you gone about it?

1538
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,460
Yeah.

1539
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,460
I mean,

1540
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,460
certainly Dean is my biggest,

1541
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,460
biggest partner through all of this.

1542
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,460
There's obviously a lot of other people that play a big role.

1543
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,460
Um,

1544
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,460
but he is someone who we made this deal.

1545
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,460
Um,

1546
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,460
if he writes the program,

1547
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,460
the best that he can,

1548
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,460
I will execute it the best that I can.

1549
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,460
And so it certainly is a partnership.

1550
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,460
I couldn't do it without him.

1551
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,460
He's quite an eccentric personality.

1552
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,460
And I don't think that he would work well with me.

1553
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,460
Um,

1554
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,460
and,

1555
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,460
and,

1556
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,460
and,

1557
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,460
and,

1558
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,460
and,

1559
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,460
and,

1560
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,460
and,

1561
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,460
and,

1562
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,460
and,

1563
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,460
and,

1564
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,460
and,

1565
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,460
and,

1566
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,460
and,

1567
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,460
and,

1568
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,460
and,

1569
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,460
and,

1570
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,460
and,

1571
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,460
and,

1572
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,460
and,

1573
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,460
and,

1574
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,460
and,

1575
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,460
and,

1576
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,460
and,

1577
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,460
and,

1578
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,460
and,

1579
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,460
and,

1580
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,460
and,

1581
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,460
and,

1582
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,460
and,

1583
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,460
and,

1584
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,460
and,

1585
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,460
and,

1586
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,460
and,

1587
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,460
and,

1588
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,460
and,

1589
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,460
and,

1590
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,460
and,

1591
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,460
and,

1592
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,460
and,

1593
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,460
and,

1594
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,460
and,

1595
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:07,440
because of our work ethic um we work really well together um he gets quite frustrated if he sees

1596
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,539
things not being done the best that they can be and so I try to do everything as best I can to

1597
00:43:13,539 --> 00:43:20,679
keep the peace as well um but it's more so with us it's about making deals and so I mean even this

1598
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:25,980
week um I've just come back from break and he said to me you know are you giving me the green light

1599
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:31,219
to go like we've got less than two years are you giving me the green light to go and and put you

1600
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:35,860
under pressure and um go through those hard moments again and and for me it's not even a

1601
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:40,960
question um for sure like if he he's got to do what he's got to do to get the best out of me

1602
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:48,840
and some people can't handle that but um I'm I'm open to anything to get get more out of me and

1603
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:54,780
and reach my potential and I he just knows how to how to get that and I love hearing that he does

1604
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:59,619
ask that question and he's and he knows the answer I'm assuming but without asking it you're not part

1605
00:44:01,219 --> 00:44:06,019
you say hey I've signed up to that he's done his best and he's working overtime and not sleeping

1606
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:11,280
at night I'm going to hold up my end of the bargain as best I can it's great you know we're a bit

1607
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,780
obsessed with leadership and leadership stories but in the past that wouldn't have been a coach

1608
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:20,019
relationship is having you part of the once you sign on I'm assuming all bets are off you know

1609
00:44:20,019 --> 00:44:26,099
you then do your best but uh it sounds like you're included in it uh to that point yeah well he always

1610
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:31,199
says that um when he was an age group coach I had an age grouper come to me and go I was an age grouper

1611
00:44:31,219 --> 00:44:36,719
I want to win at national age and he goes okay if you want to win then you have to understand what

1612
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:42,500
that's going to take so um are you ready to sign on to what I'm going to have to do to get the best

1613
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:47,340
out of you and and they go yeah yeah yeah and then you know training happens and they get put

1614
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,900
under pressure and they've got to repeat things and and they don't like it and you know he goes

1615
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,579
well you're the one that came to me and said you want to win he said you telling me you want to

1616
00:44:55,579 --> 00:45:01,199
win is the worst thing you can tell me because it gives me the right to go after you and I'm

1617
00:45:01,219 --> 00:45:07,139
trying to get the best out of you but for me um I love it I love being pushed to the limit I love

1618
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:13,099
doing the repeats I love having the feeling of knowing that while my competitors are done

1619
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:19,119
training and or asleep on the other side of the world I'm here doing the extra and um I think

1620
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,460
that's why we work so well together now I think I'm uh got a guess at uh these two final questions

1621
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:29,099
and where you might head with them but I've been asking these uh two questions to all the people

1622
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:31,159
the privilege of sitting down with and I've I've

1623
00:45:31,219 --> 00:45:35,800
loved uh listening to you today final two questions who's been the greatest leader in your life

1624
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:45,820
well I Dean is definitely there but I I would say my probably my mum um she is more competitive than

1625
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:54,900
me she um is super fiery um she stands for what she believes in and I think that she has just been

1626
00:45:54,900 --> 00:46:01,019
she just knew how to be the perfect mum to me growing up um you know as an

1627
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:07,000
athlete and also as a as a teenager she'd never forgot who I was as a person um as well as who I

1628
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,000
as an as a who who I am as a swimmer and um she's an incredibly hard worker as well and I think she

1629
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,760
set the standard for me so I'd probably say my mum um Dean is definitely there though I look up

1630
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:24,519
to him like my second dad and and my coach and I trust him with my life but um I think my mum

1631
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:29,840
what a great answer and you know again to hear what you said before about that context of uh

1632
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,199
your mum just treading that line before you and I think that's a great answer and I think that's a

1633
00:46:31,219 --> 00:46:37,099
between inspiration but not overlaying you know her uh her world on your world that's um

1634
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:42,400
you know incredible story in itself if you could collaborate uh Arnie with anyone in any area of

1635
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,619
your life and we've seen and read about your passion for a range of different things and

1636
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:51,800
from cooking and you might head to swimming or is there someone in your world that you thought

1637
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,559
I'd love to uh spend some time with them and that would make me

1638
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:59,619
a better person in any area of your life is there someone that springs to mind

1639
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:10,719
I'm trying to think really I mean I love hearing um other athletes stories and and what they have

1640
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:16,239
gone through um to get to where they are I mean someone who I've spent a little bit of time talking

1641
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:22,980
to is Ian Thorpe I mean um I feel like he was under enormous pressure at such a young age as

1642
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:28,599
well and um you know learning a little bit about him and and getting to know him I've really loved

1643
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:31,199
um but in terms of collaboration I think he's a great person and I think he's a great person

1644
00:47:31,219 --> 00:47:35,920
I mean I'm not really sure I'm always just open to learning new things and finding new ways to get

1645
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,300
better and um sometimes people pop into your life for a reason and and you know I believe that

1646
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:48,019
everything happens for a reason and so um I'm not going to put my finger on anyone but um we'll see

1647
00:47:48,019 --> 00:47:54,199
I love your open do you follow other sports I mean Ian Thorpe uh makes a lot of sense doesn't

1648
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:58,500
he given what he's done and the person that he is but do you do you follow other sports

1649
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,019
you take inspiration from other athletes in other parts of the world

1650
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:07,599
um I mean my biggest idol um in the world is Rafa Nadal um you got to meet recently didn't you

1651
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:13,599
yeah I got to meet him and I um recently went to his academy in Spain which was amazing but

1652
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:18,440
I look up to him I believe he has the he's the epitome of what high performance is just his

1653
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:25,920
attitude to tennis I I love his passion and so um yeah I definitely follow Rafa um I'm an AFL girl

1654
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,320
I mean growing up in Tassie um I got corrupted by the Hawks my um

1655
00:48:31,219 --> 00:48:36,579
old family on my mom's side dating back to my grandfather's father is Richmond all the way down

1656
00:48:36,579 --> 00:48:43,059
the family um and I got corrupted it was footy colors day in prep and half the class was Hawthorne

1657
00:48:43,059 --> 00:48:49,860
and so um I went and I switched to Hawthorne and and still go for the Hawks um but living in

1658
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:55,739
Queensland you don't really get to see the foot the footy as much up here so it's more rugby league

1659
00:48:55,739 --> 00:49:01,199
up here um which I've started to get into a little bit but um not so much I definitely follow AFL

1660
00:49:01,219 --> 00:49:06,440
more I love your language they're corrupted uh by the Hawks who had their home second home base

1661
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:11,260
down in Launceston where you grew up and they did a good job of uh getting a lot of that part of

1662
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:16,880
of Tassie on board with the Hawks I have four kids we live in Hawthorne Arnie and they'll go

1663
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,920
to junior clinics and 90% of the kids are wearing Hawthorne gear and they'd come home and they'd say

1664
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:25,059
do you know what I I think I want to barrack for Hawthorne I'd say that's no problems you just

1665
00:49:25,059 --> 00:49:29,900
got to find a new family and a new house because there's no way that's ever going to happen that

1666
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,199
was one thing I wasn't prepared to do and I'm not going to do that anymore I'm going to do that
