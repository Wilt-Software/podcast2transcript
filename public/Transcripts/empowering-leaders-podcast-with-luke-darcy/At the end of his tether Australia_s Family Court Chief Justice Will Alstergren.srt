00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:07,820
The Honourable Will Ostergren is the Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia.

2
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:10,720
He sits at the coalface of violence against women.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,859
Will is appealing to the three out of four males who the statistics show love their partners,

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,699
are great role models, to call out these cowardly attacks.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,600
His clear message is that it is time for good men to take a stand.

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,960
I have to admit I found this conversation confronting at times.

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,719
The Chief Justice's message is really appealing to all men to become part of the solution

8
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,740
and end what is a worldwide disgrace, violence against women.

9
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,939
It's leaders like the Chief Justice, Will Ostergren, who inspire the work we do at Alita.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,840
We are passionate about inspiring connections and creating a world of collaboration.

11
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:52,759
Our Alita Connect program brings together groups of five to six leaders from around the globe

12
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:55,560
in small groups to learn, connect and collaborate.

13
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,579
Head to alitacollective.com, book a discovery call,

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,520
and we would love to connect with you.

15
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,899
Big thanks to Jason Nicholas and his team from Temper Bedding

16
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,000
and their great support of conversations like this.

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,040
We know that people who live successful lives value their sleep

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,980
and investing in a mattress like Temper is a decision that will change your life.

19
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:21,609
The Honourable Will Ostergren is the Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia

20
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:25,730
and the Federal Circuit Court, effectively putting him at the coalface of family

21
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,489
and gender-based violence in Australia.

22
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,469
The statistics on violence against women in Australia are disgraceful,

23
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:36,430
13 women a day are hospitalised because of the injuries they receive from violent men.

24
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,269
On average, a woman is killed every nine days by a current or former partner,

25
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,069
and one in three women have experienced violence since the age of 25.

26
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,870
Young women aged between 18 to 24 are twice as likely as the general population

27
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,590
to experience sexual harassment.

28
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,069
Will, thanks for taking the time to discuss it.

29
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,150
It feels like it's a genuine crisis.

30
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:57,430
Is it getting worse?

31
00:01:57,629 --> 00:01:58,469
Oh, much worse, Luke.

32
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:01,469
Unfortunately, when you look at it, it's certainly got a lot worse than it was.

33
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:05,230
The message just isn't getting out that this kind of behaviour is not on.

34
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,270
Unfortunately, we're seeing it much more in the courts.

35
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,189
It's much more prevalent.

36
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,330
We saw it increase during COVID, and it certainly hasn't stopped.

37
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:14,990
It's very much increasing.

38
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:18,270
Will, does that say three out of four men love their partners?

39
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:19,229
We love our daughters.

40
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:20,189
We love our sisters.

41
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:23,389
And we do genuinely care about the women in our life.

42
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,669
But you're appealing to that bracket who you're saying enough is enough

43
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:31,469
that good men have to call out bad behaviour.

44
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:33,409
Why is that so important to you?

45
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,009
I think when you look back on it, in the last 20 years,

46
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:39,409
we've had an enormous amount of people that have done a great deal of work

47
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,469
in this area to try and stop family violence.

48
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:44,289
The difficulty is most of them have been women calling it out,

49
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,270
and they've been incredibly brave.

50
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:47,349
They've been incredibly effective.

51
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:49,770
But men aren't part of the conversation.

52
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,849
Men don't feel comfortable being part of the conversation about it.

53
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:55,229
We've got to get men more involved.

54
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,310
And it's not the perpetrators I'm talking about.

55
00:02:57,789 --> 00:02:59,689
They're already involved in it one way or another.

56
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:01,449
It's the people who actually find this.

57
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:04,090
It's appalling behaviour that we need to call it out.

58
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:07,210
Tell other men, tell young boys to stop doing it.

59
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:08,150
And it's just not on.

60
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:11,289
And I think it's not about shaming men either.

61
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,389
It's about actually bringing them on this journey

62
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:15,909
and trying to inspire them to actually call it out themselves

63
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:18,689
because a lot of them are totally appalled by it.

64
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,090
But they don't want to get involved because it's just too hard.

65
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,250
It's time for us to really step up.

66
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:25,650
And it sounds cowardly to me, Will.

67
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,349
And last time I caught up with you, I said the same thing,

68
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:30,830
that I think a lot of us have been nervous in this space

69
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,169
because we don't feel as though we've got the right words

70
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:37,449
and we're maybe scared that we would add more pain to those families

71
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:39,629
that have been affected terribly by this.

72
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,349
What are the right words?

73
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,250
And why do you think we suddenly need men?

74
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,689
It's not enough just to be a good man yourself.

75
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,030
You have to call it out in your words.

76
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:49,449
Look, I think it's a really important question.

77
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,590
There's no doubt we've got to be very careful not to be trauma-informed

78
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,629
and not to re-traumatise people when you get involved in this.

79
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,389
But the message still has to be said.

80
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:00,729
So as a result, I think it's going to be very, very,

81
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,229
very clear and it's got to be a very, very constructive message.

82
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,129
And the message just really is this kind of behaviour is just not on.

83
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:09,449
It's just not acceptable.

84
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:12,789
I don't think it can go any further than that at the moment.

85
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:15,210
We obviously want to bring up respect for women

86
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,910
and we want to bring up respect for children.

87
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,050
But the most important thing for men to know is this kind of behaviour

88
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,670
just isn't acceptable and it can't be tolerated.

89
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:26,389
I think if you go to that level, then people can come on the journey with you.

90
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:30,730
It's not about saying all men are bad or all men are at fault.

91
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,149
Obviously, a lot of men are,

92
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,550
but it's about trying to inspire them from that point of view.

93
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:36,230
It's a difficult thing to actually get,

94
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,670
but I think people have to be just pretty honest about it

95
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,230
and just say, well, this is how I feel.

96
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,790
That way, I don't think there'll be anywhere near as much blame

97
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,629
or risk of blame than there is at the moment.

98
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:47,750
Well, I feel like I've lived my life in a bit of a bubble.

99
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,529
I have loving parents who are married,

100
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,370
the most beautiful woman in the world.

101
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,610
I've got four healthy kids.

102
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,389
And you feel as though that world is something that's so foreign to you

103
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:00,050
and you've only seen the good in people.

104
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:03,009
And it is a bubble of sorts.

105
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:07,009
I mean, the psychology of violence towards women from men,

106
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:09,709
I don't even think I can possibly understand.

107
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,490
I just can't get my head around it.

108
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,810
Can you give us an insight into why this abhorrent behavior happens?

109
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,990
Look, I think it's interesting.

110
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:18,990
Your observation is absolutely right.

111
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:21,230
A lot of people don't believe it's in their neighborhood

112
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,529
or in their family or anybody they know would possibly do it.

113
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:26,149
But the statistics speak for themselves.

114
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:28,610
There are a lot of cultural reasons why it happens.

115
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,910
There's also, I think,

116
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,329
a sense of entitlement amongst some men when they grow up

117
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:35,470
that they're entitled to do this to their partner,

118
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:38,589
that they're entitled to be stronger, more physical,

119
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:40,290
and they can do whatever they like.

120
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:43,970
And unfortunately, that kind of behavior is much more prevalent than we know.

121
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,949
And I think there's been a level of acceptance.

122
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:48,589
Also, people don't want to talk about it.

123
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:53,290
Up until the 1990s, it wasn't even spoken about as much in court cases

124
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,189
that you used to talk about it.

125
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,550
They used to say, oh, it's a private matter.

126
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:57,170
It's absolutely not.

127
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,769
And I think one of the things that we see

128
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,110
in courts is this level of not only acceptance,

129
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,009
but an intergenerational acceptance of this kind of behavior.

130
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,610
So kids who may see their parents do it or their uncle do it

131
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,670
or one of their friends do it and has tolerated,

132
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,490
will tolerate it themselves and even perpetrate it themselves.

133
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,970
One of the things we found is so often when you see people

134
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,129
who are convicted of this kind of behavior in criminal courts

135
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:24,589
will say, I was a victim myself that led me to do it.

136
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,850
You can understand why.

137
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,089
So that's why we've really got to sever this and actually get to young kids

138
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:29,790
before.

139
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,810
Before they get to adulthood and know it's not on,

140
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:33,730
to try and make sure they get the message.

141
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,029
Well, they say in newsrooms around the world and here in Australia

142
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:41,170
on Christmas Day, newsrooms have police scanners

143
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,870
and they pick up frequencies of what's going on out on the roads.

144
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:47,209
And on Christmas Day, you'll have someone, you know,

145
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,410
working the Christmas Day shift and they'll ring the news director

146
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,350
and they'll say World War III's broken out.

147
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,610
And then they'll get the call back, oh, no, it's Christmas Day.

148
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:56,829
It's what was called domestic violence.

149
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,569
Almost the worst day of the year.

150
00:06:58,569 --> 00:06:59,569
Families get together.

151
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:00,810
They drink and we see this.

152
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:04,569
But you've actually got to think about how sad that is on a day of celebration

153
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:05,750
and holiday.

154
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,370
Is that what you see at the family court?

155
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:12,069
Look, there's an absolute spike in this behavior two different ways.

156
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:15,509
One, during sporting finals, it's really bad.

157
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:19,970
And the other is just before most holidays, particularly Christmas.

158
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:22,110
Christmas is always a really busy time for us.

159
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:25,569
A lot of people feel very, get very emotional around that time.

160
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:29,050
They may have had a family celebration previously that's changed.

161
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:33,029
And people really, unfortunately, do react very badly in those circumstances.

162
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:38,209
Emotions are high, a lot of alcohol and a lot of substance abuse.

163
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,730
And it just, that means a lot of people just lose control.

164
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,870
If you go and see any policemen, it's really interesting talking to them.

165
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,269
Just the street, they're having a cup of coffee, have a chat and say,

166
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,250
how many calls did you get today about domestic violence?

167
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:51,670
How many call outs have you had?

168
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:54,689
And they'll tell you, it could be up to eight or 10 a day.

169
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:55,430
They might have.

170
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,470
And when it comes to things like Christmas, it's out of control.

171
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:00,490
So you're absolutely right.

172
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,449
And the difficulty too is a lot of women may call it out.

173
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:05,449
They may have the courage to actually call out a policeman,

174
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:07,949
but often they'll go back into that environment again

175
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:10,589
because they can't afford to leave or they're too scared to leave.

176
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,689
So it's a repeated problem.

177
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,110
It's a tragic story.

178
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,110
As the Chief Justice of the Family Court,

179
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,930
you see the impact that violence against women has every single day.

180
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,029
And you described it as intergenerational.

181
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:23,810
And often in the criminal cases,

182
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:28,069
we're seeing perpetrators are the victims themselves of violence growing up.

183
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:29,149
Do you ever,

184
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:31,029
ever have a sense of despair about this?

185
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:31,850
Oh, look, absolutely.

186
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:35,730
One of the reasons why I've been so motivated to try and get men to call out family violence is

187
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,049
I'm really sick of seeing it every day in court.

188
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,250
It's devastating for the people around you.

189
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,269
It's the hundreds and thousands of people every year that get affected by this,

190
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,269
particularly women and children, that never recover.

191
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:49,909
And it's also the people that actually commit it themselves.

192
00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:51,990
They lose control and do these terrible things.

193
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:54,570
They've wrecked their life as well and everybody else around them.

194
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:58,230
So it's something that can make you really quite,

195
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:01,309
well, upset about it.

196
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,009
And I think we need to actually channel it to actually doing something about it really positively.

197
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:09,049
That's why I'm really keen to get a campaign going where men are calling this out

198
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,230
and really using the message that's just not on.

199
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:15,450
Yeah, I know this is going to sound almost strange,

200
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,970
but you read about these cowardly attacks and you see them,

201
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,370
you know, as a high profile one on television this week.

202
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,509
And I knew I was talking to you, a famous rapper in the US.

203
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:27,470
There's some vision caught of him assaulting his partner.

204
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,769
And it's disgraceful.

205
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:32,230
And when you actually see it in person, you think,

206
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:34,230
my God, part of you wants retribution.

207
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,409
You want to go back and as a male,

208
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,149
I want to get a hold of this person and perpetrate some violence the other way.

209
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:44,669
You shouldn't even have those words, but it elicits that response in people.

210
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,429
How do we go about firstly protecting women from these cowardly attacks?

211
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:51,070
Look, I think women, we're under-resourced.

212
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,289
The police are under-resourced.

213
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,809
Unfortunately, a lot of the services that are open to them are under-resourced.

214
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:58,850
And a lot of women aren't actually leaving abusive,

215
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:01,909
abusive relationships because of lack of resourcing as well.

216
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:05,909
So the first thing is to make sure they're aware of what's available for them at the moment.

217
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:10,909
Secondly, the courts have adopted situations where hearings can be happening in safe environments.

218
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:13,529
They don't have to go into a courthouse and face a perpetrator.

219
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:17,649
They can be at the end of a phone, in a refuge centre, in a safe environment.

220
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,909
I think thirdly, though, look, we've got to call it out.

221
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:22,649
We've got to actually call it out when we see it.

222
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:26,649
And the other thing we have to do as men is step up and have a national conversation about it.

223
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:28,549
Demand that we have a better society.

224
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:30,470
And part of that's going to be education.

225
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:38,250
I'm firmly of belief that the government's 10 year plan to eradicate family violence has got to be on the first step of it, which is prevention.

226
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,309
We've got a national campaign against smoking.

227
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:42,470
We've got a national campaign against drink driving.

228
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,970
Where's the national campaign against family violence?

229
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,429
Where's the television ads?

230
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:48,549
You know, where's the social media raids?

231
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:53,049
There's been so much done in this area and the message isn't getting out and men aren't listening.

232
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:54,850
Well, they'll listen to other men.

233
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,350
One of the things you said, which is absolutely right, it engenders

234
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:03,730
a level of frustration in you when you see men behave like that shocking bloke that rapper did.

235
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,549
But then you think, well, if you were there, you would have tried to stop him or do something about it.

236
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:10,470
Or we can stop him by actually educating his kids.

237
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:20,049
We can stop him by actually going to schools and saying, we want you to spend two minutes watching a video and, you know, a trauma informed, properly prepared video.

238
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:25,350
Because that two minutes may be containing a message these kids have never heard before.

239
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,230
And if they only hear it once or twice a year, we've got to use it.

240
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:35,990
We've got to use sport as a way of reaching out to people and trying to use a male role models they'll listen to just say, this isn't on.

241
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,029
If you use the right people on social media, they could reach a hundred million people.

242
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:46,809
We've got to do much more about this, but we've got to applaud men for doing it and encourage them to do it and have this conversation.

243
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,809
And you're a great campaigner for this, Will.

244
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:53,769
I know that you're reaching out to high profile people and asking them to say, it's enough.

245
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:54,429
It's not on.

246
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:55,889
We're not going to accept this anymore.

247
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,730
Can you share with us some of the names that are?

248
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,110
Sure.

249
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,190
Joining the campaign?

250
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,990
Well, we decided to try and do something meaningful that was not a fundraiser.

251
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:14,070
And that was going to be something which I don't think men would get upset about because I really firmly believe that three out of four men are appalled by this sort of behavior and want to do something about it, but they don't want to be pilloried by doing it.

252
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:22,730
So I thought as Chief Justice, I did this really, well, when I think about it now, it's quite bizarre, writing cold to people that I thought that people would admire.

253
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,730
So I wrote to, for instance, Hugh Jackman.

254
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,730
I don't know Hugh, but he's, I've always admired him.

255
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:38,809
He was a wonderful fellow and I asked him through an agent and then through about four different other contacts I had, whether he'd entertain just doing a message for us on a, on an iPhone.

256
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:51,110
Well, I have to say some months later, I got a text and there it was where Hugh Jackman sitting in New York, in a chair, looking magnificent, and he's passionately calling out this sort of behavior.

257
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,809
Travis Vermeule, who's a great Australian actor, and I've met him a couple of times, he's just a ripper of a bloke.

258
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:05,429
He not only got involved in this, he's actually got other mates of his like Luke, Luke Hodge, like Richo and others to actually send me messages in the same thing.

259
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:10,190
So reaching out to people, Hamish Blake, I mean, you know, Hamish was fantastic.

260
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:14,889
He did his own script and did a wonderful message, which is really inspirational.

261
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:18,889
Putting in his own words, um, Glenn Robbins has done something else.

262
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:20,889
Um, we've got John Bertram.

263
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:23,269
Um, we've got Olympians like Kyle Chalmers.

264
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,889
As I said, we've got great footballers like Luke Hodge and Richo. I didn't have to write to them.

265
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:25,429
Um, we've got Olympians like Kyle Chalmers. As I said, we've got great footballers like Luke Hodge and Richo. I didn't have to write to them.

266
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,429
As I said, we've got great footballers like Luke Hodge and Richo. I didn't have to write to them.

267
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:29,429
And you know, they just did it for us.

268
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:31,429
Eric Banner did it.

269
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:33,429
I got to find out about Eric and trying to get to Eric through his wife's golf coach.

270
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:35,429
I got to find out about Eric and trying to get to Eric through his wife's golf coach.

271
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:37,429
I got to find out about Eric and trying to get to Eric through his wife's golf coach.

272
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:39,429
And sorry Eric, I didn't mean to.

273
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:41,429
And he did the most brilliant message, you know.

274
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:43,429
And it's something that kids will actually take notice of.

275
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:45,429
Now do you know, Luke, none of those people asked for money.

276
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:47,429
None of them asked for an agreement.

277
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:49,429
Or wanted me to sign anything, but how are we going to do it.

278
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,429
They just trusted me.

279
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:53,429
And they did it because they believe this is the right thing to do.

280
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:55,429
And they did it because they believe this is the right thing to do.

281
00:13:55,429 --> 00:13:57,429
Now if they can believe it, I'm sure we've got millions of Australian men out there that feel exactly the same way.

282
00:13:57,429 --> 00:13:59,429
Now if they can believe it, I'm sure we've got millions of Australian men out there that feel exactly the same way.

283
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:01,429
And would like to have the opportunity.

284
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:03,429
I think you're 100% right, isn't it.

285
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:05,429
Sometimes it takes people understanding that you have got the power to do this.

286
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,429
Sometimes it takes people understanding that you have got the power to do this.

287
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,429
And congratulations again to you.

288
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:11,429
It's a campaign.

289
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:13,429
When you think about it, it affects everyone.

290
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:15,429
It affects our communities in such a horrific way.

291
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:17,429
And it is time.

292
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:19,429
The message has got through to me.

293
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:21,429
It's time for us to call this out and to make a stand.

294
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:23,429
Ta-Dean's square in the microphone.

295
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,429
We've got-

296
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:27,429
Will I love stories like yours.

297
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:29,429
It's a great leadership story.

298
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:31,429
It's where I'm passionate about.

299
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:37,429
We say success leaves clues and I want to ask you a series of questions I ask all leaders around these patterns that we think form great leadership.

300
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:41,429
Starting with this idea that it's hard to lead someone else unless you have a sense of self leadership.

301
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:43,429
What does self-Leadership mean to you?

302
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:45,429
I think it's being inquisitive.

303
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:47,429
And being hungry to learn more.

304
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,429
And to work out what you can achieve.

305
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:51,429
I really invite you this from the start to this Пока.

306
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:57,330
like being positive and getting things done and not dwelling on the past, but trying to get as

307
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:01,629
much done as possible and self-improve, but also inspire other people to do things when I think

308
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:05,769
they need a bit of help. Not to boss anybody around or tell them what to do, but rather bring

309
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:10,509
them with me. I just find that so, you know, it's so much fun and it's great working with people

310
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:15,149
and having a common goal and working together. I can see that in the campaign that you're

311
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:19,190
running now. We see other leaders I speak to are really conscious about every day,

312
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,570
the positive impact they can have on other people in their environment. How have you

313
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,330
thought about that? Look, sometimes you don't, it's probably something that's more subconscious

314
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,809
than conscious. I love going to work. I took this job on seven years ago, taking over two courts

315
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:35,190
that needed some serious reform. It was a really difficult job. If you thought that some people

316
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:39,250
hated change, wait until you get to a whole lot of lawyers and then judges and say, we're going

317
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:44,850
to change things. It's not a natural thing for us. We're built on precedent, but we've engaged in a

318
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,090
serious piece about trying to reform courts and reform our system. And we've had,

319
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,710
a great deal of success. I've got a really young team of people I love working with every day,

320
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:57,970
and I can't wait to get to work. I can't wait to see what we can try and achieve that day.

321
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,909
And I really celebrate what they do around me. One of my people is a policy officer that came

322
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:07,190
to me, I think it was her first job. She's one of the brightest women I've ever met,

323
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:11,129
a woman called Jordan. And to work with her every day is just a complete honour and see

324
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:15,309
what they're achieving. And these kids come up with the most amazing things. And if you

325
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:18,870
encourage them to do it and you're able to sort of spend some time doing it with them,

326
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:23,450
it's really inspirational from my point of view. So part of it's teamwork. And I suppose also it's

327
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:28,590
trying to look at what we can achieve. It's pretty cool walking home and thinking I've

328
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,429
actually achieved a number of things this week. You don't reflect on things too much

329
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:35,389
because you always want to be hungry, but I do really like the fact that we can celebrate those

330
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:38,850
things. A couple of big visions, uniting a couple of courts, as you said, with all the

331
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,950
complexities of that, and now being someone at the face of a campaign to try and stop this

332
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:48,090
national disgrace of violence against women. How have you gone about creating and sharing

333
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,850
visions of that?

334
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,629
At that scale, what's been your method for that?

335
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,690
I think internally with my own team and getting people who are really inspirational, I think

336
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,789
I sort of, like a lot of people, I think you react if you've got positive people around

337
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:03,730
you. And my team are incredibly positive. They're visionary. They're probably pretty

338
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,970
patient with some of those silly ideas I have. I'll give you one example. Last year, just

339
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,869
before The Voice, I think a lot of people were hearing terrible things about what was

340
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:16,950
happening in Alice Springs. And it was mainly, I think, some misinformation. I was really

341
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,849
inquisitive as to what was happening and how we could do something about it. And I think

342
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:23,250
we could support that community. We have a once-a-year judges' meeting. It was meant to be in

343
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:29,029
Melbourne. And I said to my poor events organiser, Alex, look, I want to take 120 judges, cancel

344
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:33,390
Melbourne. We're going to Alice Springs. It's not an easy place to fly into. I rang the security

345
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,269
officer and said, got any problems? And he said, oh, no, it should be fine, thinking, oh, my gosh,

346
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:41,529
what are you doing? And sure enough, six or eight weeks later, we were up in Alice Springs. We spent

347
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:45,750
three days up there. We talked to the local people, went to the town camps, went to the communities.

348
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:48,849
And 120 judges got experiences they never had.

349
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:54,390
Before about how Indigenous people live in some of these communities, what the effects it can have

350
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,950
on them from a legal system, what they understand and don't understand, and really the challenges

351
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:06,690
they face being part of our community or part of our litigation system and how unfair it can be on

352
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,690
them. Now, we left that message just because I thought, you know, what, we're just going to go

353
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:15,369
up there and see it. And it was one of the best things we ever did. We had Eastern state judges

354
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:18,849
who'd never been in a community before spending time in there and talking to people. And we

355
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:23,430
talked to people about it, what they felt, the kind of misinformation or some of the information

356
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:29,069
that was going on, and just the education we were able to obtain from that. That's just sort of one

357
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:33,710
idea. But it was just great to be able to change the course and think a bit laterally. During COVID,

358
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:38,809
we were locked down like everybody else. We decided with our courts, with the backlogs and other

359
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:42,569
things that were happening. And I think I spoke to you a little bit on Triple M about it. We had to

360
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:46,710
get the message out that people weren't alone. And if they couldn't see their kids, there was

361
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,849
border disputes and all sorts of other things. They couldn't see their kids. And so we had to

362
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:53,869
vary their arrangements in a safe way. I remember going on the radio, getting in the television

363
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:58,869
and saying, calling people out and saying, listen, we haven't shut down. We're still open for

364
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:04,029
business and we can help you in making some suggestions. We started a COVID-19 list so

365
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:07,809
people could get to the court really easily. We made sure that if women were in crisis,

366
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:12,509
they could actually contact us through phone numbers and through video hearings that they

367
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:16,769
couldn't have done before. We worked with the women's legal services. We were just fantastic.

368
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:18,109
And the men's legal services.

369
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:22,910
And we probably revolutionized the court and nationalized the court in a way we never would

370
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:28,509
have had to before. I loved going into that courtroom every day during COVID and hearing

371
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:32,869
and doing these things. Most courts went down about 40% of what they were doing during COVID.

372
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:38,349
We were at 105%. We just smashed it. And it was great because we were just so enthusiastic to

373
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:42,509
do it. And that's all these judges. Imagine getting a whole aging population of judges

374
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:47,329
and saying to them, in two weeks time, you're going to do total electronic hearings. If I

375
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:48,849
said in two years, they wouldn't have believed me.

376
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:53,789
They all did it. Then they started competing at who could do it better. So it was a great time.

377
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:58,250
And I think realistically, that's the kind of environment I want to work in. And I expect

378
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,029
people to work in. It's a great positive out of that, isn't it? That innovation may have been

379
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:07,190
brought forward 10, 20 years by necessity. And as you said, doing something that was impossible in

380
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,970
that timeframe, and hopefully that changes lives for better. But it takes people like you prepared

381
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:17,210
to push that cause. Curiosity is a word we see all the time. And leaders are genuinely curious

382
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,849
and use curiosity to want to do something. And I think that's a great way to do that.

383
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:20,369
Does that resonate with you?

384
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:26,549
Absolutely. I love trying to work out what's working and what's not. And also, I've got my

385
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:30,289
own ideas, but I also love looking at what other people are doing and how I can learn from that.

386
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:36,029
I'm a great believer you don't necessarily have to reinvent the wheel and you're finding ways to

387
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:40,789
sort of be collaborative. I am normally very curious about things. I find myself talking

388
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:45,269
to anybody I possibly can about some of their ideas, doesn't matter which area. In fact,

389
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:48,650
as a judge, sometimes you have people in front of you and they might be talking about a particular

390
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:48,829
thing. And I think that's a great way to do that. And I think that's a great way to do that.

391
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:52,849
But occasionally you're sitting there thinking, I actually want to know a bit more about their

392
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:57,349
business and how that works. That sounds pretty good. So look, it is great to be curious. And I

393
00:20:57,349 --> 00:21:02,329
think it's also great to have interaction with people. I think it's one of the things I really

394
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:07,329
enjoy is having interaction with people, whether it's people you're working with or people you're

395
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:11,910
serving to make sure you're relevant to what their needs are. You, as a lawyer and a judge,

396
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:16,990
have communicated for a living and communicating with clarity is another thing we see leaders are

397
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,650
particularly good at. Is that a skill? Is that a skill?

398
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,809
Is that a skill you've had from a young age or is it something that you've worked on?

399
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:26,829
Oh, I think I was always sort of good at spinning a yarn at some stage, but I think, yeah, you have

400
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:31,490
to be, I think as you become a judge, you really have to be a lot more concise. I reckon, you know,

401
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:36,089
being in court and having to actually convey messages in a pretty short timeframe taught me a

402
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:40,269
lot. And also thinking on your feet and trying to deal with matters when things are really going

403
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:45,549
badly without showing too much emotion. So yeah, it is, it's a skill I've just developed over time,

404
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:48,490
but it's a lot of people around me the same way. And that's pretty inspiring,

405
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,910
too. How important's collaboration been for you, Will?

406
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:55,250
When you're a barrister, you're basically a sole trader. You live with a whole lot of other people

407
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,890
in chambers who are still sole traders, but they're in a collaborative environment. It's

408
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:03,529
pretty unusual. I always wanted to be, you know, an old crusty barrister, sort of, you know,

409
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:08,170
quietly passing away in my chambers at the age of 90 after, sort of, you know,

410
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:13,009
and all of a sudden I had one secretary and a couple of juniors. And next thing you know,

411
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,990
I'm in a court, 120 judges and 140 registrars,

412
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:20,670
and things are totally different. And, you know, I absolutely love it. I love that

413
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:25,690
collaboration. We've got a really tight team of people we work with. I've got great friends now

414
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:30,730
that, you know, on a national basis, I've talked to them, you know, 17 locations around Australia,

415
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:36,289
plus about another 37 regional locations. There's nothing better than having conversations with

416
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:41,509
judges, whether it's something that's gone wrong or right, or talking to the security guys in the

417
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:45,670
Brisbane registry and how they're going, if there's been a problem, or just being able to collaborate

418
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,930
and talk to people who are doing a lot of work. And I think that's been a really, really, really

419
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:46,970
important thing for me. And I think that's been a really, really, really important thing for me.

420
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:51,490
Child impact reports, that sort of thing, that might be over in Western Australia or in Northern

421
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:55,690
Territory. They've always got a great story. And also, we're all working together as a big family.

422
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:59,309
And I think that's one of the things we've changed a lot. In the last seven years, our courts have

423
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:04,630
become a big family. And it's really important to have that kind of collaboration and spirit.

424
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:06,690
Well, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

425
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:11,289
I reckon probably my grandfather. He died when I was reasonably young, but he was a young

426
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:16,930
Norwegian cavalry officer. Came to Australia in 1922, walked up Collins,

427
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:23,509
met a gorgeous Scottish woman called Marjorie MacDonald. It's funny, I think I had my father

428
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:30,890
pretty quickly. But she had seven siblings, but he worked incredibly hard, developed his own

429
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:35,750
business up, provided for his family. They had seven kids themselves. And he was an amazing

430
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:41,569
businessman, just an amazing person, because he could inspire people very, very positively.

431
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:46,269
He was tough when he needed to be, but he was a great leader and a great businessman. And I think

432
00:23:46,269 --> 00:23:51,670
if it was someone I sort of saw as having great dignity, it was him. And he just loved his family.

433
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:56,750
Nelson Mandela is also someone I really admire too, for two reasons. One is because he inspired

434
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:02,549
people by, I think, kindness and love and inspiration. The second thing is he did his

435
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:05,569
best work later in his career, which I'm sort of trying to aspire to.

436
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:09,890
Yeah, they're brilliant, aren't they? And I love when someone's got a figure in their family,

437
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:14,069
and it relates back to what you're saying, the gift of having that example or something. It's

438
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:16,009
probably that grandfather.

439
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:20,269
Sounds a bit like I picture you, Will, in the same light. And it's not surprising that you went

440
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:25,289
there first and foremost. But for all of us that had that, you really win the lottery, don't you,

441
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:26,990
if you get a family member that close to you?

442
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:32,509
Look, it comes back to what we were saying before about role models. I reckon young boys need role

443
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:37,529
models, and they need to know how to behave, and they need to know what the parameters are. And as

444
00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:40,690
much as they don't like a discipline, it's not such a bad thing in the sense of being told

445
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:44,910
how you should behave and how you shouldn't. I just think having someone to look up to

446
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:52,470
or directly, it might be subconscious, but you do get enormous amount of comfort and enormous

447
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,410
amount of confidence from seeing how people go about it, seeing how they live their life and

448
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:01,509
what you should aspire to. And I think if you really delve into people's psychology, a lot of

449
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:06,369
people do, for better or for worse, react as a result of the role models they had around them.

450
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:12,210
And I often think, diverging for a moment, Will, that the opportunity to impact,

451
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:16,130
particularly as a young male, as a coaching junior footy that I have for 12 or 14,

452
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:20,710
is I always think that's such a great responsibility. You've got 20-plus boys in

453
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:25,170
front of you, and you get an opportunity there. And those touch points, perhaps through the

454
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:31,630
horrific Royal Commission findings into child sex abuse and all that, it feels as though males have

455
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:37,250
lost their nerve again in wanting to impact young boys. And maybe that gap is a problem as well,

456
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,509
where I know that there's three or four people that growing up had a massive impact on me outside

457
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:45,609
the family just because they took an interest. Is that something that's a problem as well, Will?

458
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:51,450
I really do think there is. We've got to be careful in trying to get things like, for instance,

459
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:55,650
family violence at the moment with violence against women and children. I think we'd be

460
00:25:55,650 --> 00:26:01,970
really careful that we don't mistake a really effective campaign with a gender war. You're

461
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:06,369
not going to actually be able to achieve what you want to achieve and create better men and

462
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:10,890
better young men by berating them in a way which makes them feel uncomfortable and not have those

463
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:16,250
conversations, as we were saying before. I really do believe that we need to,

464
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:19,809
and education is going to be the key to this, particularly as kids are young.

465
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:24,569
Like my grandmother, old Scottish grandma used to always say, give me a child until they're eight

466
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:30,750
and I'll create a man for life. I do really believe that education is so important. And part of that

467
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:34,269
is role models. It's the environment you're living in, it's the people you're looking up to.

468
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:38,789
I mean, I remember my footy coaches, they were just fantastic. I remember a mate of mine that

469
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:45,529
had difficult family lives and the people they looked up to may not have been their dad if he

470
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:50,509
wasn't around or an uncle or what have you. It may have been the footy coach or some other person

471
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:54,630
I knew around the area or the bloke at the local mechanics store that used to like them filled with

472
00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:02,190
cars and give them a bit of a hand. Just having a conversation with a man about life and you learn

473
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:07,569
things. And I think, and women are just amazing at this. They're just such nurturing, fantastic

474
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:12,369
people in so many ways. But young boys have to hear from men as well because they're the ones

475
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:15,970
they have to learn how to behave from, unfortunately. Well, we're a bit obsessed with

476
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,809
collaboration in our world and what you're doing is brilliant. You're reaching out,

477
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:24,970
you're cold calling people saying, we need you to stand up. We need you to come on board with

478
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:29,430
this campaign. Enough's enough. We've got to take a stand against violence against women. It's a

479
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:34,349
national disgrace. Is there one name that you've thought, God, I'd love to get hold of that person

480
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:39,170
to collaborate with? Is there someone that we can put a call out to? Well, mate, I think there's a

481
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:43,210
bloke who actually does barrack for a fantastic football team called the Western Bulldogs.

482
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:45,150
Chris Hemsworth. I've actually,

483
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:51,089
your management approached you a couple of times and I just think he's such a fantastic bloke. I

484
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:56,150
admire him in so many ways. He's got a great family. He's got a great family life. He's a

485
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,529
sort of person that people will listen to. So if there was one person I really want to get to,

486
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:04,150
it'd be Chris Hemsworth. Well, let's make that happen. He's a big Bulldog man and you're right.

487
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:09,710
He's got a huge reach and we need the role models of that nature to step up. Your message is

488
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:15,289
certainly reverberated with me in a positive way that it's not enough just to be the person that

489
00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:15,950
you want to be in your home. It's not enough just to be the person that you want to be in your home.

490
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:20,750
It's time for all of us as men to take a stand and just say, it's not on violence against women is

491
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:26,069
a disgrace to get the language out there. It's an incredible cause that you're behind. It's

492
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:30,829
something I think hits a raw nerve with all of us. And thanks for sharing the story today. I

493
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:35,190
really appreciate it. No, thanks. It's been great. Thanks for listening to another episode of the
