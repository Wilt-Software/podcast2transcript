3
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:28,440
theme of how finding happiness in other people's success is what makes Andrew Gaze happy. I love

10
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,900
Andrew Gaze is the greatest name in the history of Australian basketball, a five-time Olympian

11
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,260
who was Australia's flag bearer,

12
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,519
at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games in Sydney and is still second on the all-time point scoring list

13
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,480
in Olympic basketball history. The Australian National Basketball League MVP is awarded the

14
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,620
Andrew Gaze trophy and the Australian International Player of the Year is awarded the Gaze medal if you

15
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,379
don't mind. Gaze played at the highest level in Europe and the United States highlighted by being

16
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:44,980
part of the San Antonio Spurs first NBA championship victory in 1999. Gaze it's always a great pleasure

17
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,879
to spend some time with you. Thanks for joining me today.

18
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,260
It's a pleasure to be here.

19
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,760
It's a privilege. Thank you very much for having me, Das. Appreciate it, mate. I didn't realize I was

20
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,719
that high up on the pecking order, although you've probably done a million of these, so perhaps I'm not

21
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:59,780
that high up as I think. You are right at the very top of the tree, Gaze, as you would imagine in

22
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,019
everything that you do. I always love, whenever you mention I've bumped into Andrew Gaze or I've

23
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:09,139
spent some time with Gaze, people just smile straight away and you bring this infectious

24
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:14,439
personality and this great energy, mate, into everything that you do. Is that something that

25
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:18,020
you've been conscious about bringing positive energy or is it just you being you?

26
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:25,719
I think it's probably me being me. I take it as a compliment, that's for sure, but it's not a conscious effort.

27
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:32,819
It's just, I guess, a reality of the opportunities that I've been given and the privilege that I have and it's

28
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:40,900
made for a fantastic life and I'm always very grateful for those opportunities and perhaps because of that

29
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:47,520
somewhere in your fibers that you're getting a clip over the head if you ever start to get a bit grumpy.

30
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:55,819
Things aren't going your way to say, hang on big fella, you've got plenty of things to be happy about, so just try and be a little more grateful.

31
00:02:55,819 --> 00:03:03,180
But that's not the case for, a lot of people are successful and grumpy and don't have that energy.

32
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,439
I'm going to talk about Lindsay and the family history, but is that a Gaze family trait? Because

33
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,280
it is a brilliant thing. You want to be around people like you more often, Gaze.

34
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:17,060
Yeah, I really don't know. I think that

35
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,500
there's a lot of people who are successful and grumpy and grumpy and don't have that energy.

36
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,439
There's no doubt from my parents' standpoint, the influence that they had on me, and I believe

37
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,699
that's a significant part of what's made my personality.

38
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:31,400
You know, you've always got the nature-nurture argument, and there's a combination of all

39
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,360
those things that I'm sure have a pretty significant influence.

40
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,620
But for me, the most dominant factor is the influence that my parents had on me.

41
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,680
My dad was always one that's very pragmatic, very objective.

42
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,479
He was never a rancher or a raver.

43
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,000
He'd never force things down your throat.

44
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:56,960
It was never my way or the highway, but he had this ability to be able to communicate

45
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:04,300
and set boundaries and hold people accountable in a way that wasn't confrontational.

46
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,960
And it was this guided discovery that you go through.

47
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:15,300
And I think that between him and my mum, that they were able to always make sure that you're

48
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,579
incredibly grateful for.

49
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,899
You know, all the opportunities that you are able to receive.

50
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:28,699
I come from what I would consider very, very humble backgrounds in that, you know, we weren't

51
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:34,279
blessed with great wealth, financial wealth, but we were blessed with incredible wealth

52
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:37,939
in regards to an environment that I grew up in.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,120
And it was always constantly reinforced that these were privileges that I had that others

54
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,480
didn't.

55
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,480
And because of that, you know...

56
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,500
You come to appreciate and learn that, hey, everything's pretty cool because you don't

57
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,379
have to look too far to see the alternatives and know that, like you mentioned, that there

58
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,660
are others doing a hell of a lot tougher.

59
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:03,699
Guys, when you think about the legacy of your legendary father, Lindsay, and your mum and

60
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:04,740
the whole Gay's family.

61
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,699
I mean, the Gay's family really established basketball in Australia in lots of ways.

62
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,540
Can you tell us about growing up in Albert Park and when really a lot of Australians

63
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,459
didn't know about or care about basketball, what that was like?

64
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,579
You know, for you growing up?

65
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,259
Yeah, it was different.

66
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,839
And mainly because of the environment that I grew up in.

67
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,079
Lived in this little cottage that was in a sports precinct.

68
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:34,199
For those from Victoria or know anything about the city of Melbourne going back a long way,

69
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,860
in the late 50s, there was these old Commonwealth Army warehouse storage facilities that were

70
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,740
right next to the Albert Park Lake.

71
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,740
And they were no longer required.

72
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:44,819
Right.

73
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,560
And the local council...

74
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,480
The local council there decided to allocate those facilities to sport.

75
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:54,879
And one was given to basketball, one was to badminton, and one was to table tennis.

76
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,100
Not, at the time, real high-profile sports.

77
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,720
And they were converted into these sporting complexes that, additionally, a few years

78
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,959
after they were done, a squash centre was built in that same precinct.

79
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,519
There was the old Harry Trott Oval at the back of it.

80
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,660
And right next to that was the Albert Park Golf.

81
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:24,600
And when basketball was going through this conversion to make this old, you know, asbestos

82
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:31,000
roof, real sort of primitive type facilities, converting it into a basketball stadium, in

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,300
their wisdom, they built this little cottage.

84
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,000
It was a manager's residence that was attached to this basketball stadium.

85
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:44,519
So I grew up in an environment that was surrounded by all these different sports, and I had a

86
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,079
nine-court basketball stadium.

87
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:52,120
And it was my backyard from the time I was born to the time I was about 13 or 14 when

88
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,759
we moved out.

89
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:00,319
So I had this incredible environment that was vastly different to a lot of my friends

90
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,759
when I was going to primary school or high school.

91
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,199
They knew nothing about basketball.

92
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,279
At that time, it was considered a bit of a...

93
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:13,660
Now, you're not allowed to say this anymore, but at the time, it was considered a bit of

94
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,680
a sissy sport.

95
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,879
They thought it was...

96
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,639
Netball was a girl's sport, you know, and this...

97
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,879
It was considered...

98
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,220
Really didn't know a lot about it.

99
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:31,139
So for me, playing a game which I loved and was very passionate about and had been educated

100
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,740
about it from a very young age, I knew how huge it was throughout the rest of the world.

101
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,060
Unless you played footy or cricket, then it was hard to necessarily be in tune with a

102
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,300
lot of your peers and your friends.

103
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,180
So it was different.

104
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,199
It was one that whenever my friends used to come around to my house and they'd see all

105
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,259
these different things, we'd go and hit a bat, you know, table tennis, and we'd be at

106
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:57,439
the back of the Harry Trot Oval having to kick a footy, playing golf.

107
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,339
Everyone wanted to come to my joint because it was so vastly different.

108
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:10,800
So it was a lot of fun and although it was different, it was one that I felt really helped

109
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,040
me in my sporting development because, you know, a lot of people these days, they don't

110
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,819
from a very early age, a lot of parents focus their kids on one particular sport and everyone

111
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:25,819
assumes that because of my dad's success that from the time I came out of the womb, I had

112
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:28,259
a basketball in my hand and that's all I did.

113
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,079
But in fact, I did a whole bunch of things.

114
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,399
So, and I think that that versatility and experimenting with all those different sports

115
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,840
really helped me in my pursuit of basketball.

116
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,519
Fascinating to hear you say that, Gaze, at the end.

117
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,100
You would have thought that that's it.

118
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,679
You were the Tiger Woods of, you know, basketball.

119
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:45,919
Yeah.

120
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:50,580
And Lindsay wasn't going to give you lunch if you didn't shoot, you know, 400 free throws

121
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,059
a night.

122
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:56,039
But I read a great book in the last 12 months that a friend gave me called Range and it

123
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:01,799
talks about athletes like Roger Federer, whose mum was a tennis coach, but she wouldn't hit

124
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,519
balls to him because he was a bad sport.

125
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:08,779
And so he had to go and play soccer and badminton and go and do all these other sports that

126
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:12,179
when he actually matured and she said, okay, you're right to play.

127
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,019
He was a much better all-round athlete and makes a little bit of a difference.

128
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:20,559
Gaze, I sent you a message and I'm sure it was one of thousands, the Olympic games

129
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:26,539
in Tokyo in 2021 and Paddy Mills and Joe Ingalls are the leaders of that team.

130
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,940
Something that Gaze family for more than four decades probably have been on that path from

131
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:37,559
the humble manager's cottage at the Albert Park Sports Centre, toiling away, building

132
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:42,200
basketball, this dream could Australia, as you said, people don't realise a sport that

133
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,700
no one really cared about or sort of laughed about basketball in this country.

134
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,200
So would Australia be good enough to win an Olympic medal?

135
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,600
And it happens in Tokyo and there's so much of the Gaze history all over it.

136
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:57,159
But your reaction, mate, was one of the most joyful, beautiful things I've ever seen.

137
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:00,379
And I, but I couldn't help, but there's tears in my eyes as well.

138
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,620
Just your joy for other people's success.

139
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,220
Can you explain why that was such a big moment?

140
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,440
Yeah, well, it was, it was joy for the guys that have been there because it was my boyhood

141
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,480
dream when I was growing up because of my dad.

142
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,059
Who?

143
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,559
Uh, was a part of the 60, 64 and 68 Olympics as a, as a player.

144
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:25,279
Then in 72, 76, 80 and 84 Olympics, he was a coach.

145
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:31,559
And, and even prior to that in, in 56, he and his brother was selected to play in the

146
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,220
exhibition game of Australian rules football.

147
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:38,500
When my dad was growing up, he played Australian rules football, mainly in the, uh, uh, the

148
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,600
amateurs and the association.

149
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,419
And, um, there was a all-star game with the exhibition game, which each host city.

150
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,879
It is able to, to showcase they had Australian rules football.

151
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,500
So my dad and his brother played in that as well.

152
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:57,179
So, um, he, he participated in one way, shape or form in eight consecutive Olympic games.

153
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:03,179
So being born into that environment and learning about the Olympics and learning about the

154
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:09,700
spirit of competition and getting appreciation for how significant that can be.

155
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,279
Uh, it was, it was my boyhood dreams.

156
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,240
Uh, when I, you know, when you're a young kid and.

157
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,320
I tell this story a bit, but I'll shorten it.

158
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,120
But, but when you're a young kid and you're, your mom puts you to bed and they'll tell

159
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,419
you the bedtime stories.

160
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:29,539
And as you're, you're thinking about all those fanciful things that you can do, all

161
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:36,799
that, you know, if some kids will be there, if they're looking for something heroic deed

162
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,820
to do, if a lot of them, you talk to them, they'll, they'll be the fireman that comes

163
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,659
and puts out the fire or the policeman that saves a robbery and, and does.

164
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,080
All these heroic things.

165
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:54,159
Well, for me, my earliest childhood memory of the most heroic thing that I could do was

166
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:59,799
winning, was hitting the winning shot for Australia to win a medal at the Olympic games.

167
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,700
That was, that was my fixation from a very early age.

168
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,399
And it really helped, uh, me grow.

169
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,220
And, uh, my goal was to achieve that, that, that boyhood dream.

170
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:15,399
And I had the privilege to go to compete at five Olympics, but.

171
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,559
Uh, we never, we played off for a medal three times.

172
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,879
We never actually won a medal, but it was always the dream of my dad.

173
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:30,879
And because of my dad's involvement, uh, not just as a coach and a player, but as an administrator

174
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:36,940
of the sport, I saw things that, that not other, no other people were able to see.

175
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:43,659
I saw the Toils when he first started and was running that basketball stadium in, um,

176
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:45,059
in Albert Park.

177
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:45,600
In the early 60s.

178
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:53,259
And they had a national registration, uh, of about eight to 900 basketball players.

179
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:54,720
That's where it started from.

180
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,980
That's not in Victoria.

181
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,779
I'm talking throughout the whole country.

182
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:04,600
There was the 800 registered players and for him to, to take this, him along with others,

183
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,139
not just him, but as one of those founders of that, who's trying to propagate the game

184
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:15,539
and build stadiums and get an understanding of what it was going to take to fulfill.

185
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:21,759
That dream, he knew that without high levels of participation, without introducing this

186
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:28,299
sport to many, many people, then you're never going to achieve, uh, uh, international success

187
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:30,860
and, and it was a tremendous goal to have.

188
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:38,659
So for me, that was the culmination of that boyhood dream and seeing the way in which,

189
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:44,240
um, which very few people could remember or saw the development of the game.

190
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
That's why it was.

191
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
Yeah.

192
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,899
Very much special for me because, uh, I had a, I guess a, a more detailed appreciation

193
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,480
of what it took to get there.

194
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,700
My mind gaze is going to, um, my old school friend, John Aloisi, who I've had the pleasure

195
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,700
of sitting down with.

196
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,700
Yeah.

197
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,080
We went to school in year three together and, and that was his really early childhood

198
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,960
memory and dream as a kid, when he went to bed from an Italian family, a very proud soccer

199
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
family.

200
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
His brother Ross was an outstanding player.

201
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
Yeah.

202
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
I'm going to kick the winning goal.

203
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
You know, he was a really good player, a really good player and a great guy.

204
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
He was a great guy.

205
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
He was a great guy.

206
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
He was a great guy and I can picture him.

207
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
I can picture him.

208
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Yeah.

209
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,600
And, and I can picture your world and to see that happen and that, that makes sense.

210
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,200
What I love guys use it.

211
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,059
You know, it wasn't meant to be in your area and you're incredible to play off three times

212
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:31,539
for a medal, but it was like you'd won.

213
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:32,539
That was the joy I got.

214
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:36,960
It was like as it did it feel that way for you, that it was just as good.

215
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,960
Yeah.

216
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
Which is brilliant.

217
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,960
And the hardest thing is I was commentating the game and you're trying to keep your focus

218
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
on commentating the game.

219
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,340
I'm with alongside Andrew Bogan who had also been to a couple of Olympic Games

220
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,899
and we're there and you're trying to contain yourself

221
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:55,559
and you get off to a really good start and, you know,

222
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:57,659
and the battles that they're going through

223
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:01,639
and you're sort of getting overcome with emotion as it's going.

224
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,240
You're trying to, you know, you're trying to keep it all in check

225
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,379
and be professional about the job you've got to do as a broadcaster

226
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:11,200
as well as a fan and a passionate basketball person.

227
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:19,620
It was tough and it was not until like it was probably an hour or so after that

228
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,159
that I did a show called Shinya.

229
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:26,120
It was a wrap-up sort of show along with Andy Maher

230
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,500
and there was this excitement that was brewing after the game with Bogues

231
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,379
and we're celebrating.

232
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,279
There was genuine joy and happiness for what we're finally able to achieve

233
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,039
and then what happened was is I,

234
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,659
I hadn't checked my text messages or anything like that

235
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:48,320
because I was still caught up and it's surrounded by all the commentators

236
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,120
and that and this Olympic hub where you've got superstars from all sports

237
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,360
coming and hugging you and saying, well done, this is great

238
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,200
and you're getting filled up with the excitement and all

239
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,039
and just before we went to air on Shinya, I turned on my phone,

240
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,600
had a bit of time, I was waiting there because Hamish,

241
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,500
he had, you know, he banged on and it was going on with his show

242
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,539
and we're waiting for them to finish it up.

243
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,000
So,

244
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,139
I got my phone out and I saw, mate,

245
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:20,139
the messages coming through about the success and, you know,

246
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:26,960
and a lot of it was overwhelming because it was somehow or other congratulating me.

247
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,840
I'm thinking, well, I'm here in another country calling it off the tube

248
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:37,080
and it was like just, and it's just the heartfelt messages of, you know,

249
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:40,379
the generations that have come before and all those things.

250
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,220
It started to get me.

251
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:44,480
I'm like, geez, this is starting to hit me.

252
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,100
And then when I finally, then straight after reading all that,

253
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:50,720
I was on air and Andy Ma started to talk about it

254
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,100
and then I was just sort of overcome and tried to share the emotion of the joy

255
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,259
that we have for the players and what they're able to do

256
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:01,340
and the coaching staff and all those that were immediately involved.

257
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:06,940
But my thoughts went back to my year, the players that I played with,

258
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,819
the players that inspired me that went and, you know,

259
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:16,799
always the undersized overachievers that went away and competed at World Cups

260
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,940
and Olympic Games who had done it a lot harder than me and others

261
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:26,619
and those that come after it that really helped provide those opportunities.

262
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:33,599
So there was genuine happiness and joy that was not just felt by me

263
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,539
but the entire nation and in particular a basketball community

264
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:40,519
because for those of us who are as old as me,

265
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:42,920
and like you talk about with John Aloisi,

266
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:49,640
it was a time when we came through that wasn't as well received,

267
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,920
wasn't as well known and there was perhaps not the appreciation

268
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,299
of what this type of achievement meant.

269
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,059
And we all just saw the pure joy, Gage,

270
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:01,900
and we loved that you were just so giving in that time

271
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,740
because, you know, there's a bracket of people that maybe would feel a bit of jealousy

272
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,240
that it wasn't their era and all that came out was pure joy.

273
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:10,799
I love that the superstar, you know,

274
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:13,700
the leader, you know, Indigenous Australian athlete, Paddy Mills,

275
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:18,420
for him to take the reign and, you know, shoot 42 points in that final,

276
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,539
I thought just was another layer that was just so brilliant.

277
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:25,740
As an Australian story, going back to the roots of 900 registered basketball,

278
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,680
I think there's 900 in the under nine competition.

279
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,079
Correct.

280
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,680
My kids play in one domestic league at the moment.

281
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:35,599
That's how good basketball is going in Australia at the moment,

282
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,759
which is another great story to talk about.

283
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:40,420
I want to ask you, you've played in championship winning teams.

284
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:45,119
In Australia, you were part of that San Antonio Spurs team that I mentioned.

285
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,099
You're a really successful stint in US college.

286
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,480
What's good leadership look like to you in the successful teams that you've played in?

287
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,799
Yeah, it's a very common question.

288
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:01,720
And the thing that I have noticed throughout my time in sport

289
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,420
is that the leadership can come in a variety of different ways.

290
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,019
There's no cookie cutter model that you can put in place to say,

291
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:10,660
bang, do this, this, and this.

292
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:12,240
And you're a good leader.

293
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,519
It doesn't work like that.

294
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,480
And there are so many different ways in which you can lead.

295
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:22,980
And if you look, you mentioned, say, the San Antonio Spurs team that was there.

296
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,180
It was a veteran team, which was a little unusual back then.

297
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:31,359
It was a bunch of older guys that are coming together

298
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,539
that also had a superstar young fella in Tim Duncan.

299
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:40,539
And their leadership styles were old.

300
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:44,079
A lot were sometimes diametrically opposed.

301
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,380
If you look at someone like Tim Duncan,

302
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,960
didn't speak a lot, but spoke with his actions more than his words.

303
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:56,559
If you look at Greg Popovich, gone on to win five NBA titles,

304
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,259
regarded as one of the greatest coaches ever to coach the game,

305
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:06,140
very vocal, very, very direct with his feedback.

306
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:09,960
And did not discriminate on who he'd give his feedback to,

307
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,599
whether it's the 15th man on the roster or Tim Duncan or David Robertson,

308
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:21,500
very direct and was prepared to hold people accountable in a very, very similar way.

309
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:30,400
And you transpose that to right now and with me being involved in coaching

310
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:36,839
and say the Greg Popovich model that I saw in 99,

311
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:39,140
I, I, I,

312
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,859
I, I,

313
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:40,859
I would find it very,

314
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,779
I would find it very,

315
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,079
very difficult for that to be appropriate in 2018 when I'm coaching

316
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,599
because of the different personality types,

317
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,160
the different changing of attitude,

318
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:54,680
the way in which you've got it,

319
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,240
you're at you,

320
00:20:55,859 --> 00:21:00,279
you communicate to people has to be very nuanced these days,

321
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:02,799
as opposed to back in 99.

322
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:09,799
I think the underlying characteristic to it all is that the most,

323
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:25,619
most of the leaders have put in place clearly defined standards and behaviours that they believe are appropriate and they are prepared to hold people accountable to those standards.

324
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:31,619
And the other thing about being a good leader is also understanding your role.

325
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:37,980
Sometimes the second and third followers are actually outstanding leaders because they are following your lead.

326
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,980
Sometimes the second and third followers are actually outstanding leaders because they are following your lead.

327
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,420
And so it's,

328
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:44,519
they are following and endorsing and supporting and assisting those that are above them.

329
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,220
So there is a whole bunch of different characteristics that you can point to as saying,

330
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:53,680
as being identified as,

331
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,420
as good leadership traits,

332
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:58,880
but they are very varied and they are very,

333
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,339
can be quite sometimes just when you look at it in isolation can be very contradictory.

334
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:08,339
But when,

335
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:08,940
but when,

336
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:08,960
when,

337
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:17,180
deep dive into them, they still can feature very, very strong leadership characteristics.

338
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:23,359
It's a brilliant answer, Gazi, and I love the thought that it does look different in

339
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:26,119
different personalities and, as you said, can be as effective.

340
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:31,480
Where I feel people get it wrong a lot is, I want to be like Greg Popovich and I'm going

341
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,720
to try and be that sort of leader because that's successful and it never works, does

342
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:36,839
it?

343
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:39,579
It never works if you're not authentically being yourself.

344
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:44,819
I mean, and clearly he was and he is, that's who he is and it works for him.

345
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:50,160
We've seen this big shift in leadership, Gazi, from the AFL era I played in was very much

346
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,839
command and control and you'd cop the hair dryer every second day and if you couldn't

347
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,359
cope, you're out.

348
00:22:58,099 --> 00:23:03,559
Whereas we see, you used the word nuance, the generation of coaches that I probably

349
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:06,819
played with that are senior coaches now, they're much more, they're much more

350
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:10,019
more, I'd say, collaborative with their team.

351
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,779
They really take feedback on, they work with their player.

352
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,740
Is that, you've coached a lot in recent times, is that where it's at now?

353
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:20,200
Do you think that's a healthier way to lead teams now?

354
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,099
I think with all these things, there is a balance and your point is that your personality

355
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:32,519
type and the certain traits you have as an individual, yeah, I think you absolutely can

356
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:35,240
learn to vary that.

357
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,799
And like anything.

358
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:43,039
You have experiences, you get some education and can really help you in that area.

359
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:49,859
However, I think that in order to be the most authentic, you've still got to combine that

360
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:54,119
with what you are and what your personality is.

361
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:01,680
And because of that, there are some roles that may not be as appropriate as others.

362
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,940
You may be because of your personality type.

363
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,680
And despite that...

364
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:11,880
And despite all the various things you can do, there are certain roles that, well, that's

365
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:17,839
just the reality of your DNA that, hey, you've got to find your right role.

366
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:25,519
So it can be very difficult for some, I think, because you're aspiring to other things.

367
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,700
But, you know, it's like a basketball player.

368
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,299
You're born, you're also born with a bit of DNA and I wanted to be like Mike.

369
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:34,480
But God love me.

370
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:35,299
I could never jump.

371
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:36,819
And I didn't have that.

372
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:42,539
I didn't have that DNA in me to ever get up and barely touch the rim rather than fly like Mike.

373
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:45,400
So, and it's the same in other areas.

374
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:52,039
Well, yeah, you want to be Greg Popovich, but, hey, that particular way, you haven't

375
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:52,819
been born with that.

376
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,880
So you've got to figure it out.

377
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,299
You've got to figure out how in which you can be changed so you can get the same types

378
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,440
of outcomes in a different way.

379
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,440
And I think that the ability...

380
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:13,359
For the individual to understand, particularly in a team environment, that just because you're

381
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:19,740
not necessarily the main guy, the lead guy, doesn't mean you're not a leader.

382
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,000
For example, Tim Duncan was the best player on our team.

383
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,640
Tim Duncan and David Robinson were the best player on the San Antonio Spurs team.

384
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:36,740
But Avery Johnson, a five foot ten guy who'd been cut left, right and centre, was our point guard.

385
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:40,200
And our team, he was very much the leader of our team.

386
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,839
And he was holding Tim to account when we were out on the floor.

387
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,660
He was the floor general when we were out there.

388
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:51,299
And he did it in a more Greg Popovich way than Tim Duncan.

389
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:55,660
Like, he was there and being very direct sometimes.

390
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:59,960
And I remember when I first got there and I thought, mate, this is a five foot ten guy

391
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,279
who's been cut left, right and centre.

392
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:04,240
And he's having a crack at Tim Duncan and David Robinson.

393
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,720
I'm thinking, this could go horribly pear-shaped.

394
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:06,799
Right?

395
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,279
But such was the leadership of Tim Duncan.

396
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:13,819
He knew he was the best player on the team.

397
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,039
But he also knew that Avery had a job to do.

398
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,859
He had to be the organiser, the distributor, do all those things.

399
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:28,440
And it showed great leadership qualities to not let the ego get involved,

400
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:34,440
not let Avery do his thing because of a so-called pecking order

401
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,619
and understood that he was the best player on the team.

402
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:35,720
And he understood that he was the best player on the team.

403
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
And he understood that he was the best player on the team.

404
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,960
And he understood that when all's said and done, I'm the best player.

405
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,140
I know they're going to come to me at the right times.

406
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,859
I know they're going to be able to get it done.

407
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:47,720
And for him to have the, for Avery to have the other impact,

408
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:55,220
I had to lead by not showing dissent or not contradicting a lot of the things

409
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,160
that Avery could do.

410
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:01,720
Both great leaders, but both are doing it in a vastly different way

411
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,680
and that Tim, very quiet, didn't say much, but would let his game do the talking.

412
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,019
So I don't know if that makes sense, but it makes sense to me.

413
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:16,119
Because I saw it firsthand and I could see how the dynamics are working.

414
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,619
And if Tim Duncan is like some other players and says,

415
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,740
screw you, man, don't talk to me like that.

416
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,539
That's bullshit, blah, blah, blah.

417
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,519
And trying to get Avery to change the way he was doing it.

418
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,819
Well, Avery might have changed, but in a very short window,

419
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:33,420
in a season, in the cut and thrust of it all,

420
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,359
that was going to take a lot of work.

421
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:35,440
Yeah.

422
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,200
Great leadership by understanding what Avery is.

423
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:42,039
Avery, great leadership by understanding what Tim is

424
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:46,259
and accepting that we win an NBA championship.

425
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:48,480
It's the magic of sport, guys.

426
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:50,579
It's why we love it so much, isn't it?

427
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:53,559
It's that, you know, how do you get that to happen

428
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:55,400
and work at the right time, as you said.

429
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:59,339
I love the self-awareness and it applies to all areas of our life, isn't it?

430
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,740
You know, I might want to be the CEO of BHP.

431
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,700
Maybe there's an ego that says, but I haven't got the skill set to do it.

432
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,339
Or knowing your role, isn't it?

433
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,640
And then finding that success within the role,

434
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:14,400
whether that's on a sporting team or any other area, isn't it?

435
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,640
You know, you and I have worked in commentary boxes a lot

436
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,740
over the period of time.

437
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,700
And you try and be Bruce McInerney.

438
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,059
When Bruce is there, you've got a short lifespan, Gazi,

439
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,480
because there's only one Bruce.

440
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:25,079
Well, that's right.

441
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,180
So that's what you've done.

442
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:29,519
And you're another example of Avery and Tim to say,

443
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:32,480
well, I'm not Bruce, but in order for us collectively

444
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,480
to get the result I need, I've got to be able to do my bit.

445
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,579
I'm still very much a player.

446
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,299
I'm still a key cog to it all.

447
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,660
But Bruce has got to be Bruce in that type of situation.

448
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,480
And you don't want to impose yourself to a point that it's

449
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,500
to the detriment of Bruce and to the detriment of the whole thing.

450
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:52,460
And that's – it can be tricky.

451
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,559
And you've got producers and other people in our commentary environment

452
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,740
that try to, you know, manage all that.

453
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:04,160
But when you're dealing with really, really driven people

454
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,220
that are striving to the best.

455
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,319
And the thing that I say about – and the message that I also try to say

456
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:13,880
that, again, I don't want this to sound like a contradiction,

457
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:21,319
but my experiences in sport has shown me that those that get

458
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:26,480
to the absolute highest, those that perform feats that no one

459
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,519
in the world has ever done before, they knew they were going

460
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,900
to do it from a very young age.

461
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,140
They had that goal.

462
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,819
It didn't happen by accident.

463
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,160
Now, at some of the times when they're there, we think, well,

464
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,140
this is cockamamie rubbish.

465
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,539
Yeah, you're going to run 9.6.

466
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,480
You turn it up.

467
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:45,440
Here's a 14-year-old saying, I'm going to run 9.6.

468
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,180
Well, whatever it is, and bugger me, Usain Bolt some 10,

469
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:53,000
12 years later, he's running 9.8 or whatever the hell it is.

470
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:59,839
So I don't say everyone should strive for the ultimate.

471
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,640
Don't – you're not going to get there by accident.

472
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,240
You're not going to perform a world record.

473
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,140
You're not going to – you're not going to – you're not going to – and I

474
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,819
win a gold medal you're not going to do any of those things unless you absolutely believe it

475
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:17,500
and feel it in your body to know that yes i'm going to do these things and push yourself to

476
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:25,380
get there um but along the process particularly in team sport you've got to realize that there are

477
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:32,759
in order to get to that gold medal hey i want to go out there and average 40 well averaging 40 is

478
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:38,680
not going to be the best for this particular team so we've got to refine those goals to the

479
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:44,359
to get the ultimate outcome of a gold medal but we still want you to be striving to be a great

480
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:51,000
scorer because that's what you do best yeah and i'm i'm so in line with you guys when you've

481
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,400
genuinely and people will relate to that you mightn't be able to run a world record but when

482
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:00,640
you genuinely passionately cared about something and you go to bed thinking about it and your whole

483
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,259
energy flows in that direction

484
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:07,440
inevitably that's where you end up isn't it now not everyone you know can be michael jordan or

485
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,880
andrew gaze but you know that logic i think is something finding that thing that you love so

486
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,720
much you're not it's not work is it when you're dreaming of winning that olympic medal that was

487
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,359
just that was the joy of of your life i i often when i watch uh the australians succeeding on

488
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:26,200
the international stage gaze i think of you and i think there must be great pride in josh giddy i

489
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,720
remember crossing over to basketball court and seeing you and you're pointing out to have a look

490
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,420
at this kid he's going to be

491
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:38,960
something extraordinary dyson daniels joe ingles patty mules the list goes on and on and and it must

492
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,819
be full of incredible pride but i wanted to ask you about ben simmons the number one overall pick

493
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:51,400
in the national draft in the nba an australian born extraordinary athlete 208 centimeters 110

494
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:57,839
kilos it looks like life's got a bit hard for ben and i find it a sad story without knowing

495
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:02,099
you know him personally or knowing the sport that it seems like the joy's been taken away

496
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:06,279
what sort of leadership do you think he needs around him at the moment gazey to

497
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:12,400
to get it all back on track that's a that's a really tough one because we're always from the

498
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:18,500
outside looking in and you'd know within 40 circles and i know within basketball circles

499
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:24,039
that sometimes the narrative that's going on about a team an individual is not necessarily

500
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:31,700
the reality and people will come up with some uh explanations or some suggestions without all the

501
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,740
information and facts and i think that's a really tough one because we're always from the outside

502
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:39,740
but but you know so there's always a an asterisk next to anything i or anyone else says unless you

503
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:45,039
are really intermittently involved it's hard to to know but i do know through my own experiences

504
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:52,500
and the consistency of certain situations of some of the challenges that he is facing

505
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:58,519
and i think that one of the hardest one believe it or not and it was a long time ago when i was

506
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:02,740
there in 99 but i've also had glimpses of the nba program and i've also had glimpses of the nba program

507
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:10,819
recently as a guest coach or um seeing some of our players go over there is the culture of the

508
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:18,359
nba is not easy it's not like it is here in australia it's a team sport that has

509
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:28,920
uh profoundly individualistic attitudes and because of that it it's it's it's harder to find

510
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,599
your role uh particularly when you're

511
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:39,539
the expectations are so high and i think with with ben he was on this trajectory that even with

512
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:45,480
his time in the nba when he was there as a youngster he was overachieving he was excelling

513
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:52,779
two times all-star defensive player all these various accolades that were there but the minute

514
00:33:52,779 --> 00:34:00,819
things started to go go a little tough i think that that what's happened to him is is and i

515
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:02,740
i think all basketball players have been in the nba program for a long time and i think that's

516
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:08,719
is that there's that little bloke on the shoulder that's always telling you what you can't do

517
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:15,579
and he's there and he's in your head and sometimes trying to shake him and brush him off it's it's

518
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:22,960
really hard to do because you can't get it out of your head and for him it comes down to what he's

519
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:32,739
doing with his with his jump shot uh all the a lot of the the the criticisms of him notwithstanding

520
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:40,280
the off-court stuff about his holdout with the the sixes and the relationship issues and the egos and

521
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:46,519
all that difficult but let's just park that for a second when you talk about his actual game

522
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:52,800
is i can see it in him like i've seen it in with him and there will always be these guys when it

523
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,159
comes to your shot it's like in golf the yips when you get the yips it is a tough thing you know

524
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:02,400
what are you talking about just swing the club back 18 inches and

525
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,920
push it through and it can't be that hard it's the same with a jump shot a free throw what are

526
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,159
you talking about there's no defender here go up the ring's not moving shoot the ball it should be

527
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:20,639
easy but when you've got that little fella on your shoulder telling you you're shit that rim looks

528
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:27,360
like a thimble uh yeah yeah yeah your head's not in the right place and you lose that confidence

529
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,860
it is a nightmare and i see a lot of that in him right now where

530
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:40,099
this season i think he's got more fouls than field goal attempts not makes field goal attempts i

531
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:44,579
mean it's something there's some statistical stuff that's going on this year that's that's

532
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:53,099
outrageous so for me getting the basketball right will solve a lot of the other stuff that's going

533
00:35:53,099 --> 00:36:00,679
on and the criticisms that he's facing getting the basketball right is very very hard but what

534
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:07,820
do you get the mind right how do you get the mind right to make the basketball which one comes first

535
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:14,280
and uh sometimes great players they'll have this that that little fella in your head saying you

536
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,239
know good you know good and bugger me you come out you start hitting some shots and you just hear

537
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:24,679
the distant voice of the little fella and it's almost gone because just natural instincts i'm

538
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:30,860
shooting it and it's going in um but for him who's got some you know some technique issue problems

539
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:38,179
it's hard for him to get out there and just let it fly and just starts dropping so he has got some

540
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:43,280
problems he's got to deal with with his technique in order to get his mind right but i think with

541
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:50,539
him in particular if he can get the mind right and eliminate that fear of failure and that is a

542
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:58,480
big one fear of failure has brought many a person down but if he can somehow or other eliminate that

543
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,840
that fear of failure take some of the burdens off and just let it go

544
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:07,320
off start to see some things drop which he's shown he can do he's already shown he can do it

545
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:13,179
but when the mind starts playing games with you it's hard to get so getting the right people

546
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:19,199
around you to understand the work that you've got to do the perspective that you've got to have

547
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:24,760
and the calmness that you need to exist in your life in order for that to happen is going to be

548
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,019
the big challenge and gazey there's a massive asterisk alongside this next comment for the

549
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:31,840
obvious reasons that you pointed out before

550
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:36,739
you you gave that uh that answer and that is you know without being on the inside course you don't

551
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:43,179
know i must admit i i look at that olympic medal and you know ben simmons not being there and you

552
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:48,059
think i wish that around him that clearly is huge contract and there's insurance risk and there's

553
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:52,280
tens of millions of dollars so i'd take that on board but how good that would have been for him

554
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,440
to get back into a culture with patty mills and joe ingles and all of that team that did such

555
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,840
great and be the man at olympic games you see luke donchik goes back and plays the olympic

556
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:07,400
days with his heart for you know for for his country every single time and so i just you know

557
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,800
i take on board what you're saying and i'm sure that's the case i'd love some of that advice to

558
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:18,860
be around him i think uh that would be 100 and that's just on that and i've said this publicly

559
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:27,619
before i don't think he understands as yet because when he was like 16 or 17 he was involved in the

560
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:31,539
program for a very short window there was a tour

561
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:39,639
i think it was and he was involved with a junior uh team so he has had international experience

562
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:44,920
with the australian team but he i don't think he understands the benefits that he can gain

563
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:53,400
from it even say well we'll try to even think of it selfishly i know that being involved in

564
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:00,780
this program is going to help him trying to convince him of that is difficult because

565
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,820
for the last

566
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:07,340
three years he's had nothing but scrutiny and criticism about some of his decision making

567
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:12,960
nothing but so he's got to try and find a way to to have faith in others around him to say

568
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:19,699
give this a go you're now going to be playing in a situation where you're not going to be

569
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:24,320
scrutinized for not taking that shot you've got others around that you're going to support you

570
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:31,840
go out there and and have fun just embrace this and no one's worried about the

571
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:36,039
name on the back of the jersey anymore it's all about the name on the front of the jersey now

572
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:41,880
look at these guys look at uh jokic look at all these other international players have gone and

573
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,780
represented their country their numbers are nowhere near what they do in the nba but but

574
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:52,940
they're not under that same level of scrutiny that they are and you're around people with this

575
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:58,780
common goal this common goal that goes beyond how many points rebounds and assists we're getting

576
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,840
it's it's it's it's all that's going on and it's a lot of people who are not going to have that

577
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:08,039
stuff's important because it's part of winning but it's parked in the sense of who has to get

578
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:13,500
it done we're going to find that out okay you're the shooter you're and it's and it's a just a

579
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:20,800
completely totally different culture than what you get in an nba environment and if you're

580
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:28,260
surrounded by that you get a different perspective on the game and how the game can um uh treat you

581
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:34,280
then i think that it can be part of that rehabilitation for want of a better word for

582
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,619
which he has to go through and that would be a good thing and selfishly you know with the

583
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:44,880
the australian heart on the sleeve uh wouldn't you love to see i would yeah

584
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:52,260
josh giddy and you know dyson down that generation coming through with ben simmons leading the way

585
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:58,079
would be would be something special gazey we spend a third of our lives in our beds

586
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,199
it's a pretty good decision to invest in the world's best bedding mate isn't it

587
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:07,639
well it is and for me it came about because uh probably two or three years ago i was having some

588
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:12,780
some back problems and i thought well your bed feels okay and surely it's not and then then

589
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,460
some advice came back and said well you might want to look at the bed because like you said

590
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,139
you don't probably realize how long you're actually spending these things

591
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:27,400
so i went about and i um sought out some uh different alternatives and then uh the temper

592
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,059
came along

593
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,079
and you know when you just you sit in something you go hang on there's something a little bit

594
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,860
different about this it seems to just fit me a little bit better was that tension level

595
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:44,059
it seemed right and i thought i need a little look a little bit further in this so as i did um

596
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:48,320
got to to learn a little bit more about the temper and the mattress and all the science

597
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:55,659
that goes into it uh and um eventually uh got one and uh it's been fantastic

598
00:41:55,659 --> 00:41:57,480
now whether it's

599
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:04,619
a direct correlation but i can look you in the eye and anyone out there and say well

600
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:10,699
my back problems are not what they were um so i'm sure there's other things that go into it but

601
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:16,619
to me uh the ability and i don't know if you've got one uh dust but that when i've got the sexy

602
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:22,699
model where you can zero gravity andrew gaze change your life i'm 10 years ahead of you

603
00:42:22,699 --> 00:42:27,840
i've been sleeping in uh timber bedding for over a decade and i the problem i've got is if i ever go

604
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:34,139
into state or you stay in a hotel room i can't i can't sleep i can't nothing is the same as

605
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:39,539
temper mattress and for those that are listening zero gravity press a button your feet just raise

606
00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:44,619
that little bit gay your back comes up it's like you're floating it's nasa approved uh betting

607
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:49,539
the team at temper and it's changed my life seriously i i can't uh you know do anything

608
00:42:49,539 --> 00:42:55,380
else i'm not surprised as as a you know he's a big guy an athlete with back troubles this is uh

609
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,880
this is a good investment jay-z

610
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,340
annoys me and i i make my bed when i get out and i'm the last out i always make the bed but

611
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:09,380
i don't change the bed as as often as i should and melinda does it and what my wife when she does it

612
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:14,780
and she messes with my settings so she comes in there because she wants it perfectly flat so bang

613
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:20,539
it's flat when i get in there i go hang on a second and then i'm gonna go and i'm okay now

614
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:24,840
but when i was first there getting it just just to that right spot where the legs are right

615
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,619
the head's in the right i'm back in it

616
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,400
so i had to we had to go through some some periods there where uh i just say can you please

617
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,360
don't push any more buttons i'm in my sweet spot right now and i don't want to be messed with

618
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:42,519
all the best athletes in the world sleep in temper betting including hall of fame nba

619
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:47,400
championship legend of australian basketball andrew gay's temper a mattress like no other

620
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,800
i like asking this question guy i know you're a passionate father of four what what what do you

621
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,739
like on the home front as a leader gazey what do you what do you bring to the table as a father

622
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,940
well you've got to know your role as we're talking about and uh everyone would think that

623
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:14,440
in some instances that maybe i have um not fulfilled my roles as a stereotypical father

624
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:20,559
but i don't know what that is i i think that there are so many these days so many different

625
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:27,980
family dynamics uh but for me it's as it is uh with my basketball teams and with other things

626
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,900
in that about

627
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:39,300
finding the best way to find joy in life and how you guide your kids to have comfort and joy in

628
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:44,739
life and that doesn't mean they've got to be independently wealthy it doesn't mean that

629
00:44:44,739 --> 00:44:54,159
if you're not the ceo of the major company that you failed it's about trying to find contentment

630
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:59,639
and joy in life and providing an environment where my kids can explore

631
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:07,099
and get as much opportunities that we as a family can provide for them for them to figure out what

632
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:13,960
it is that provides them with joy i played basketball at a time where i never ever ever

633
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:19,039
ever for one second ever thought throughout my developmental years that i was ever going to

634
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:25,440
be a profession that i would actually get paid for playing the game but i found something that

635
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,920
i loved that inspired me that gave me unbelievable intrinsic reward and i found that i was able to

636
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:30,940
make a living out of it and i was able to make a living out of it and i was able to make a living

637
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:31,940
out of it and i was able to make a living out of it and i was able to make a living out of it

638
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:38,860
that gave me a social environment that was fun and all my friends and everything that provided

639
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:46,199
my life as joyful as it possibly could and yes i had some privileges just like we spoke about i was

640
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:55,219
in a uh this unique uh situation where i i grew up but my goal in when as a father has to be

641
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:59,920
is to do what my parents did for me and provide as many opportunities as i could for my kids and

642
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:08,059
opportunities as i possibly can for my kids uh teach them right and wrong respect try to get them

643
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:14,300
educated but somehow or other give them a direction where they can find their passion in life what is

644
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:21,880
going to be their passion and provide them with joy and if they are happy and content then i feel

645
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:27,340
like i've succeeded as a father what a brilliant answer yeah i love it and and you know interesting

646
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,920
to say you know what what is you know

647
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:35,179
conventional parenting look like i think you you break it down you know in the most simplistic way

648
00:46:35,179 --> 00:46:39,739
isn't it it's not putting a layer on saying you know i'm going to love you if you you know play

649
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:45,360
basketball like me or you know i've got this expectation finding that for them isn't it giving

650
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:50,739
them as much support as you can and uh i appreciate you sharing that go we've been asking a series of

651
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:55,219
questions loving the idea of what leadership looks like and as you said different settings

652
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:59,920
different personalities different ways but we see some common traits of modern leaders gazey that

653
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,659
uh i'm keen to get your thoughts on and we think it starts with a sense of self-leadership very hard

654
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:09,539
to lead others if you don't understand your own sense of self-leadership what does that mean to

655
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:17,179
you self-leadership well i think it's um an understanding of your own abilities uh sometimes

656
00:47:17,179 --> 00:47:23,139
trying to lead when you're not qualified to lead can end in disaster and it's about understanding

657
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:29,719
where you are at in certain situations and for me taking my leadership qualities

658
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:36,179
when i was or what i had to do as a leader when i was at the nba with with the melbourne tigers in

659
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:44,099
the nbl quickly and vastly different to when i'm a player on the san antonio spurs because

660
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:50,199
it's it's a different environment there are different people around of different skill sets

661
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:56,860
all those things so there are certain things that are transferable in those circumstances

662
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:59,900
yeah even though i'm the 15th man as opposed to the 15th man i'm the 15th man i'm the 15th man

663
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:07,159
as opposed to the first one or two men uh i'm still responsible for my own behavior i'm still

664
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:13,260
responsible for holding people accountable uh and the mechanisms of which you need you you have to

665
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:20,960
do it are different but that still doesn't change if you're the 15th man and someone's not applying

666
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,900
themselves in the right way i'll do it in a different way but i still have to hold people

667
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:37,219
accountable when you're uh not qualified i go into a situation when i've finished my my

668
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:41,679
basketball career and i feel like i'm worldly and i've got all these principles that i'm learning

669
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:48,139
and i'm getting involved in in business ventures and getting involved in administration of the

670
00:48:48,139 --> 00:48:59,739
sport uh trying to exude the same uh leadership methods i wasn't ready i i understood that i'm

671
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:08,239
ready for that because i'm not qualified in certain areas to to be able to lead i've got to get an

672
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:15,920
understanding um but like i said right from the start being a follower does not make you a less

673
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:22,599
of a leader being a follower and learning from those around you does not take away from your

674
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:29,900
leadership responsibilities so being aware of those situations and being aware of of

675
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:36,840
your skill sets and trying to make sure you figure out uh where that fits in is part of the

676
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:43,000
challenges i think to to answer that question about what's inside is being inside is trying to

677
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:50,920
where am i at right now with my abilities uh and where am i at right now to be able to help

678
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:56,119
in whatever that challenge is that you're facing and i love the the self-awareness to to know and

679
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:59,900
not as you said imposed you know i've achieved in all these other areas

680
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:05,019
doesn't necessarily mean as you said you've got the skill set in in a different path but you can

681
00:50:05,019 --> 00:50:09,659
as you said uh overlay some of those great qualities i i think and i said this in the

682
00:50:09,659 --> 00:50:12,980
intro probably the first question we think leaders are really conscious about how they

683
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:17,699
positively impact others in their environment that to me is andrew gaze there's a positive

684
00:50:17,699 --> 00:50:23,780
glow gazey whenever you're around mate it's it's it's again again i asked you that question is that

685
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:28,239
something that you you're aware of now and you think you know when i walk into a room

686
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:29,900
i'm going to give that that sort of positive glow to you

687
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,480
positive energy to others a hundred percent and that comes from my olympic games experiences where

688
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:40,340
i learned that one of the biggest and most significant lessons that came out that i

689
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:46,380
learned from my olympic games experiences is great things happen in an atmosphere of greatness

690
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:53,119
and in that atmosphere of greatness ordinary people can do extraordinary things and so my

691
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:59,900
challenge whatever it may be is when i'm in the group whether it's the team on the radio the team

692
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:07,420
in the commentary as a as as a coach somehow or other i have to create an atmosphere of greatness

693
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:14,900
never have i ever experienced in my sporting career and it's very easy to identify a shitty

694
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:24,599
atmosphere people pissing and moaning uh pointing fingers all that type of stuff is shitty and i

695
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:29,880
learned very on buying into that and venting and and looking at that and i've learned that

696
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:36,619
the negatives and venting that to think that that's going to help me never did joining in the

697
00:51:36,619 --> 00:51:44,400
pylon never helped me trying to be divisive ah this coach is a dickhead yeah there's four guys

698
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,199
over here yeah i'm with them because i don't i'm not getting the opportunities i'm getting

699
00:51:48,199 --> 00:51:52,219
it's not me it's the bloody coach i'm going to join this group over here

700
00:51:52,219 --> 00:51:57,960
and and and be shitty and and bring about this shitty atmosphere

701
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,719
a great

702
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:06,360
leader understands that there are there there's always going to be those that have different goals

703
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:13,619
different objectives all those things but creating an atmosphere of greatness creating an atmosphere

704
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:19,400
of greatness where you can still be pliable enough to for people to work out their their problems and

705
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:25,300
have a have mechanisms for them to share their their issues so you have some type of resolution

706
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:29,320
is a better way to get the outcome

707
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:29,880
that

708
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:35,780
you're looking for create an atmosphere of greatness easy to create a shitty atmosphere

709
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:43,480
very easy go i can go anywhere and be a cancer and a lot of people are probably some of the times

710
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:50,059
unwillingly but if you know that each and every time somehow or other i've got to get this group

711
00:52:50,059 --> 00:52:55,619
together and feel good about ourselves yeah you've got some problems but that's okay let's figure it

712
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:59,820
out let's be let's provide solutions

713
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:07,300
for people in a positive way far greater opportunity to have success than it is with the

714
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:14,039
other alternatives and a far happier life guys isn't it it's just the joy comes back and and uh

715
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:18,440
and you live that you know the joy comes out of you i think it's a great life lesson you've just

716
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:23,400
articulated there ladies are really conscious we see about you know if i've got a vision how they

717
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,179
go about creating and sharing that vision you spoke about atmospheres of greatness how have

718
00:53:28,179 --> 00:53:29,880
you gone about creating and sharing that vision and how have you gone about creating and sharing that vision

719
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:35,940
and sharing the visions that you've wanted to achieve well for me uh and and that depends on

720
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:43,559
the circumstances whether it's family whether it's business whether it's um the sport coaching

721
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:52,760
all those different things is uh all always going in there and appreciating that uh we're all

722
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:59,519
different and the way in which people will approach certain environments or challenges

723
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:10,019
can sometimes be different accepting that uh sometimes a preconceived idea on how

724
00:54:10,019 --> 00:54:16,280
things should be done as opposed to being open-minded and being objective about other

725
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:23,340
suggestions uh i think can be detrimental now you might always come back and you might come back to

726
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:29,880
your own preconceived idea about a certain thing but not having an openness and a willingness to

727
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:37,820
explore and see that there are always alternatives out there progress is made by innovation and new

728
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:44,699
things all the time and one of the gross criticisms of me is gazey sits on the fence

729
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:50,300
gazey sits on the fence he never makes a decision no no no gazey doesn't sit on the fence

730
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:57,219
gazey has talking in the third i love him in a third person gazey that's it but what i try to do

731
00:54:57,219 --> 00:54:59,880
is understand that no no i've got a vision i've got a vision i've got a vision i've got a vision

732
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:04,960
i've got an opinion i've got a view but i'm not going to dismiss someone else's view until i

733
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:12,659
understand it appreciate it make an assessment on it and then go no that's for me i come into

734
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:20,460
situations often with a predisposed position but that doesn't mean you it's it's it's um you can't

735
00:55:21,099 --> 00:55:27,659
change and i think that uh approach to leadership i think is really important

736
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:29,820
is it that

737
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:38,000
there are times where i can be as a coach highly dictatorial and that would fly in the face of

738
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,840
everything i just said but that's in that moment so we've made a decision we're going to run this

739
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:48,880
play and in order for us to have the best chance we are running and if you don't do it i'm going

740
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:54,760
to hold you accountable to that now after we've gone through it we look at the statistical data

741
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:59,760
we check out over a sample size we've gone through all the process

742
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:08,000
and you've shown me and demonstrated well there's an alternative absolutely let's make that change

743
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,320
and then we'll we'll incorporate those things but a lot of especially from a coaching standpoint

744
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:20,420
this is it i'm doing this come hell or high water because i know it's been successful i'm

745
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:24,659
going to do it i'm going to teach you how to do it and that is that is all there is to to do with it

746
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:29,699
well there's a time and a place for that but you also have to be

747
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:36,699
open-minded enough to understand and consider alternatives speaking about that open-minded

748
00:56:36,699 --> 00:56:41,380
gaze you will see you know people who are like you have had success are very curious and

749
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:46,000
curiosity is a very common theme we're hearing a lot and through that that's how people really

750
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,079
think about getting better all the time that constant never-ending self-improvement how

751
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:57,500
does curiosity show up for you yeah huge i think my curiosity is a quest for information

752
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,880
um you know

753
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:10,059
i i and it's hard these days because it is it's a lot more um biased than it used to be but

754
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:17,360
when i was growing up my parents highly encouraged me to always seek out news

755
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:25,880
always go out there and and and seek out news and try to understand and give and they believe

756
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,900
give me a greater appreciation for the challenges of others

757
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,880
so

758
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:38,340
i am i'm sure because of their their influence always very curious about information and

759
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:51,760
alternatives i am i consider myself uh um it nerdish type i know nothing about it but i am i

760
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:58,119
am curious and i am enthralled with some of the shit that's going on these days when you can speak

761
00:57:58,119 --> 00:57:59,659
into a uh say

762
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,760
give me a story about luke darcy and bugger me there's this give me

763
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:11,619
that world all that stuff mind-blowing all that so so i am really really curious because

764
00:58:11,619 --> 00:58:18,559
i think it provides you with a lot of information now having said that there are a lot of people

765
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:24,159
out there that say it's complicated it's complicating us all it's it's changing our

766
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:29,880
values and all those types of things but like everything there's always a lot of people out there

767
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:33,039
out there and the level of interest Coming Carlos has always been there because they're making great

768
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:35,300
decisions but you're not showing up on the stage валverde maybe you've got a glass of wine that the

769
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,099
situation is going down but you're not focused at the moment to do something good i think it's

770
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:39,460
it's that sort of thing it's what makes it interesting

771
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,820
getting those ideas out if you're a nod 8

772
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,760
back

773
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,539
it's also only in united states so there's always a balance in there somewhere and being curious Award

774
00:58:46,539 --> 00:58:46,840
leading people for

775
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,920
IT

776
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,820
i think helps you develop individually it keeps you young it keeps you appreciating other things that go on around you and sometimes you you'll look into it and be appalled of course you might throw this good reason as so

777
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:57,559
at each and the same time but it's motivate me

778
00:58:57,559 --> 00:58:57,739
joy

779
00:58:57,739 --> 00:58:59,260
the cutter it helps me doึ

780
00:58:59,260 --> 00:58:59,440
education

781
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,699
but I feel better for it rather than just having this narrow view about,

782
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:07,559
well, this is the way it should be and that's all there is to it.

783
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,260
Yeah, interesting.

784
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,800
I can see that in every part of you guys.

785
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:15,840
It comes out in all of your work and your words.

786
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,619
Communicating with clarity is another dimension of leadership

787
00:59:18,619 --> 00:59:19,780
I wanted to ask you about.

788
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:22,119
You communicate in a unique way.

789
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:27,119
There's always an entertaining part, whether you mean that to be the case

790
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:31,679
or any time you get in front of a microphone, I laugh and it makes me smile,

791
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:35,659
but there's always very clear through that message around what you want

792
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:36,239
to get across.

793
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,500
Is that strategic from you or the way you communicate or, again,

794
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,219
is it just a natural thing that's always been your thing?

795
00:59:42,219 --> 00:59:49,659
I think it's one that I like to be disarming and sometimes I feel like

796
00:59:49,659 --> 00:59:51,659
I'm not always a great communicator.

797
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:55,739
I feel like I watch people.

798
00:59:55,739 --> 01:00:00,000
And the way in which they can use words to explain something

799
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:07,019
and I'm in awe of the way in which they can do it because I don't have those skills.

800
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:12,579
I don't perhaps have the vocabulary or sometimes know the way to express

801
01:00:12,579 --> 01:00:19,260
a thought is that to try to provide a message that's a little disarming

802
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:24,820
and sometimes that can be filled with humour and sometimes it can be

803
01:00:25,739 --> 01:00:29,119
filled with naivety, whatever.

804
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:33,380
But that in itself is a way to say, well, here's what I've got to say,

805
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,039
but I don't want it to be offensive.

806
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:38,380
I don't want to offend.

807
01:00:38,739 --> 01:00:43,239
And that's what some people think is a shortcoming of mine.

808
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,079
Don't be afraid to offend.

809
01:00:45,219 --> 01:00:45,900
Have your opinion.

810
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:52,380
Well, I do have my opinion, but I don't want it to be offensive

811
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:55,199
because someone else has a different opinion.

812
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:58,659
If someone else has a different opinion, I'm prepared.

813
01:00:58,860 --> 01:00:59,960
I want to hear you out.

814
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,820
I want to hear what you've got to say.

815
01:01:02,539 --> 01:01:05,860
But here's what I've got to say and I'll say it in a way that says,

816
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,179
well, okay, this is what I think, but I understand there might be

817
01:01:09,179 --> 01:01:10,119
different points of view.

818
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:14,139
It can be highly frustrating and, like I said, a lot of people think

819
01:01:14,139 --> 01:01:15,519
that it's a shortcoming.

820
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:21,039
But in my own head, it's probably being a little bit selfish in that

821
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:22,880
it does me no good.

822
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,840
It does my mindset no good.

823
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:29,800
If I'm trying to impose values that I have that are going to upset others,

824
01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:33,119
I would like to think that they would see the same in me.

825
01:01:34,059 --> 01:01:39,940
Some don't because they are very fixed on what they believe, you know,

826
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:44,619
certain values or certain rule or a certain thing should be

827
01:01:44,619 --> 01:01:46,719
without having that flexibility.

828
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:51,780
And I respect it because it – but I personally doesn't give me.

829
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,900
So I say it can be a little selfish.

830
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:54,739
Sorry to interrupt.

831
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:59,000
I saw that in your answer with Ben Simmons and it wasn't a pointed question

832
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,119
in lots of ways, but I know and you know, if Andrew Gaze comes out

833
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,559
and says something, you know, controversial around Ben Simmons,

834
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:10,300
that filters back and I could see how conscious you are.

835
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:12,179
Now, you said what you needed to say.

836
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,699
I respect that.

837
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:18,480
I know your thoughts and you can hear it, but you're conscious around the energy

838
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,679
that's going to go that way and cause, you know, unnecessary upset.

839
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,820
So I know the criticism.

840
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:28,179
So I can see the criticism, but I can see you've been true to yourself, Gaze,

841
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:29,420
in everything as well, is it?

842
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:30,980
I haven't said – I'm going to live with that.

843
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:31,539
Yeah.

844
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:32,820
Yeah, I live with that.

845
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:38,440
I have no problem in being accused of offensive because I know in myself I'm not.

846
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:45,460
I can sit down and I can tell you on most things exactly where I stand,

847
01:02:45,619 --> 01:02:51,559
but I'm not to the point where, like I said before, that can't be altered.

848
01:02:52,179 --> 01:02:54,139
And I don't – I think if I'm Ben Simmons,

849
01:02:54,139 --> 01:02:54,820
I put myself first.

850
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,139
I've been Ben Simmons' situation.

851
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:01,900
And absolutely, has he – has a lot of these issues been self-inflicted?

852
01:03:02,019 --> 01:03:04,159
I believe some of them probably, yes.

853
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:10,579
But should he be vilified in the vitriolic nature of the way in which that people

854
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:13,440
have gone about it?

855
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,039
I don't think it's fair.

856
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,300
It's fair to have a criticism, absolutely.

857
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:24,599
And that's what they're – I can be critical, but not to the point

858
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:31,260
where it's vitriolic and just mean-spirited and all those things

859
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,980
because, you know, there may be other agendas in play.

860
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:39,239
Guys, we see collaboration is now something more than ever

861
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:41,940
that leaders are really conscious of how they collaborate.

862
01:03:42,699 --> 01:03:44,300
Does that align with you these days?

863
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:44,840
Yeah.

864
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:46,440
I am a collaborator.

865
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,380
I love collaborating because I was born and bred in team sports.

866
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,380
The joy that I have got –

867
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:58,099
from individual recognition for anything I did –

868
01:03:58,099 --> 01:04:04,179
is nowhere near the joy I get when you've done it as a collective.

869
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:06,139
So, again, it's selfish.

870
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:15,139
It may just be me, but I get far greater privilege being acknowledged

871
01:04:15,139 --> 01:04:20,880
and honoured with a group than I am acknowledged and honoured

872
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,579
as an individual, of which, by the way, I have been honoured,

873
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:27,960
and acknowledged way beyond anything that I have done.

874
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:34,679
And it's a little – it's uncomfortable because I don't feel all the time

875
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:35,699
that it's worthy.

876
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:41,739
So collaborating and being able to share in other people's success

877
01:04:41,739 --> 01:04:47,000
and joy and be honoured as a contributor to someone else's successes

878
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:53,480
and joy, I find way more rewarding than just being about me.

879
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:58,460
And I can see it, absolutely, in everything that you are.

880
01:04:58,619 --> 01:05:03,199
Again, it's authenticity of you and the combined team's success.

881
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:07,019
I mean, the individual honours are more than well deserved,

882
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,800
and there are many, but it's great.

883
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,780
I think all of us that are lucky enough to play in a team,

884
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:18,079
you get that sense of wanting – it becomes a bit addictive being a good teammate,

885
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,039
being part of something bigger than yourself.

886
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:21,980
It's a special thing.

887
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:24,360
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

888
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:27,719
My dad, no question.

889
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:35,400
And everything that I try to do, there is what would he do in this situation?

890
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:36,980
How would he handle this?

891
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:41,639
How can I do it in a way that he has done it?

892
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:44,820
Because, again, it's simple.

893
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:48,260
It's because I've seen the success that he's been able to generate.

894
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:52,079
I've seen the way – how impactful it can be of getting outcomes,

895
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,539
but also how impactful it can be.

896
01:05:54,599 --> 01:06:04,380
In helping others and seeing how others become better

897
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:07,619
for what you have been able to contribute.

898
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:15,300
So that's, for me, his biggest asset is that obscenely humble.

899
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:19,079
Like, you know, I'm thrilled when people say,

900
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:20,539
geez, you're a humble sort of boy.

901
01:06:20,739 --> 01:06:24,079
He is obscene, ridiculously humble.

902
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:27,059
But I see why.

903
01:06:27,659 --> 01:06:34,480
And I get it and understand, like we were talking about how rewarding he is for me.

904
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:40,179
I get why he is like that because it makes him happy.

905
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:49,780
And finding happiness in other people's success is what makes me happy.

906
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:54,400
So, yeah, he has instilled that.

907
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:57,360
He has instilled that in me, either directly, indirectly.

908
01:06:58,179 --> 01:06:58,880
I don't know how.

909
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,119
Maybe I was just – because it was in the DNA, I was born with it.

910
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,179
But that's what made me tick.

911
01:07:04,179 --> 01:07:08,099
That's what I feel – and it is selfish.

912
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:10,079
That's what makes me feel good.

913
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:15,159
So that's how I want to lead.

914
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:19,659
I don't want to lead to the point to be honored as an individual leader.

915
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:24,219
I want to be lead, to be recognized.

916
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:28,260
I want to be recognized as contributing to the overall leadership.

917
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,239
I just wrote that down.

918
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:35,019
You know, finding happiness in other people's success is what makes me happy.

919
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:40,500
I think that would be a nice quote on your tombstone, Gainsey,

920
01:07:40,579 --> 01:07:43,219
hopefully in another 40 years because –

921
01:07:43,219 --> 01:07:44,159
Hopefully a long time.

922
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:45,619
A long, long time from now.

923
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,380
But it's a joyful thing to say.

924
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,380
And I love how you said it.

925
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:53,019
You said it's selfish because it's what I see made Dad happy.

926
01:07:53,019 --> 01:07:54,300
It's what makes me happy.

927
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:58,280
You're not doing it for, you know, to be the most humble person on earth.

928
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:59,440
You're doing it because –

929
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,059
No, I am not.

930
01:08:01,179 --> 01:08:02,159
It makes you happy.

931
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:02,480
I am not.

932
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:02,860
I'm not.

933
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:04,019
It's not about being humble.

934
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:06,559
It's about feeling good about myself.

935
01:08:07,179 --> 01:08:08,039
Final question.

936
01:08:08,179 --> 01:08:12,539
We're obsessed with collaboration in the work we're doing in Leadership, Gainsey.

937
01:08:12,619 --> 01:08:15,300
And if you could collaborate with anyone on anything,

938
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:18,560
you've got a range of different passions and projects and family life

939
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,340
and business, clearly in basketball.

940
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:24,539
Has there been someone you thought, that's the person I'd love to connect and,

941
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,079
you know, collaborate with?

942
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:31,399
Well, I guess it goes back to my boyhood heroes.

943
01:08:31,939 --> 01:08:36,279
And I see what Michael Jordan has done.

944
01:08:36,659 --> 01:08:39,960
I would love to collaborate with Michael Jordan

945
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,979
because Michael Jordan has the Jordan brand.

946
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:48,140
I have the Gaze brand now.

947
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:49,239
And the stuff that I've –

948
01:08:49,239 --> 01:08:53,479
500,000 pairs of runners sold here in Australia, Gainsey.

949
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,220
That's it.

950
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:57,300
For $24 on average, mate, I've done my own work.

951
01:08:57,859 --> 01:09:02,899
And that is a great, great success story to make basketball shoes affordable

952
01:09:02,899 --> 01:09:03,960
for people in Australia.

953
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:06,039
I've got four kids as well, Gainsey.

954
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:08,279
The Gaze brand has success.

955
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,920
Different scale to what Air Jordans have done.

956
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:13,060
But I'd like to see that collaboration.

957
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,920
Well, you know, and I would say because we're into a different –

958
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,779
it's different models.

959
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:24,199
He is dealing with the Uber elite where he's at.

960
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:28,079
And where I'm at with entry-level products.

961
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,439
But I'd like to collaborate with him because not only does that,

962
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:34,420
he's an owner of the Charlotte Hornets.

963
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:39,060
So he has – he's trying to build a successful team.

964
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:43,819
And I think, you know, a lot of people look at him and say,

965
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,439
well, the greatest player of all time.

966
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:49,800
But he's got some work to do as an owner of the Charlotte Hornets.

967
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:53,859
Not, you know, he's investing the money but still trying to figure out a way

968
01:09:53,859 --> 01:09:57,479
to make that a successful program.

969
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:03,560
But I think with his – basically what I've read and seen of him,

970
01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:14,220
with his drive and determination for success and his unrelenting commitment

971
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:16,760
to do the work.

972
01:10:17,899 --> 01:10:19,640
And that's what's missing.

973
01:10:19,979 --> 01:10:22,939
A lot of people can have the right attitude, the right goal.

974
01:10:23,859 --> 01:10:30,340
But I'm not always aware of the sacrifice and the work that has to go into it.

975
01:10:30,899 --> 01:10:36,340
But to see that, to see how that would apply in those other areas as an owner

976
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:45,739
and as a producer of basketball products and – well, it goes –

977
01:10:45,739 --> 01:10:47,720
he's extended into other products now.

978
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:52,539
But he has collaborated well with Nike.

979
01:10:53,859 --> 01:10:57,579
And what – their collaboration regarded outstanding.

980
01:10:58,399 --> 01:11:05,439
But I'd love to collaborate with him and tap into his drive and the way in which

981
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:10,260
that he would do it because I think that the combination of what he brings

982
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:14,960
with that ruthless work ethic, which I think we both have,

983
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:22,300
but a different philosophy on how that could be achieved would be interesting.

984
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:23,739
What a beautiful.

985
01:11:23,739 --> 01:11:26,720
Wonderful answer to finish on, Andrew Gaze.

986
01:11:27,159 --> 01:11:30,640
I feel such a great privilege to sit down with you.

987
01:11:30,779 --> 01:11:34,819
And any time you've come across your path, it's always been a joyful experience.

988
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,500
I always feel like you leave the conversation, Andrew Gaze,

989
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,500
you want to be a better person.

990
01:11:38,779 --> 01:11:41,899
And that's literally the way I feel today, mate.

991
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:45,039
Thanks so much for sharing some of your wisdom.

992
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:47,020
There's a lot of wisdom in all that you've said.

993
01:11:47,319 --> 01:11:50,600
And I appreciate, as I said from the start, taking the time.

994
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:51,119
Thanks, mate.

995
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:52,380
Oh, I love it.

996
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:53,720
And thanks for wanting to spend.

997
01:11:53,739 --> 01:11:54,539
Spend some time with me.

998
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:59,300
I don't get as many invitations as I used to, but I appreciate it.

999
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:01,199
It's been a great chat.

1000
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,079
I don't believe that for a second.

1001
01:12:03,399 --> 01:12:04,479
I do not at all.

1002
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:05,300
Thanks, mate.

1003
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,060
Thank you for listening to the Empowering Leaders podcast,
