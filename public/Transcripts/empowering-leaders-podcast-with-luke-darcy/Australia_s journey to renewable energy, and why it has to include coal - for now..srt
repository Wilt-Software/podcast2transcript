00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:08,029
This week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is Jeff Dimery.

2
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:13,230
Jeff is the CEO of Alinta Energy and is an extraordinary story of success.

3
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,589
He was raised by a single mother in the Commission High-Rise Apartments in Port Melbourne alongside his five siblings.

4
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:26,230
His pathway from the most humble of beginnings to one of the most senior leadership positions in Australian corporate life,

5
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,489
I found to be an incredibly fascinating story.

6
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:34,890
In this conversation, you're going to hear Jeff reflect on Australian cricket captain Pat Cummings' decision

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,530
to distance himself from Alinta Energy's sponsorship of the Australian cricket team.

8
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,630
Fascinating story in itself.

9
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,109
Jeff has the unique position of operating a coal-fired power station

10
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:50,469
whilst also being the biggest single investor in renewable energy in Australia.

11
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:57,310
His position on the need to move away from coal but transition to renewable energy in an orderly fashion,

12
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,310
again, I think is worth having a listen to.

13
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:06,329
I asked Jeff in this conversation to think big on this global issue we all face of a sustainable future

14
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:11,870
and his answer right at the very end of this podcast to link defence budgets to clean energy

15
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:16,230
is again a thought that's worth hanging on and having a listen to.

16
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,090

Huge thanks as always to the team at Temper Australia New Zealand.

30
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,830
Jason Nicholas and his team have been great supporters of bringing conversations like this

31
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,969
on the Empowering Leaders podcast to the table.

32
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:20,250
Sleep and recovery are crucial to achieving success in all aspects of life.

Been sleeping on one for more than 10 years.

00:02:57,169 --> 00:02:58,550
It is a life-changing thing.

46
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,349

00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:01,210

and we'll be giving one away very shortly.

52
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,250
Jeff Dimmery was raised by a single mum alongside his four siblings

53
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,949
in the Housing Commission High-Rise Tower in Port Melbourne.

54
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,610
His mum regularly worked two to three jobs every day to support the family

55
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,949
and would even at times have to borrow tin food to make the cupboards look full

56
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:35,969
before a visit from social services.

57
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:36,969
Jeff Dimmery was raised by his four siblings in the Housing Commission High-Rise Tower in Port Melbourne.

58
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:38,830
Jeff Dimmery's rise from the commission flats

59
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,590
to one of the most senior leadership roles in Australian corporate life

60
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,810
as the CEO of Alinta Energy is an extraordinary story.

61
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:47,050
Jeff, I've heard a lot about your story.

62
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:49,610
It's great to catch up and thanks for taking the time today.

63
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:51,210
Absolute pleasure, Luke.

64
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,150
And just to correct the record, five siblings.

65
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,169
One of them actually lived with my grandparents

66
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:00,150
because we couldn't fit her into the commission flat.

67
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:04,330
Well, thanks for the correction and apologies to the sibling.

68
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:04,889
My older sister.

69
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:05,569
Beautiful.

70
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:06,949
How exciting.

71
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:07,849
Still close to the family?

72
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:09,189
Very much so, yeah.

73
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,370
We're close-knit.

74
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:13,509
Mother passed away last year

75
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:17,170
and my new wife, Nicole, commented how amazing it was

76
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,430
to listen to us all conversing about the planning of the funeral

77
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,930
and how we would go about that, agreeing on music.

78
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,230
And, you know, Mum staunched Geelong supporter,

79
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,129
so she was buried in a Geelong jumper.

80
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,509
And she also had a message from...

81
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:40,310
from her favourite Geelong player at the funeral.

82
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:42,370
The big hairy cat, Cam Mooney.

83
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,430
What a great bloke.

84
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:43,750
Oh, wow.

85
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,250
Yeah.

86
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,110
So I'm really grateful for Cam for doing that for the family.

87
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:47,769
Yeah.

88
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:49,670
Who is a great person.

89
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,269
She must have been a remarkable person, your mum,

90
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:56,930
to be able to provide and work the jobs to support you all.

91
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:01,050
It was phenomenal, Luke, growing up in that environment.

92
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:01,949
And you don't appreciate...

93
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,649
As a kid, you just live your life, you know.

94
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:06,889
It's your environment's your environment.

95
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,410
To me, that's how everybody grows up, or so I thought at the time.

96
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:13,410
But, you know, Mum didn't take social welfare.

97
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:15,649
She worked...

98
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,910
During the day, she worked at the Albion Hotel in Port Melbourne,

99
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:20,870
washing dishes in the kitchen.

100
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:22,750
So, you know, the big counter lunches.

101
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,290
And Mum would be out the back doing dishes.

102
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,290
And then at night, down at Fisherman's Bend,

103
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:32,850
she'd be cleaning factories, the factory offices during the evening.

104
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,850
And then on weekends, she would become the chef,

105
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,170
at the Chequers Inn Hotel in Port Melbourne,

106
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:41,769
doing the counter meals for the front bar.

107
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:46,310
And then when she wasn't doing that, she'd be at Port Melbourne Oval.

108
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,310
We're huge fans of the borough.

109
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:50,889
Lived in the commission flats across the road.

110
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:54,949
And Mum would be over there working in the canteen, you know,

111
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:56,990
for free as donating her services.

112
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:59,410
Just remarkable people, aren't they?

113
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:02,709
And I love, you know, the female, you know,

114
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:06,709
legends in lives that have affected so many people in such a great way.

115
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:08,870
Now, this podcast is all about leadership,

116
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:13,170
but your mum's story is almost the ultimate story in leadership in lots of ways, isn't it?

117
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,949
It is.

118
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,649
You know, there are so many looking back now

119
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:20,569
and reflecting as somebody who runs a very large corporate entity,

120
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,069
the lessons learnt from Mum.

121
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,389
I, you know, I have mentors in the commercial environment.

122
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:32,490
However, you're never going to be as close in any way as you were to your mother.

123
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,110
And watching my mum,

124
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,430
and the way she went about things,

125
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:41,189
the uncertainty that she lived with, you know, you mentioned,

126
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:46,230
and it's absolutely true about borrowing food from the neighbours to fill the cupboard.

127
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,930
We lived very much hand to mouth.

128
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:51,350
Hope Mum doesn't get sick and can't go to work sort of thing.

129
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,209
But watching her cope and deal with the stresses of that

130
00:06:56,209 --> 00:07:01,629
and putting on a smiley face every day and sharing the love with the family,

131
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,089
you know, you take that leadership,

132
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:08,649
you take that leadership role very seriously when you see it through that prism.

133
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,069
When you look back, as you said, when you were a kid, that's just your world, isn't it?

134
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,009
You don't, you think everyone's world's the same and, you know,

135
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:19,730
the commission flats in Port Melbourne produce great people as other parts of the world do.

136
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:25,050
But was there any sense in you at that young age that you had, you know, big senior leadership ambitions?

137
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,569
No, not at all.

138
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:32,230
I remember my first sort of ambition in life was to be a bank teller.

139
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,810
And it might sound really silly to you,

140
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:40,470
but the only people in my world that I ever seen wear a suit and tie were the bank tellers

141
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,310
when Mum went down to the bank.

142
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,069
And I thought they must be really important people.

143
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:47,129
And that's something that I'd love to do.

144
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:54,069
So that was my initial sort of aspiration for greatness, if you like.

145
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,170
But no, never.

146
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,550
I mean, you're just sliding doors moments in life.

147
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,790
One door opens another.

148
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:04,569
I guess maybe other people.

149
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,810
And I think that's what I've been doing for quite a long time.

150
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,370
And I think that's what I've been doing for quite a long time.

151
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,370
I was the president of the student representative council.

152
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:16,410
I was captain of the football team in juniors before talent kicked in.

153
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:20,569
So that was all about the person you were rather than your ability, I think.

154
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:22,470
Proven to be the case.

155
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:28,629
But, you know, maybe a little bit later in life when I did enter the corporate world

156
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:31,750
and I was determined to do well.

157
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,710
You could call that ambition.

158
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:39,970
It was, yeah, just something driving me to, I guess,

159
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:46,129
ultimately want to give a life to my children that I didn't have the fortune to inherit.

160
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,830
Jeff, when you were talking about the bank manager in a certain time,

161
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,289
I remember Mum and Dad, when you had a meeting at the bank,

162
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,230
you put your best suit on and it was a really formal occasion.

163
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,429
And I remember Dad's horror.

164
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:01,129
I must have been going for my first ever loan.

165
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:03,049
I had the board shorts on or something.

166
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:04,450
And he just was like,

167
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,649
what are you even doing?

168
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,769
You can't turn up.

169
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,409
Kids these days, a lot of them have never been into a bank.

170
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,909
You know, that's just how quickly life has changed.

171
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,669
Your family didn't have the means to send you to university.

172
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:19,049
I understand you're a naturally gifted student and you could do that really well.

173
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,370
You went to a tech school, to a TAFE here in Victoria for your secondary schooling.

174
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:29,330
But you went back and studied economics and finance when you had the means after going to work.

175
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,610
How important was that for you?

176
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,950
Oh, look, critically important.

177
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,429
And a shout out to the Port Colts.

178
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,309
Football Club here.

179
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,269
Little things in life.

180
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:38,730
Luke, I'd finished.

181
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:43,129
So I went to South Melbourne Tech, which doesn't exist anymore.

182
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,950
It's a sports and aquatic centre, basically.

183
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:48,370
And it only went up to year 11.

184
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,309
And in order to go to university, you needed year 12.

185
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:57,049
And the football club actually gave me a scholarship at the annual awards night.

186
00:09:57,149 --> 00:09:59,409
So, you know, we had most determined, best and fairest.

187
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:03,129
I think I was probably the smart guy that couldn't play.

188
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:04,429
But they.

189
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:05,610
They wanted me to do well.

190
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,750
And so they gave me a scholarship to help fund my tuition in year 12.

191
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:18,049
So I moved across to RMIT and did TOP, which was probably a step down from your HSC.

192
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:21,110
So I studied there, finished year 12.

193
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,370
And then I went off and joined Melbourne Water because I had to.

194
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:29,649
And got a job in their contact centre answering phones.

195
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:33,350
I did that for about 12 months.

196
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:34,409
And I thought, there's got to be more.

197
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:38,789
There's got to be more to life than answering phones, albeit, you know, I had a great job, good friends.

198
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:42,389
But I thought I could probably progress a little bit further.

199
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,570
And so I enrolled back at RMIT.

200
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:47,970
And that's where the year 12 was so important.

201
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:52,870
And I got in to do an undergraduate degree in economics finance.

202
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:58,990
And, Geoff, you mentioned you're answering the phones in a call centre at Melbourne Water as a 17-year-old.

203
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:04,309
And you look at your trajectory, you know, it's just a steady rise of, you know, promotion all the way.

204
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:08,149
And, you know, some of the energy businesses that you entered were acquired.

205
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:15,950
And then you stepped up, you know, all the way to now CEO, as I said, of one of the, you know, the biggest organisations in Australia for the last 12 years.

206
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:21,570
Can you see some, clearly you've got a skill set that, you know, works in what you do.

207
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,090
How would you describe it?

208
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:26,129
I think, I'd like to think I'm commercial in my thinking.

209
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,950
I can spot opportunities.

210
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:31,529
In terms of leadership and success.

211
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:34,149
So it's one skill.

212
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:40,090
To identify an opportunity and to position yourself to take advantage of that, i.e. acquiring companies.

213
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:46,350
More important once you acquire them is integrating them and making them work.

214
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:56,110
And I think that comes back to your ability to deal with and relate to people, to understand, to motivate, to incentivise.

215
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,710
And occasionally, unfortunately, to discipline along the way.

216
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,809
And getting that right is key.

217
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:04,370
Anyone can pay for an asset.

218
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:11,730
But providing you've got the right people backing you with the funds, but then making it work, to me, that's the point of differentiation.

219
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:17,529
And you look at the Alinta story and, you know, if the numbers are right, correct me again if I'm wrong, but you took over that business.

220
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:23,230
It had $120 million EBITDA, but interest costs of about double that, $250 million.

221
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,990
You come in, that's, you know, you don't have to be a great expert to understand that's not a business in great shape.

222
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,769
If your interest bill is double your profit.

223
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:34,289
You remove, basically, the executive.

224
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:37,710
You take over the team within the first six months and build a whole new team.

225
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,950
Tell us about why you had to do that and how you turned it around.

226
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:45,929
So Alinta had been struggling for quite a while, which led to the opportunity.

227
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,289
So I was working at AGL.

228
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:57,490
I'd been there for 16 years and I was approached by some pretty smart guys here in Australia who run their own private equity shop today.

229
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,409
But back then they were working for TPG, so a big American private equity firm.

230
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:04,169
And they asked me to.

231
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:23,129
Basically, leave an organization where I was 2IC and destined to take on the role of the CEO under the succession plan of the organization and take a risk and go and look at something that was pretty much bankrupt and see if we could build and turn it around.

232
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:30,029
I was the challenge of of the turnaround and the promise.

233
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,289
I also had a horse stud that a very small one that.

234
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:36,909
I was working on to develop with my ex-wife.

235
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:49,909
And so the promise was, look, by the time you actually get to the CEO role at AGL, if you're successful here, you can retire at the same time your current boss does and go and run your horse stud, which was the plan.

236
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,230
So I took the I took the gamble.

237
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,129
I moved across when I got there.

238
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,590
It wasn't that the people that were running it were were bad, but they were exhausted.

239
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:04,110
Look, you know, it.

240
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:10,649
It takes a lot of energy to keep a business like that afloat, and they were barely staying alive.

241
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:20,309
And I just looked into the eyes of the executive team and thought, this is not the team that's going to take this organization to where our funders want it to be.

242
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:33,149
And so I did make the hard decision, and it's never an easy decision to part ways with all of the executive and then relied on a combination of recruitment, external recruitment.

243
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:33,509
But.

244
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:44,350
I was hoping that my network and my reputation in the sector to that point would attract talent and so that I could get the right skills, the right people with the right motivation.

245
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:54,149
And the good thing about private equity is that you can put a certainly the right incentive program in place to get alignment between the shareholder and management.

246
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,769
And that's what we're able to do.

247
00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:02,909
So, Jeff, you know, which is takes, you know, courage and skill to do that at the same time, isn't as you said, no one likes that.

248
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:03,909
I don't think anyone likes that decision.

249
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:25,490
But clearly, it's been successful for you want to fast track to 2018 Alinta becomes the major sponsor of the Australian cricket team or a significant partner and Pat Cummings, the captain of the Australian cricket team is a passionate climate activist says I'm no longer going to partake in any promotional activity associated with Alinta's sponsorship.

250
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:29,370
You know, if if Pat picked up the phone, I'm assuming he hasn't.

251
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:30,809
You know, what would you say?

252
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,850
Why would you say that there is a better way to do it?

253
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:34,470
Than that?

254
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,350
What's your thoughts when you look back at that?

255
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:45,429
Yeah, look, I think, you know, we all learn from experience and I'm sure I'm certain that Pat would phrase things differently if he had his time again.

256
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:53,370
Now, that's not to say that his passion for renewable energy, you know, would would be not relevant to the conversation.

257
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:58,009
But I think the way he canvassed what he did at the time could have been done better.

258
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:03,990
And I think, you know, in conversations with Nick Hockley and others at Cricket Australia, there was an admission.

259
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,809
That that that would be the case.

260
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:10,149
And of course, you know, the media take things and run with them as they do.

261
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,889
The story becomes the story.

262
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,389
Look, the reality is, what would you do differently?

263
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:29,409
Firstly, from a from from from a factual point of view, Alinta Energy at the time the comments were made had just finished commissioning Western Australia's most efficient wind farm.

264
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,690
It's the most efficient wind farm in Australia.

265
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,129
Full stop, not just WA.

266
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,610
It has the most energy output of any wind farm.

267
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:47,450
We'd also recently completed building a solar array for Fortescue, who are one of our biggest iron ore exporters.

268
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:50,549
And we supported that with backup battery.

269
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:55,370
So we were displacing diesel in that regard.

270
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,289
We picked up an order to do the same thing for BHP in the Pilbara.

271
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,950
And we were progressing with one of the first offshore wind farms.

272
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,089
And we were progressing with one of the first offshore wind farms in the Pilbara.

273
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:08,230
We're building pumped hydro in New South Wales.

274
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,470
We own a coal-fired asset.

275
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:18,349
And, you know, I don't shy away from that because it has such a critical role to play in the delivery of energy today.

276
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:22,170
And ironically, you know, I was watching the cricket after the story broke.

277
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:24,170
There was a night match on in New South Wales.

278
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:25,869
It was night.

279
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,089
So there was no solar and there wasn't a breath of wind.

280
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,529
So there was no wind.

281
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,809
And that game wouldn't have gone ahead but for the coal-fired generation.

282
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:34,009
So you either.

283
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:38,190
You put the ball down and say, I'm dead against this or you run in and you bowl.

284
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,970
And you run in and bowl because, you know, practically people want to watch night cricket.

285
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:43,950
They want to be entertained.

286
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:46,430
We want to maintain our lifestyles.

287
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,750
We, you know, unashamedly, we're driving towards net zero.

288
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,009
We're transitioning away.

289
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:57,490
And so I guess from my perspective, the dilemma was we're at the forefront of that transition.

290
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:02,450
Yet we're being called out because we continued in that situation.

291
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:07,250
We were being called out because we continued to operate a coal-fired power station.

292
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:15,829
And the reality is technically, if you turned off all the coal-fired power stations in Australia today, um, the economy would come to a standstill.

293
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,750
People's lives would be devastated.

294
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:23,750
And so it's kind of, you know, it's having perspective and understanding really is the key.

295
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:25,250
And declaring energy.

296
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:31,130
I've actually sat across from Pat in this format and he's a, he's a brilliant guy and an outstanding human being.

297
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:31,730
And, and, and.

298
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:38,269
And, and, uh, totally, um, share his right to, to, to the view in, in, in every sense of the word.

299
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:49,029
At one end of the argument, uh, Jeff, there's a, there's a view of it, you know, people that the human, um, uh, carbonization of the planet has caused irreparable damage.

300
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:53,009
And we're on a one-way slide to, to irreversible destruction.

301
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:56,670
You're suggesting, hey, we have to get to net zero.

302
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:57,549
We've got to get to renewal.

303
00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:00,230
But we need to buy some time.

304
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,589
Otherwise the lights go out.

305
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,690
Then, then we, we, uh, we need, we need to pre-perform.

306
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,930
And I think, and I, and I agree with you, with you on that, but it's, it's, it's, um, it's just a, it's, uh, it's a, it's a, it's an issue of.

307
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:08,970
It's just, it's an issue of, it's an issue of time.

308
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,329
Because it feels like the, uh, it was, everyone's so extreme on this.

309
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,890
Is there a way that, and are you right?

310
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,970
Is there time?

311
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:18,549
Um, look, time is of the essence.

312
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:19,710
Don't get me wrong, Luke.

313
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:25,430
And the moment we don't need that power station, then we won't be operating it on coal.

314
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:31,609
And by the way, we're spending millions of dollars right now, assessing the merits of converting the coal.

315
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:31,710
So, um, uh, uh, uh, uh.

316
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:39,349
supply to um biomass so we're not sitting there operating it with our head in the sand we have a

317
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:45,130
plan to transition even that power station away from coal what we don't have in australia that

318
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:51,789
they have in parts of europe and the us for that matter we don't have any nuclear power we don't

319
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:59,269
have any baseload energy that that isn't high intensity when it comes to emissions and and so

320
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:05,170
you know we need to find an alternative and that's why we're looking at biomass as an alternative to

321
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:14,210
coal um you you won't survive merely uh on wind and solar the cost of battery to install to back

322
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:20,890
up those renewable variable sources of energy are unaffordable for us so we'll save the planet

323
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:27,609
but we'll blow up the country in the process and so you've got to find that that happy middle

324
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:29,250
ground i mean i i was in china

325
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:36,269
last week um and often people will point to china and say well look well look at what the chinese are

326
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:41,150
doing let me tell you what the chinese are doing i was on the ground there i was in shanghai 80

327
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:47,730
of the cars in shanghai are now electric um the difference in shanghai quite frankly is when the

328
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:52,210
government decide they're going to do something they do it whereas here in australia if i think

329
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:58,130
about the challenges we've got on this transition um to put them into perspective access to the

330
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,210
grid the grid our

331
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:06,309
grid hasn't been designed um for 100 percent renewables and so we've got to do work to

332
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:11,769
retrofit the grid um and so even if you build the assets before the grid's ready the grid won't take

333
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:18,890
them so it doesn't matter how impatient we are and then the other thing is that um if you look at

334
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:24,589
what's going on with the push to renewables this is not a a domestic thing that's happening in

335
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:28,869
australia this is a global phenomenon and so for instance the u.s government

336
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:35,549
introduced the ira which is the inflationary reduction act um and so they're putting

337
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:41,849
trillions of dollars into subsidize renewal renewable development in the u.s so guess where

338
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:46,470
all the big renewable developers globally want to head we don't have those incentives here in

339
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:52,210
australia europe's about to announce a similar program and so you know what we need to do to

340
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,509
get to net zero is offshore wind's going to be a big part of that and we're developing offshore wind

341
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:59,250
but we don't have the equipment here in australia to be able to do that so we're going to have to

342
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:04,630
for instance to anchor the towers into the seabed we've got to bring that in from overseas

343
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:10,049
and then you've got all of these massive government subsidized programs going on in the u.s

344
00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:16,390
going on in europe and asia who wants to come to australia that's that's what we're competing with

345
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:22,789
so wanting to do something and having the ability to do it are two different things and really what

346
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:28,690
i'm saying to you is that you know let's not walk the high wire until we've got a safety net

347
00:22:29,269 --> 00:22:33,730
underneath us to catch us from falling now that doesn't mean we don't do anything quite the

348
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:39,210
opposite but don't shut down assets before you've got replacement supply in place because all you

349
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:46,829
will do is drive up the energy price and you will create grid security um reliability of supply

350
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:52,049
issues so you know you don't want to be a factory that has to interrupt their supply like they do in

351
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:57,910
south africa you know three four or five times a day um that's just you know not where anybody

352
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:58,650
wants to be

353
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:07,289
this is not a new conversation the decarbonization around the globe has to be top of mind for for

354
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:11,589
everyone in senior government and and every conversation in households now it's something

355
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:16,869
our kids are really passionate about as they should be and we and we should understand and

356
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:22,349
we're an incredibly resource rich country we've got wind we've got a lot of sun that other

357
00:23:22,349 --> 00:23:27,950
countries we've got a lot of uh natural um opportunities haven't we to to do better on

358
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,950
this bay so

359
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:34,269
what are the decisions is it you know why hasn't the grid been fixed yeah why haven't we put that

360
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:39,150
infrastructure in place these are things that you know probably 20 25 years ago could have been

361
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:46,309
happening yeah look um firstly if you take a quick trip down memory lane when i was at agl um we were

362
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:51,130
a member of the renewable energy generators of australia we're also a member of the australian

363
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:59,089
wind energy association and um the business council for sustainable energy um i was our

364
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:05,549
representative on each of those and uh we lobbied really hard i'd drive an amalgamation of those

365
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:09,890
three groups to create the clean energy council which is you know the most prominent lobby group

366
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:16,890
for renewables um in the country so we we were there i'd also say just historically i started up

367
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:25,890
the um power generation group at agl uh including doing the first ever wind farm at agl and uh built

368
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:29,250
um commercialized the bogong hydroelectric power generation group and i was a member of the

369
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:37,609
power station in the high plains here up up near um falls creek um and build a cluster of wind farms

370
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:43,210
i've built more renewables or commercialized more renewables in this country than anybody so i feel

371
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:49,869
like you know i'm i'm qualified to to make the the comments that i do about the transition and

372
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:55,349
the timing you're right luke if you had a crystal ball and you went back 20 or 25 years ago you

373
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:59,250
would do things differently um you know why why is that

374
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:05,710
not the case um look we're kind of in an interesting situation in victoria right now

375
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:10,730
when you look at the state of the economy but we we were all equally in a very difficult position

376
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:17,690
if you go back sort of 20 odd years ago 25 maybe close to 30 um and victoria decided to

377
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:24,190
privatize and sell off assets as did other states um and so now what you've got is you've got private

378
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:29,250
ownership of transmission and distribution networks um you know they're

379
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:35,230
no longer owned by the people um and they're not all owned by the same entity uh and then you've

380
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:40,569
got separation of ownership between power generation transmission distribution there's

381
00:25:40,569 --> 00:25:45,430
a lot of vested interests that go into the mix um when it comes to redesigning anything quite

382
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:50,710
frankly and then we have um you know difference between australia and china i said earlier

383
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:56,789
the government want to do something in china they do it here in australia um it's we very

384
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,750
much want to take everybody along for the ride

385
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:05,809
so uh you know classic right now you'll see more recently we had tractor tractors parked up on

386
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:11,029
spring street um there was a protest in ballarat as well same sort of thing farmers aren't happy

387
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:15,109
about transmission lines going across their farmland their livelihood you know the asset

388
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:20,789
been in the family forever um they don't see the world through a bigger picture lens that you were

389
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:25,809
painting earlier they just see you know their their lot in life and so they're not happy about

390
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:29,190
that and they don't want this to proceed um equally

391
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:34,950
people don't want wind farms in their backyard and we don't you know we don't have compulsory

392
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:40,730
acquisition and laws like that that that would happen in china and so getting everybody to the

393
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:47,650
table getting everybody to agree and and even more so i guess the the emerging profile of

394
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:51,549
indigenous people and their rights and you know i'm not commenting whether these things are right

395
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:57,509
or wrong the reality is the complexities that we need to deal with and then you overlay those

396
00:26:57,509 --> 00:26:59,250
subsidies going on overseas that i think are going to be a big part of the future of the

397
00:26:59,269 --> 00:26:59,990
world and i think that's a big part of the future of the world and i think that's a big part of the

398
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:07,630
and the availability of um infrastructure to come and build the assets and uh you know it's it's uh

399
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:12,109
it's a pretty difficult task we have and i think that's why this is an important discussion it's

400
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:17,329
to me it's a leadership conversation not about the um intricacies of energy which you know upside

401
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:22,190
down back to front i think often you know it's easy to paint jeff dimmery as the coal baron who's

402
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:29,029
got the loyong big power station and and greed you're a a father someone who cares deeply about

403
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:33,849
the um history and and the future as well everyone who knows you will tell you that's the case and

404
00:27:33,849 --> 00:27:38,730
that's why i was super interested in in this conversation because without being able to have

405
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,730
normal conversation i feel like that art's gone isn't it you know at one level it's okay to say

406
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:48,950
you know i want to ban uh you know um any coal five power station but what are you prepared to

407
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:54,250
give up is there a sense that as a community hey perhaps we do need to sacrifice a little bit do

408
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:59,250
we do need to give back is is is that a fair assumption as well or not i think it's a fair

409
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:04,849
absolutely and it's happening right now whether people realize that or not um you know the cost

410
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:10,569
of energy has gone up and uh i was talking at a conference last year and i gave the example

411
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:19,170
let's take our loyong b asset um so it's it's 1000 megawatts um so for your average punter that

412
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:25,349
means uh the total demand in the state of victoria gets to about 8 000 so it's about 12 15 percent

413
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:29,250
uh and then on a normal day it's probably that coal five power station

414
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:36,049
generates about 15 percent of victoria's energy needs yeah um on on a busy day and then it runs

415
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:42,670
24 7 so on a quiet day um you know that that could be pushing up around 25 percent but yeah that's

416
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:49,730
that's the so we switch that off tomorrow the lights they literally go out in victoria um if

417
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:57,490
it's not windy and uh so if the if the wind's not blowing then yes absolutely we're in dire um

418
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,250
we we'd

419
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:04,390
we'd be so if you switch that off and next door loyang a i guarantee the lights would go out yes

420
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:09,829
um our power station on its own i would say depends on whether your lawn down the road which

421
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:15,150
is an old coal-fired power station which doesn't operate very reliably anymore if that's still

422
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:19,769
operating and loyang a is operating we might be okay but if they're out as well the lights are

423
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:24,269
out so people listening to this and say okay take your face value you know you've got shareholders

424
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:28,390
that you need to to look after as well and that's cheap energy and that's a good business model

425
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:28,809
yep

426
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:35,369
when when can we do it so yeah the point i was going to make was that we we purchased that

427
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:41,630
asset a few years back for just over a billion dollars to replace that either with offshore

428
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:46,710
wind i'll use offshore wind so if you use the combination of offshore wind which is where we're

429
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:51,210
heading and pumped hydro which we're developing a pumped hydro project in new south wales

430
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:57,390
those two projects combined will put us back to where we are with with loyang b the difference

431
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,230
is that's costing close to nine

432
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:05,210
billion dollars to develop those two projects energy is not going to be cheaper under that

433
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:11,470
scenario and then you've got augmentation of the grid another thing so um sometimes it's easy for

434
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:18,029
politicians to talk about if you think about it conceptually look the wind's free um so why isn't

435
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:24,410
it cheaper the reality is it costs a lot of money to go and plonk turbines in in the ocean build

436
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:29,250
undersea cables connect them and redesign the grid to take it um yes and then you've got to

437
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:34,529
the marginal cost of fuel is close to zero but maintenance all of that you know those costs

438
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:39,430
that up so it's not as simple as you know highlighting winds free or that the sun's for

439
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:46,650
free what about the question aren't we one of the world's biggest producers of gas um yeah and

440
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:50,910
we pay extraordinarily amount more than the people that we

441
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:58,190
send our gas to is that is that a is that a fair um fair comment from time to time um

442
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:04,210
the commodity and commodity markets go up commodity markets come down there's been a lot of talk about

443
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:10,630
um uh russia invading uh the ukraine and then sanctions on russian gas and and there's no doubt

444
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:17,390
the cost of gas went from um around about call it eight to ten dollars in in the international

445
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:24,250
market and it got as high as um three hundred dollars um it's back down it's come way back

446
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:29,250
down now uh in any event the australian government intervened and put a cap on the

447
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:36,910
cost of gas um here in australia a domestic cap and so we've seen that impact through the market

448
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:44,109
the one thing i would say even the most ambitious plans about transitioning to renewables and closing

449
00:31:44,109 --> 00:31:53,009
coal um i'm adamant that that requires gas supply for the next 20 odd years um so uh to to fill in

450
00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:58,049
the gaps when the sun's not shining and the wind's not blowing so that we can close coal so it's what

451
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,109
we'd call a transitional

452
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:05,670
fuel i'm i'm very concerned that by putting a cap price on gas and interfering with the the

453
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:12,150
commodity cycle there is a risk that new gas fields aren't developed and if that happens then

454
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:17,710
we're going to have an exposure down the track in filling in the gaps between the renewables

455
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:21,890
can you paint a picture for us uh jeff and i i know people will be listening because it affects

456
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:26,910
all of us and and we've transferred we've transitioned perfectly to renewable in whatever

457
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,089
date that is uh whatever time frame whatever date that is uh whatever time frame whatever

458
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:34,509
what does our house look like what are what are we you know 30 years time what what's our energy

459
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:39,349
sources look like look some houses are already there luke so it doesn't have to be 30 years time

460
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:44,170
it literally in part is happening today the question is how quickly it can happen in full

461
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:50,230
but uh your average house um where you have a lot of people live in high density housing

462
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:55,109
apartments this won't be the case there but freestanding dwellings um you've got your solar

463
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:58,990
panels on the roof you've got your home battery inside the house

464
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:02,670
every house will have that every house will have that and should you do that now if you've got the

465
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:09,369
means um yes short answer is yes if you can afford and there are some really attractive government

466
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:16,349
subsidies out there if you can afford to put a solar panel on your roof step one um battery is a

467
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:20,029
little less commercial but it is where we're heading and a lot of households are now putting

468
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:25,170
them in and the cost i was in china looking at battery technology specifically last week the

469
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:29,089
costs are coming down rapidly um so each house will have a

470
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:34,069
solar rooftop it'll have a battery it'll have an electric charger for the car or cars

471
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:41,349
um that you drive there will be um so for instance if you're fortunate enough to own a holiday house

472
00:33:41,349 --> 00:33:46,109
you'll be able to trade you won't be using the energy at home so once you fill up your battery

473
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:53,170
trade your imbalances on the market a bit like um you know people with share trading or or um

474
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:57,650
you put your excess back into the grid they tell me that is an incredibly complex

475
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:04,109
gateway through now and it's been made so hard by the energy companies that it's almost impossible

476
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:09,670
to decipher is that is that a fair statement again no no it's not um energy companies are

477
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:16,650
trying to crack that nut quite frankly so for instance we're working um at alinta on software

478
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:22,030
package that we can provide to customers to add value to do exactly that we just don't have the

479
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:28,289
technology to this point and i know the world gets impatient we're all impatient things are moving so

480
00:34:28,289 --> 00:34:29,090
rapidly our

481
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:35,889
first step was to build a digital billing platform and house a digital warehouse so that we can use

482
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:41,309
the information real time the the australian energy market trades in five minute intervals

483
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:45,949
it's the most volatile commodity market anywhere in the world that goes on behind the scenes

484
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:52,570
so having access to an aggregate of a million customers that are willing to become your

485
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:57,269
supplier is enormously valuable so there's commercial drivers for us to want to do it

486
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:59,090
um the fact is we're trying to build a digital billing platform and we're trying to build a digital

487
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:02,710
billing platform and we're just not quite there yet but it is happening yeah i love the idea of

488
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:06,889
being able to you know even donate it to your neighbor or can you get to that point where

489
00:35:06,889 --> 00:35:12,030
you absolutely got excess storage it's it's something you need to use and you can put back

490
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:16,170
in obviously commercial outcomes make sense as well but is that what's going to happen in the

491
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:22,110
future yes yeah precisely so if you want to be philanthropic um and you want to donate your

492
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:27,590
energy to somebody else we'll absolutely be able to facilitate that safe nuclear an option

493
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:34,429
um look it's an interesting question i get asked this question by our board in fact

494
00:35:34,429 --> 00:35:40,949
we're looking at um down the track options around nuclear do i think it will happen personally

495
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:49,469
anytime soon um not no i don't i think there's a a big political hurdle there is um perceptions by

496
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:54,829
the australian community they've seen what happened at five mile island or three mile island

497
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:58,949
what happened at fukushima you know so that that imagery the technology

498
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:04,530
improved though hasn't it jeff enormously and the capacity to do that so with no emissions

499
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:11,650
cheap energy i mean it has to be a part of it it's not my space but you know logically you put

500
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:16,150
your brain to that anything if you can guarantee safety it's got to be part of the conversation

501
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:21,489
isn't it i think it has a really important role to play luke um personally so do i think it will

502
00:36:21,489 --> 00:36:26,309
happen could it have a really important role to play yes so you remember earlier when we were

503
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,090
talking about the difference between australia and australia

504
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:35,030
overseas i mentioned nuclear and um to have an element of baseload that's not to say you need

505
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:41,269
to do get all of your power from nuclear but to have that that baseload underlying and supporting

506
00:36:41,269 --> 00:36:47,250
the renewables would be a wonderful thing it's expensive but so are the alternatives i love this

507
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:52,989
quote i read from you um i don't fear not having material things because i grew up without them

508
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:58,130
whilst they're nice to have that's not what brings you happiness what's the retribution for me

509
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:58,869
speaking out

510
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:04,789
someone takes the toys away okay so be it life goes on i feel like jeff you've got a great

511
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:10,469
perspective on that because not many people understand you know that you can be happy uh

512
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:15,349
in both scenario life has been um you know pretty good to you i'm assuming and had some great

513
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:18,949
financial success but you're pretty comfortable either way is that is that the life lesson

514
00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:25,530
it is um you know money doesn't bring happiness happiness is it's almost a choice we you know we

515
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:29,030
choose our attitude every day and you can either be a

516
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:34,730
glass half empty or a glass half full person i'm definitely the half full um i always see

517
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:41,010
you know the positive aspect of of what's possible um and and again you know the only

518
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:47,630
person responsible ultimately for my happiness is me and i've got to choose that and um you know

519
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:52,050
the reality is that when they're putting you underground luke you're not worried about how

520
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:57,650
many ferraris are parked up in the car park outside it's the people inside you know that

521
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,829
that are there mourning your

522
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:04,429
your departure it's about the quality of relationships that you have in your life that

523
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:09,250
that matters yeah beautifully said and it's a great unique perspective you've got can we trust

524
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:17,849
humans to not cut down the last tree jeff we have to luke um and you know i for one again i just

525
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:22,170
told you i'm a glass half full kind of guy and i i look at all the great things that are happening

526
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:26,969
and you know there'll be many people out there that say we're not transitioning quickly enough

527
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:29,010
but i could go back 30 years

528
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:34,329
and say who would have envisaged today that we'd be driving around in electric vehicles that we can

529
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:42,230
charge at home that are powered by a panel on the roof of the house not from coal not from gas um

530
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:47,789
so you know i've got the confidence that the technology will keep evolving on you know look

531
00:38:47,789 --> 00:38:53,070
at look at when you first started using a mobile phone and and what capability it had and how big

532
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:58,409
it was you know the old bricks and you know the device that that we all live with today energy's

533
00:38:58,409 --> 00:38:59,090
no different you know we're not going to be driving around in electric vehicles that we can

534
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:05,889
and you know it's been taken on as a as a huge challenge um by society not just here in australia

535
00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:12,989
we're seeing great things being done overseas um and i'm confident that the the velocity of that

536
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:17,409
transition will get quicker you know i get annoyed when you go along to a conference and everyone's

537
00:39:17,409 --> 00:39:22,010
patting themselves on the back about what we've done to this point when i'm looking at the

538
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:27,849
challenges ahead and so i'm more interested in focusing on how do we overcome those hurdles you

539
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:29,090
know um how do we overcome those hurdles and i'm more interested in focusing on how do we overcome

540
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:34,590
how do we clear the pathway for the future that that that to me you know that gets me up out of

541
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:41,769
bed every day and keeps me motivated and i know we can do it um will we do it by 2030 i'm not so

542
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:47,090
sure we will will there be consequences of that it it appears there will be so you know i buy into

543
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:53,230
the whole human induced global warming but you can only go as quick as you can go and and again

544
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:58,389
you know there's an old saying does the ends justify the means and we just need to be careful

545
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:06,230
life's full of trade-offs you know and so um my view is we don't want to leave anybody behind

546
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:13,730
and so when i think about the um the energy system it's got to supply people who live in

547
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:20,510
high-rise commission flats right through to the people with their mansions interact um and so

548
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:26,690
uh you know it's an essential service everybody should have access to it and affordability is a

549
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,789
big big issue so is environment

550
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:35,349
and so is security of supply and that's the dilemma because often those three we call it the

551
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:42,070
energy trilemma they're often in in competition with one another we could go all renewable at

552
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:49,710
what cost um we could go no renewables and drive the cost right down that's a fact um now neither

553
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:55,190
of those are the right answers at this point in time so it's about getting things right and getting

554
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:59,090
the transition right so that we end up where we want to and we need to be and we need to be and

555
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:05,269
but we don't leave you know anybody behind very um reasonable and sensible case that you mount and

556
00:41:05,269 --> 00:41:09,530
your story is a great leadership story from those high-rise commission flats to to senior leadership

557
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:15,949
i love uh jeff this is my passion sitting across from you know from the sea oval inter or the

558
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:19,969
captain australian cricket team or people in different spheres and and leadership looks uh

559
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:23,750
different in different settings but we feel like there's some patterns of leadership i want to ask

560
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:28,849
you about some dimensions of leadership we think self-leadership is a a term that really applies to

561
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:36,090
someone else does that resonate with you um it does i mean firstly you know leadership is a great

562
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:41,929
responsibility and not not all people want to be leaders and that's fine there's there's nothing

563
00:41:41,929 --> 00:41:48,050
wrong with that um you know there's a thing about can can leadership be learned is it is it inherent

564
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:52,929
in people i think it's a combination of both um it's like anything you know you might be a

565
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:58,869
a gifted natural afl footballer but if you practice and you refine your skills you'll become

566
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:06,190
an even better afl footballer um and so i think leadership is similar that if firstly you've got

567
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:10,550
to be up for the challenge and it is challenging um you know you not only have to deal with your

568
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:16,670
own emotions but you've got to become a spring for other people's emotions and uh and so that's

569
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:22,710
not a task that anybody should take take lightly um but if you are if you feel so inclined then

570
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:28,349
you know it's really incumbent upon you to be the best leader you possibly can at that point

571
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:34,250
depending on you and we know the impact that it has when someone's in a role like yours there's

572
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:39,690
thousands of people that take their temperature of their day by by how your behavior is isn't it

573
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:44,130
and and when you do that well the the opportunity for impact is enormous and that's the next

574
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:48,650
dimension we really see leaders you're really conscious about how they positively impact

575
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:54,570
others how have you thought about that um in terms of role model i think um you know back

576
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:59,090
back to mum um back to the commission flags back back back to the examples that were

577
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:05,710
set as a kid um to me it's about treating it doesn't matter who you're dealing with um and

578
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:10,929
and i'm sure my employees would say this at alinta whether i'm talking to the cleaner after

579
00:43:10,929 --> 00:43:15,489
hours and i'm back or whether i'm talking to one of my executive directors responsible for a

580
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:20,510
portfolio i treat them exactly the same i'll give them the same respect um i'll take time out to

581
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:26,889
have the conversation if they want to have a conversation um so actually um respecting people

582
00:43:26,889 --> 00:43:29,050
is is first and foremost

583
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:35,369
trying to uh showing empathy and understanding necessarily we all see things differently for a

584
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:41,329
reason um and trying to appreciate other people's perspectives when you're weighing up decisions and

585
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:45,909
what that might mean and importantly having a grasp on what the consequences look like

586
00:43:45,909 --> 00:43:50,610
when you do make decisions so you know back to the old does he ends justify the means

587
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:56,050
um type approach to things and they're not just you know you don't put that lens just over

588
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,869
big big decisions like do we build another

589
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:04,409
farm or a solar plant i mean you put those decisions over quite frankly when you're talking

590
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:08,949
about people and their roles in an organization because whilst it mightn't affect the whole

591
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:14,409
community it affects that person and their family directly and so all decisions matter and you know

592
00:44:14,409 --> 00:44:20,889
i make the point that it doesn't referencing i look at a leader in our contact centers and the

593
00:44:20,889 --> 00:44:26,510
impact they're having on the people that work for them um you know and so their leadership role is

594
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:29,090
equally as important to those people as much as it is for them and so i think it's important to

595
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:34,829
mine is to the broader community and so i feel working with my people to develop them into

596
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:41,550
better leaders um is a really good use of my time yeah beautifully yeah i said uh creating and

597
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:47,750
sharing a vision big part of of any leadership role maybe ask you what what is your vision

598
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:54,389
for alenta and how do you how do you share that with the wider team yeah so um part of being

599
00:44:54,389 --> 00:44:59,090
overseas was a session with the board to talk through our strategic direction and how do you

600
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:06,389
of the company we've had um i guess a consistent strategy for 13 years that sounds boring

601
00:45:06,389 --> 00:45:10,969
but you know if it ain't broke don't fix it what we do is we change the emphasis

602
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:16,630
um around what we're doing depending on the market situation and what our competitors are doing but

603
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:22,929
right now um it wouldn't surprise you for me to say that one of the key strategic pillars we have

604
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:28,829
is investing in renewable energy um and so we've got a program of works that we're calling big

605
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:34,570
and no regrets um and i've talked a little bit about we're building a large-scale hydroelectric

606
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:40,190
power station in new south wales we're building an offshore wind farm here in victoria we're

607
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:47,429
installing solar up in the pilbara we're putting a big battery in in perth in in wa so it's around

608
00:45:47,429 --> 00:45:54,389
how we build and integrate those assets into our existing portfolio at the same time you know we

609
00:45:54,389 --> 00:45:58,630
need to make sure that we continue to provide reliable power out of luoyang

610
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:05,309
which is you know an aging old asset but if that asset's not in the market we know it's going to

611
00:46:05,309 --> 00:46:10,250
cause issues with pricing and stability so that's sort of you know we've got a we've got to run a

612
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:15,909
business and grow a whole new business um simultaneously and that's our challenge we see

613
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:20,750
ladies are really curious and curiosity is a is a word that's common and through that curiosity

614
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:26,309
is how a lot of ladies approach their their own learning does that resonate with you um yeah

615
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:29,090
absolutely i mean you you know there are people you know that are really interested in the

616
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:29,150
business and they're really interested in the business and they're really interested in the

617
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:36,070
look to i've got um my mentor is is my old boss um michael fraser he's the chairman of the

618
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:43,469
australian pipeline association um and uh michael taught me a lot of things uh valuable lessons

619
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:48,690
along the way i was you know impatient and he taught me the value of time um one of the best

620
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:55,809
lessons i ever learned and you know craig mccray with i'm a magpie supporter and craig uh has

621
00:46:55,809 --> 00:46:59,090
instilled this concept in the collingwood team that we play with and we play with the

622
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:04,670
minutes i we play right to the end and we've all seen the consequence of that you know they've won

623
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:10,130
games you just didn't expect them to win we've steamrolled at the end and you know things are

624
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:15,690
never over until they're over and um you know so hang in there and keep going and keep trying

625
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:22,130
there's a lesson i learned um and and trying to instill that in people don't lose faith if you've

626
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:27,710
got a vision follow it through stick to it you know if you fail did you really fail was it a

627
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,090
learning experience what can you apply to and and and and and and and and and and and and and and

628
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:34,050
let's go again sort of mentality i think it's really important what when you say the lesson

629
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:40,010
of time what what do you mean by that there's there's you know i've got a trading background so

630
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:47,369
if you want to value a commodity option a put or a call option one of the um big parts that

631
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:53,550
that lead to the valuation of that derivative product is time because um the more time you

632
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:57,989
have the more things can can go in different directions the more things can change obviously

633
00:47:57,989 --> 00:47:59,090
as you get closer to the end of the game the more things can change the more things can change

634
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:04,389
to you know an event occurring less things will move around so the value of that option

635
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:09,610
you think about it in terms of financial derivatives diminishes over time but it

636
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:15,070
still has a value until it no longer until that event occurs and i see business as being

637
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:22,349
no different to that um uh the example i was giving was um i was living in new south wales

638
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:27,750
and my wife wanted to move back to victoria she was victorian her family structure and

639
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,050
whatnot was in victoria

640
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:36,889
and so i went into my boss to resign and he asked me to give him six months notice and he said look

641
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:42,289
i'm going to put your resignation in the bottom drawer um a lot of things can happen in six months

642
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:48,289
jeff and so it turns out he was working behind the scenes i ended up moving back to victoria

643
00:48:48,289 --> 00:48:56,369
in a role with that company uh and uh we started up power generation from scratch it agl is by far

644
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:59,090
the largest power generator in australia and we started with nothing

645
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:07,269
myself and an ea um and so you know had i have not spent that six months and invested that time

646
00:49:07,269 --> 00:49:12,550
i would have been off on a different on a different trajectory in life but uh you know he convinced me

647
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:18,329
that if i could be patient and use that time wisely good things would happen and they did

648
00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:24,570
communicating with clarity big part of most leadership roles in a big role like yours how

649
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:28,949
do you do that keep it simple i mean we we're very fortunate as leaders today

650
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:37,190
the advancement in technology that we have so the means to communicate um visuals uh use a lot of

651
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:43,650
visuals there's an old saying pretend you're talking to um intelligent 12 year olds um that

652
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:48,989
that's not meant to be demeaning to people but the reality is that when when for instance if

653
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:54,710
i'm giving an hour-long presentation you know i've got to focus really what are the three or

654
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:59,090
four things at the end of that hour i want people to remember and make sure that you're

655
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:04,349
you're clear about that you talk about it um you tell them you're going to tell them about it then

656
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:09,550
you tell them about it and then you tell them what you've told them effectively and like i said you

657
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:15,730
look we've had the same strategy for 13 years our people get it now um and and that's the value of

658
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:20,949
consistency now like i said we'll play around with the execution of that strategy and the emphasis

659
00:50:20,949 --> 00:50:27,389
within the strategy of what we're doing at a point in time but um we always need to be um true to

660
00:50:27,389 --> 00:50:29,090
ourselves and what it is that we're doing at a point in time and we're doing it at a point in

661
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:33,409
time and we're trying to do because it's at that level that our people understand what we are

662
00:50:33,409 --> 00:50:40,329
trying to do how important has collaboration been in your world um uh look you you won't get

663
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:46,050
anywhere without collaboration um so whether that's uh you know collaboration with government

664
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:51,590
collaboration with your own workforce um collaboration quite frankly from a whole

665
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:57,610
of industry perspective with our peers and what we do there um yeah it's it sits at the heart of

666
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:05,670
who's been the greatest leader in your life my mum thought you might uh say that no hesitation

667
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:14,250
none at all none at all i look i you know i guess uh one of my favorite leaders um and i'm sure you

668
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:20,710
wouldn't have heard this before is john singleton um you know i regard john as a friend i like the

669
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:26,070
fact that he's a bit of a knockabout larrikin uh i really admire what he's been able to achieve

670
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:29,090
with his life we share a lot of common interests um and we've had a lot of great conversations with

671
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:34,409
um passionate horse racing man as well correct yeah yeah absolutely but uh you know i was i was

672
00:51:34,409 --> 00:51:40,369
once told by somebody um when i was at agl that hey look you're a bright lad you've got a bright

673
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:44,889
future i know you've got an interest in the ponies uh you might want to leave that behind

674
00:51:44,889 --> 00:51:52,989
if you want to be successful and for me that was like no no no no um then i wouldn't be me um and

675
00:51:52,989 --> 00:51:58,949
that's what i love about a guy like john john's john and john's been terribly successful so the

676
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:04,050
world you know has bent to john rather than john bending to the world and i really admire that

677
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:09,369
there are people who've made a lot more money than john um and done a lot of other things uh

678
00:52:09,369 --> 00:52:14,949
and i admire that as well but you know john one thing you get unashamedly himself uh john

679
00:52:14,949 --> 00:52:21,309
singleton and the the lovable australian larrikin is almost sort of a dying uh uh art these days

680
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:25,949
isn't it probably cancel culture might have got john if he was uh born a little later in life and

681
00:52:25,949 --> 00:52:29,090
i can say that about you you know authentically yourself and unashamedly yourself and i think

682
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:32,829
it's a great life lesson isn't it because it's hard work trying to be someone else isn't it i

683
00:52:32,829 --> 00:52:37,409
would think it would tell you and you know you'd rip you up inside you can't pretend to be somebody

684
00:52:37,409 --> 00:52:43,630
you're not um yeah a lot of people do we're in the work we're doing in our leisure space we

685
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:49,409
sort of see collaboration now as being a bit of a superpower and your uh you know evolving world

686
00:52:49,409 --> 00:52:53,289
has there been anyone looked at and thought god if we could collaborate with that particular

687
00:52:53,289 --> 00:52:59,090
person or that and that would go a long way to solve uh some of the the challenges that

688
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:04,469
you face is there any other springs to mind oh look i think um if i had one sort of desire would

689
00:53:04,469 --> 00:53:11,230
would be to see collaboration on a global scale so i'm talking about politics unfortunately now

690
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:18,309
um and we kind of let east and west get in the way of one another i mean i'll go out on a big

691
00:53:18,309 --> 00:53:24,190
limb here but i i don't think the u.s is going to invade china anytime soon and i certainly don't

692
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:28,989
think china is going to invade the u.s or for that matter australia um you know

693
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:35,369
and so i wonder about how much money gets spent on things like submarines and defense and and

694
00:53:35,369 --> 00:53:42,170
whatnot and you know whether we not be better investing that 360 billion dollars in the energy

695
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:47,989
revolution that needs to take place you know rather than protecting our borders let's all

696
00:53:47,989 --> 00:53:52,690
work together and save the planet if you want the ultimate collaboration that's it it's a brilliant

697
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:57,829
answer jeff isn't it and when you actually stop and look back and think how crazy it is that we

698
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:04,909
have our own nationalistic uh views and as you said the defense budgets uh you put that at money

699
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:12,610
as you just described we solve that 2030 becomes absolutely on the cards doesn't it it's um and i

700
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:17,610
think that's part of the you know challenge isn't it you you see people getting more divided

701
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:22,929
algorithms on our phones send us more of what we think you know jeff dimmer is the you know the

702
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:27,329
the evil coal baron rather than actually sitting down listening to you know it's why i love this

703
00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:29,090
forum because you make up your own mind you know you're not going to be able to do anything about it

704
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:35,010
but at least you've heard jeff's side of uh of why it makes sense it's it seems a lost art i hope

705
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:38,710
we can get it back is that that sense of global collaboration on some things that we should all

706
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:42,550
agree on which is we've all we all live on the one planet we should all want to take care of it

707
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:46,550
shouldn't we you would hope so great to catch up with you all right luke my pleasure thank you
