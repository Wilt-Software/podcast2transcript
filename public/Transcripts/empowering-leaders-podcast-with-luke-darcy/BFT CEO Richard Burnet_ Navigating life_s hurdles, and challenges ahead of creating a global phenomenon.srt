00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,460
see it in the future and so i feel really privileged that you've taken the time to do it

42
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,759
today thanks dust great to be here if i could rich and i know this is uh and i found it emotional

43
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,979
actually just doing the research again but i can't begin to imagine what you and danielle have been

44
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:22,479
through losing your two boys can you put into context just how rare a condition it was that

45
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:29,840
sebastian and charlie had and and how did you find a way to cope it's rare um and yeah the two

46
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,080
two parts to that question obviously the the

47
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:40,199
and the the heartache that came with um the tragedy that it was and then also the coping

48
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:45,620
bit so yeah i guess i'll start with sort of how rare it is just to put in context it it was um

49
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:52,939
no one in australia at the time um had exposure to it i think there might have been a a couple

50
00:03:52,939 --> 00:04:00,919
kids um who died of the the disease in the the 80s or 90s um but it we were told they were

51
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,280
somewhere around the 41st or something like that and i think that's where it came from and i think

52
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,120
we understand the circumstances and so it's it's such a huge it's such a big thing that's

53
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,280
happening and one of the um companies that we've been working with are um uh so we've been working

54
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,099
with blue sky and it's a really big uh it's a big one and instead of having government

55
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:17,560
beans to provide Jewish women with um mental health benefits to women and making sure that

56
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,939
uh and Видal was living with us um nursing women you know and if there was a lot of い

57
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:28,360
and by just like the cold out the country which um it there's there's lots of a lot of

58
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,639
of i saw it for a while and i think they're really exciting with it at the same time as well

59
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,019
said it to us when when the boys were diagnosed was that if there was four mcgs full of women and i

60
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:31,199
i had the choice to to marry one of them um it's literally those odds so one in 400 men and the other

61
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,879
one in 400,000 chance that you're going to sit next to or marry the wrong one, in inverted

62
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,319
commas.

63
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:46,939
And then from that, you've still, because it's a recessive disease, you've still only

64
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:54,459
got a one in four chance every time you have a baby that that baby will have the disease.

65
00:04:54,459 --> 00:05:01,339
So three in four times, you won't actually even know that you've had the disease in your

66
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:01,660
family.

67
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:06,379
And Danielle and I certainly didn't know, and we're both what's called unaffected carriers.

68
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,100
So that gets the 400,000, obviously, times the four, the one in four chance to get you

69
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,420
up to the one in a one and a half million chance kind of thing.

70
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:24,139
So yeah, incredibly rare disease and yeah, very, very sad and still.

71
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,019
Still, still hurts to be honest.

72
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,160
And you find out with Sebastian, you had some concerns when he was 12 months of age that

73
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,699
he was falling over a lot.

74
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:38,259
Danielle's pregnant with Charlie and, and, you know, you want to try and protect your

75
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:43,439
concerns while she's pregnant and then you find out, then you have to sit there and wait

76
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,439
the one in four chance on Charlie.

77
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,579
I can't even begin to imagine that day of when you sat down in the doctor's clinic again.

78
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,040
Yeah, that was, that was a tough one because.

79
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:58,300
Sebastian was, you know, we're over in New York, born in New York.

80
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,779
He was, you know, the dream baby.

81
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,279
We thought, you know, a little US citizen growing up and all this sort of exciting stuff

82
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:10,279
for his future and to see him sort of degenerate after about 12 months or so was hard.

83
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,379
But the signs were there because we saw him, he was able to walk a little bit, but then

84
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:17,199
he just kept on falling over and falling over.

85
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,819
He was never really able to talk at all.

86
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:24,339
He said data once or twice, which is one of the happiest moments ever in my life.

87
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:29,240
To hear him say those words, they were the only words he ever spoke, but the decline

88
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,839
was there.

89
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,439
So we had a lot of the testing with him and, and saw that there was something wrong.

90
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:39,579
So when he was diagnosed, of course, to hear the words that it was terminal and that he,

91
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,779
you know, he wouldn't live very long were absolutely heartbreaking.

92
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:50,139
We had Charlie sitting there and he was this bright, bubbly little baby that was only a

93
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:53,399
few months old, but just so alert, so active, so alive.

94
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,399
And so to your point.

95
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:01,300
We thought, well, even though we got them both tested, once we heard Sebastian's result,

96
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,680
we just couldn't bring ourselves to asking the question whether Charlie was affected

97
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,000
or not, but had in our mind that he wouldn't be because he was just so alert, so bubbly

98
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,319
and, you know, rolling around on the floor, just so confident.

99
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,240
We thought there's no way he's got the disease because it looked very different from Sebastian

100
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,259
who was a lot slower in some of his sort of skill development.

101
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:28,040
Um, so yeah, eventually once four months after three or four months after we found out

102
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,439
about Sebastian, we, we, um, got the, got the nerve to, to find out, um, from the doctors

103
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:39,620
what position Charlie was and, and that you're right to ask if there was one moment in our

104
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,000
lives where we sort of literally felt that the end of the earth was going to happen.

105
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,319
It was then when we were back in the Royal Children's back in the same damn room with

106
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,000
the doctor who said, you're not going to believe this.

107
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,240
But.

108
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:58,519
But Charlie's also got the disease and, um, he sent the bloods to Adelaide three or four

109
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,379
times and yelled at them over the phone to double, triple check it because he could not

110
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:06,980
believe that it could happen to us twice given that the odds of it all.

111
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,920
So that was just this kick in the guts like I've never had in my life before.

112
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,360
And we just thought, you know, it was hard not to think then there's nothing worse that

113
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,620
could happen in your life.

114
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:20,579
And the doctor was in tears himself.

115
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,040
Yeah.

116
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:21,540
Yeah.

117
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,220
The doctor was.

118
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,920
The nurse was incredibly upset that the nurse was there upset.

119
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:36,139
We were just in absolute, uh, absolute disbelief and, um, couldn't, couldn't fathom how this

120
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:36,940
had happened to us.

121
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:43,740
And it's a, when I say us, it's not a well with me thing, but this whole space of the

122
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,820
boys being sick and having a disability from birth and eventually, um, passing away at

123
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,899
Charlie two years ago, actually.

124
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:57,539
Um, the other day was his, his second anniversary of his passing and Sebastian a couple of years

125
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:06,419
before that, but that, that whole notion of growing up with a disability for me had

126
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:10,620
been so foreign because I hadn't been exposed to it in, in my lifetime.

127
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,279
We didn't have family or close friends with kids with disabilities.

128
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:21,379
And I thought it was, I always thought it was something that was, I don't want to say

129
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:30,620
shameful, but something that was, um, wrong, innately wrong with, um, uh, someone's makeup

130
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,820
or, or the way they, they were.

131
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:36,940
And it was almost like it was avoidable to some degree.

132
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:45,879
And, and that's how naive I was around just that the fact that nearly all disabilities

133
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:51,039
are completely due to luck, completely random, completely genetic.

134
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:53,620
Um, through no fault of anyone's.

135
00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:02,080
And, um, some people, you know, get a hand that's, uh, drawn with, uh, that the news

136
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:08,059
that, that we had that you, you just, and now all of a sudden living a life that was

137
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:14,259
completely unexpected and your, your dreams and hopes of a shattered, but, and the upside

138
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:16,919
you think, well, this is so rare.

139
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,259
This is so heartbreaking.

140
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:20,580
Um.

141
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:23,659
Well, how is it going to be for the boys?

142
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:28,879
And then you turn it around into, well, how lucky are we that we have the chance to give

143
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:37,559
these boys such a, an awesome, precious life, um, and, and maybe, you know, God's been the

144
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:45,039
one who's actually been smiling on us saying that, um, you know, I, I trust you guys to,

145
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,620
to look after these boys, um, and that you are going to give them the best life they

146
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,620
can.

147
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,620
Yeah.

148
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,620
That's a great perspective, Rich.

149
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,500
And, uh, yeah, as I said, I, I'm, I'm sure I couldn't have coped, I just can't imagine,

150
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
uh, doing that.

151
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,379
A, a beautiful part of the story is that you and Danielle choose through IVF, you can skip

152
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:08,019
that gene, and, um, you got two beautiful kids, uh, Christian and, and Taylor, and for

153
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:11,679
both of them, they then live through that experience too.

154
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,840
How has that shaped them, do you think?

155
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,580
Yeah, well, so much of what we went through comes down to, well, okay, if that's going

156
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,700
to happen, the boys are going to pass away.

157
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,500
What, what happens?

158
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,340
what hope have you got?

159
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,820
And you're right, so lucky to have IVF.

160
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,279
You know, just cheesy for IVF.

161
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,279
Some people have knocked it in the past.

162
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:35,240
I remember when IVF, there used to be decades ago so many negative comments about it

163
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,960
and it is an absolute godsend for thousands and thousands and thousands of people

164
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,220
every single month in Australia and around the world.

165
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,100
And for us, we were incredibly lucky to be able to use modern medicine to screen out the disease,

166
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,879
to have Taylor and Christian, and that provided hope.

167
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,340
That's essentially what it did for our family.

168
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:03,100
It was like, well, are we going to sit here and get through this focusing on only Sebastian and Charlie

169
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:10,580
or are we going to bring other life into the family and try to have hope that this is going to be

170
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:17,500
somewhat normal in a weird way, but also a completely unique experience to have our kids

171
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,779
who've lost two older brothers, who have seen that disabilities aren't scary,

172
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,500
which is what I originally thought.

173
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,480
You know, they're not frightening.

174
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,179
They're something that's incredibly special.

175
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,519
And for them to have the soft hearts that they've got now and the resilience that they've got

176
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,899
and the empathy towards kids is just amazing.

177
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:43,759
And I'll never forget Christian and Taylor first seeing their main school,

178
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:46,799
their mainstream school that they were going to in primary schools.

179
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:47,399
And they were...

180
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,580
I'm amazed that there weren't all these wheelchairs going around everywhere

181
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,639
because the only schools they'd seen ever were Sebastian and Charlie's schools

182
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,700
that we used to send them to where there were wheelchairs and disability stuff.

183
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,919
And, you know, then they saw these mainstream schools and that was rare for them.

184
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:07,799
So their norm was kids with disabilities and they're so comfortable in that space,

185
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,860
which is, you know, shame on me.

186
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,779
I never was because I never had that opportunity.

187
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,740
Yeah, it's incredible, wasn't it?

188
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:17,379
Do you feel like Sebastian and Charlie live on in a lot of ways?

189
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,000
Do you feel like Sebastian and Charlie live on in a lot of ways through Taylor and Christian?

190
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,399
Is that a sense you've got or...?

191
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:21,940
Yeah, absolutely.

192
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:27,460
We worried us, to be honest, that especially Christian will forget Sebastian

193
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,659
because he was young when Sebastian passed away.

194
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:31,600
He remembers Charlie.

195
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,139
It was Charlie's, as I said, he's passing only a couple of days ago, the anniversary,

196
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:43,679
and we all sat around and watched some video and some photos on the TV at home together

197
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:46,460
and with some music in the background and had a good cry.

198
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,379
Just for the kids to see them in the photos with the boys

199
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:52,820
and to remember how special they were,

200
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,580
I think we need to continue to do that to remind them

201
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:01,419
before they get swept up in the everyday sort of living.

202
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:08,519
But there's unquestionably traits in both kids that we know are solely and utterly

203
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,919
due to our boys and the legacy that they've left.

204
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:15,759
And hopefully people see that in Danielle and I as well,

205
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,379
you know, that we've changed.

206
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,139
And that the type of people we are is different because of the experience we've had.

207
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:26,200
Yeah, and in what way, Rich, do you feel like you and Danielle have changed?

208
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:35,360
I think, for a start, empathy and understanding of people and where they're from.

209
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:41,980
And, you know, mate, so often we used to think, well, geez, this is shocking for us.

210
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,460
But we would remind ourselves that there are people in a lot worse situations.

211
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:46,840
And...

212
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,159
So that's number one, that there are people out there.

213
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,080
No matter how bad we thought we had it, a lot of people have it a lot worse.

214
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,940
You know, they might lose kids without having the chance to say goodbye.

215
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:58,440
You know, we had 12 years for both of them to say goodbye

216
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,379
and to be prepared for the fact that they would pass away.

217
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,320
Some people don't have that chance.

218
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,480
And so there's empathy.

219
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:12,600
There's, I think, just an appreciation of living every day

220
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,220
and making those days special and loving.

221
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,600
Your kids, like there is no tomorrow, because you just don't get that opportunity.

222
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:23,519
You know, kids grow up.

223
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,799
Your kids are growing up and they're moving out now.

224
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,299
And I've still got some time with Taylor and Christian.

225
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:34,399
But to have that acknowledgement of family and the importance of family

226
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,840
and how special family is, is another way that I think we've changed.

227
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,179
And, yeah, work's important.

228
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,500
But to get that balance is so cliched but so hard to do.

229
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,019
But it's...

230
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,299
It's absolutely the right thing to do and you've just got to do it.

231
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,740
And I love seeing dads from the local primary school now

232
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,460
just be so present and so involved in their kids' lives.

233
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:59,559
And 10 years ago, you know, you wouldn't even see that.

234
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,980
You wouldn't see dads rock up to kids swimming, you know,

235
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,320
into school swimming meets at 12 o'clock on a Wednesday afternoon.

236
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,940
There's no way.

237
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,679
But now you rock up and half of them are dads.

238
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:10,379
It's just brilliant.

239
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:15,299
So to instill that on and shake up a lot of my mates who are workaholics

240
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:18,399
who took a bit of a...

241
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,059
had a bit of a check there and adjusted their life was pretty cool as well.

242
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,779
Someone said to me the other day that by the time your child, you know,

243
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:30,759
turns 18 and becomes an adult, you've spent 93% of the time

244
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:34,120
that you're going to spend with them on average for the rest of their life

245
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,759
just by the nature of how intense the first 18 years are

246
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,320
and they move out of home.

247
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,259
And it's...

248
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:41,759
I don't know how accurate that is but it's pretty profound

249
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,779
when you think about it.

250
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,779
And to your point, you experienced that in the most...

251
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,220
intense way.

252
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,799
But it's a reminder, isn't it, to all of us

253
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:52,100
that you get that chance in that period of time.

254
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,960
You don't want to waste it.

255
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,799
Richard, I want to move on.

256
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,179
Life has to continue even when you've got, you know,

257
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,120
Sebastian and Charlie and all of the challenges

258
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,059
and the joy and everything in the mix.

259
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,059
But you're working really successfully in the corporate space

260
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,640
and you had senior high-profile roles in the AFL industry

261
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,480
and the golf industry, as I said in the introduction.

262
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,500
You transition away from that.

263
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:15,859
What was...

264
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:19,059
What was the motivation to want to head down the entrepreneurial path?

265
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:22,480
I think it was a slow adjustment.

266
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,519
It started with the realisation when I was at BP

267
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:28,500
when we were living in New York

268
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,740
that I wanted to get into that fitness space and sports space.

269
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,319
So that was one big change for me, 12 years, big corporate BP

270
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,220
to, you know, Golf Australia and the Essendon Footy Club

271
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,240
and the Giants where you've got, you know, not 100,000 staff

272
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,500
but literally...

273
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:46,500
literally 100.

274
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,640
From those roles, that cemented for me that the jobs

275
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,539
that I wanted to have for the rest of my life

276
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,920
were where not only was I passionate about the people

277
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,319
because I loved the people at BP

278
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,740
and the development opportunities that I had there

279
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,299
and the responsibilities that I was given as a graduate trainee

280
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:07,200
in the early days right through New York

281
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,779
were something that I'll never forget.

282
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,319
But I also wanted to be passionate about the product

283
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,119
and not just the company and the people.

284
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:19,339
And that's where the AFL kicked in

285
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:22,859
because I was incredibly passionate about footy, obviously, and golf.

286
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,579
And then there was a time to say,

287
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,960
OK, well, love the product, love the passion and the people

288
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,240
but can I actually be kind of really selfish

289
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:41,559
and think how can I enjoy that but doing it on my own

290
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:45,460
which I'd never been open to

291
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:45,859
because...

292
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:45,900
because...

293
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,000
because...

294
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:49,039
because, you know, Dad was in corporate all of his life

295
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,859
and I'd never really been exposed to sort of small businesses

296
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:55,259
or people breaking out and doing their own thing too much

297
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,539
and that was very foreign to me.

298
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,319
But I thought, well, if I start small

299
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:01,240
and had a couple of side hustles

300
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,960
where I had a couple of my own little businesses

301
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,539
saw how that went

302
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:08,500
and thought, you know what, I can actually do this.

303
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,579
So that was transitioning from the Giants

304
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:15,140
where I was doing a sort of Tuesday to Thursday commute

305
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:20,259
which was always only going to be a short-term role for me

306
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,420
given everything from family situation

307
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,799
just to, you know, travel

308
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,700
and you don't want to be away from your family

309
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,240
obviously more than a couple of days a week

310
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,119
if you can help it

311
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:34,019
to, OK, how can I come back to Melbourne

312
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:37,359
grab a job equally as passionate

313
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:39,240
but working for myself.

314
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,819
So I started exploring the fitness landscape

315
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:45,019
and a few weird things happened

316
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:48,099
to fast-track that

317
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:50,839
but one of them was just meeting a couple of people

318
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,940
Tim Schlager, a good mate of ours

319
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,299
who gave me some fantastic advice on gym ownership

320
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:56,539
and 24-7 gyms

321
00:19:56,539 --> 00:19:59,779
which was all the rage then in sort of 2016, 2017

322
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:03,299
so I did a lot of research into that model

323
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:08,259
and then happened to be bumped into Jake Williams

324
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:11,559
now a guy I'll always be thankful for

325
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,099
who gave me the advice to say

326
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:14,799
you should look into this brand

327
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,000
called...

328
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:15,599
called F45

329
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:17,019
because they're going great guns

330
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:18,599
I was literally on a plane with him

331
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,460
and he was telling me that

332
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,119
about his involvement with them

333
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,579
and so that was a different model of fitness gyms

334
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:27,339
that was exploding in Australia

335
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:30,740
and heading globally as well

336
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,200
so I spent some time looking at that model

337
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,660
and the whole boutique sort of fitness sector as well

338
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,059
and pretty soon

339
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:44,500
that opened the door for me to think

340
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:44,799
well, you know, I'm going to do this

341
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,859
then I started to think

342
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:49,519
well, F45 might be a really smart play

343
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:51,720
unfortunately though

344
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,319
the Australian landscape was pretty much sold out

345
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,839
of franchises

346
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:01,220
they'd sold out most of Australia

347
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,380
and a lot of people already

348
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,039
Australians were already looking overseas

349
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,700
and the US was starting to sell out

350
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,700
all the big kind of obvious capital cities

351
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,660
were selling out

352
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,500
fortuitously given we'd lived over there

353
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,859
I knew a bit about the landscape and started researching areas that might not have been

354
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:27,180
sold out with F45 and Seattle was one of those that really sparked my interest just because

355
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:35,460
it was demographically the right fit, very affluent, crap, crap weather so people want

356
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:41,220
to train indoors a lot but then when they are in summer they want to be looking good

357
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,980
because they've only got a few months of summer to really enjoy it and some amazing

358
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:52,660
corporate facilities there with Amazon and tech companies which meant that there was

359
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:59,099
this explosion of the right target market so I really explored opportunities in Seattle

360
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:06,420
with Danielle, we flew over and had a look around and joined up with a couple of Jake's

361
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:11,019
mates as well as Hamish McLaughlin, a good mate of both of ours.

362
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,900
And Haim was instrumental when I was at the Giants to say, hey Rich, whatever you're doing

363
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,019
going forward, let's do it together.

364
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:23,640
I really believe in what you can do and I want to back you in whatever you're doing.

365
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:29,119
If it suits, let's work together which gave me an enormous confidence boost because you

366
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:31,119
know how smart Haim is.

367
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:32,599
Full of passion.

368
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:33,680
Full of passion, yeah.

369
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,200
It's a nice backing, isn't it?

370
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,880
I didn't know that part of the story and whatever you're in, I'm happy to be in your corner.

371
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,740
What a great vote of confidence and that's why I love hearing these stories, isn't it?

372
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:51,279
A lot of Australians have only seen America as New York, Los Angeles, maybe San Francisco

373
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:56,480
they're branched out but a lot of us and I include me would never have been to a town

374
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,519
like Seattle so these things don't happen by accident.

375
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,420
You were fully researched based, you were really doing your homework and really drilling

376
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:08,680
in and so you look at a town like Seattle with the University of Washington and all

377
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,200
of the demographics fitting right.

378
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,920
So you're prepared to open multiple of these sites, how disappointing was that one?

379
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:22,720
Yeah, that was tough and I won't go into it too much other than to say when our reservation

380
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,900
for 10 territories, five in Seattle, five in LA had the main reservation we had for

381
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:35,119
Seattle where we were ready to put a lease down on a property and pretty excited about

382
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,859
it when that fell through and was taken away from us.

383
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:41,059
We decided and I was the driving force.

384
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:46,839
So it's mainly maybe an I rather than a we but the group of us decided that the values

385
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:53,140
that we had didn't necessarily sit well with what we're on offer and that we didn't really

386
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:58,900
want to be part of going forward for the other nine territories just because of the way that

387
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,680
it unfolded.

388
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:08,279
Then we made a call to really stop that opportunity and so that was a lot of effort and research

389
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:11,180
into the boutique fitness model in the US.

390
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,220
So we had a lot of experience including Orange Theory and Barry's Boot Camp and F45 and all

391
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,279
that sort of stuff seemingly wasted.

392
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:24,779
But for the random fact and you kind of mentioned it roughly in your introduction that two weeks

393
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:31,019
prior to getting that email to say that the deal for this particular territory was off,

394
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:38,019
I'd happened literally to walk past in River Street, South Yarra, a studio that was run

395
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:41,200
by Matty Thomas at the time who was an expert.

396
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,319
He was an ex-AFL player.

397
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,180
I poked my head into this thing, the music pumping.

398
00:24:45,339 --> 00:24:50,539
There was this awesome vibe of 36 people going nuts in there and it kind of looked a bit

399
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:56,640
like a CrossFit or an F45 or it had some elements of Orange Theory, had some screens, had some

400
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,140
awesome vibe, great music as I said.

401
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:04,359
But it had this strength equipment as well and some rigs and racks and it looked quite

402
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,859
different and unique in its own right.

403
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:09,220
And I poked my head in and spoke to Matty and said, what's this about?

404
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,059
And he told me what it was.

405
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:17,420
And we'll talk more about Cam and obviously his influence on me and how he shaped BFT,

406
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:18,839
I'm sure.

407
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:24,740
But it turned out it was one of Cam's four at the time test sites, essentially concept

408
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,799
sites that he'd created, this concept that he'd created, this model that he'd started

409
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:37,079
to sort of fill a void between a CrossFit, if you like, which is quite a hardcore, intense

410
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,920
type training program.

411
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,920
But really one of the main families.

412
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,400
The founders of the whole group training movement globally, the void was that at the

413
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:51,099
other end of the spectrum, you had a lot of the group-based cardio classes and we would

414
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:56,059
put your Orange Series and your Barry's Bootcamp and your F45s in that bucket where people

415
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,920
are primarily there to lose weight.

416
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,880
But this had all the strength elements in there as well.

417
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:06,500
So Cam had found this sort of sweet spot between CrossFit and the other boutiques that he was

418
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,200
really trying to exploit and saw a big opportunity for in the market.

419
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,680
So I'd seen that and gone home and told Danielle that there was a pretty cool thing in South

420
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,720
Yarra that looked pretty good.

421
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:24,160
And it was actually Danielle who said to me after the F45 thing didn't eventuate that,

422
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,619
what about that thing you saw in River Street?

423
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,039
Why don't you see more about that?

424
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:34,539
And I thought, you know, that's not a bad idea and called Maddie and then ended up meeting

425
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:35,099
with Cam.

426
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,859
And long story short, within two months, we'd formed a partnership.

427
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,460
And it was incredibly right time, right place for him and for me.

428
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:53,299
Him because he obviously had this concept, knew he wanted to grow it, but obviously didn't

429
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:59,680
have the sales marketing or franchising expertise that was required to grow a brand, but had

430
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,539
this incredibly successful concept and knew he was onto something.

431
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:06,799
And for me, it was right time, right place because I'd done all of this research.

432
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:10,259
I knew that that was something that I wanted to get into, fitness.

433
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:16,460
And when I spoke to Cam, was convinced that although it was a riskier proposition than

434
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:22,799
say getting a 24-7 gym, the upside potentially, if we got it right, was sort of massive.

435
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:27,200
So yeah, the fact that within a couple of months, we formed this partnership and of

436
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,019
course, Haim was involved.

437
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:35,900
So the three of us ended up being shareholders of BFT within just literally a matter of sort

438
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,619
of 60 days.

439
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:39,519
Great sliding doors moment in life, isn't it?

440
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:40,119
It's a remarkable.

441
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:40,559
It's a remarkable story.

442
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:47,380
Cam Falloon, who crossed over, was a high performance expert in the AFL Geelong and

443
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,359
he was the head of high performance of the Bulldogs when I was there and he went to Port

444
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:52,039
Adelaide as well.

445
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:56,500
He's famous for being Princess Di's personal trainer at various stages.

446
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:58,180
And it's fascinating, isn't it?

447
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:04,200
When partnerships come together and you get different skill sets combined, I mean, not

448
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,500
all partnerships work out.

449
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:09,380
For you, we're sitting here now, 600 franchises have been sold.

450
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:16,599
You've sold the US rights for $60 million in recent times and you've got expansion around

451
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:17,000
the globe.

452
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,859
It's incredible trajectories, isn't it?

453
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,000
Does it surprise you to think, God, it's just exploded that partnership?

454
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,460
Have you got a reason?

455
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:27,859
As you explained, it was just the perfect time for the two of you and Haim?

456
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:28,779
It was.

457
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:30,380
It was perfect in that way.

458
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:37,440
And to Cam's credit, there's no way we would have been successful, especially in my ability

459
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,319
to sell the franchises.

460
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,440
If it wasn't for the fact that we'd had these four that Cam had tested, two of them were

461
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,160
brand new, so they were untested, but two had been around for a year or two.

462
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:57,319
So to have that model and that financial rigor to show potential franchisees that these sites

463
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:04,039
actually have done well was one of the main things, obviously, that set us up for this

464
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,079
huge growth.

465
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,900
But it wasn't easy.

466
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:18,140
It took a lot of hard work from September or October 2017 until April 2018 when we first

467
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,380
started selling franchises.

468
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:27,259
Cam and I are there sitting in a pretty cold warehouse over near his house in Spotswood,

469
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:33,619
sitting there basically doing everything from the website to the brand, body fit training,

470
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,660
to franchise contracts, to operations manuals.

471
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:43,619
You know, Cam obviously was heavily involved with everything, but in particular, the programming.

472
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:47,880
As you mentioned, that's his forte, and that's what separates BFT from every other model that

473
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,940
we've got periodized and progressive training programs that actually get results because

474
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,799
they're scientifically backed.

475
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:01,299
They're done personally by Cam or his team now in a way that means that they're so realistic,

476
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:07,680
basically, the opportunity for a weekend warrior to train like you would have Darcy in preseason

477
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,799
with six weeks.

478
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,779
You know, it's a lot of work, but it's a lot of hard work, but it's a lot of hard work.

479
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:16,480
So the programming element was there, and we really mashed all of that up into something

480
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:24,240
that we thought was pretty compelling and then went bang in April of 2018 and started

481
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,640
selling.

482
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:27,920
So yeah, the trajectory was really quick.

483
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:35,700
We sold a lot off the back of the success of the concept sites, I think, of the positioning

484
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,440
of the brand.

485
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,140
But it's not only the brand, it's the people.

486
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:49,299
And yes, they bought into Cam and me, the franchisees, but then they also bought into

487
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:50,920
the team that we quickly established.

488
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:56,660
And, you know, we've got John Glancy, you could not have a better GM of operations anywhere

489
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,960
in the country, an absolute gun.

490
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,480
And gee, Dunlop started with us early, just an incredibly smart, young, switched on person

491
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,420
who, as our marketing and commerce team, we've been able to do a lot of work with.

492
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,480
Tom's manager was able to shape the tone of voice for BFT and the communications around

493
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:10,720
that.

494
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:15,119
And Scotty Nathan, our franchise performance manager, who focused on the growth of the

495
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:20,799
franchisees in particular, making sure they got good numbers on day one so that they were

496
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:26,180
set up for success and they could break even and make money from day one because of the

497
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,680
number of members they had from day one.

498
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:31,680
Those guys were just instrumental in creating this team.

499
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,099
And of course, as we mentioned, Hayme in the background, who has just got an amazing,

500
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:41,880
amazing ability to have a look at anything that's complex and break it down into something

501
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,779
simple and find solutions.

502
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,559
And if he can't find solutions and can't workshop them with you, he'll know who to call to get

503
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,200
those solutions.

504
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,380
So this awesome team, obviously, Cam and I are at the forefront of it.

505
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,140
But yeah, everyone playing their role was just, I think, one of the main things that

506
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:04,119
we were so lucky to have that meant that we had this big sort of trajectory until COVID

507
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:04,680
hit, obviously.

508
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,299
And that was interesting.

509
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,700
It's brilliant, Rich, that you share those names.

510
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,799
I mentioned to you on the way in that something's ringing my ears at the moment around a quote

511
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,480
I read the other day.

512
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,859
Effectively, you don't build something or grow something on your own.

513
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,619
You actually hire great people, collaborate with great people, and then they help you

514
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:23,240
to grow something.

515
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,420
And you're right.

516
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:29,200
You in no way could get scale without the incredible people that have done it behind

517
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,799
the scenes.

518
00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:34,240
And that must be satisfying for you to see the people that you've been able to work with.

519
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:35,180
Yeah, it is.

520
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,259
You're right, Dars, isn't it?

521
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:42,660
People are just so important in your life, and especially people who, if you're striving

522
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:47,660
to achieve something normally in a work setting, if you're not all aligned and don't have the

523
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,400
same vision, then you're never going to get anywhere.

524
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:55,519
And Cam and I were so lucky to have such good quality people around us.

525
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,279
And yeah, we worked our asses off, of course.

526
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:02,200
But there's always luck in every success story.

527
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:04,299
And ours was undoubtedly.

528
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:10,059
The fact that we both came across each other at a random time and both had these complementary

529
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:16,240
skill sets that me with the franchising, marketing, and sales, and Cam with everything else, and

530
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,980
together strategically, we don't do anything strategically without both of us getting across

531
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,140
it.

532
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:23,599
And so that partnership has been brilliant.

533
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,720
Yes, of course, every partnership has its challenges, but Cam and I rarely have a cross

534
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,019
word.

535
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:33,940
And we're always, I think, on the lookout to work with each other and to support each

536
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,180
other.

537
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:39,140
And particularly stay in our lanes where we need to, to get on with delivering an awesome

538
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,579
product.

539
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:45,619
But now we've put in a CEO so that we can focus on the global expansion.

540
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:52,400
And we've got a gun CEO in Dave Aitchison, who is running the ship and focusing on the

541
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,720
250-odd sites that are open in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, to make sure that

542
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:04,259
their performance is consistently strong, as it can be, so that we can look at areas

543
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:07,420
beyond where we're at now to grow.

544
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:12,260
And I want to go back a little bit here, Rich, and I know you'll take no joy in this, but

545
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,260
I'm interested more in the value.

546
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:19,739
You felt like the values weren't aligned when you had the sites ready to go and F45, and

547
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,760
you said, you know what, no matter what, I'm moving on here.

548
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,579
I'm not going to go back because our values aren't aligned.

549
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:29,980
And F45 listed on the US Stock Exchange, it was this huge behemoth that's hit enormous

550
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,219
amount of trouble.

551
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,460
I know you take no joy in that at all.

552
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:33,659
And the franchisees are going to be there.

553
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:33,699
And I'm going to take no joy in that at all.

554
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:33,780
And I'm going to take no joy in that at all.

555
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:33,800
And I'm going to take no joy in that at all.

556
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:33,900
And I'm going to take no joy in that at all.

557
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,500
And the franchisees that have struggled as a result of that, and you want the whole

558
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:43,340
fitness industry to thrive, but you look back, you end up in a legal dispute with F45, which

559
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,480
was sort of contrary to that as well.

560
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,420
It's sort of that overlap's been there, hasn't it?

561
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,960
But do you feel like the values that you guys have brought have been pretty clear and a

562
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,119
part of your success as well?

563
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,320
Yeah, absolutely.

564
00:34:54,699 --> 00:35:01,599
And firstly, I've got to say credit to F45 because they, in so many ways, paved the way

565
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,119
for this model of...

566
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,940
of boutique or group training in Australia.

567
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:13,380
And the model is really, the principle of it is that it's high margin and low volume,

568
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:13,679
right?

569
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:14,579
So it's high margin.

570
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,179
Members are paying sort of 50, 60, 70 plus dollars a week, which is still cheaper than

571
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:24,980
a personal training session, but they're getting sort of as close to personal training as they

572
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,079
can in a group environment.

573
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,420
And when they're going three or four times a week, which is our average, they're getting

574
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,659
some real value for money.

575
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,219
So, but it is still a...

576
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:36,599
it's a high margin play with low volume.

577
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:43,780
So a franchisee will only need sort of 250 members and they're crushing it, making some

578
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,480
really good money.

579
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:50,559
That's different from every other franchise business around, which is really not every,

580
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:54,280
but most of them are focused on high turnover, right?

581
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,400
With low margin.

582
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,960
That's your, you know, all your fast foods, your whatever else it is.

583
00:35:59,139 --> 00:36:02,480
And so F45 paved the way for that.

584
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:03,119
But you're right.

585
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:03,199
Yeah.

586
00:36:03,219 --> 00:36:08,920
There's no joy in the fact that they are now struggling and there's whatever, 200 odd

587
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,980
for sale in Australia.

588
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,539
And that doesn't help the industry at all.

589
00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:15,559
And in fact, it, you know, raises questions.

590
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:20,980
Well, okay, you need to be really sure of the quality of the leadership of the franchise

591
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:28,260
that you're backing, because it's so important that the franchisee, they're backing the people

592
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,179
as much as the brand and every single, it's funny, every single email.

593
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:38,659
Since the very first time we've sold a franchise where we welcome the franchisee into the BFT

594
00:36:38,659 --> 00:36:48,519
family, I've always written, thank you for trusting in us and the brand, because no,

595
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:51,679
they're not just buying the brand, they're buying the people, they're buying those people

596
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,079
I mentioned, and they're buying into the fact that they believe in Cam and I and what we're

597
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:56,739
trying to create.

598
00:36:56,739 --> 00:37:02,820
And I think back to your point, they're buying into those values and the big value that Cam

599
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,139
and I have.

600
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:06,860
We've had literally from day one, when we worked out, what are we going to do here?

601
00:37:07,179 --> 00:37:09,500
That's going to be special as a value.

602
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,260
We use the word that's thrown around a lot, but fairness, we just knew we had to be fair

603
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:24,119
and we had to make sure that in every major decision, that three pillars of our business

604
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,599
are considered.

605
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,900
And that is that the member, the member's just got to have a great experience.

606
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,179
They've got to get value for money.

607
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,639
They've got to be getting results.

608
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:36,699
And they've got to feel like they're onto something special and really, really enjoying

609
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:37,639
their training at BFT.

610
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:43,900
Secondly, we've got to consider the franchisee because the model is based on franchising

611
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:50,079
and they need to make sure that they're making a buck and they're feeling like they're really

612
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,099
invested in the brand and enjoying it.

613
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:57,400
And one of the reasons I think that it's so popular as a franchise is because you can

614
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,280
actually, as a franchisee, you can see the excitement in members.

615
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,619
You can, as a franchisee.

616
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:09,039
You can go into the thing that you own and see 36 people at 5am every single day of the

617
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:15,039
week, rocking up, excited to work out, excited to be fit, excited to be part of this community.

618
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,099
You can get to know 250, 300 people's names and get to know who they are.

619
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:21,320
And literally, they're not just a number.

620
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,699
We don't have numbers at BFT.

621
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,380
They're not a number.

622
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,659
They're actually a name.

623
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:29,440
Someone who lives down the street, who's got a story, got a fitness journey, got a reason

624
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,559
that they're going to BFT.

625
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,559
And as a franchisee, especially.

626
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:37,280
If you're an owner operator, which a good chunk of them are, you can get invested in

627
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,900
that business.

628
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,739
And, you know, you can't, I can't think of many other franchises where you can get to

629
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:51,179
know those customers so well and feel like you're actually part of their life, you know,

630
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:53,480
other than work and their family.

631
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:59,199
BFT is the next thing that they love in their life, that they're there more than any other

632
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,159
place and they're really enjoying.

633
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,619
So we've got to make sure.

634
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,880
We've got to make sure the franchisee is looked after.

635
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:09,860
And then, of course, we've got to consider HQ or the franchisor, which is us, because

636
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:14,940
if we're not successful, it doesn't really matter how good the franchisees are if we

637
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:19,619
haven't got money to pump back into the system in support and regional franchise managers

638
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:25,440
and the IP of the business and pumping the brand and having partnerships and relationships

639
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,460
like we've just partnered with Hyrox, which is this global fitness race that is going

640
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,699
to do great things for our brand.

641
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:32,480
It's really exciting.

642
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:38,320
If we can't do things like that, then the franchisees aren't going to get any value and

643
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,980
they're wondering why they're paying us royalties.

644
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,739
So those three pillars have to work and we have to be fair across the board.

645
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:50,480
And that shaped everything that Cam and I did from day one in terms of what the contract

646
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,860
looked like, the size of the territories.

647
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,559
You know, we can only sell 380 territories in Australia.

648
00:39:57,099 --> 00:40:02,340
F45, I think, can 580 or 600 or something or maybe even more before they had sold out.

649
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:02,360
So we've got to be fair across the board.

650
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:02,500
So we've got to be fair across the board.

651
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:08,280
So our territories are, you know, one and a half times larger than our major competitors

652
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:13,179
because we wanted our franchisees to feel like they were getting value for money, that

653
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:20,679
we were being fair and that we took the noise out of pretty much every single complaint

654
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,239
that franchisees have globally.

655
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,679
And as part of the research we did, whether it's your Baskin Robbins or, you know, franchise

656
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:32,420
in Australia or any fast food chains.

657
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:32,940
Subway.

658
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:37,800
Subway, any of them, the franchisees complained that the territories are too small, that they

659
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,940
feel like they're competing with each other.

660
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,940
So give them bigger territories, break down the barriers so our members can go to any

661
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,340
BFT.

662
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:49,019
They're not restricted just to the one they sign up to, which means our franchisees aren't

663
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:53,380
competing for members because the members are free to choose to go where they want.

664
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,139
So our franchisees basically work together to share best practice.

665
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:57,980
They're not competing.

666
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:02,460
And being fair with what we do.

667
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:07,699
And how we do it and how we charge our royalties and all that sort of stuff has been fundamental

668
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:11,719
to answer your question in getting those values right, I think.

669
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:17,519
And not every franchisee would tell you right now of the 250 open that we're fair in everything

670
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:17,840
we do.

671
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,420
We know that.

672
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,980
But we try to be.

673
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:26,239
And I think especially in the early days when Cam and I had those such strong relationships

674
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:30,280
with the ones that invested in us early, they only had us.

675
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,340
They didn't have a brand.

676
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,260
No one knew BFT.

677
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:36,599
Now it's not everywhere, but it's prevalent.

678
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:38,659
They didn't have that brand.

679
00:41:38,739 --> 00:41:43,460
So they relied on us and they trusted us with a lot of their hard-earned money and their

680
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:43,760
future.

681
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:44,960
And yeah.

682
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:45,800
It's a great answer.

683
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,840
And I can just hear the passion come out in your voice.

684
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,539
That's why things are successful, isn't it?

685
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:54,300
You can genuinely hear your joy around what you do and the fact that, as you said, you

686
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,360
hadn't thought of it that way, isn't it?

687
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,179
People come and they get fit and they have results and they build a community and it's

688
00:41:59,179 --> 00:42:02,300
a pretty unique relationship you have with the 60,000 plus.

689
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,599
It is not something that other groups do.

690
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:08,380
And I'm not surprised you're successful, but you're right, isn't it?

691
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:09,960
It's not just the name.

692
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:14,300
It's the people behind the name that you put a lot of trust in to have that success.

693
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:19,539
Rich, I've really enjoyed crossing over with you in recent times in a space we're passionate

694
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:24,500
about, which is great leadership stories like yours and Cam's and what you're doing and

695
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:30,619
trying to share that with other leaders around the world and Australia in these bespoke groups.

696
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:31,619
And you've joined one of our...

697
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,639
Leader Connect programs and you're midway through it.

698
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,900
I love the group you're in.

699
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,980
Laura Henshaw, who's a brilliant CEO in her own right, keep it cleaner.

700
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:43,920
Lydia Lassler, who's an Olympic gold medal winner.

701
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:45,940
Ken Hinkley, the coach of Port Adelaide, who's...

702
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,099
Since you've been with him, mate, he hasn't lost a game, I think.

703
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:48,159
Yeah, I know.

704
00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:49,099
I'm not happy with that.

705
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,300
He beat the Bombers the other day.

706
00:42:51,219 --> 00:42:53,280
He's had a fairly good purple patch.

707
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,599
Anthony Seabold is an incredible senior coach in NRL and a great human being in every sense.

708
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:01,599
And John Safanos, who started Tinter Car and now one of the...

709
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,239
Leaders at Repco.

710
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,840
What's that experience been like for you, Rich, to sort of collaborate with a group like that?

711
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:07,800
Fantastic.

712
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,300
And don't forget Stace, too, as the moderator.

713
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:16,900
She's fantastic and very successful in her own right, obviously, as Australian captain in lacrosse.

714
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,059
And yeah, she's been great.

715
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:24,679
Early days, obviously, we're still sort of finding our feet and getting to know each other.

716
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:31,679
But the differences in approach are...

717
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:38,039
Really fascinating for me in terms of how we all structure what we do and how we do it.

718
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,519
At the moment, we're sort of going through what leadership means and trying to break down

719
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:53,280
what separates a good leader from one who isn't and some of the challenges that we face in our roles as leaders.

720
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,280
So we're helping each other in that.

721
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:02,280
And I think that's what I'm loving is to hear the different ways that everyone does stuff to eventually...

722
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,539
Get the same result, right?

723
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:11,239
Which is to try to make sure that you can be someone who is followed, not because they have to follow you,

724
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,860
but because they want to follow you.

725
00:44:13,179 --> 00:44:17,260
And that, in essence, is a definition for me of what a good leader is.

726
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,400
And it's clear for those other five that you mentioned.

727
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:30,719
Yeah, people follow them because they want to, because there's a passion and an innate sense of purpose for them.

728
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:31,719
That means people are drawn...

729
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,539
They're drawn to work with them.

730
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,340
Yeah, brilliant description, Rich.

731
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,119
And I love...

732
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:40,159
We felt probably historically people were in their silos a lot and you would have had your head down

733
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:45,079
and creating this incredible story called BFT and doing it in your own unique way.

734
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:48,320
And we sort of love that sharing economy now in real time and you're so open.

735
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,840
The way you told your story before, you just put it all on the table and you're not hiding anything

736
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,400
or the successes and the failures, you're totally transparent.

737
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,400
And so we think capturing those opportunities and sharing them in real time is...

738
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:01,920
Yeah.

739
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,219
Leadership's lonely at times, isn't it?

740
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:11,059
There's other people that come from a totally different perspective that we love the thought of that sharing economy

741
00:45:11,059 --> 00:45:15,159
of how you can do things in a different way is the beauty behind it, we think.

742
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:16,099
And you're feeling that?

743
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:16,940
Yeah, I am.

744
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:18,059
Yep, definitely.

745
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:26,500
We're about to share who some of the leaders in our lives are and people who we've looked up to,

746
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:32,139
whether they're famous people or people on the journey and that'll be a good session, I think.

747
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:32,659
Yeah.

748
00:45:33,019 --> 00:45:38,780
One of our coaches had this term, success leaves clues, and I think about it a lot.

749
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:42,619
And that sort of formed a bit of what we've felt from the environments we've been in

750
00:45:42,619 --> 00:45:46,119
and seeing people like you doing extraordinary stuff, that there are patterns around

751
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:50,360
why people are continuously successful.

752
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:54,679
And starting with this idea of self-leadership, Rich always asks people first up,

753
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:58,400
that we feel it's hard to lead someone else unless you understand yourself.

754
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,480
How would you describe self-leadership?

755
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:03,679
How I describe myself?

756
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:04,460
My leadership style?

757
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:08,440
Your sense of self-leadership for you and what that means to you

758
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,760
to lead yourself first before someone else.

759
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:21,280
Yeah, I think in that sense, getting the basics right of what motivates and drives me

760
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,860
is probably something that I need to get right and make sure I'm really clear about.

761
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:33,659
You know, as an example, I remember when Cam and I,

762
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:38,900
when I first started talking about what BFT could ultimately sort of lead to,

763
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:45,679
and we put up different sort of objectives and certainly not the first or second or the third,

764
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:48,019
but eventually we got to, well, how big could this be?

765
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:52,579
And Cam had actually had in his mind that he thought we could get to a thousand units open.

766
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,739
And that was just, you know, when we didn't have one franchise sold,

767
00:46:58,739 --> 00:47:03,039
you're thinking, you know, geez, that's pretty lofty ambition.

768
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:11,219
But I was like, he talked to me about it and why he thought it was an opportunity to get there.

769
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,659
And I was like, okay, well, let's go for it.

770
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:20,559
We wrote it down, but we didn't tell anyone for a couple of reasons.

771
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,760
I think one, because it was the most ridiculous number we'd ever heard of

772
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,460
and people would think we're absolutely crazy.

773
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:29,860
But more importantly, as I mentioned, it wasn't number one or two or three.

774
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:33,639
It was the things that mattered were how we actually,

775
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:35,960
how we actually make sure the franchises were successful.

776
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:40,960
So there's no point going for a thousand or a million if the franchisees aren't successful.

777
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:45,659
It had to be about making sure that every time someone asked us how fast are you going to grow?

778
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,880
The answer is we'll grow as fast as the franchise system allows us to grow.

779
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:52,840
And the moment that they're struggling, the moment they're not getting support,

780
00:47:53,019 --> 00:47:57,099
the moment they're not able to share best practice and work out how to get better,

781
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:02,059
we need to stop any thought of growth and focus on the franchisee.

782
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:08,320
So, you know, eventually now that thousand is actually not looking too silly

783
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:13,199
and we're opening up a bit about the fact that we kind of did actually talk about it a while ago,

784
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:19,599
but it's a long way of coming back to your sort of question in terms of getting the basics right,

785
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,539
which is how to look after the franchisee.

786
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:30,280
Similar to me, how do you look after yourself to make sure that I'm in a good place to be able to look after others?

787
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,599
And that was really, really hard after Sebastian and Charlie.

788
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:39,219
Obviously, passing because there was a sense of what the hell am I doing?

789
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:41,219
And, you know, Charlie passed away.

790
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:49,639
And within two months, we were negotiating a $60 million deal with Exponential Fitness around the clock, day and night.

791
00:48:49,639 --> 00:48:54,039
Cam and I literally day and night for 30 days to get this deal done.

792
00:48:56,039 --> 00:49:01,039
But it didn't matter for me anywhere near as much as it probably would have

793
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:03,579
if I hadn't gone through that time with Sebastian.

794
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:06,320
And Charlie, because everything in life is put into perspective, right?

795
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,360
And you're like, okay, money is money.

796
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,340
That's fantastic.

797
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,800
It's life-changing, whatever.

798
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:13,860
But it's not who I am.

799
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,099
It's not going to define me.

800
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:18,659
I don't want it to define how I am in the future.

801
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:20,519
I don't want to change as a result of it.

802
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:27,800
And so the basics of who you are, how you live your life, how you structure your days,

803
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:33,300
how you're going to stay true to some of your values, which, you know, for me is obviously, as we've mentioned,

804
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:37,400
is family and making sure particularly that Danielle and I are strong

805
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,500
and that, you know, the stats on divorces if you lose a child is horrendous.

806
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,300
I think it's 80% or something like that.

807
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,059
And we haven't ever asked a doctor what the stats would be if you lose two.

808
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,480
You can laugh to us because it is sort of funny, but yeah.

809
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:56,400
We had a dinner one night, you know, with you and Danielle.

810
00:49:56,699 --> 00:50:00,460
And the black humor part sort of has to be part of it too, doesn't it?

811
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,639
I mean, it's a hard thing to talk about, but I think it's worth,

812
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:08,420
you can't be morbid, can you, even in the most morbid situation.

813
00:50:08,659 --> 00:50:12,940
And you have to, you know, and the two of you occasionally, it was like over dinner,

814
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:14,219
I'm going, did you say that?

815
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:17,880
You know, and then you do laugh because without it, you're in trouble, aren't you?

816
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,579
Was that part of, you know, talking about self-leadership,

817
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:22,800
was that part of what gets the two of you through that?

818
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:23,980
Yeah, absolutely, mate.

819
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:25,380
And you have to, don't you?

820
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,840
You've got to work out a way, what's going to get you through the day

821
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:32,139
to make sure that you can actually start the next day.

822
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:33,639
Because...

823
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:38,679
Mate, you just want anyone, and I know you've had tough times, you know,

824
00:50:38,699 --> 00:50:42,980
with your father and people listening to this will have lost family members,

825
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,380
they'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

826
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:51,079
But you just want the world to stop and you expect the world to stop.

827
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:57,840
And your kid passes and you're like, what the hell?

828
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,820
Why is the world continuing?

829
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:03,440
Why are people laughing and talking?

830
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:04,960
Why is the bloody TV on?

831
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:06,300
Why is the world going on?

832
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:07,400
It has to stop.

833
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,099
My world has just stopped.

834
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,679
And you can't make sense of how the world is continuing to go on.

835
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:15,679
It just doesn't seem fair.

836
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,039
It doesn't seem right that everything else in life is going on.

837
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:24,179
And, you know, you know all of your family and your friends are hurting.

838
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,400
And that was one of the most painful things to me, to be honest,

839
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:30,559
to see the people so close to you hurting as well.

840
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:32,780
But life goes on.

841
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:33,599
And you...

842
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,059
You just can't understand why it doesn't stop.

843
00:51:36,739 --> 00:51:41,579
So to think about how you can get through,

844
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:46,900
it sort of unfortunately just happens because you realize that the world isn't stopping.

845
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:47,920
You know, we've got...

846
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,480
Danielle and I have got a photo of a mountain in Africa that was given to us

847
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,820
as part of a charity for very special kids, I think, or St. Paul's.

848
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:59,159
And on the bottom, it's got the sun always rises.

849
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,280
And it's just the sun coming over a mountain somewhere over Africa.

850
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:03,519
And it doesn't...

851
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:03,719
It does.

852
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:06,579
The sun always comes up and life always goes on.

853
00:52:06,619 --> 00:52:11,500
And you have to find a way to either be part of it because there's no other...

854
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,159
I shouldn't say either, to be part of it, full stop, because there's no other way.

855
00:52:15,159 --> 00:52:16,480
You can't check out.

856
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:23,539
And literally a week ago, we were lucky enough on family holiday to be at Robben Island

857
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:29,619
and to be in Nelson Mandela's cell where he spent 17 years.

858
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,159
And we were in the courtyard in the tour beforehand where he was...

859
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:38,380
Chiseling, you know, limestone to create gravel from for, I think,

860
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,639
eight hours a day or something for 17 years in that courtyard.

861
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:44,239
And I held the family back because I wanted to be at the end of the tour

862
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:49,239
so we could be at his cell, just us, and not be rushed to, you know,

863
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,139
go through, take your photo, move on, whatever.

864
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:56,340
So we were at the back and I just stood there at this two metre by two and a half metre cell

865
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:03,360
and I was fascinated by how someone could think about how they could go on.

866
00:53:03,739 --> 00:53:10,099
And how they could get up the next day and do the same bloody thing every day for 17 years

867
00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:13,239
and be committed and stay passionate.

868
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:18,440
And we talk about leadership and I read a lot about him and I just stood there in awe.

869
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,480
Saw the tiny little window that he would have looked out on any day

870
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,980
and saw that the sun always rises, you know.

871
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:29,639
And I was gobsmacked just to be there and to think about that

872
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,280
and to see where he did his workout.

873
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,880
And you've probably read his story.

874
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:36,000
You know, he was a boxer and he wanted to keep his fitness regime

875
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,139
so he got up an hour before the ridiculous hour they made them wake up

876
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:41,480
which would have been five o'clock or anywhere.

877
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:45,280
So he got up an hour early, 45 minutes of jogging on the spot

878
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,940
because he didn't have anywhere else to jog

879
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:50,539
and then like a hundred fingertip push-ups and 200 sit-ups

880
00:53:50,539 --> 00:53:53,820
and all of this other stuff that he did every single day

881
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,619
just because he wanted to create a sense of purpose

882
00:53:56,619 --> 00:54:00,960
and he wanted to work out, give himself something to achieve each day

883
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,360
because everything else was kind of meaningless.

884
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,719
Because they weren't allowed to talk and all this sort of stuff.

885
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:09,280
So, yeah, to get up every single day, mate,

886
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,780
is you've got to be able to do it, right?

887
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,260
You've got to show resilience and you've got to push on.

888
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,760
And people who've been through tough times know that

889
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:21,239
and somehow you've got to be able to think about that

890
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:25,820
and work out how you can do that and create meaning and value in your life.

891
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:26,699
Beautifully said.

892
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,500
It's a profound experience standing in that.

893
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:31,000
Saw the great privilege of doing that many years ago as well.

894
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:33,500
You know, shadowboxed and then to come back.

895
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:37,880
Come out of there and actually forgive and heal a whole nation

896
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,199
that was the most divided nation on earth afterwards

897
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:45,099
and to bring people back together and not want retribution.

898
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:47,280
It's just, you know, it's extraordinary, isn't it?

899
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,380
And it is a profound thing to stand there, isn't it?

900
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,400
And think how on earth did he find a way, Nelson Mandela?

901
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,320
We see people really conscious, Rich, day to day

902
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,500
how they positively impact others in their environment.

903
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:01,199
I've heard you talk with great passion about your team.

904
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,320
Have you gone about that idea of,

905
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,460
every day having a positive impact?

906
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,920
I don't think I'm as good as it is I'd like to be.

907
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:09,639
I'm sure I'm not.

908
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:13,860
I'd like to think when I am around our team, I'm positive

909
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:19,420
and I give them the real opportunity to thrive.

910
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:23,420
To be honest, it's been really hard for Cam and I to step back

911
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,440
and to have Dave in there as CEO

912
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,199
because we've been across absolutely everything since BFT started.

913
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:32,659
But we knew that the right progression

914
00:55:32,659 --> 00:55:33,300
and the natural progression,

915
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,159
for the company was for us to allow Dave to come in

916
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:41,239
and to really manipulate and micromanage, if you like,

917
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:45,599
the success of our network so that we could focus elsewhere

918
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,760
and really drive the growth internationally.

919
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,880
So the touch points with the team are less now.

920
00:55:52,699 --> 00:55:58,800
But hopefully the space that I'm able to give them

921
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,380
demonstrates that we have absolute confidence

922
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:02,300
that we can do this.

923
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:07,079
We know it's not just our brand, it's their brand

924
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:09,119
and they're incredibly invested in it too.

925
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,099
And to have the OGs that I mentioned

926
00:56:12,099 --> 00:56:15,039
and others who've been at BFT since day one

927
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:18,380
still there driving it, equally as proud

928
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:21,260
and excited with what we can do in the future

929
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,659
is incredibly rewarding.

930
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:29,340
So yeah, positively impact, giving them space,

931
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,079
giving them assurance that we've got their back.

932
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,699
I think that's incredibly important,

933
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,480
especially when you're going into new countries

934
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,639
and you might only have one person.

935
00:56:38,659 --> 00:56:40,760
We've only got one person in Spain at the moment,

936
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,000
one person in the UK,

937
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:47,280
one person in looking after sales in sort of Malaysia.

938
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,000
So they feel quite isolated.

939
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:52,159
And I think my role in that is to make sure

940
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,400
that they know that I'm there for them

941
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,940
and that they eventually will get a team

942
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,639
and we will get a team in the UK

943
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:01,480
because we're selling a lot in the UK and Spain

944
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,539
and across Europe now.

945
00:57:02,539 --> 00:57:02,679
Yeah.

946
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,079
Until that time, they've got to know that I'm there

947
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:07,539
and that means, yeah, you're talking at,

948
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:10,199
like I did last night, 11 o'clock at night to people

949
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:13,059
because it's the right time zone

950
00:57:13,059 --> 00:57:17,820
and that they can be part of the bigger picture.

951
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,260
So team is so important, right?

952
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,480
And wherever we can, we get them involved

953
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,019
in being on Zooms or coming to Australia

954
00:57:26,019 --> 00:57:28,179
for our annual franchise conference

955
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:29,880
just so that they can feel part of it

956
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,539
because otherwise they, I think,

957
00:57:32,539 --> 00:57:33,300
would feel pretty isolated.

958
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,840
I'd be back to the days of me and Cam

959
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,440
in spots in a warehouse, just the two of us

960
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,099
and it's not fun for anyone.

961
00:57:40,219 --> 00:57:42,900
I love hearing, you know, from a couple of sites

962
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,280
in South Yarra to Spain and Malaysia

963
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,659
and, you know, I saw you pop up in the Philippines

964
00:57:47,659 --> 00:57:48,340
the other day.

965
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,280
It's incredible to see what can be created

966
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,599
when you get that alignment.

967
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,719
It's amazing.

968
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:56,000
We talk about another dimension of leadership,

969
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,460
how people go about creating and sharing a vision

970
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:59,840
and I hadn't heard you before.

971
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,219
I'm not surprised knowing the two of you

972
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:03,239
that, you know, a thousand,

973
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,179
went on the whiteboard

974
00:58:04,179 --> 00:58:05,780
before you'd even, you know,

975
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,360
opened the first proper franchise.

976
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,400
That's a pretty big vision.

977
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:11,599
How did you go about, you know,

978
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,260
I know you kept that part of it

979
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,980
maybe in-house at the start,

980
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:16,099
but how'd you go about creating

981
00:58:16,099 --> 00:58:18,139
and sharing this vision of what you've achieved?

982
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,900
I think one of the things from me,

983
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,480
from BP in particular,

984
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,019
but also at the Bombers and, you know,

985
00:58:26,059 --> 00:58:27,460
the Bombers, we went through a hard time

986
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:29,400
with our vision completely being upended

987
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,699
because I was there right through the ASADA stuff, right?

988
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,000
So, you know, I had to,

989
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,260
I had that horrible year in 2013

990
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,300
having to try to keep the membership base

991
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,940
and sponsors and everyone together

992
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:42,059
when the whole world of the Bombers collapsed.

993
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,500
So your vision can be incredibly fragile

994
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,940
and it can be broken very, very easily

995
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,840
if you don't have the right magnetic Norse

996
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,460
and the right sort of moral compass.

997
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,059
And so we really focused on fairness

998
00:58:56,059 --> 00:58:59,019
as that driver for us and creating values

999
00:58:59,019 --> 00:59:02,800
where those pillars of the franchisee,

1000
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,099
the member and the office

1001
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:07,960
are all in this together

1002
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,599
to create a win-win situation.

1003
00:59:10,539 --> 00:59:13,559
But what I learned from those times at BP

1004
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:15,780
and the AFL in particular,

1005
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,460
when you're creating those strategies and visions,

1006
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:18,739
you've got to bring people along.

1007
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,440
You know, that, Dars, it's, you know,

1008
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,579
101 of creating a shared vision

1009
00:59:24,579 --> 00:59:25,900
is you can't do it yourself.

1010
00:59:26,139 --> 00:59:28,059
So Cam and I in the early days

1011
00:59:28,059 --> 00:59:29,780
only had each other to sign off on it.

1012
00:59:30,019 --> 00:59:32,260
But as we got more people every year,

1013
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:32,659
we would,

1014
00:59:32,659 --> 00:59:34,940
throw it up on the board

1015
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:38,139
and interrogate it and challenge it and question it

1016
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:40,219
and say, well, guys, is this right?

1017
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:44,619
Does this actually sit with us as who we are now?

1018
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,659
And we've had various iterations of it actually

1019
00:59:47,659 --> 00:59:51,539
over time as we get more evolved

1020
00:59:51,539 --> 00:59:52,880
and we've now got 30 staff

1021
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,780
who all have a say in that sort of stuff

1022
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,599
and buy into it.

1023
00:59:56,219 --> 00:59:57,559
So it has been evolving.

1024
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:00,340
But at the heart of it,

1025
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,320
it's creating these communities

1026
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,199
where we're able to change people's lives,

1027
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:06,579
the members and the franchisees,

1028
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,000
because of the opportunity that we have

1029
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,380
to create this really unique model

1030
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:14,980
where everyone can benefit and everyone can grow.

1031
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:17,579
So bringing people along,

1032
01:00:18,099 --> 01:00:19,199
constantly refreshing it,

1033
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,960
so much easier said than done, I know,

1034
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:22,679
because you just get caught up in the day-to-day

1035
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:24,559
and the vision just becomes this thing

1036
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:25,500
that's tacked on a board.

1037
01:00:25,739 --> 01:00:29,340
But I think making sure we've done those two things

1038
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:30,460
have been really important.

1039
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,079
Curiosity is a word which we,

1040
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,599
we hear and see a lot in people

1041
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:36,280
who are successful

1042
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,980
and they use curiosity as a way to constantly,

1043
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:40,679
apart from learning and development

1044
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:43,139
and wanting to always be better.

1045
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,340
Is curiosity paid a part for you?

1046
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:47,539
Yeah, definitely.

1047
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,500
I'm so glad Cam and I spent that time six months

1048
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,079
before we started selling franchises,

1049
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:54,840
being curious particularly about

1050
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:58,099
what the global landscape is

1051
01:00:58,099 --> 01:01:00,659
and where we should be different and better,

1052
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,739
which if you didn't know,

1053
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:02,079
is our,

1054
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,480
our slogan and our tagline,

1055
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,860
which kind of forces people to,

1056
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:06,679
to ask us,

1057
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:07,199
well, okay,

1058
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,219
either we believe you,

1059
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,139
that you're different and better

1060
01:01:09,139 --> 01:01:10,139
or if not,

1061
01:01:10,139 --> 01:01:10,159
why?

1062
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:11,079
So the actual tagline is

1063
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:12,239
different, better, yeah.

1064
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:12,860
Different, better, yeah.

1065
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:13,460
Yeah, yeah.

1066
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,980
So that's a bit of a,

1067
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,679
a play on some of our competitors,

1068
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:17,219
obviously,

1069
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:17,860
but it also,

1070
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,739
it forces people to ask the question,

1071
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,239
well, okay,

1072
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,760
prove to me you're different and better.

1073
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:23,519
And there's so many elements to why we are,

1074
01:01:23,619 --> 01:01:24,619
why we think we are.

1075
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:29,460
But to answer your question,

1076
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:30,659
which was

1077
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:31,239
Curiosity.

1078
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:31,940
The curiosity,

1079
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:32,380
the curiosity one,

1080
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,559
other than,

1081
01:01:35,699 --> 01:01:37,119
other than the,

1082
01:01:37,139 --> 01:01:38,900
the start of that journey,

1083
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:41,500
really being curious as to what happens in the landscape,

1084
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:43,719
Cam and I are always

1085
01:01:43,719 --> 01:01:45,659
looking at

1086
01:01:45,659 --> 01:01:47,840
what we can do

1087
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,300
within our space

1088
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,400
to make sure that we're offering

1089
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:51,960
the,

1090
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,039
the very best to

1091
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:53,900
the model.

1092
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,719
Cam is a gun at that.

1093
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:55,980
And,

1094
01:01:56,019 --> 01:01:56,159
and,

1095
01:01:56,219 --> 01:01:56,340
you know,

1096
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:57,559
he's been the first to say,

1097
01:01:57,619 --> 01:01:57,780
Rich,

1098
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,420
we cannot compromise on the

1099
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:02,059
180 square meters of unencumbered space

1100
01:02:02,059 --> 01:02:03,539
that we have in every studio,

1101
01:02:03,539 --> 01:02:04,579
because if we do,

1102
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,920
it won't allow us to put in new equipment

1103
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:07,780
or new offerings

1104
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:09,619
as a result of changing,

1105
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:10,400
you know,

1106
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,000
global best practices when it comes to fitness.

1107
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:13,719
And look,

1108
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:15,300
obviously most of those stay the same.

1109
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,900
And that's why Cam's so good that he's like,

1110
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:17,039
well,

1111
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,219
we're going to stick to the core

1112
01:02:18,219 --> 01:02:20,739
movements that have,

1113
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:23,099
have over the course of time

1114
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:24,260
got results.

1115
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,619
So we're not going to waver from that,

1116
01:02:25,699 --> 01:02:28,480
but you don't want to restrict yourself space wise

1117
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,159
so that you can't adapt.

1118
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:31,880
So Cam's been at the forefront of that.

1119
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,760
He's been at the forefront of making sure we've adapted there.

1120
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,340
We don't focus really on our competitors,

1121
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:37,800
to be honest,

1122
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,019
mate,

1123
01:02:38,019 --> 01:02:38,860
where we're,

1124
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:42,139
we've never been ones where Cam and I will talk forever

1125
01:02:42,139 --> 01:02:42,699
about what,

1126
01:02:43,219 --> 01:02:43,559
you know,

1127
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:46,280
different companies are doing or why they're doing well.

1128
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,320
We don't go and spend time,

1129
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:48,900
you know,

1130
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,380
working out in their spaces and see what they're like.

1131
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:53,659
We're not that we just know that we're onto something

1132
01:02:53,659 --> 01:02:56,440
and we need to focus on us.

1133
01:02:56,719 --> 01:02:57,760
I think that's been a,

1134
01:02:58,340 --> 01:02:59,260
a,

1135
01:02:59,260 --> 01:02:59,760
um,

1136
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:01,199
a smart thing to do.

1137
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:01,400
Uh,

1138
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,280
maybe some would disagree and say,

1139
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,639
it's really important to know your competitors backwards,

1140
01:03:05,639 --> 01:03:07,260
but we've sort of been like,

1141
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:07,519
right,

1142
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,079
we,

1143
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:09,460
everyone's got competitors,

1144
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:14,239
but how can we be us and how can we really focus on

1145
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:15,500
the stuff that we do well?

1146
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:16,820
And if we do that,

1147
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:19,460
which is really about making sure our members get results and

1148
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:20,480
a happy being there,

1149
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,619
then everything else will fall into place.

1150
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:25,139
So we're curious more so from a,

1151
01:03:25,579 --> 01:03:30,019
a broader business perspective and landscape and changing dynamics.

1152
01:03:30,019 --> 01:03:30,380
And,

1153
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:30,639
you know,

1154
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:31,219
right now,

1155
01:03:31,219 --> 01:03:31,400
obviously,

1156
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,900
we're curious as to what the Australian in particular,

1157
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:38,099
but also global markets doing with interest rates and how that's affecting

1158
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:42,500
people's propensity to buy a franchise because they may not have as much

1159
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,539
capital available to invest.

1160
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:45,559
Um,

1161
01:03:45,719 --> 01:03:47,239
the F 45 sort of,

1162
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:47,579
um,

1163
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:48,860
collapse of their share price.

1164
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:49,659
And you know,

1165
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:54,000
the fact that there's 200 odd for sale across Australia is not great for,

1166
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:54,800
for BFT,

1167
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,159
obviously,

1168
01:03:55,159 --> 01:03:59,420
because people need strong brands and strong leaders to,

1169
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:01,219
to make sure they back in our model.

1170
01:04:01,219 --> 01:04:04,099
And so our job is to make sure we prove to people that we're,

1171
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:05,260
um,

1172
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:08,480
going to drive this thing and we're different and better from every other model.

1173
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,139
And that,

1174
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:10,159
um,

1175
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:10,599
we're a,

1176
01:04:10,599 --> 01:04:11,599
we're a safe bet.

1177
01:04:11,739 --> 01:04:12,260
Uh,

1178
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:13,320
so yeah,

1179
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,739
we're more curious probably now as business people,

1180
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:17,539
um,

1181
01:04:17,539 --> 01:04:19,539
rather than looking particularly at,

1182
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:20,360
um,

1183
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,820
anything our competitors is doing.

1184
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:22,940
Um,

1185
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:24,139
and,

1186
01:04:24,679 --> 01:04:25,539
but I love reading.

1187
01:04:25,539 --> 01:04:26,219
I love,

1188
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:27,199
you know,

1189
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:28,400
listening to podcasts.

1190
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,079
I love finding out about,

1191
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:30,659
um,

1192
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:33,280
what other leaders are doing in spaces.

1193
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,840
And that stuff really excites me because there's so much to learn.

1194
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:38,760
And the moment you stop learning or,

1195
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:42,960
or asking people or having opportunities to have coffees with people to pick

1196
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:43,780
their brains is,

1197
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,119
you know,

1198
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:46,920
that's why Haim has been brilliant because he's problem.

1199
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:50,219
What do you much knowledge on different things is always there to give a call

1200
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:50,860
to and say,

1201
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:51,099
Hey,

1202
01:04:51,099 --> 01:04:51,920
this is our problem.

1203
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:52,559
What do you think?

1204
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:53,300
And,

1205
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:53,760
um,

1206
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:54,119
Cameron,

1207
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:59,400
I will often just go for walks for an hour or so and bounce off ideas with

1208
01:04:59,400 --> 01:04:59,840
each other.

1209
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:00,599
So we're curious,

1210
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:01,440
but in that respect,

1211
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:02,280
um,

1212
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:06,340
definitely communicating with a clarity is another dimension.

1213
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:11,159
And as you get a global enterprise and 60,000 new community,

1214
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:15,340
how have you gone about communicating with clarity and going about that?

1215
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:17,099
Yeah.

1216
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:19,019
Communicating with clarity is it's massive,

1217
01:05:19,019 --> 01:05:19,380
isn't it?

1218
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,539
And as I mentioned before,

1219
01:05:20,539 --> 01:05:20,940
gee,

1220
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,820
don't know about my comms manager is,

1221
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:24,480
is great,

1222
01:05:24,539 --> 01:05:24,960
um,

1223
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,059
from that perspective.

1224
01:05:26,059 --> 01:05:30,579
And she would be the first to agree with me that where we've needed to,

1225
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:40,980
to communicate well has been in a time where you you're needing to get some information out quickly,

1226
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:42,780
but importantly,

1227
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:44,400
because there's some urgency around it.

1228
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:45,360
Um,

1229
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:54,539
but it needs to be just so on point that it gives people comfort and reassurance in the brand and where we stand.

1230
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:55,260
Um,

1231
01:05:55,679 --> 01:05:58,880
and real clarity in that message about what we're trying to get across.

1232
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,239
And an example of that is,

1233
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:01,260
when COVID hit,

1234
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:10,739
obviously that the comms to members and making sure our franchisees had a really clear playbook about how to communicate to members about what was happening,

1235
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:11,500
um,

1236
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:16,539
was fundamental to the success of us getting through that time where we,

1237
01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:17,679
we didn't lose a franchise.

1238
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:18,659
Um,

1239
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:23,320
and we had these awesome membership community who jumped online,

1240
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:23,900
pivoted,

1241
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,199
jumped online rather than,

1242
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:25,659
um,

1243
01:06:25,659 --> 01:06:26,460
working out at the,

1244
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:27,460
at the bricks and mortar.

1245
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:28,840
We're actually working out online,

1246
01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:30,079
paying the,

1247
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:33,079
the franchisees just a few bucks a week,

1248
01:06:33,079 --> 01:06:33,860
maybe 20 bucks.

1249
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:37,679
I think it was at the time to have these online classes,

1250
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:38,980
but it just got us through,

1251
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,000
um,

1252
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:42,739
and helped the franchisees survive in that time.

1253
01:06:42,739 --> 01:06:42,920
And we,

1254
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:43,280
of course,

1255
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,619
didn't charge franchise fees.

1256
01:06:44,619 --> 01:06:46,039
We tried to do the right thing there,

1257
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:46,940
but the point was,

1258
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:56,760
if we communicated that poorly to the members or we'd shut or we hadn't been nimble enough to understand that change management is all about communication.

1259
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:57,360
As you mentioned,

1260
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,619
that's all change management is.

1261
01:06:58,619 --> 01:06:59,739
If you can get communication,

1262
01:06:59,739 --> 01:07:00,039
right,

1263
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:03,460
then change management will fall into place.

1264
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:04,119
Um,

1265
01:07:04,579 --> 01:07:06,679
so times like that,

1266
01:07:06,679 --> 01:07:07,280
we've been,

1267
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,760
I think pretty good at sitting back thinking,

1268
01:07:11,179 --> 01:07:12,840
what do we need to get through?

1269
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,139
How do we do it clearly?

1270
01:07:14,539 --> 01:07:15,199
And then having,

1271
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:21,679
don't be afraid to have lots of different sets of eyes on documents to make sure that it reads in the right way.

1272
01:07:22,199 --> 01:07:22,559
Um,

1273
01:07:22,579 --> 01:07:25,900
that's been really critical for us.

1274
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:29,239
Don't allow just one or two people to read something and send it out.

1275
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:30,000
We're going to,

1276
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,239
we're going to do it for 60,000 members.

1277
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:32,239
Um,

1278
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:33,179
so get it right.

1279
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:33,860
You know,

1280
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,579
like let's get it right.

1281
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:37,800
Let's make sure they understand where we're coming from,

1282
01:07:38,059 --> 01:07:41,400
why we're doing what we're doing and how it's going to benefit them.

1283
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:42,179
Yeah.

1284
01:07:42,179 --> 01:07:42,900
Brilliantly said.

1285
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,039
And I can see the,

1286
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:44,280
the,

1287
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:45,960
the strategy and the systems and the,

1288
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,179
and the clarity within the way that you speak.

1289
01:07:48,179 --> 01:07:50,239
How important has collaboration been for you?

1290
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:51,900
Yeah.

1291
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:52,360
Huge.

1292
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:52,980
Yeah.

1293
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:53,679
Um,

1294
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:55,800
uh,

1295
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:56,460
I'm,

1296
01:07:57,719 --> 01:07:59,440
I think hopefully cam would say the same,

1297
01:07:59,440 --> 01:07:59,760
but we,

1298
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,039
we collaborate really well and,

1299
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:02,199
and me and cam and then,

1300
01:08:02,199 --> 01:08:02,760
and Haim,

1301
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:03,360
um,

1302
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:03,599
you know,

1303
01:08:03,619 --> 01:08:04,599
at board meetings or,

1304
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:05,760
or when we need to,

1305
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,340
the three of us have worked really,

1306
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,039
really well now with Dave as well,

1307
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:09,480
um,

1308
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,920
at the helm collaborating there,

1309
01:08:12,039 --> 01:08:12,579
um,

1310
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,219
has been just a,

1311
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,699
such an important part of driving the,

1312
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:18,239
the business.

1313
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:18,699
Um,

1314
01:08:18,699 --> 01:08:20,880
we've got an amazing senior leadership team of,

1315
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:21,359
of,

1316
01:08:21,579 --> 01:08:21,840
uh,

1317
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,119
another few executives at,

1318
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:27,500
at BFT who now really drive that collaboration and direction.

1319
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:28,659
Um,

1320
01:08:28,659 --> 01:08:30,260
but you know,

1321
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:36,359
interesting made it to collaborate on everyday stuff is one thing,

1322
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:38,640
but when you have particular,

1323
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,319
um,

1324
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,380
strategic deliverables,

1325
01:08:42,439 --> 01:08:45,760
that's when collaboration I think becomes so important.

1326
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,479
And one thing that we don't,

1327
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,079
I don't think do that well in Australia,

1328
01:08:49,079 --> 01:08:54,060
but they do really well in the U S is that they create many project teams for

1329
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:58,300
pretty much every strategic item that they do.

1330
01:08:58,659 --> 01:08:59,880
That's what they do in corporate America,

1331
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:00,079
right?

1332
01:09:00,119 --> 01:09:03,899
They have these PMOs project management offices and they have project managers

1333
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:08,260
who actually are the liaisons between the supply chain and the sales and the

1334
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:11,239
marketing and the finance and whatever other division,

1335
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:12,899
bring them all together and say,

1336
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:13,100
right,

1337
01:09:13,159 --> 01:09:15,119
we've got this initiative.

1338
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:17,899
Let's project manage this and let's get it done.

1339
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:20,579
And I think we're weak.

1340
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:21,300
Uh,

1341
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,119
and I know,

1342
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:22,680
um,

1343
01:09:22,779 --> 01:09:23,619
not just BFT,

1344
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,619
but anywhere I've went,

1345
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:24,960
uh,

1346
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:25,939
been in Australia.

1347
01:09:25,939 --> 01:09:28,520
I think we're not that strong when it comes to,

1348
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:32,340
to having a project as opposed to a day to day type deliverable.

1349
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,000
Who's actually doing it.

1350
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:35,939
Who's responsible for it.

1351
01:09:35,979 --> 01:09:37,840
When's it going to be done and what's the scope.

1352
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:38,619
And,

1353
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:39,439
um,

1354
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,699
so to wrap all of that together,

1355
01:09:41,699 --> 01:09:45,159
you've got to collaborate and you've nearly got to pull people out of their day

1356
01:09:45,159 --> 01:09:46,520
to day and say,

1357
01:09:46,579 --> 01:09:46,779
right,

1358
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:51,199
you've got to spend an hour a day on this for the next four weeks or it's not

1359
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:51,739
going to get done.

1360
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:52,920
Um,

1361
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:57,920
so I've tried to instill that sense of collaboration by having project

1362
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:58,899
teams.

1363
01:09:58,960 --> 01:09:59,539
I think I mentioned,

1364
01:09:59,659 --> 01:09:59,779
we,

1365
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,600
we just signed this deal with high rocks,

1366
01:10:01,659 --> 01:10:04,380
which is this big fitness racing event.

1367
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:05,380
Think sort of like Spartan,

1368
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:06,539
um,

1369
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,600
or sort of the tough mud,

1370
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,899
but it's indoors and it's gone absolutely gangbusters all over Europe.

1371
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:13,859
And it's gone gangbusters now,

1372
01:10:13,859 --> 01:10:14,300
um,

1373
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:14,819
in Australia,

1374
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:17,260
it's already nearly sold out in Melbourne in a couple of months.

1375
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:19,300
Cause all the BFT members have jumped on board.

1376
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:23,680
It's given our members something to train for this massive indoor event at the

1377
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:24,439
showgrounds.

1378
01:10:24,439 --> 01:10:24,800
Um,

1379
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,260
but we had to collaborate there,

1380
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:27,479
bring people from all over.

1381
01:10:27,479 --> 01:10:27,880
Uh,

1382
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:28,800
BFT,

1383
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,619
all the different departments together to say,

1384
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:31,840
right,

1385
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:32,800
high rocks wasn't,

1386
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:33,960
didn't exist two months ago.

1387
01:10:34,039 --> 01:10:35,720
You didn't have that on your plate for 2023.

1388
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:39,520
Now we've got an event with 3000 people at the,

1389
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:40,199
at,

1390
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:40,640
um,

1391
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:41,560
in Flemington,

1392
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:42,720
uh,

1393
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:46,859
in August and one in Sydney be two weeks prior to that.

1394
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:47,600
What are we going to do?

1395
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,739
And there's one in Hong Kong and there's one in Singapore and how we're going

1396
01:10:50,739 --> 01:10:54,420
to get our BFTs around this and excited about it and create this whole

1397
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:57,220
program specifically so that people can train for this event.

1398
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:00,479
And feel excited about it and have something to achieve for.

1399
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,560
So without collaboration and without a project,

1400
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:05,199
um,

1401
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:07,140
those sorts of things end up for me,

1402
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,600
either one person ends up saying,

1403
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:09,779
Oh,

1404
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:10,579
well you deal with it.

1405
01:11:10,579 --> 01:11:12,020
And then it goes into the never,

1406
01:11:12,079 --> 01:11:13,340
never or doesn't get done properly.

1407
01:11:13,939 --> 01:11:14,300
Um,

1408
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,300
so I hope that's a great way to think about it.

1409
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:17,720
I love it.

1410
01:11:17,739 --> 01:11:18,699
I love the idea of it,

1411
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:19,000
isn't it?

1412
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,479
Because you do in your own space,

1413
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:23,140
you get busy and you sort of delegate a little bit,

1414
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:26,140
but to prioritize something when you actually call it a project management,

1415
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:26,180
it's,

1416
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:26,239
it's a,

1417
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:26,300
it's a,

1418
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:26,340
it's a,

1419
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:26,359
it's a,

1420
01:11:26,359 --> 01:11:26,399
it's a,

1421
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:26,460
it's a,

1422
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:26,520
it's a,

1423
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:26,539
it's a,

1424
01:11:26,539 --> 01:11:26,579
it's a,

1425
01:11:26,579 --> 01:11:27,899
it automatically elevates it,

1426
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:28,239
doesn't it?

1427
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:28,380
Yeah.

1428
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:30,199
Cause you've got to deliver on it one way or another,

1429
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:31,659
and you've got to be accountable to it.

1430
01:11:31,699 --> 01:11:32,699
It's a great way of,

1431
01:11:32,739 --> 01:11:32,960
you know,

1432
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,680
collaborating within your own business effectively,

1433
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:35,180
isn't it?

1434
01:11:35,239 --> 01:11:36,239
And you do,

1435
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:36,619
you know,

1436
01:11:36,619 --> 01:11:39,140
the U S experience brings that to the table,

1437
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:39,460
doesn't it?

1438
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:40,180
When you think about,

1439
01:11:40,279 --> 01:11:41,000
uh,

1440
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,260
how effective that can be,

1441
01:11:42,279 --> 01:11:43,819
it's a brilliant idea.

1442
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:44,560
And thanks for sharing.

1443
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:45,420
Rich,

1444
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:47,140
who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1445
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:50,170
Uh,

1446
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:52,930
there's been a few,

1447
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:53,970
um,

1448
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:58,369
different people for different circumstances to us.

1449
01:11:58,369 --> 01:11:58,750
I think,

1450
01:11:58,850 --> 01:11:59,289
um,

1451
01:11:59,289 --> 01:12:01,210
but if I think back to my time,

1452
01:12:01,289 --> 01:12:02,470
I had,

1453
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:02,930
uh,

1454
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:07,010
a couple of unbelievable managers at BP and John Clark and Lance Ed,

1455
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:07,289
who,

1456
01:12:07,430 --> 01:12:08,550
who gave me the,

1457
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:10,710
the confidence that,

1458
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:10,890
uh,

1459
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:12,750
I was just a young buck as a,

1460
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:14,449
as a BP graduate trainee,

1461
01:12:14,449 --> 01:12:15,090
but you know,

1462
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:15,229
you,

1463
01:12:15,369 --> 01:12:15,930
you're,

1464
01:12:16,109 --> 01:12:17,510
you're only,

1465
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:19,789
they only choose five a year out of,

1466
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:20,430
out of uni.

1467
01:12:20,729 --> 01:12:21,149
Um,

1468
01:12:21,149 --> 01:12:22,329
and I was one of those and,

1469
01:12:22,409 --> 01:12:27,670
and these particular managers gave me the responsibility at a very young age to be a

1470
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:28,350
regional franchise.

1471
01:12:28,369 --> 01:12:32,250
I was a franchise manager looking after 30 or 40 BPs in,

1472
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:32,810
in Melbourne.

1473
01:12:33,229 --> 01:12:33,510
Um,

1474
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:34,510
and that's where your franchise.

1475
01:12:34,909 --> 01:12:34,930
Yeah,

1476
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:35,170
exactly.

1477
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:36,029
That's yeah.

1478
01:12:36,149 --> 01:12:37,350
Out of that randomly.

1479
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:37,649
Yeah.

1480
01:12:37,689 --> 01:12:38,430
Because BP,

1481
01:12:38,649 --> 01:12:39,170
a lot of our,

1482
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:44,170
the service stations are franchised and then Lance and John both backed me in to go and

1483
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:51,029
run a company owned and operated 12 site multi-site franchise in North Queensland in

1484
01:12:51,029 --> 01:12:52,409
Townsville and in Cairns.

1485
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:56,789
So I was there as a 25 or seven year old,

1486
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:57,449
maybe yeah,

1487
01:12:57,529 --> 01:12:58,350
25 or seven,

1488
01:12:58,430 --> 01:13:03,229
one of those ages looking after 110 staff living remotely by myself up there.

1489
01:13:03,409 --> 01:13:03,810
Um,

1490
01:13:04,609 --> 01:13:04,949
to,

1491
01:13:05,149 --> 01:13:07,189
to deliver bottom line,

1492
01:13:07,489 --> 01:13:07,869
um,

1493
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:08,369
you know,

1494
01:13:08,649 --> 01:13:10,029
millions of dollars for BP.

1495
01:13:10,689 --> 01:13:11,130
Um,

1496
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:12,350
so they backed me in and,

1497
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:13,630
and believed in me.

1498
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:13,810
And,

1499
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:15,149
and for me,

1500
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:16,890
they've been incredibly influential.

1501
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:17,489
Um,

1502
01:13:17,489 --> 01:13:20,010
and I don't thank them or see them enough for that.

1503
01:13:20,069 --> 01:13:20,409
And then you.

1504
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:21,850
Can I just stop on that?

1505
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:22,090
I mean,

1506
01:13:22,090 --> 01:13:22,750
for a size,

1507
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:24,149
a company size of BP,

1508
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:28,189
that seems incredibly flexible to be able to trust a 25 year old,

1509
01:13:28,369 --> 01:13:32,210
put them into with all the bureaucracy of a hundred thousand people globally.

1510
01:13:32,489 --> 01:13:35,210
That seems pretty unique that they're able to just go,

1511
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:35,430
yeah,

1512
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:36,770
we see something in you,

1513
01:13:37,130 --> 01:13:37,489
uh,

1514
01:13:37,489 --> 01:13:38,750
go and go and go for it.

1515
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:39,529
Yeah.

1516
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:39,890
I,

1517
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:40,390
I think I,

1518
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:42,430
I mentioned it at a little bit,

1519
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:46,310
but I loved that people development aspect to BP.

1520
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:49,369
And that's one of the things that they were incredibly strong with.

1521
01:13:49,369 --> 01:13:52,270
I was there for six months as a 21 year old,

1522
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:54,229
and I got the tap from my manager and he said,

1523
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:55,189
we need you to go to Papua,

1524
01:13:55,189 --> 01:13:58,250
New Guinea and to evaluate our distributorships.

1525
01:13:58,250 --> 01:13:59,270
In PNG.

1526
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:03,949
So I lived in PNG for six months as a 21 year old because I was part of this graduate

1527
01:14:03,949 --> 01:14:08,090
trainee scheme where they want to expose you and throw you in the deep end all over the

1528
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:10,029
world to really test your,

1529
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:10,909
um,

1530
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:11,890
ability to,

1531
01:14:12,229 --> 01:14:13,850
to cope under pressure and to deliver.

1532
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:14,529
And that's what they,

1533
01:14:14,689 --> 01:14:14,869
you know,

1534
01:14:14,869 --> 01:14:17,569
that's why they invest in you obviously as a graduate trainee,

1535
01:14:17,569 --> 01:14:18,529
but you're right.

1536
01:14:18,569 --> 01:14:19,130
It was,

1537
01:14:19,869 --> 01:14:20,369
uh,

1538
01:14:20,569 --> 01:14:26,449
they were some incredibly influential and defining moments of my life being in PNG and then moving to,

1539
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:27,529
to Townsville and,

1540
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:28,069
and,

1541
01:14:28,069 --> 01:14:29,609
and running the show up there.

1542
01:14:30,109 --> 01:14:30,430
Uh,

1543
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:32,789
incredibly grateful that they gave me that opportunity.

1544
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:33,470
Um,

1545
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:34,250
and then,

1546
01:14:34,729 --> 01:14:34,949
yeah,

1547
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:35,329
as I said,

1548
01:14:35,329 --> 01:14:37,130
morphing into the AFL system,

1549
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:39,409
I wouldn't have got into sport,

1550
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:40,090
um,

1551
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:41,989
if it hadn't been for,

1552
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:43,090
um,

1553
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:44,470
Colin Carter in particular,

1554
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:45,090
who is the,

1555
01:14:45,289 --> 01:14:45,529
uh,

1556
01:14:45,529 --> 01:14:46,010
as you know,

1557
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:46,550
the ex,

1558
01:14:46,689 --> 01:14:47,189
um,

1559
01:14:47,329 --> 01:14:47,989
chairman of,

1560
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:48,529
of the,

1561
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:52,609
the cats and AFL commissioner and lucky enough to know him as a,

1562
01:14:53,109 --> 01:14:54,109
as a family friend.

1563
01:14:54,109 --> 01:14:54,310
And,

1564
01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:57,850
and he gave me the advice sport can wait.

1565
01:14:58,069 --> 01:14:58,550
Um,

1566
01:14:58,649 --> 01:15:01,489
go to New York and spend three years there with BP.

1567
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:05,630
Cause I had the opportunity with BP and I was really keen to get into sport and he's like rich,

1568
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:08,069
go and learn what it's like to,

1569
01:15:08,069 --> 01:15:11,510
to deliver on a global scale for,

1570
01:15:11,569 --> 01:15:13,850
for BP with Castro brand at the time.

1571
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:14,210
Uh,

1572
01:15:14,489 --> 01:15:16,050
and that was incredible advice and,

1573
01:15:16,489 --> 01:15:18,130
and absolutely right that yes,

1574
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:19,970
the AFL was still there when I came back,

1575
01:15:20,029 --> 01:15:27,409
but I had this breadth of experience about dealing in a different geography with different complexities and huge scale that I did,

1576
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:27,869
um,

1577
01:15:27,869 --> 01:15:29,369
from New York and,

1578
01:15:29,449 --> 01:15:32,750
and Colin was able to introduce me to a number of,

1579
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:33,149
um,

1580
01:15:33,149 --> 01:15:35,189
people within the AFL landscape.

1581
01:15:35,689 --> 01:15:36,050
Um,

1582
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:39,270
and there were probably only three or five people,

1583
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:46,710
but to crack into sport when you've been a BP dude for 12 years was incredibly hard.

1584
01:15:46,829 --> 01:15:46,850
And,

1585
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:47,130
you know,

1586
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:47,470
Darce,

1587
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:48,550
especially AFL,

1588
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:53,310
they only pretty much employed within ex players alumni.

1589
01:15:53,529 --> 01:15:56,949
That's how that's until literally 10 or 15 years ago,

1590
01:15:57,109 --> 01:15:57,850
the clubs,

1591
01:15:57,869 --> 01:16:00,310
would pretty much it was a close shop.

1592
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:03,750
And if you hadn't been a player or from another club,

1593
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:08,869
the chances of you getting a job in at the AFL at a club where we're negligible,

1594
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:10,609
almost impossible.

1595
01:16:10,609 --> 01:16:12,449
So to be able to make different people,

1596
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:16,270
including great recruiters that I've had the privilege of being able to,

1597
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:16,810
to meet,

1598
01:16:16,869 --> 01:16:17,350
um,

1599
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:22,989
like Paul Helen from six degrees who put me in front of Peter Jackson at the Essendon football club,

1600
01:16:23,029 --> 01:16:24,449
who he was CEO at the time.

1601
01:16:24,449 --> 01:16:25,590
And Peter was one of the,

1602
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:27,750
the guys who I would,

1603
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:30,029
count again as another amazing leader.

1604
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,470
And he had the foresight to say,

1605
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:31,789
well,

1606
01:16:31,789 --> 01:16:36,090
I actually don't want people from within the Essendon footy club as players to,

1607
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:37,590
to lead our administration.

1608
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:38,130
Um,

1609
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:41,989
so he put me in as he took a pun on me and put me in as chief commercial officer,

1610
01:16:42,449 --> 01:16:42,949
um,

1611
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:47,550
having no prior sports background other than a small stint at golf Australia.

1612
01:16:48,149 --> 01:16:48,430
But,

1613
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:49,470
um,

1614
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:50,550
if I look at him,

1615
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:52,069
I look at David Evans as well,

1616
01:16:52,069 --> 01:16:52,930
who came on as,

1617
01:16:52,949 --> 01:16:54,210
as chairman afterwards,

1618
01:16:54,289 --> 01:16:55,109
I see in,

1619
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:56,869
in those people and Colin Carter,

1620
01:16:56,869 --> 01:16:57,869
uh,

1621
01:16:57,869 --> 01:17:02,329
an enormous amount of integrity would be the word I would use more than anything else.

1622
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:02,930
Um,

1623
01:17:03,529 --> 01:17:08,550
knowing that they had a moral compass that was similar to mine,

1624
01:17:08,949 --> 01:17:09,609
um,

1625
01:17:09,789 --> 01:17:11,569
that they were,

1626
01:17:11,569 --> 01:17:13,649
um,

1627
01:17:14,449 --> 01:17:15,109
passionate,

1628
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:18,949
but not blindsided by what they believed in.

1629
01:17:19,329 --> 01:17:19,710
Um,

1630
01:17:19,869 --> 01:17:23,090
and I learned a lot from those people,

1631
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:23,609
uh,

1632
01:17:23,609 --> 01:17:24,890
in particular because of,

1633
01:17:25,489 --> 01:17:25,829
um,

1634
01:17:25,829 --> 01:17:26,850
how resolute they,

1635
01:17:26,869 --> 01:17:27,409
they were and,

1636
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:28,710
and how strong they were as,

1637
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:29,289
as leaders.

1638
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:30,029
Um,

1639
01:17:30,210 --> 01:17:31,310
and it's funny,

1640
01:17:31,369 --> 01:17:32,390
you look back on your career,

1641
01:17:32,489 --> 01:17:35,949
especially after we had the life changing moment with exponential where we had the,

1642
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:36,729
you know,

1643
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:36,890
the,

1644
01:17:36,909 --> 01:17:39,029
the big opportunity to get some investment from,

1645
01:17:39,229 --> 01:17:39,890
from them and,

1646
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:41,029
and life changing.

1647
01:17:41,109 --> 01:17:41,590
As I said,

1648
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:43,090
you look back and you think,

1649
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:48,770
who are those people in my life that actually allowed me to get to where I was and,

1650
01:17:48,989 --> 01:17:49,430
and,

1651
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:51,329
and they were some of the people who,

1652
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:52,170
you know,

1653
01:17:52,189 --> 01:17:55,149
I absolutely owe so much to,

1654
01:17:55,149 --> 01:17:56,850
because without their,

1655
01:17:56,869 --> 01:17:59,090
their influence and support,

1656
01:17:59,149 --> 01:17:59,770
um,

1657
01:17:59,789 --> 01:18:00,010
you know,

1658
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:00,869
David through,

1659
01:18:00,869 --> 01:18:02,229
um,

1660
01:18:02,789 --> 01:18:04,149
and Ian Robson as well,

1661
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:04,569
obviously,

1662
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:05,130
um,

1663
01:18:05,149 --> 01:18:05,590
as our,

1664
01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:06,350
as our CEO,

1665
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:07,390
but David in particular,

1666
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:08,550
I remember him saying to me,

1667
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:09,050
um,

1668
01:18:09,529 --> 01:18:11,430
when we were talking about,

1669
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:11,829
uh,

1670
01:18:11,829 --> 01:18:13,170
the boys and then passing away,

1671
01:18:13,229 --> 01:18:13,789
he said to me,

1672
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:18,010
if you ever just need to go on the longterm injury list for any period of time,

1673
01:18:18,449 --> 01:18:19,630
your job's still going to be here.

1674
01:18:19,689 --> 01:18:20,130
Just go,

1675
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:20,810
you know,

1676
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:23,909
and Peter was there with me at,

1677
01:18:23,909 --> 01:18:26,529
at the start when I found out about the boys.

1678
01:18:26,529 --> 01:18:26,750
And for him,

1679
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:29,010
for him just to be rock solid in,

1680
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:29,510
okay,

1681
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:30,149
let's,

1682
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:32,149
let's do this and let's do it together.

1683
01:18:32,229 --> 01:18:33,050
You got a job to do.

1684
01:18:33,109 --> 01:18:34,649
And he kept me focused on the job,

1685
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,369
which was his massive distraction for me,

1686
01:18:36,409 --> 01:18:37,970
which was probably the only thing that got me through.

1687
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:38,829
Whereas Danielle had,

1688
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:39,750
you know,

1689
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:43,109
12 years of having to be at home with sick kids.

1690
01:18:43,109 --> 01:18:44,810
And that was her purpose in life.

1691
01:18:44,829 --> 01:18:46,029
But for me,

1692
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,630
without that distraction of,

1693
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:49,670
of being at the,

1694
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:50,510
at the bombers,

1695
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:51,229
um,

1696
01:18:51,289 --> 01:18:51,989
and then at the,

1697
01:18:52,050 --> 01:18:53,609
at the giants and Gil saying,

1698
01:18:53,689 --> 01:18:53,770
Hey,

1699
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:53,970
Rich,

1700
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:55,630
come to the giants whenever you need.

1701
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:55,729
And,

1702
01:18:55,729 --> 01:18:55,770
and,

1703
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:55,829
and,

1704
01:18:55,829 --> 01:18:56,229
and,

1705
01:18:56,229 --> 01:18:56,289
and,

1706
01:18:56,289 --> 01:18:56,329
and,

1707
01:18:56,329 --> 01:18:56,350
and,

1708
01:18:56,350 --> 01:18:56,369
and,

1709
01:18:56,369 --> 01:18:56,430
and,

1710
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:56,449
and,

1711
01:18:56,449 --> 01:18:56,470
and,

1712
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:56,529
and,

1713
01:18:56,529 --> 01:18:56,569
and,

1714
01:18:56,569 --> 01:18:56,590
and,

1715
01:18:56,590 --> 01:18:56,609
and,

1716
01:18:56,609 --> 01:18:56,630
and,

1717
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:56,649
and,

1718
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:56,670
and,

1719
01:18:56,670 --> 01:18:56,770
and,

1720
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:56,829
and,

1721
01:18:56,829 --> 01:18:56,850
and,

1722
01:18:56,850 --> 01:18:56,869
and,

1723
01:18:56,869 --> 01:18:56,890
and,

1724
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:56,909
and,

1725
01:18:56,909 --> 01:18:58,090
and,

1726
01:18:58,090 --> 01:18:58,109
and,

1727
01:18:58,109 --> 01:18:58,130
and,

1728
01:18:58,130 --> 01:18:58,149
and,

1729
01:18:58,149 --> 01:18:58,189
and,

1730
01:18:58,189 --> 01:18:58,210
and,

1731
01:18:58,210 --> 01:18:58,229
and,

1732
01:18:58,229 --> 01:18:58,289
and,

1733
01:18:58,289 --> 01:18:58,310
and,

1734
01:18:58,310 --> 01:18:58,329
and,

1735
01:18:58,329 --> 01:18:58,350
and,

1736
01:18:58,350 --> 01:18:58,630
and,

1737
01:18:58,630 --> 01:18:58,649
and,

1738
01:18:58,649 --> 01:18:58,670
and,

1739
01:18:58,670 --> 01:18:58,689
and,

1740
01:18:58,689 --> 01:19:00,329
I don't think I would have been able to get

1741
01:19:00,329 --> 01:19:00,689
through,

1742
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:01,189
um,

1743
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:03,229
anywhere near as in the way that Danielle did

1744
01:19:03,229 --> 01:19:05,310
because I needed that distraction.

1745
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:06,250
I needed an outlet.

1746
01:19:06,689 --> 01:19:07,050
Um,

1747
01:19:07,130 --> 01:19:08,670
I don't think I could have coped and we both

1748
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:09,350
couldn't have hoped,

1749
01:19:09,489 --> 01:19:12,390
coped sort of being at home in each other's,

1750
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:12,810
um,

1751
01:19:13,710 --> 01:19:14,210
spaces.

1752
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:16,789
So to have a real outlet at,

1753
01:19:17,109 --> 01:19:17,489
um,

1754
01:19:17,489 --> 01:19:19,470
in my corporate life,

1755
01:19:19,529 --> 01:19:20,949
thanks to those leaders who,

1756
01:19:21,109 --> 01:19:23,289
who really believed in me and,

1757
01:19:23,289 --> 01:19:25,409
and showed me how to be a true leader,

1758
01:19:25,569 --> 01:19:27,069
I'll be really thankful forever.

1759
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:27,510
Well,

1760
01:19:27,550 --> 01:19:28,810
I love asking that question because,

1761
01:19:28,949 --> 01:19:29,229
you know,

1762
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:31,829
to take the time to actually say those names out loud,

1763
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:32,050
I,

1764
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:34,470
I know that would mean a huge amount to a lot of those

1765
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:35,189
people I know,

1766
01:19:35,329 --> 01:19:35,930
uh,

1767
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:36,689
really well,

1768
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:40,189
but no one gets through without influential people on the

1769
01:19:40,189 --> 01:19:40,430
journey,

1770
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:40,829
do they?

1771
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:42,369
And I don't know the BP guys,

1772
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:43,569
but that seems like,

1773
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:43,970
uh,

1774
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:46,390
such a life changing experience as much as the,

1775
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:46,630
uh,

1776
01:19:47,069 --> 01:19:47,229
you know,

1777
01:19:47,229 --> 01:19:47,470
the AFL,

1778
01:19:47,489 --> 01:19:49,289
the AFL guys who I know a bit better are in your

1779
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:49,569
corner.

1780
01:19:49,689 --> 01:19:51,750
I'm not surprised by that's the community I know

1781
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:52,029
well,

1782
01:19:52,069 --> 01:19:53,710
and it's full of people with big hearts and,

1783
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:55,069
and great values.

1784
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:55,250
I,

1785
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:56,590
the values comes up a lot with you.

1786
01:19:56,829 --> 01:19:58,149
I asked this question as well,

1787
01:19:58,149 --> 01:19:59,930
because we're a bit obsessed with what we do at a

1788
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:00,949
leader about collaboration,

1789
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:01,529
rich,

1790
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,770
and you've just done an international collaboration.

1791
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:05,090
I'm not familiar with,

1792
01:20:05,189 --> 01:20:05,369
uh,

1793
01:20:05,609 --> 01:20:06,010
high rocks.

1794
01:20:06,109 --> 01:20:06,430
Is that right?

1795
01:20:06,489 --> 01:20:06,689
Yeah.

1796
01:20:06,729 --> 01:20:09,829
It sounds fascinating to see what BFT and high rocks

1797
01:20:09,829 --> 01:20:10,430
do together.

1798
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:11,569
But if you looked at it and thought,

1799
01:20:11,649 --> 01:20:13,369
if I could collaborate with anyone on anything,

1800
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:14,489
uh,

1801
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:16,710
I'm assuming BFT will be close to your heart with

1802
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:16,850
this,

1803
01:20:16,930 --> 01:20:17,350
but it could be,

1804
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:18,510
it could be on any other area of your life.

1805
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:21,109
Is there a name or a space that you've thought of

1806
01:20:21,109 --> 01:20:21,390
or not?

1807
01:20:21,569 --> 01:20:21,750
Yeah.

1808
01:20:21,789 --> 01:20:23,569
Get me the rock or someone like that.

1809
01:20:24,449 --> 01:20:24,850
We'll,

1810
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:27,449
we'll maybe give him a few BFT franchises,

1811
01:20:27,529 --> 01:20:29,350
although we've never given any away to us.

1812
01:20:29,449 --> 01:20:30,710
We have never once given,

1813
01:20:30,970 --> 01:20:31,189
we've,

1814
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:32,989
we've stayed true to being fair to everyone and

1815
01:20:32,989 --> 01:20:34,510
never given them any away.

1816
01:20:34,649 --> 01:20:34,770
We,

1817
01:20:34,869 --> 01:20:38,430
we always value them and are consistent with the

1818
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:40,149
pricing and the contract and the structure,

1819
01:20:40,189 --> 01:20:40,930
but give me the rock.

1820
01:20:41,649 --> 01:20:41,810
Yeah.

1821
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:42,449
I reckon I'd,

1822
01:20:42,729 --> 01:20:44,229
I reckon I'd do something for the,

1823
01:20:44,329 --> 01:20:44,609
uh,

1824
01:20:44,609 --> 01:20:45,210
for the rock.

1825
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:45,710
Um,

1826
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:47,329
he'd be great to collaborate with.

1827
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:49,810
He just seems like this absolute machine who

1828
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:52,229
anything he touches seems to turn to,

1829
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:52,829
to gold.

1830
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:53,590
um,

1831
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:54,989
how big a community is he?

1832
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:56,130
Oh my gosh.

1833
01:20:56,449 --> 01:20:56,930
Unbelievable.

1834
01:20:57,069 --> 01:20:58,710
Hundreds of millions of people follow him,

1835
01:20:58,770 --> 01:20:59,090
don't they,

1836
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:00,069
on a daily basis.

1837
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:01,229
And yeah,

1838
01:21:01,229 --> 01:21:02,729
he'd be pretty cool.

1839
01:21:03,289 --> 01:21:03,630
Um,

1840
01:21:04,829 --> 01:21:05,229
yeah.

1841
01:21:05,289 --> 01:21:06,430
And then our other one,

1842
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:06,770
give me,

1843
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:10,529
give me someone who can help us navigate how to

1844
01:21:10,529 --> 01:21:13,670
get into other countries where language is,

1845
01:21:13,729 --> 01:21:14,270
um,

1846
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:16,909
not English because that's proving incredibly

1847
01:21:16,909 --> 01:21:17,289
challenging.

1848
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:18,510
For Cam and I at the moment,

1849
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:19,630
it's going to be a whole new,

1850
01:21:20,409 --> 01:21:22,430
whole new ball game for us because you just,

1851
01:21:22,430 --> 01:21:23,430
this whole complexity,

1852
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:23,689
right?

1853
01:21:23,689 --> 01:21:26,970
Of translations and contracts and documents and support,

1854
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:29,350
and even the screens who have got instructions,

1855
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:29,789
everything.

1856
01:21:29,789 --> 01:21:32,390
So I know they're probably not too great answers,

1857
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:32,649
but,

1858
01:21:32,829 --> 01:21:33,329
um,

1859
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:34,029
they're brilliant.

1860
01:21:34,210 --> 01:21:34,470
Yeah.

1861
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:34,770
That's,

1862
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:35,970
that's where we're at at the moment.

1863
01:21:36,069 --> 01:21:36,270
That's,

1864
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:37,109
that's my wishlist.

1865
01:21:37,449 --> 01:21:37,710
Uh,

1866
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:38,670
rich has been a great,

1867
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:39,069
uh,

1868
01:21:39,229 --> 01:21:40,989
privilege to sit down with you and,

1869
01:21:40,989 --> 01:21:41,390
uh,

1870
01:21:41,409 --> 01:21:42,189
I've enjoyed,

1871
01:21:42,229 --> 01:21:42,489
uh,

1872
01:21:42,489 --> 01:21:44,409
the interactions over the years and,

1873
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:44,949
um,

1874
01:21:45,029 --> 01:21:45,350
yeah,

1875
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:46,869
the heart's always gone out,

1876
01:21:46,869 --> 01:21:49,670
but to hear the way you and Danielle and have thrived,

1877
01:21:49,829 --> 01:21:50,550
not only in your life,

1878
01:21:50,609 --> 01:21:53,569
but to understand your values and why they're so important to you.

1879
01:21:53,630 --> 01:21:56,329
It makes a lot of sense to see this sustained success.

1880
01:21:56,329 --> 01:21:57,310
And I get the feeling,

1881
01:21:57,529 --> 01:21:58,109
whatever happens,

1882
01:21:58,189 --> 01:21:59,430
nothing's going to change who you are,

1883
01:21:59,489 --> 01:22:00,489
which is a great credit to you.

1884
01:22:00,529 --> 01:22:01,130
So thanks again,

1885
01:22:01,189 --> 01:22:01,329
mate.

1886
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:02,850
I've really enjoyed catching up today.

1887
01:22:03,109 --> 01:22:03,350
Thanks,

1888
01:22:03,449 --> 01:22:03,630
Das.
