1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:11,019
I think the best leaders we've had in our country, a Bob Hawke or a Keating or a Howard,

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,640
they're not tortured in their language and they know what they believe in and they're

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,179
willing to fight for it.

4
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:25,620
And sometimes you can get yourself in trouble because it's not filtered or there's a full

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,359
stop instead of a comma, so the qualification in the sentence is not included in the grab

6
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:30,839
on the news.

7
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:36,780
And sometimes, you know, I listen to the PM at the moment and I think he's trying to

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,119
please everyone on the issue and you've got to stand up for what you believe in and you're

9
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:43,060
not going to please everyone.

10
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:46,719
And if you're trying to please everyone, then generally it means you haven't arrived at

11
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,380
the right outcome.

12
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:54,439
So I think decomplicate it and don't forget where you've come from and keep your feet

13
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:54,859
on the ground.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,719
I think they're always good lessons.

15
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,060
Hello, welcome to another episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,599
At Alita, we are passionate about inspiring connections and creating a world of collaboration.

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,920
Our signature program, Alita Connect, curates groups of five to six leaders from diverse

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,120
backgrounds in sport, industry, social venture and the arts who come together to learn, to

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
connect and to collaborate.

20
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,079
Dr. Troy Flanagan, Vice President of Performance for the Milwaukee Bucks.

21
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,060
I've probably had some of the most radical changes out of that leadership group.

22
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,060
The significance of their work and how much it's really about helping others.

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,640
It made me think, what else could I be doing?

24
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,799
And I approached our owner and within a few weeks, we'd raised $5 million to try and solve

25
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,760
obesity in the underprivileged community in Milwaukee.

26
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:49,519
So that's one spark that that leadership course has caused to contribute and leave the world

27
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,400
as a better place.

28
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,680
Umrah Omer, founder of Safari Doctors.

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,799
It defines the word creativity for me.

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,700
The ability to like see connections.

31
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,560
Where none seem to exist.

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,819
And I think that's the magic of Alita.

33
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:11,740
Definitely not my usual, you know, workshop panels like humanitarian spaces, but more

34
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,379
of an intentional dissection of leadership.

35
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:21,460
The Empowering Leaders podcast is proudly brought to you by Victoria University, where

36
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:27,599
cutting edge sports and exercise science facilities like heat chambers, performance labs and altitude

37
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,539
environments mean VU is ranked seventh in the world.

38
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:29,479
And that's the magic of Alita.

39
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:29,500
Thank you.

40
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:29,539
Thank you.

41
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:29,599
Thank you.

42
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:29,639
Thank you.

43
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:29,659
Thank you.

44
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:29,719
Thank you.

Thank you.

46

Thank you.

47
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:29,879
Thank you.

48
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,180
Thank you.

49
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,199
Thank you.

50
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:31,479
Thank you.

51
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:31,520
Thank you.

52
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,659
Thank you.

53
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:33,719
Thank you.

54
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:33,740
Thank you.

55
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:33,819
Thank you.

56
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:33,840
Thank you.

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:33,979
Thank you.

58
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:34,020
Thank you.

59
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,120
Thank you.

60
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,199
Thank you.

61
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:34,240
Thank you.

62
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,259
Thank you.

63
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:34,319
Thank you.

64
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,780
As always, a big thank you to Jason Nicholas and his team at Tempur-Bedding, a mattress

65
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,580
like no other.

69
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,189
Peter Dutton is hoping to be the next Prime Minister of Australia.

70
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,129
And on the Empowering Leaders podcast, we aim to tell great leadership stories.

71
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:01,750
We have invited the current Prime Minister of Australia, Peter Dutton.

72
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,330
current Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, and hope to have him on the podcast as well soon.

73
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:11,210
Peter, I first met you around 12 years ago, and we share a great mutual friend,

74
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,629
Geoffrey Thomas, who we were just talking about before we hit record. And over the last 10 years,

75
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:21,289
I've had the great pleasure of meeting Kiralee and your family. And declaring this interview,

76
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:26,849
I consider you a friend. And I think when people ask me about Peter Dutton, the words I use is

77
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:33,789
the most misrepresented person in public life that I've ever met. In a short space of time,

78
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,590
you're a great chance to be the next Prime Minister of Australia. I thought I'd start with,

79
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,969
in your own words, what's Peter Dutton really like?

80
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:45,909
Well, Darce, great to be with you. Thank you, mate. And thanks for your leadership. But

81
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:51,409
look, I think people can get to know you through longer form interviews. And

82
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:56,830
instead of just the soundbites on a package, you know, TV of a night time in the news,

83
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:02,069
and as the campaign goes on, I hope people can see more of my story and who I am and my

84
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:06,110
background. And people can make their own judgments instead of being defined by your

85
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:13,810
opponents or those who have an axe to grind. So I'm a pretty open book. I'm not too complicated

86
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:20,089
in that sense. I'm just happy to be open and honest about my values, what I stand for. And

87
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:25,730
that's the basis on which I make decisions. And people, as I say, can draw a positive or

88
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,829
negative conclusion out of that.

89
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:33,250
I don't sort of, I've never gone into politics to crave that popularity or that recognition.

90
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:39,250
It's just, that's not been part of my, you know, my sort of being. And I'm pretty

91
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,589
comfortable in my own skin.

92
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:47,550
Your wife clearly described you as this, relaxed, very gentle, empathetic. He's a great mate. He's

93
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,050
a good son. He's an excellent dad. And that's the person that I've met. As you said just then,

94
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,470
the opposition did this, maybe too good a job of painting of some sort of

95
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:02,910
Batman villain at times. And do you think that now in these sort of formats,

96
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:04,949
people are starting to see the real version of you?

97
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:09,230
Yeah, I think so. I think people stop you and say, oh, I heard that interview the other day,

98
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,949
and I didn't know this about you. I hadn't heard that before. And it's funny because I've been in

99
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:21,730
public life for over 23 years or so. And people have seen me through the lens of being the sports

100
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,430
minister or immigration minister or health minister or home affairs minister, defence

101
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,370
minister, whatever it might be, that sort of snapshot and that point in time. And leader of

102
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,750
the house. I mean, some of these roles, you sort of take on the attack dog role, which is a necessary

103
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:44,790
one in the parliament. It's an adversarial environment. And I've always said that I went in

104
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:52,550
to politics, not wanting to sit on the fence, but stand up for what I believe in. And it's a game of

105
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,129
of tackle, not touch.

106
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:02,769
If you, you know, if you walk away with your head held high, didn't make every call as you would want

107
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:08,589
in hindsight, but not to live with those regrets. And yeah, I think that's, people can appreciate

108
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:08,889
that.

109
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,810
First thing, whenever I see you always ask about family, as you did first thing this morning,

110
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:17,189
I just thought you could go back and tell us about your extended family,

111
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:20,750
mum and dad and your siblings growing up and your current family.

112
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:26,149
Yeah, so pretty humble, sort of out of suburbs upbringing. And, you know,

113
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:26,449
dad was a big fan of my dad. He was a big fan of my dad. He was a big fan of my dad.

114
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:33,290
Worked hard. Mum worked hard. Raised five kids and really, you know, they sacrificed and went

115
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:39,930
without to give us a good education, sort of, I guess, second tier school, not sort of first tier

116
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:45,449
private schools that they couldn't afford back in the day. But, you know, mum took in kids as a

117
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:50,930
family daycare mum to pull some extra dollars together to save to send us to school. Dad

118
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,949
started out as a bricklayer and a builder and ultimately was, you know,

119
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:01,689
successful in, through hard work and his endeavours and, you know, with mum's support. So

120
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:09,050
that was the grounding. It was a, you know, a carefree life and jumping on the bike and

121
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:15,910
playing backyard cricket until dark, you know, jumping around in the pool, the above ground pool

122
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:22,889
in those days in the backyard. And, you know, I think it gives you an appreciation,

123
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,449
A, of what you've got now, but also,

124
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:31,389
that there are a lot of people in humble households right now who are really doing it tough.

125
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,009
Oldest of five?

126
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:33,490
Yes.

127
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:34,449
Are you close to the siblings?

128
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:40,709
Yeah, I am. Yeah, I am. And there's 10 years between myself and my youngest sister

129
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:48,329
and they're all different, different jobs. And, but we've always remained close. And my mum and

130
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:54,750
dad separated when I finished year 12 in 1987. Sort of, you know, I guess one of those

131
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,930
family days.

132
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:03,189
It's one of those dynamics where you wait until, you know, you finished year 12 before they separated.

133
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:10,269
And that was, you know, that was a messy situation. And for us as siblings, it probably drew us

134
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:18,529
closer together. But we grew up as kids with a really close relationship with our cousins. And

135
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:24,970
that was, you know, a real highlight for me as a child growing up. And

136
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:30,050
I've wanted that for our kids as well, to be close to, you know, my, my brother and sisters,

137
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:34,370
their kids. And they are, and it's nice to see them together and, you know,

138
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:40,190
seeing them playing together. And it's also the highlight for, you know, we sort of congregate

139
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:46,149
largely at dad's place and, and, you know, it's the joy of his life as well. And it's good to

140
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:50,830
see him enjoying the grandkids and the joy that comes with seeing all of them together.

141
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:55,730
I think, Peter, that immediately it humanises people when you know their backstory,

142
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:01,710
and, and, and even your own, you were married at 23 for a short time. And I think

143
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:07,149
Rebecca, your beautiful daughter was with a partner you're engaged with, and you meet Kiraly

144
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:12,230
pretty soon after, who's been your lifelong partner. You had the two boys with, that's a

145
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,870
bit of complexity for a young man at that stage, mate. How did you, how'd you work your way through

146
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:22,070
all that? I didn't do too well to start with. So I was married at 23 and, and we'd, we'd sort of

147
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,649
lived together for, I don't know, 12, 18 months or something before that.

148
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:31,250
And I, you know, I picked my then wife up from, she was a nurse and picked her up from work one day

149
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:38,269
and after a night shift and she just said, look, I don't love you anymore. And I tried to work on

150
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:43,809
that, but it just didn't work. And, and I was working two jobs. I was, you know, you know,

151
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:49,889
keen to make money and, and try and set ourselves up. She wanted to travel and, and it was just,

152
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,289
you know, we were too young for that relationship. And, and it was,

153
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,629
yeah, it was confronting because I'd always, particularly with my parents having separated,

154
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:05,409
which really, you know, upset and, and, and, you know, and I didn't cope with that well

155
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:11,370
at the time as a, as a 17 year old. And I always thought, you know, I wanted to get married and I

156
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:17,309
wanted to be for life and I wanted to raise a big family and, and, and that wasn't the case. And

157
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:19,850
yeah, so that was- Did it knock you around?

158
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,289
Yeah, it did. And it, yeah, it sort of, it takes,

159
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:32,529
takes a while to recover from that. And, you know, that I guess you, you deal with all those

160
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:37,570
knockbacks and setbacks. And, and when you look at it with the benefit of hindsight,

161
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:43,409
it was just a level of immaturity and, and, you know, there was no third parties or anything

162
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:49,350
like that. It was just, just the reality of, for me, working two jobs and working hard and,

163
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,190
and, and yeah, it just, we were together at the wrong time.

164
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,929
One of those two jobs was as a police officer.

165
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,450
Yeah.

166
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:01,970
You started out, I know you, you spent some time as a kid working in a butcher shop as well. What,

167
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,710
what drew you to, to want to be in uniform and tell us about that time?

168
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:11,210
But I'd wanted to be a policeman from a young age. I don't know why. I mean, I listened to my

169
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:16,450
mother's advice, which you should always do, I suppose, but, you know, no one in our family

170
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:22,149
had been to university before and she was keen for me to go and, and, you know, and I was keen

171
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:25,929
to go too. But I started out doing a bachelor of business. I really wanted to go to university.

172
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,850
I wanted to go to the police academy, but, but she wanted me to do that. And, and it was good

173
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:35,429
advice. I did it for two years and I, I was majoring in accountancy, which I didn't enjoy.

174
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:43,330
So I decided to, to defer and I finished my degree later on, but I went into policing because I

175
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:49,230
couldn't see myself, you know, sitting in a bank nine to five behind a desk or an accountancy firm

176
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,789
or something like that. I, and, and I liked the, you know, sort of the pace or the excitement or

177
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:55,929
the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you

178
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:03,450
know, the, the unknown factor within a policing career. And that's, I guess what I enjoyed. And

179
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:08,230
it's a little bit like this job. You don't know what the news cycle holds today. You don't know

180
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:13,009
the next question in a, in an, in an interview, which is not encouragement to ask a horrible

181
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:18,409
question, but, but as a policeman, you just don't know what that next radio call is going to be or

182
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:24,889
what's behind that door that, you know, that you're about to, to enter. And there is, for me,

183
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:28,509
I've, you know, I've always sort of been attracted to that, um, to that dynamic.

184
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:34,129
The, the theme that I understand runs through your life as a, as a policeman, you were

185
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:40,789
zero tolerance on violence against women and children and, and fast track to your political

186
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:45,029
life. I want to ask you about what I think might be one of your proudest achievements, the

187
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:49,990
formation of ACE, the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation. It's a,

188
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:53,750
it's a hundred million dollar investment. It's regarded as a global leader in that space.

189
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:54,830
Is that,

190
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:58,269
is that the reason why you're drawn to politics, the chance to, to do things like that?

191
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:03,009
Yeah, uh, short answer is yes. And, uh, I'm incredibly proud of what, you know, the work

192
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:08,450
that the, the police and the analysts and, uh, all of the tech people do. And, and for those,

193
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,309
you know, who aren't aware of the work, it's really interesting to have a look at them online,

194
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:16,710
actually, because they are, it's, it's a function of the Australian Federal Police

195
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:24,269
and they counter child exploitation here, but in the region as well. So, uh, they,

196
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:24,870
you know,

197
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:29,870
I think they've, they've saved now over 1500 lives of, of young kids that were in the hands

198
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,669
of pedophiles or subject to those networks. And the, the technical aspect of it, where they can

199
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:41,929
look at a photo, an image, uh, of a child sitting at the end of a bed or, uh, in a car, and they can

200
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:49,110
analyse that to try and identify where, you know, and, and the circumstances, um, of, of, you know,

201
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:54,610
that child being at risk and how they can recover that child. It's the talent and the expertise is

202
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,929
amazing, but it was underfunded and it wasn't a priority. Uh, and when I came into that portfolio

203
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:04,450
and had responsibility for the federal police, I, I really, well, I gave it a direction to the

204
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:09,190
commissioner to prioritise that because in my household, you know, we, we were just very

205
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:15,789
fortunate that, you know, it, you know, there was no sexual abuse that, that I was aware of in my

206
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:21,610
world I'd never seen, or I probably had a pretty naive upbringing, but, but as a police officer,

207
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,509
a 19 year old, uh, you know,

208
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,830
walking into domestic violence situations and seeing blood splattered across the walls or

209
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:35,549
kids screaming and, you know, uh, you know, grabbing onto mum or dad's leg, uh, as, you know,

210
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:41,289
people are fighting, all of that is just horrible and scars you. And, uh, and I'd work then in the

211
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:46,549
sex offender squad, uh, where you're taking statements from rape victims or visiting crime

212
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:52,269
scenes and, uh, interviewing offenders and taking people through the courts and the frustration of

213
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:54,590
that process when, uh, there's not,

214
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,110
an adequate sentence given at the end of it. And so, yes, I mean, that, that's been a driver for me

215
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:04,049
and the protection of women and children, I think is paramount because I think the, the, the protection

216
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:09,730
of that innocence of their upbringing and allowing them to be children, uh, and allowing women to,

217
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:15,070
uh, you know, to live their lives freely as, uh, as, as most men would expect. I just think it's

218
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,649
a human right and it's, it's, it's not a given, unfortunately.

219
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,970
Bizarrely, uh, I used to sit in a breakfast radio studio, Peter, for 11 years and, and you read the

220
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:24,590
paper front and center, and it's, it's, it's not a given, unfortunately.

221
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:30,230
Every day because you're looking at the news. Hidden on page 18 would be some horrific,

222
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:35,230
you know, child sex offense that had two, two paragraphs. On the front page would be

223
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,889
some footballer, you know, with a new girlfriend and you, and you think,

224
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:44,970
have we got our priorities so wrong? It doesn't seem as though the, the thing that I know drives

225
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,029
you gets the attention from mainstream. Have you got a theory on that?

226
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:52,809
Uh, yeah, look, I do. And I, I think it's a, it's a real societal issue because

227
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:54,570
at one level it's understandable.

228
00:15:54,590 --> 00:16:10,950
At dinner parties, you know, people will be talking about, you know, houses being broken into or cars being stolen or the, you know, the gangland wars or the tobacco shop, you know, arsons, whatever it might be, because it's in the news.

229
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,950
People can see the footage and, you know, it affects them.

230
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:32,370
But the next conversation about the pedophile ring that's just been discovered and the child that's been sexually abused, understandably, people don't want to talk about that either in front of their children or at a dinner party where people are trying to enjoy each other at a barbecue, whatever it might be.

231
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:37,909
And it's wrong because we have to lift the veil.

232
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:43,929
The images of these offenders are blurred out because the law requires that to be.

233
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,830
The names are normally protected.

234
00:16:46,070 --> 00:17:02,330
And so the footage is, you know, there's no CCTV from the robbery at the service station that people can see and conceptualize and see the violence that, you know, that was the subject of that crime.

235
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:11,490
And so I just think as a society, we have to accept that this is a very significant, you know, crime type.

236
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,769
And it really, yeah.

237
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:27,390
It upsets me that we don't talk more about it because I think the awareness, encouraging children to speak up, encouraging adults to look for signs, all of that hopefully would lead to a reduction in the incidents.

238
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,170
But sadly, it doesn't.

239
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:36,869
I want to chat to you about, you know, a few of the issues that you seem to find clarity on whether people agree with you or not.

240
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:43,750
We caught up, I don't know if you remember, had a beer in the city in Melbourne and the voice to parliament had just been,

241
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:49,230
and you asked me about it and I really hadn't understood it at all.

242
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:57,670
And the idea that our Indigenous brothers and sisters would have a voice in the government of Australia and on the surface, everyone who cares about Indigenous Australians,

243
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:02,069
immediately you think about what you can do and what that means.

244
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:10,069
You just come back from visiting a number of the remote Indigenous communities and mid-sentence you stopped and you actually had a tear.

245
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:13,069
And you were talking about just how horrific.

246
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:17,390
Some of the circumstances that you'd seen, where and how much it affected you.

247
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,329
And yet in public life, you were opposed to the voice.

248
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:24,529
And I think someone in parliament would have even called you a racist at the time.

249
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:33,089
And I'm just, this theme of this person I know that cares deeply versus this image is polar opposites.

250
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,529
Can you tell us about how you arrived to that decision?

251
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:36,750
So just go back a second though.

252
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:43,150
We caught up for a beer and I think you introduced me to some low-carb trendy beer that I hadn't had before.

253
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,390
Yeah.

254
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:43,769
Which you got.

255
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:45,069
Which you graciously said was okay.

256
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:47,890
I gave you a gluten-free beer, mate, and you went, mate.

257
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:48,609
I sucked it down.

258
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,170
It was okay.

259
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,150
Yeah.

260
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:55,890
So look, mate, every Australian wants a better outcome for Indigenous Australians.

261
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,250
And it's not a lack of money.

262
00:18:58,329 --> 00:18:59,170
The money is there.

263
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:05,269
And it's this huge funnel that just becomes a drip at the end when you get to these communities.

264
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:13,670
And you go up to a place like Gove to Unupingu land and you look at the great work that he did during his life.

265
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:18,890
His lifetime and what his brothers and others are doing there now.

266
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:21,630
But there's a 90% attendance rate at school.

267
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:29,769
I walked into a classroom where these young kids were preparing for a robotics competition

268
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,269
in the United States.

269
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:36,569
They were travelling from this little Indigenous community to the US and they were just beaming

270
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:37,250
with excitement.

271
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,809
And they were in uniform.

272
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:43,089
And, you know.

273
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:51,130
Barker College had a relationship with this local school and it was just an amazing demonstration

274
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:56,569
of leadership within a community where they had a sustainable logging business, a building

275
00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:03,829
business, the streets were clean, health services were provided, and it was a functioning society.

276
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:09,609
And I was in that classroom with those kids and I don't mind saying, I went to the side

277
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:19,049
and I can be a bit emotional sometimes, but I had to compose myself because what I'd seen

278
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:23,930
there compared to what I'd seen only a couple of hours by plane away in other communities

279
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,309
was just chalk and cheese.

280
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:33,829
And in some communities where you've got kids who are living in complete squalor, kids who

281
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:39,150
are out breaking into homes or businesses and stealing cars over nighttime because they're

282
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:39,589
afraid to go.

283
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:44,609
They're afraid to go home to an unsafe environment and they sleep during the day, therefore they

284
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:45,130
miss school.

285
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:52,210
And the contrast, it just really hit me that why can these kids live a life that we would

286
00:20:52,210 --> 00:21:00,470
expect for all of our kids, but exactly the same kids, Australians, each one of them in

287
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:06,009
another community like Alice Springs can't enjoy that normality.

288
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:09,410
And so I just thought the voice was...

289
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:17,910
Ultimately more about the elites than it was about those kids and about their parents.

290
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:22,609
And you speak to the elderly women and the elders otherwise in the communities and the

291
00:21:22,609 --> 00:21:26,170
town camps, they want what every parent does across the country.

292
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:29,009
They want a stable home environment.

293
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:31,410
They want an education for their kids.

294
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,730
They want health.

295
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:38,970
They want running water and they want to have jobs there for their kids as they graduate

296
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,670
from school.

297
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:46,970
And the whole conversation is diverted by a group of people that care more about themselves

298
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,990
than the people they're supposed to represent.

299
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,890
And I want to see those kids going into a trade.

300
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,890
I want to see them going to university.

301
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:58,549
I want to see them enjoying the normality of life.

302
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:00,869
And I don't think that's too much to ask for.

303
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:05,170
And I just thought the voice was going to be an entrenchment or an enshrinement in the

304
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,470
constitution of something that was going to set back.

305
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,990
I don't think that's going to set back the prospects of Indigenous people for a long

306
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,990
time.

307
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:19,029
But you've been handed the tough portfolios traditionally of defence and immigration and

308
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:22,410
these complex issues, just like the one you described then.

309
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:29,230
And you have a way of seeing through difficult issues, even when they're really emotional.

310
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:34,950
When we've got people detained on places like Manus Highland and immigration detention centres,

311
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,329
anyone understands how horrific that is.

312
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:38,329
How do you...

313
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:43,549
Even when you sit in those leadership roles, how do you come to a clear decision?

314
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:46,710
Do you wrestle with that or how would you explain something like that?

315
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,109
Look, they're tough decisions.

316
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:55,430
But in the end, if you're the Home Affairs Minister, when the file lands on your desk,

317
00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:02,329
it's gone through 10 other hands and the decision ultimately hasn't been made by those people.

318
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:06,849
And so it's the toughest of decisions you're presiding over.

319
00:23:06,849 --> 00:23:07,849
And normally, you look at the...

320
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:16,609
There's facts before you and there's a terrible decision and just two degrees less than that.

321
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:19,950
It's the devil's curse in terms of the decision you've got before you.

322
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,869
But ultimately, your job is to take a decision that's in our country's best interest, that's

323
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:28,869
going to provide a safe outcome for Australians.

324
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:33,150
It's going to preserve our sovereignty or our rule of law.

325
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,349
And that's the...

326
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:37,650
I guess the lens that you have to look at.

327
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:42,410
You have to look at it through and you have to look obviously at the human side.

328
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:48,950
And there are countless visas that I issued for kids and for their parents and parents

329
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:54,809
whose mother or father had come here from a part of the world and had a stroke or been

330
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:58,589
diagnosed with dementia and couldn't return home.

331
00:23:58,589 --> 00:24:01,849
And you do all of that without the public seeing any of it.

332
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:05,650
And when I went into the portfolio, there were kids in detention and boats obviously

333
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,650
had arrived.

334
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,650
And...

335
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:12,410
Our desire was A, to stop the boats and then to get the kids out of detention.

336
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,150
I was proud that on my watch, we got everyone out.

337
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:22,450
And if you don't have border security and you don't have integrity, then people take

338
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,569
advantage of that.

339
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:28,369
And the people smugglers will take the money off innocent men, women and children because

340
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:29,369
they're just another commodity.

341
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:33,630
And when the people aren't there paying the money, they're running prostitutes, they're

342
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,410
running the human trafficking, they're running drugs.

343
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,410
They're running drugs.

344
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,609
They're running tobacco.

345
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:46,329
These people just don't have the same set of standards that we do.

346
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:50,190
And you have to deal with that and you have to try and take that business model away from

347
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:54,009
them because ultimately people drown at sea and kids end up in detention.

348
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:58,890
The much better way to run the migration program is to bring people in in a regularised way,

349
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,890
give them an opportunity.

350
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:06,809
I mean, we brought in thousands of women who were Yazidis and the Yazidis had been subject

351
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:14,809
to sexual servitude and had been raped and brutalised by ISIS and ISIL.

352
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:20,049
And those women came in, have made amazing Australians, have started a life that their

353
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:24,630
parents, that they could never have imagined themselves as children.

354
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:33,690
And two, three, four, 10 generations time, those kids and those generations will be talking

355
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:34,769
about how brave they are.

356
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:35,769
They're great, great, great grandmothers.

357
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:36,769
They're great, great, great grandmothers.

358
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:40,390
They're great, great grandmothers who came to Australia and, so you've got to get that

359
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,390
balance right.

360
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,390
I guess that's the point.

361
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:47,390
Speaker 1 We all are born different.

362
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:57,089
As we grow, the experiences we have develop into outlooks, uniquely our own, charting

363
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:00,089
our life's course.

364
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:04,809
No one sees an idea, opinion, or opportunity like you.

365
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:05,809
And no one sees you like me.

366
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:06,809
Speaker 1 It's not like you.

367
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:07,470
Like VU.

368
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:09,750
Victoria University.

369
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:11,730
Uniquely you.

370
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,650
Hi, my name's Mim.

371
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,250
I do a Bachelor of Social Work.

372
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:20,470
I got this tattoo done for my 20th birthday present

373
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,329
because I was born as a twin,

374
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:25,230
but she passed away because my mum had ovarian cancer

375
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,329
during pregnancy.

376
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,589
So my name's Miriindi, which means rainbow,

377
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,589
and it means the bridge between,

378
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,309
for our ancestors to reach their afterlife,

379
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,869
which is what my sister was called,

380
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:37,730
which is the Wadahputi, which is the Milky Way,

381
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,109
and that's where they go as, like, the stars,

382
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,309
and they live there.

383
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:42,970
VU's very supportive.

384
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,390
It doesn't matter if you're an Indigenous student.

385
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:48,609
Wunday Bola to make sure that you're very well taken care of.

386
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,789
At Alita, our signature program, Alita Connect,

387
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,910
is something we're really passionate and proud of.

388
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:57,990
We bring together groups of five to six people

389
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,529
around the globe from diverse backgrounds,

390
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,750
sport, industry, social venture and the arts.

391
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,569
We come together to learn, to connect and to collaborate.

392
00:27:05,869 --> 00:27:09,250
Vanessa Ford, Chief Operating Officer at Kukua.

393
00:27:09,509 --> 00:27:13,049
The Alita Connect experience for me has been transformational.

394
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:16,450
I met people that I would never have met

395
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,150
from totally different spheres.

396
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,650
It's very basic.

397
00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:21,349
It's all about relationships.

398
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,349
It's all about how we communicate

399
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:26,650
and what the Alita Connect group does that is so powerful

400
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,730
is when you bring two people

401
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,789
from two totally different worlds together,

402
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,430
there's no ego.

403
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,369
It just leaves room for,

404
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:37,349
for the real you.

405
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:39,809
And I think that's what Alita gave me

406
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:41,869
was bringing back the real me

407
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:45,130
and really connecting to my own leadership style.

408
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,990
We're doing this interview this morning in Melbourne, Australia

409
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,990
and the common place to have had a home invasion

410
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,049
or have had a neighbors have one.

411
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,710
We have had a couple in recent times at our own home

412
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,589
and you speak to the neighbors

413
00:28:00,589 --> 00:28:02,190
and almost everyone in this street.

414
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,630
In your role at Home Affairs,

415
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,509
you, you,

416
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:08,509
you've deported and canceled the visas of more,

417
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:10,509
thousands and thousands and thousands of people,

418
00:28:10,509 --> 00:28:14,109
pedophiles and bikies and violent criminals.

419
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,569
Their connections then went after your family

420
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,869
in the most horrific way,

421
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:19,130
which is an untold story.

422
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,789
And your kids were subjected to having federal police

423
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:24,170
at the front of their classrooms

424
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:27,609
and some horrific things to kill your wife.

425
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:29,410
Was there a moment where you thought,

426
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,390
is this all worth it?

427
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,990
Did, did that get, get to you?

428
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,250
Uh, it's a, it's a tough question

429
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,369
because I've always said that I would leave this job overnight

430
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:40,250
if one of my kids went off the rails or,

431
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,529
uh, you know, they, they needed me more than, than the job did.

432
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:47,130
The most remarkable thing about, uh, you know,

433
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,869
my wife, Kiralee, and, and my kids

434
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:50,890
is that they've never complained about it.

435
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:55,450
And, uh, it, it, it's, it's intrusive

436
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:58,869
because you have 24-7 security.

437
00:28:58,869 --> 00:29:01,549
Uh, it means you, you know, you don't lead a normal life.

438
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:03,930
And, uh, and, and, but that, that's the price you pay.

439
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,470
I mean, I think we're a safer community,

440
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:10,569
safer society because of those people that we, we deported.

441
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:11,650
These were serious criminals.

442
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:17,569
And, uh, and no, I, I don't think that I thought about leaving the job.

443
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:20,690
And, and that was never something that, that, you know,

444
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,269
a conversation that Kiralee and I had where she said,

445
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:25,630
you know, this is too much, you, you know, you need to get out.

446
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,529
She's been stoic and supportive, uh, every day.

447
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:30,450
And, and I've been incredibly grateful for that

448
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,930
because you couldn't do this job without, uh, that support,

449
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:33,930
and without a strong family.

450
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,950
Because I think that's the, that's the most important thing

451
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,950
that you have to do.

452
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,950
I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a very,

453
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:42,069
a very strong relationship and it's, it gives you the ballast.

454
00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:44,990
And it also allows you when you get back home to, um,

455
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,049
to be able to reset.

456
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:48,529
And I, and I think mentally that's important as well,

457
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:51,089
that you don't just carry the burden of this job,

458
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,109
which, which is a vocation.

459
00:29:52,109 --> 00:29:55,170
It's not a normal job where you go home and, you know,

460
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:58,190
ten past five, you, um, you know, you're off the train

461
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,609
and you're back home and, and you can switch off.

462
00:30:00,609 --> 00:30:02,769
It's, it, it goes constantly.

463
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:03,869
So, so to be able to have that, uh, that support network with your wife and kids,

464
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:08,130
kids, and your close friends as well, that for me has been really important.

465
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:13,450
And it hurts me that I put them at risk because of my job, but I'm incredibly grateful that

466
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,069
they take it in their stride.

467
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:23,569
And I mean, I probably told this story before, but I think the only complaint, maybe two

468
00:30:23,569 --> 00:30:23,970
complaints.

469
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:28,230
I mean, one is that the kids have done their hundred hours of driving with the AFP and

470
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,950
the rear vision mirror.

471
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,309
It comes with a layer.

472
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:36,049
Well, it becomes a bit hard because they're on their L's and you're sitting in the passenger

473
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:37,230
seat trying to give them guidance.

474
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:42,109
But when you take off from the stop sign, you've got to allow room for two cars, so

475
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:44,930
your car and the car behind you to make the turn.

476
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:47,089
And so it all becomes a bit stressful for them.

477
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,230
And so there's a bit of a gripe about that.

478
00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:56,829
And then the bum bags at school that the AFP carry and trying to convince your kids that

479
00:30:56,829 --> 00:30:58,069
nobody knows who they are.

480
00:30:58,069 --> 00:31:01,230
But kids are much smarter than what you realize.

481
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:08,309
So, but no, they've been great and they've grown up to be now young adults and I'm incredibly

482
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:08,809
proud of them.

483
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:12,170
I've heard you talking in recent times a lot about the Australian dream of owning your

484
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:17,710
own house and how that's become harder for the current generation than perhaps ever before

485
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,549
in Australian history.

486
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:22,769
In a few months time, you could be the next prime minister of Australia.

487
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:26,410
What are some of the things that people should know that you want to achieve?

488
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:31,230
Well, I will break my back to make sure that people can achieve their dream of home

489
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:31,289
education.

490
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:34,529
Because I think it's such an important part of our culture.

491
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:41,309
For me personally, it's been a way to, you know, I've renovated homes over the years,

492
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,890
bought and sold, and it's been a way to create wealth.

493
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:51,809
And I think it is the foundation of being able to form a stable relationship and raise

494
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:52,150
kids.

495
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:58,809
I think the value increase in an asset, as we've seen in housing over recent years, means

496
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:00,730
that you can live a comfortable life in retirement.

497
00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:05,750
And it's an asset that grows in value such that you can bequeath it to your children

498
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,069
and help set them up.

499
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:11,470
And renting for life is not part of our culture.

500
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,309
And ultimately, it's not a way to generate wealth.

501
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:20,910
The other aspect to it, which is important to us as a Liberal Party, is that generally

502
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:24,569
it's the asset that is the security to start a small business.

503
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,349
And, you know, small business is very important to our party.

504
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,269
And just giving people that choice, if that's what they want to do.

505
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:32,349
That's great.

506
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,089
If they don't want to do it, well, that's fine.

507
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:41,650
So we've got a huge problem, though, because the migration program has brought in about

508
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,450
a million people over the last two years.

509
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:48,309
And we're a great country because of migration, but it needs to be in a managed way because

510
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:53,509
at the same time, we've had a record low of building approvals, construction costs have

511
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:59,750
gone through the roof, land supply has been limited, and we've had this perfect storm.

512
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,109
We've seen rents go up by about...

513
00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:02,089
About 20%.

514
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:07,150
You've seen people lose the hope of and the aspiration of home ownership.

515
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:11,029
And I want to restore that hope and that dream again.

516
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:17,049
And we've announced a $5 billion package to provide support to councils, to help them

517
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:21,250
with sewerage and water infrastructure and road infrastructure so that they can develop

518
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,849
the land more quickly and bring that on.

519
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:28,029
And we'll have more to say in relation to housing because I think it's a really significant

520
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,650
problem in the community.

521
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:30,890
And, you know...

522
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:36,309
I want those young people who are working hard to have an expectation that they can

523
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:37,269
own a home.

524
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:38,549
And I don't think that's unreasonable.

525
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:42,730
Peter, I had the great privilege of sitting across from a range of different people and

526
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:48,029
what I would say are great leadership stories as yours is absolutely, and these sort of

527
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:50,950
patterns around what great leaders do.

528
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:53,450
And I'm keen to ask you a handful of questions on that.

529
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:58,069
We think this idea of sort of self-leadership, that it's very hard to lead someone else unless

530
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,869
you know what fills you.

531
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,769
What do you do on that front?

532
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:05,730
What do you do to make sure you're feeling well to be able to do the job you do?

533
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:13,050
Well, as you know, and I suspect as some people have heard me say before, but you've been

534
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,829
a big influence on me in this regard in terms of meditation.

535
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:22,429
And I spoke about our dear friend, mutual friend Jeffrey before, and he's a big believer

536
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,269
as well.

537
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:29,190
And so I've looked at successful people and I see, you know, the success and the balance

538
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,730
that you've had in your life, which...

539
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:36,650
You know, I think is and should be a role model for many people because you've got the

540
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:41,849
balance right, I think, and it's, you know, there are always pressures and, you know,

541
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:45,929
always issues you've got to deal with, but in your work life, most importantly in your

542
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:52,929
home life and obviously your business life and your sporting career as well.

543
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:55,650
And so meditation has been important for me.

544
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:58,369
Exercise is important.

545
00:34:58,369 --> 00:34:59,690
And I think the...

546
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,690
Yeah.

547
00:35:00,889 --> 00:35:06,489
The ability to have those relationships where you can talk freely and it's not a download

548
00:35:06,489 --> 00:35:10,309
because you don't want to burden somebody else with all of your problems, but it is having

549
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:15,769
those trusted people around you that you can bounce ideas off and they don't have to be

550
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:20,530
connected with your workplace and they can be different people in your life for different

551
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,289
elements that you can compartmentalize.

552
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:29,869
So, yeah, meditation has been important for me and it allows a reset and it allows that

553
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:30,670
refreshing of the mind.

554
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:34,489
I think that's been important and each to their own.

555
00:35:34,489 --> 00:35:39,769
People can find their solace or their good place, you know, according to what's important

556
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:40,769
to them.

557
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:43,409
It doesn't fit the public profile, but you're a meditator.

558
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:48,130
It's not something that people are going to understand, but it's, again, it's something

559
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,130
I...

560
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:53,090
You're a great listener when you're around, you genuinely feel like when you're talking

561
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:57,210
to you, you're not focused on anyone else and I've watched your take on things that

562
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,010
other people would be surprised in a range of different areas.

563
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,010
Is there one thing that you've noticed in your work life?

564
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:00,369
Yeah.

565
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:03,610
Is there one piece of leadership advice that you pass on to others?

566
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:09,769
I've always found it important to surround yourself with good people and I have a very

567
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:17,429
low turnover of staff and I think it's important to identify those people that you can help

568
00:36:17,429 --> 00:36:23,409
create a culture with and that you can bounce off and that you can trust each other and

569
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:29,769
that the workplace doesn't become, you know, sort of a hard labour.

570
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:37,809
You can't be turning up in an environment each day that's just not conducive to positive

571
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:38,809
outcomes.

572
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:45,329
So I think bringing those people together and, you know, if there's any leadership skill

573
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:52,190
that I've got, it's identifying good people and generally people who are smarter than

574
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:57,449
you as well, which is always a good lesson in life and making sure that those people

575
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,050
can blend together.

576
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,050
And I think that works.

577
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:05,849
I think that way you get the most out of them and I think you self-develop yourself as well

578
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:10,110
and I think that's an important part and it's sort of a statement of the obvious for many

579
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:14,570
but for me that's been very effective.

580
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:17,670
You've got a really clear vision for what Australia should be.

581
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:22,769
I can hear it in your words, the ability to own your own house, to live a healthy life,

582
00:37:22,769 --> 00:37:28,730
whether you're in Gove or in Mossman in Sydney or Toorak in Melbourne, this idea of living

583
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:29,730
a safe environment.

584
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:34,250
Treating people with dignity and respect, but you come together in this environment

585
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:39,130
of MPs and a pretty brutal world of politics.

586
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:44,389
How do you try and get a team like that to share that vision and be on the same page?

587
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:46,110
Well, politics is better than it used to be.

588
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:52,389
There used to be, you know, sort of the gladiator age where you could lob limbs off and attack

589
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:53,389
each other.

590
00:37:53,389 --> 00:37:55,849
So it's always been an adversarial environment.

591
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:56,730
That's the nature of it.

592
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,730
It's like a courtroom.

593
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,730
And people, you know…

594
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,730
Yeah.

595
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:05,429
…are right to be passionate about arguing their beliefs and, you know, I've spoken

596
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:11,030
publicly, the Prime Minister's spoken publicly about the relationship that he and I have

597
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,030
and we got on well.

598
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:18,050
We are able to talk about issues that are important for our country and come together

599
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:22,670
at moments where it's necessary to resolve matters, particularly of national security,

600
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:26,489
quickly and to deal with those threats or those issues.

601
00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:27,730
I think that's important.

602
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,730
But there is a…

603
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,150
There is an adversarial element to it.

604
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,949
Sometimes it gets personal, which it shouldn't.

605
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:38,489
And sometimes the people around you, you know, can feel the impact of that as well and you

606
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:39,489
need to be conscious of that.

607
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:40,489
Yeah.

608
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:44,349
I've heard you say that before, that you like Anthony Albanese, you think he's a decent

609
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:45,349
person.

610
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:47,409
You don't think he's a particularly good Prime Minister.

611
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:51,349
But I think that is another trait of yours.

612
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:55,730
I don't hear you talk down about anyone, that you treat people with dignity and respect.

613
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:57,730
And even in that adversarial environment…

614
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:01,730
You strike me as someone who's inherently curious.

615
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:07,449
You know, the fact that, you know, meditation's a random thing a decade ago when we spoke

616
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:08,449
about it.

617
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:13,110
But is there a path of curiosity that you've gone down recently that people might be surprised

618
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,110
about?

619
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:19,610
Well, I'm discovering this world of podcasts, which has been a bit foreign.

620
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:22,730
And it's hard to sort of find that block of time.

621
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,730
So…

622
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:24,730
But, you know, I do try and go for a walk or go for a run or go to the gym.

623
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:25,730
And it's…

624
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,730
Yeah.

625
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:27,730
Yeah.

626
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:28,730
And it's…

627
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:29,730
And then I do some of my eight-day routines each morning.

628
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:30,730
And it can be part of that.

629
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:33,030
I like listening to music as well.

630
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:38,110
And that helps clear the mind or just distract from what's ahead for the day.

631
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,849
But it also allows some clear thinking.

632
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:46,449
And one of the things that I haven't been successful at doing is just trying to block

633
00:39:46,449 --> 00:39:52,510
out that period of time during the day that does give you the ability to think and to

634
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,050
read more broadly.

635
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,050
I…

636
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:56,329
When I was Defence Minister…

637
00:39:56,329 --> 00:39:57,530
I remember…

638
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:02,730
first came into this job, I thought as Defence Minister, you just absorb with the briefs every

639
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:07,570
day and stuff is coming up and getting calls and being dragged into important meetings and the rest

640
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:13,610
of it. And it's hard to find that sort of thinking time and that bigger picture time.

641
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:17,349
And I thought when I came into this job, I would have that because you didn't have the burden of

642
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:23,809
a portfolio or a department, et cetera, but it's not really turned out to be the case. And so I

643
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:31,570
want to work better on that. And it obviously becomes harder as Prime Minister to be able to

644
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:39,110
do that. But I do think you need to stop just dealing with the minute-to-minute engagement of

645
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:47,530
your job and allow some time in your diary designated and specific and deliberate to

646
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:53,570
think a little bit further afield. We love the saying, Peter, that the cost of

647
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:53,789
leadership is the cost of leadership. And I think that's a really good point.

648
00:40:53,809 --> 00:41:01,050
Is time and you can't fake that time, but then you still seem to be able to balance family life

649
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:07,409
and be able to collaborate and you've got great friends and put that together. How do you get all

650
00:41:07,409 --> 00:41:15,929
that done? Well, I think you have to prioritise and you have to be a good time manager or in my

651
00:41:15,929 --> 00:41:21,769
case, if you're not a good time manager, have a great PA and people around you that can manage

652
00:41:21,769 --> 00:41:23,789
time well. So, you know, my diary sort of goes,

653
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:29,650
15-minute blocks and it's a fail for us if I have to go to the airport lounge.

654
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:34,690
People talk about the chairman's lounge or all this sort of stuff. I like to go straight from

655
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:41,250
security to, you know, the gate. It's boarding because, you know, I mean, we do 200 flights a

656
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:47,010
year and another half hour in the lounge on every one of those just detracts from the time that I

657
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:53,030
could be spending at home or on another task. So it's a matter of managing that effectively.

658
00:41:53,030 --> 00:42:02,070
And it's also a matter of putting that date night or that appointment, you know, that you want to go

659
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:06,750
to with your wife or with your kids or their sporting event. For me, it's been, you know,

660
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:12,989
my kid's, Rebecca's 22 and Harry's 20, Tommy's 19. So they're, you know, they've finished school

661
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:19,929
now. But even, you know, Tom's playing footy after school, even trying to get to as many of

662
00:42:19,929 --> 00:42:23,010
those games as possible is important. And even if you're,

663
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:27,289
even if you're not there during the week, this is, you know, again, every family's different, but

664
00:42:27,289 --> 00:42:34,250
the kids are so busy with their lives that, you know, they want you to be there. But if you're

665
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:39,550
not during the week, I think that was balanced by the fact that I always tried to get there for,

666
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:46,809
you know, swim club on a Friday night and, you know, do the timekeeping and be there for that,

667
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:52,550
or go to the footy match on a Saturday or, you know, training on Friday afternoon, whatever,

668
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:59,789
it is. And if you can get to those, and I found it incredibly rewarding, you know, selfishly

669
00:42:59,789 --> 00:43:05,909
for myself, because to watch them develop and to go from puppy pack into, you know,

670
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:14,449
you know, into a skilled sort of player, I sort of, I was so proud of that. And it was also the

671
00:43:14,449 --> 00:43:21,010
most normal part of my week. But they were watching me on the sideline. And I think they had

672
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,010
a pride that I was there.

673
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:29,429
Taking an interest in them. And it helped, you know, build a really strong relationship

674
00:43:29,429 --> 00:43:35,929
as well. And sometimes you can make excuses for not being there. And even as a minister,

675
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:41,269
you know, travelling to Europe or to the US, I loathed being away on weekends and would fly

676
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:47,050
through the night to get back for weekend games. And so you have to get that balance right. And,

677
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:52,489
you know, I've said it would kill me as a member of the ADF, the Defence Force,

678
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:52,969
to be away.

679
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:57,269
For a six-month posting and how they do it, I don't know. But to their great credit, they do.

680
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:00,750
And yeah, that's what's worked for us.

681
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:05,530
Well, I said, you can't fake your time. You're either there or you weren't. And clearly you

682
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:12,230
made sure you were. We always see great leaders really understanding of how they communicate.

683
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:18,269
And you're an excellent communicator in your own unique way. Do you give it some thought?

684
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:21,170
Have you got a strategy around how you get your message across?

685
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:31,250
Just don't complicate it. And sometimes, I'll give this example where I have a great deal of

686
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:37,230
respect for Julia Gillard. I don't think she was a great prime minister by any stretch. But

687
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:45,630
I remember in the debate around gay marriage at the time, and I think some leaders torture

688
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:50,469
themselves in the language because they want to say what they really believe, but they

689
00:44:50,469 --> 00:44:59,210
filter it or they don't say it in its sort of raw form. And I remember hearing her say that,

690
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:06,030
well, I think the better way that she could have put her position was to say, look, I believe in

691
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:11,989
gay marriage, but I don't think the country's ready for it. And I respect that. Hopefully one

692
00:45:11,989 --> 00:45:16,250
day it will be. And as opposed to saying that you don't believe in gay marriage, because

693
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:20,110
that's what was probably...

694
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:27,409
The public mood at the time, it was a complicated debate, but it was just a sort of a snapshot and

695
00:45:27,409 --> 00:45:34,949
maybe it's sort of an awkward demonstration of it. But I think the best leaders we've had in our

696
00:45:34,949 --> 00:45:43,090
country, a Bob Hawke or a Keating or a Howard, they're not tortured in their language and they

697
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:49,550
know what they believe in and they're willing to fight for it. And sometimes you can get yourself

698
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:54,590
in trouble because it's not filtered, but all the, there's a full stop instead of a comma. So

699
00:45:54,590 --> 00:46:02,889
the qualification in the sentence is not included in the grab on the news. But sometimes, I listen

700
00:46:02,889 --> 00:46:10,150
to the PM at the moment and I think he's trying to please everyone on the issue. And I think,

701
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:13,670
mate, you've got to stand up for what you believe in and you're not going to please everyone. And

702
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:17,750
if you're trying to please everyone, then generally it means you haven't arrived at the right outcome.

703
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,070
So,

704
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:25,230
I think de-complicate it and don't forget where you've come from and keep your feet on the ground.

705
00:46:25,309 --> 00:46:27,090
I think they're always good lessons.

706
00:46:27,949 --> 00:46:29,969
Peter, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

707
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:37,769
For me, John Howard. And I watched John from afar growing up and I worked very closely with him. I

708
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:42,289
was very grateful that he put me into the ministry at a pretty young age after only one term in

709
00:46:42,289 --> 00:46:49,050
parliament. And he's still a mentor and a friend and a confidant for me now. And he's not somebody

710
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:55,969
bearing or on the phone every day at all. But I'll ring him time to time and say, you know,

711
00:46:55,989 --> 00:46:59,670
how do you think we're going or what do you think about this issue? And he's always obliging,

712
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,190
very giving of his time and very generous.

713
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:07,750
Didn't hesitate on that. That was a question without notice for you. It's clearly had an

714
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:11,949
impact on you and you value having that mentor still in your life.

715
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:19,329
Yes. Yeah. I think, again, I think John came from the suburbs. He understood the value of hard work.

716
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:31,789
Of respect. And he wasn't afraid to argue his beliefs and his structures. And that's been a

717
00:47:31,789 --> 00:47:37,550
quality that I've admired for a long time. And he hasn't got every call right by his own admission.

718
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:44,590
No human being can. So he comes with that caveat. But I think he did a lot of good for our country.

719
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:49,469
And he set us up for a period of,

720
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:52,909
along with Peter Costello, they did a great job in managing the economy. And

721
00:47:52,909 --> 00:47:56,690
if you manage the economy well, then people can succeed in their own

722
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:59,170
business lives and in their own personal lives.

723
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:03,570
We're a bit obsessed with this idea of collaboration in the leadership groups that

724
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:08,789
we're curating around the globe and putting someone from your background with someone from

725
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:15,630
a creative field or a sports leader with a leader of the business world. As you enter this chapter

726
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:19,349
for you, is there someone that you think about?

727
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:22,769
In any of your passions in life, I mean, clearly being prime minister of Australia is forefront of

728
00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:25,989
mine, that is there someone you thought, God, that'd be a great person to collaborate with

729
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:30,929
in the future? Well, I look to a lot of people with

730
00:48:30,929 --> 00:48:36,869
sporting success because I think there's a synergy between politics and sport. And I mean,

731
00:48:36,869 --> 00:48:42,849
you've got a lot more natural talent that you can rely on. Our game, not so much.

732
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:49,269
But I do look at successful sports people and I see the discipline, the sacrifice that they've made,

733
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:56,329
and in some cases too, the sort of dragging into the public spotlight where really they just want

734
00:48:56,329 --> 00:49:02,789
to play sport and play it well and chase their lifetime passion and don't necessarily enjoy

735
00:49:02,789 --> 00:49:09,469
the spotlight. And I'm sort of similar in that way. I don't crave the public spotlight. I never

736
00:49:09,469 --> 00:49:15,349
have, but it's a necessary part of the job that I really enjoy. And that is making decisions or

737
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:18,710
putting in place decisions that

738
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:25,110
I believe in our country's best interests and help people and provide that support to them. So

739
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:34,650
that would for me be a bit of a yin and yang. And I think what you've done in your collaboration and

740
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:42,250
the leadership group and the personalities, having listened to a lot of the podcasts that you've done

741
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:48,010
and the people that you've brought together, I think it's quite a remarkable model.

742
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:53,489
It may not be without precedent, but it's been a novel approach. And I really think it's

743
00:49:53,489 --> 00:49:58,949
a lot of good comes of that. Very kind of you to say. That was the final question.

744
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:04,730
I've got to follow up one on the back of it. We're seeing in the US, President Trump,

745
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:11,409
which is a whole nother topic, but happy to bring in Elon Musk into government efficiency program

746
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:17,610
and curate people from outside industries. Is that a model that, not that in particular,

747
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:19,449
but do outside people have a role?

748
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:26,250
I think some business people being involved in the upper levels of the public service would be

749
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:33,829
a great thing. I think as a defence minister, I was incredibly well served from the public service

750
00:50:33,829 --> 00:50:39,630
and the senior public servants are professional. They sometimes don't make decisions as quickly

751
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:45,829
as you would want to. But if you're a leader in that portfolio or those portfolios, you can give

752
00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:49,530
direction and people do react and they respond. And I think that's a really good point.

753
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:57,309
Respond according to your direction and the decisions that you're making. But in some public

754
00:50:57,309 --> 00:51:04,010
service families in Canberra, they're a second, third, fourth, fifth generation. And I think we

755
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:10,889
need a greater breadth of understanding of the real world and different experiences. And bringing

756
00:51:10,889 --> 00:51:15,690
that in is important. Many years ago, I was the assistant treasurer and had responsibility for

757
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:19,449
the tax office. And I was very aware of the insular.

758
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:24,989
Sort of almost Stockholm syndrome nature of the place because they're constantly under attack.

759
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:33,010
Nobody likes a tax office. But I tried to develop a program there where people could go out and work

760
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:39,429
in some of the companies and bring some of those people back in to get a better understanding of

761
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:47,050
what was happening on both sides of the fence. And I think that's an important aspect as well.

762
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:49,489
But it's always a great pleasure to spend.

763
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:53,909
Some time with you. Every time I've been around you, you only treat people with great dignity

764
00:51:53,909 --> 00:51:58,570
and respect. And my hope is that people listen to these conversations. They actually get to see

765
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:02,769
the real Peter Dutton and then they can make up their own mind. But thanks again. It's been great

766
00:52:02,769 --> 00:52:04,650
to catch up. I really appreciate it. Nice to see you. Thank you.
