1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,799
see the Manly ferry stop and if you're from Sydney you know it doesn't usually stop for anything

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,140
all the people clambered to one side of the ferry and the whole boat was on its angle but

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,600
it was just tremendous and I remember sailing back just going what am I going to dream about

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,640
tomorrow because I've been dreaming about this gold medal for so long. Belinda Stowell is an

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,140
Olympic gold medal winner from the Sydney Olympics and has now gone on to lead other athletes to

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:33,420
Olympic gold medals and world championship glory. Had an incredible ability to recall what happened

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,560
as well as the feel and the natural talent that you see in the boat. He's the first one to

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,799
win gold back-to-back in that class. Fascinating, curious and interesting pioneer in her sport.

9
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:48,799
The trailblazing female athlete that she is reflects on her impact and the journey that

10
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,159
she's had. It's the people behind you that you're bashing the wall down but it's hopefully opening

11
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,280
the doors. Plays a little part in female sport as well for the impact of what I might have done.

12
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,899
Belinda believes that self-regulation is central to anyone wanting to have an impact

13
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:03,399
as a leader.

14
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,280
It's really easy to just let it rip and you feel good for the 10 or 20 seconds that you might have

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,180
said something but you're going to have to mop that up for the next two months because of what

16
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,959
you might have said and how it was received. Belinda is also living proof that telling people

17
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,799
your goals is absolutely vital if you want to bring that vision to life. I was talking to a

18
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,799
sports psych once, I didn't want to say look I want to go and win an Olympic gold medal in Sydney

19
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,260
2000 but finally after 45 minutes you made me get it out. We are really privileged to have Belinda

20
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,299
Stowell as part of our Leader Connect community. She's been an incredible contributor,

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,299
we curate groups of five to six people from around the globe to come together

22
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:41,620

31
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,199
Sydney 2000, a world champion on a couple of occasions and twice voted the female sailor

32
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:29,719
of the year and an inaugural inductee in the Australian Sailing Hall of Fame. Belinda has

33
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:33,400
gone on to be a great mentor and coach to generations of world champions.

34
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,419
And Olympic gold medalist, Belinda, it's great to catch up with you.

35
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,620
Yeah, it's lovely to catch up with you too, Luke.

36
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:44,860
24 years ago, Sydney 2000, you alongside Jenny Armstrong became the first female sailors to win

37
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,159
an Olympic medal in Australian sporting history. You won Olympic gold, your boat was called the

38
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,479
Ugly Duckling. Amazing memories. Can you take us back to that day and how's that changed your life?

39
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,280
It was an incredible week to know you look back and you go, right, we were the best

40
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,159
in the world in those two weeks because as you know, in sport,

41
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:08,360
changes pretty quickly. But to get it right in those first two weeks was amazing. And

42
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,439
to sail on Sydney Harbour with the spinnaker up and the Australian flag up the front and to be

43
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:19,120
scooting along in a beautiful sea breeze in September with crowds cheering that we don't

44
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,580
often get in sailing was pretty incredible to be realising the dream that you have for so long as

45
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:30,080
an athlete and dreaming of that gold and to be able to cross the line in first and to see the

46
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,400
Manly Ferry stop. And if you're from Sydney, you know, it doesn't usually stop for anything.

47
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,159
But all the people clambered to one side of the ferry and the whole boat was on its angle. But yeah,

48
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,900
it was just tremendous. And I remember sailing back to Rushcutters Bay where the sailing was

49
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:50,159
stationed out of and just going, what am I going to dream about tomorrow? Because I've been dreaming

50
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,979
about this gold medal for so long. So yeah, it's an incredible relief. But boy, it's opened some

51
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:59,139
doors and just being part of a leader is probably one of those doors. So I'm very, very lucky.

52
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,039
Linda, I'd love to talk to you about that. I love that you can still see the smile on your face,

53
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,639
four years later. And we're recording this right in the middle of the Paris Olympics. And we're

54
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:14,500
seeing the Fox sisters and their family story. And this morning, a 14-year-old skateboarder

55
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,980
won an Olympic gold medal. And it just, you can see the joy. The fact that you've got

56
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:24,660
that detail still 24 years later, and it's still something that brings you joy is quite remarkable,

57
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,300
isn't it? Oh, it's amazing. I've got a lot more wrinkles, but hopefully a lot of them are from

58
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,379
smiling. But it's those tingling feelings of seeing something like that. And I think it's

59
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:38,959
winning a gold medal or win a medal really in that excitement and that sense of relief and

60
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:45,660
achievement is, it brings back the same sort of feelings in my gut too, when I see that and just

61
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,959
that overwhelming sense of connection to what they might be feeling as well. It's very special.

62
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,420
And we might jump straight into, you and I were just talking before we started

63
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:59,079
and hit the record button. Very soon, Matt Wern is back-to-back Olympic gold medal winner

64
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:03,379
in a few hours time. You spotted him as a 10-year-old and you've

65
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:09,100
dedicated your life really to after you achieved your athletic dream to help others achieve theirs.

66
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,199
What's it like, the joy of winning your own gold medal or coaching someone to an Olympic gold

67
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,120
medal? Oh, look, they're different because winning a medal yourself, being an athlete,

68
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,399
you get all the highs and you get all the lows. The highs are amazing because you've got this

69
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:29,600
physical sense of relief as well as your mental relief. And you've been basically thinking about

70
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,519
every single thing you do, whether it's sleeping, eating, training,

71
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:38,439
such a long time, that to be able to win and that joy and elation that you get physically,

72
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:45,879
as well as the lows that you get when you don't hit your mark, you go into a pretty big low around

73
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:51,879
your own self-doubts, your own analysis. But as a coach, you don't quite get the same high

74
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:57,360
because you don't have the physical relief because somebody else is actually doing that performance,

75
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,600
even though the coach is a performer. And you're standing there as close as ever,

76
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,300
you're the closest person to that.

77
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:06,920
You're the closest athlete performing, but you're not performing yourself. So

78
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,600
it's not quite the same high, but it's definitely probably a deeper low because it's all your

79
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,379
responsibility as to why it might've gone wrong. So yeah, I think there's a difference, but to see

80
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:22,480
the joy in other people and to give other people opportunity and to open doors for their lives as

81
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,759
well, that's incredibly special because that's legacy. Absolutely. You spotted Matt Adwerne as

82
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,639
a 10-year-old. What did you see in that young lad at that stage that's gone on to really create

83
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,139
some history?

84
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:40,639
Oh, he has always been curious. And we speak about that in Alita and we speak about that a

85
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:49,500
lot as coaches, but he was a remarkable young man. Even when he was young, 14, 15, he was

86
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,779
thirsty for information, thirsty to ask the question, curious as to why he would come up

87
00:06:54,779 --> 00:07:00,379
and had an incredible ability to recall what happened as well as the feel and the natural

88
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,379
talent that you see in the boat. So yeah, there is a lot of that.

89
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:09,920
Yeah. Amazing story, Belinda. Going to your own self and you don't have the level of success

90
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,019
you've had as an athlete and a coach without traits, I suppose, of discipline and resilience.

91
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,839
What did you find within yourself to achieve that? What do you think set you in such good stead?

92
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:28,160
Grit. I think self-leadership is really such a big part because self-motivation,

93
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,279
you can't coach it. You have to come to training with self-motivation and you have to,

94
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,740
as a coach, you have to come with your self-motivation to drive and to lead others

95
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:47,620
as well. And I just think it's an integral part of being a driven high achiever in that you have to

96
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:53,199
go through those days. And I guess it doesn't really stop. So it's like every morning is

97
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,439
something for me where I do things that might be uncomfortable on a day, but it's part of the

98
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,620
routine. So I swim in the ocean every day, religiously every day of the year. If I'm

99
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,379
close to a boat, I swim in the ocean every day, religiously every day of the year. If I'm close to

100
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:08,540
a body of water and I have to get in it. And so it seems like that there, we just, you pursue that

101
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,420
to challenge yourself, to improve yourself, to get better every day. And I think that's

102
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:19,759
self-leadership. If you can't lead yourself, then it's very difficult to lead others.

103
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:26,879
And so being able to also live to strong values and I have a huge value of respect.

104
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:32,200
And how does that drive me in my own leadership? If I'm respecting others and respecting people

105
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,159
or equipment or...

106
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:39,100
Or property or doesn't matter what it is, but definitely people of all levels. And so you've

107
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:45,539
got to lead from actions rather than words. And I think doing it rather than talking about it's

108
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:46,100
pretty important.

109
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:51,879
Yeah. Brilliantly said. You have lived in a sport where wind conditions, weather conditions,

110
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:57,639
waves, and so many of the elements are unpredictable. And I assume to be good at it,

111
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,720
you're making decisions in real time in a race that maybe you could make a few hundred decisions

112
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,360
and be able to make a few hundred decisions. And I think that's really important.

113
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:07,860
Being better at that than your opponent maybe is the key to success. What made you a good

114
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,039
decision maker under pressure?

115
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:18,220
I think observation is a really big part and vision drives decision. And being able to see

116
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:23,779
and observe and have a really good understanding of what the wind's doing or observing the wind,

117
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:29,100
but also observing competitors. But there's so many inputs and being able to prioritize

118
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,600
information quickly to be able to make a good decision.

119
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:36,460
And I was lucky enough to have Jenny on the boat as well. And she

120
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:41,960
had already had experience in Olympic games. And to recognize patterns is huge because you're

121
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:48,179
recognizing patterns of formations, patterns of where people are positioned. You're recognizing

122
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:55,600
wind patterns, wave patterns. And so I think under pressure, there's also a huge element of

123
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,799
self-composure. And that comes back to leading self. Because if you don't know how you are

124
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,360
under pressure, then that's very hard to improve.

125
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:10,039
And to make sure you're keeping those things in check when you have to make a quick, good

126
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:10,419
decision.

127
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:14,419
Linda, you've been coaching the coaches at the Australian Institute of Sport based in

128
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:19,220
Western Australia and influence across many, many different sports. Your husband, Arthur,

129
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:25,820
is over in Paris and coaching world-class athletes as well. What are the patterns you've

130
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,940
seen that, in your mind, make a great coach?

131
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,360
Understanding people. But first of all, understanding self. And that's a big part of my life. And

132
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:41,659
that ability to have emotional regulation. Because it's really easy. We often said, Arthur and I

133
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:46,980
talk about it a lot. If you sometimes get frustrated, it's really easy to just let it rip

134
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,519
and you feel good for the 10 or 20 seconds that you might have said something. But you're going

135
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,019
to have to mop that up for the next two months because of what you might have said and how it

136
00:10:55,019 --> 00:11:03,019
was received. And so being able to communicate. But nothing can allay the passion that people

137
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:08,440
bring as coaches and as athletes and sports people, as you all know. But then how do you

138
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,419
emotionally regulate? And it's that thirst for learning and never feeling that you know

139
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:19,080
everything. It's like that wanting to be better, to improve, because that's what your athletes

140
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,419
want to do. And I think being able to communicate that as well.

141
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,259
Fascinated that you said that and spoken about this on this podcast and this forum a little

142
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:31,519
bit. I played professional sport in an era where there was no emotional regulation from

143
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,059
coaches. They gave as much...

144
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:39,299
As much as they possibly could. It was a ferocious nature of feedback and often really personal.

145
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:43,960
And as you said, you probably spent months trying to rebuild a relationship if it ever

146
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,480
got rebuilt afterwards. And it feels like the new generation of coaches that you're mentoring

147
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,919
totally understand emotional regulation. And do you think that applies to other areas of

148
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,299
business and sport and life where really no one likes being personally abused? No one likes

149
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:03,299
being confronted in that way? And do you think that that era is dead and the new era...

150
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:05,799
Of being able to emotionally regulate is the way forward?

151
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,179
Oh, 100%. I just think we can't... It's not really acceptable anymore. Nobody likes being

152
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:16,559
criticized. And we've got the concept of a critical friend where you've got those people

153
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,620
that do need to give you the hard word, but it's how it's delivered and it's how the relationship

154
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:29,720
is critical. And it's so... It transcends across... It's not just sport, but sports where

155
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,019
the spotlight is on and you can see those behaviors.

156
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:37,480
And there's a lot of different cultures where it is still acceptable, but definitely in

157
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,879
Australia and our culture, it's not. And the young coaches, there's a lot of young coaches

158
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:50,120
that we've been... That we've got on our courses like the Gen 32 program and different programs

159
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,840
that we've got through the Institute that older coaches and younger coaches, they're

160
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,940
saying, I don't want to coach like I was coached. And I think that is a pretty important piece.

161
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,279
But also, I mean, I've been so lucky to connect.

162
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:08,899
With different people in different worlds and even talking to a fighter pilot saying they

163
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:15,679
were doing it differently and even in their world and their enormous experience, relationship and

164
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:22,519
understanding the person first rather than barking orders, it has changed. And I think it's for the

165
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:22,720
better.

166
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,100
Lenny, you've been generous enough to mention Alita a couple of times and love to talk to you

167
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:33,220
about it. We curate groups of people around the globe of five or six people who come together,

168
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:38,779
and non-competing areas to learn and to connect. And you've got a really fascinating and curious

169
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:43,620
coaching group. Craig Fitzgibbon is a legend of the NRL. Dean Cox is a legend of the AFL world.

170
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:48,600
Dean Vickerman's a three-time premiership coach in Australian basketball. And I know you've been

171
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,139
an amazing contributor and incredibly valued. Tell me about, even with all your experience,

172
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:57,220
the opportunity to connect and collaborate with different leaders. How's that been for you?

173
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,279
Yeah, it's been incredible actually having a different arm because obviously collaboration

174
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,059
is huge.

175
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:12,279
In success, nobody succeeds alone. The collaboration that I had to work on throughout my

176
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:19,080
career, both as an athlete and then as a coach, to learn from others is huge. And so in the sailing

177
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:25,720
bubble, you tend to know your sport really well. But to be able to move into my role now where I'm

178
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,580
coaching 10 different sports programs within the WA Institute, so working with coaches from 10

179
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,360
different sports, as well as the NRL, I think it's been a huge success. And I think it's been a

180
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,519
huge success. And I think it's been a huge success. And I think it's been a huge success. And I think

181
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:33,600
it's been a huge success. And I think it's been a huge success. And I think it's been a huge success.

182
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,940
Probably another five or six sports with the work that we do through the AIS coach development

183
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:46,279
team. But then having a leader in addition to that has really been fantastic for me to talk to

184
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:51,340
icons of their sport in team sports, because that's something that I felt I didn't have

185
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:59,899
a great insight into. And so to be able to be in a group with Fitzy and Dean Cox and Dean Vickerman,

186
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,019
where they've been so open to me, and I kind of felt,

187
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,820
a bit like an imposter in the beginning, just going, I don't even know if I'm giving value to

188
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,799
this group. Where do I fit in here? So it was actually a little bit of a journey. I remember

189
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:16,399
having a conversation with Stacey and she's like, no, no, you're bringing something else to the team.

190
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:21,159
And that's the power of collaboration is that you don't need groupthink. You actually need somebody

191
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:25,799
who comes from a different angle sometimes. And that's been wonderful. Yeah, it's brilliant. And

192
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:31,879
I love that you're such a curious person. And I understand just you've been physically to visit

193
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:36,980
different environments and you've been able to connect in person and follow up on that space.

194
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:41,960
So have you been able to practically implement some of the things in your daily world from

195
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:47,240
those connections and different conversations? All the time. I actually love learning from

196
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:54,100
people. I get really a lot of joy from hearing their stories and from learning from their

197
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,539
frameworks or how they operate. And just sometimes it's a phrase or it's a way of

198
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:01,860
communicating. Sometimes it's a way of thinking.

199
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:07,480
And to be able to bring that back and maybe it's just sharing a small gem that I've got from

200
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,320
the Alita group to be able to bring it back. And I know Arthur and I have spoken a lot and it was

201
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,980
tremendous because Arthur was working with these sailors that are going 60 kilometers an hour. It's

202
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:24,980
a new class for Paris and having to overcome fear and get some courage to go out there and hurt

203
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,820
yourself. And it was wonderful because I spoke to Fitzy. I said, look, Arthur's really got these

204
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,860
young guys. They're all under 20. Would you like to go out there and hurt yourself? And he said,

205
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:37,759
would you be able to let Arthur come and speak to you? And Fitzy, of course, he's being the man he

206
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,440
is. He just said, yeah, no problem. That opened the door. And Arthur's just had his athlete win

207
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,639
a silver medal. And one of the first things he said was, you know, Fitzy really left a mark on

208
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,120
me. So being able to connect somebody else and connect all the other coaches, that's just probably

209
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,039
a home example. But what I do in my role at work is connecting the learning that I get from so many

210
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,159
people to help them and help them improve in their own way.

211
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:05,759
I've been using this term a lot, Linda, that success leaves clues. And I think you're so

212
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,339
well-placed on that. And the language you talk is such a pattern of what we've seen. And we've

213
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:15,440
identified that over the course of a number of years of sitting across from incredible people

214
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,440
like you with great success. And you actually mentioned a couple of these dimensions that we

215
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,920
love talking about. And your description of self-leadership just rang so true. And could

216
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,039
you maybe just rephrase that again, why the idea of self-leadership means so much to you?

217
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,039
I come back to that if you don't.

218
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:37,039
If you can't lead yourself, you can't lead others. And I know I've gone through some really

219
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:43,700
interesting times in my career, both as an athlete and as a coach, and now as a coach of

220
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:51,119
coaches. The self-doubts, the lack of confidence in my ability, the lack of even appearance,

221
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,380
being different, you know, having a lot of musculature in my days when I was competing

222
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:01,000
was not acceptable to the social side of what a female should look like. And it's

223
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:08,880
amazing now that females and sporty females are so accepted and applauded, really. But all of those

224
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,319
things come back to leading self and to be able to look at your self-doubts, to get over them,

225
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,339
to lean on other people to help you. All of that comes from self-leadership because you've got to

226
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:28,539
be able to reach out and be humble enough to ask others to help you lead yourself sometimes. But

227
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:30,839
other times it comes from this grip.

228
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,460
By motivation from within, and I seem to have plenty of that.

229
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,779
Which is why you jump in the water every day. I imagine no matter the weather, no matter where

230
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:43,460
you are, it's pushing yourself through that. And I think for people to hear, I love these

231
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,660
conversations because I'm sitting across from an Olympic gold medalist, a coach who's had

232
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:52,519
success in every area, but self-doubt is something even Belinda Stowell has, and even

233
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:57,460
Craig Fitzgibbon, everyone you speak to him across in this forum, he talked about self-doubt

234
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,400
on a regular basis. And I think it normalizes it, doesn't it?

235
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:00,960
Absolutely.

236
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,440
Natural. And I went through a coaching course through the AIS in the middle of my career and

237
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,480
talking about the inner critic and the inner coach. And it was a really vulnerable time for

238
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,619
me because I had to actually go, I've never heard the inner coach. I only hear the inner critic.

239
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:20,440
And how do I find that? Things like that. It's just that continuous improvement,

240
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:24,000
searching for ways to be a better person, to be a better coach, to be a better athlete,

241
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,940
to be a better human.

242
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,500
You've picked out 10-year-olds and had an impact on them where they're on the edge of history,

243
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,039
back-to-back.

244
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,740
The gold medals potentially is the first time in the sailing world of Australian Olympics.

245
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,619
How have you thought about that impact on others in a daily basis? It's a big part of your role

246
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:45,079
is coaching the coaches. Have you been thoughtful about the positive impact you can have every day?

247
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,480
Yeah, it's going into a different career a couple of years ago, moving out of

248
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,079
being the head coach at WA Institute of Sport and moving into coach development was

249
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,039
a big step to go, right, hang on, I'm moving out from something I've done for

250
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,940
18 years. It's my whole world of sailing. Where do I go?

251
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,880
With this and how do I share the knowledge that I've had? And I'm realising now and just

252
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,140
having a conversation with a young female swimming coach yesterday and realising the

253
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:18,000
impact has given me a lot of joy and more purpose and more broadly to be able to

254
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,119
see the impact, but also to see Matt Wern and to see these young sailors that

255
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:30,059
both Arthur and I saw at eight, 10 years old that are now at the Olympics and that legacy of the

256
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:31,140
ones that maybe didn't make it to the Olympics. And I think that's a big part of the impact.

257
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,920
There's a whole score behind them of people that haven't made the Olympics, but they're all

258
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:42,220
there in coaching. We've got young coaches from WA now spread around Australia. And that's the

259
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,299
impact piece is that it's not just one action. It needs to flow on and be

260
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:52,740
continuous over time and to look around and see the impact of things that we might've done.

261
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:57,839
And I know the trailblazer doesn't usually get the reward. It's the people behind you that

262
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,119
you're bashing the wall down, but it's hopefully opening the doors and

263
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:06,359
I hope that that was also part, you know, a little part, plays a little part in female

264
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:11,960
sport as well for the impact of what I might've done to be able to continue to do with coaches.

265
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,099
Yeah. As we said, we started the conversation 24 years ago, you and your sailing partner,

266
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,240
Jenny Armstrong pioneering away. It doesn't happen, I suppose, without a really clear vision

267
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,539
of what you both wanted to achieve and what you're wanting to achieve in this part of your life as

268
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:30,680
well. How have you gone about sharing and creating those visions for success?

269
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:37,480
Yeah. I was talking to a sports psych once about what I was trying to do. And, you know,

270
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,519
he spent 45 minutes trying to ask me what I wanted to do. And I didn't want to say,

271
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:46,440
look, I want to go and win Olympic gold medal in Sydney 2000. But finally, after 45 minutes,

272
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,019
he made me get it out. But it was, I was talking to another psych a few years later and he said,

273
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:56,599
well, basically you only made one decision in five years. I said, well, that's pretty true.

274
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,279
Because everything, once you have a vision,

275
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:06,059
everything behind it makes sense. And coincidences start happening because you've got this

276
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:12,019
decision that you know where you want to go. And I think vision is also important when running the

277
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:16,700
program to be able to have a great vision of where do I want to be in five years time? Because what

278
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:23,579
we're doing now is the result of what we were doing five years before or what the athletes

279
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:29,460
were being trained up five years before is pretty much what we're looking at now. So to have a good

280
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,099
vision, you need that vision. And I think that's what we're doing. And I think that's what we're

281
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:36,019
doing for the collaboration piece as well, to be able to bring people along or to show and share what

282
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:40,980
your vision is. You're not going to get any help if you can't tell people what you want to achieve.

283
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,180
So I kind of think vision is pretty important. Beautifully said in a great way. You said the

284
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,099
coincidence starts to happen and the world starts to line up for you when you've got,

285
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:55,000
you know, I want to win Olympic gold at Sydney. There's the pathway finds its own way. It might

286
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,700
have been before we started recording you, we're talking about Matt Wern and history potentially

287
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,099
being made. And I asked you about your vision. And I said, well, I don't know. I don't know. I don't

288
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,960
know about the quality. So there's a curiosity there. And you've used that word curiosity

289
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,680
a few times already. Why does curiosity strike out for you as something that's so important?

290
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:16,460
It plays to the continuous learning. And I think if we're all continuous learners and we're trying

291
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:24,160
to be better today than I was yesterday is pretty much brings the curious questioning.

292
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:31,099
Sometimes it's in reflection because learning's done in reflection. And so to also be curious

293
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:37,240
around what happened so that I can make a step to go, what do I want to happen next? And I think,

294
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:43,180
yeah, it drives the question why. And yeah, I think that's pretty important both

295
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:48,279
to look back as well as look forward. We had a brief discussion about the legendary

296
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:53,259
John Bertrand and been fortunate enough to record a podcast with John and have John in our

297
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:59,240
elite community. And I had the pleasure of seeing him this week. I've never met anyone more curious

298
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,799
in my life than that.

299
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:05,279
It's actually remarkable being around him from someone at the restaurant. He wants to know

300
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,640
everything about how the restaurant's being run or you sit across from someone.

301
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,960
Have you ever seen anyone quite like that in terms of curiosity?

302
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:16,960
Yeah, there's a few athletes like that, but John's definitely a leader in that area.

303
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:24,380
Takes it to a whole new level. How about communication and communicating with clarity?

304
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,279
It's something that we've seen as a real pattern for people with success. And I'm assuming your

305
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,599
role coaching different sports.

306
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:32,519
Art of communication. How have you thought about that?

307
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:39,880
The art of communication is something that I think is always on the list because as coaches,

308
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:44,880
you kind of got these things of progression and you go, okay, we've got to progress this,

309
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,539
this, this. And you sort of have this idea that you've ticked something off on the list. So you

310
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:53,779
move to the next level of what that looks like. Whereas communication, I feel like is something

311
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:58,019
that you never tick off. It's something that you just have to get better at and you'll be

312
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:01,079
challenged by it in many ways. And it's something that you never tick off. And I think that's

313
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:04,980
individual that comes in your path. You might have to communicate in a different way, whether

314
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:12,079
it's body language, verbal, how you present. Yeah. Communications usually fixes everything as well. So

315
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:16,440
whenever there's problems, it's like probably the communication didn't work, but being on a boat

316
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,940
with only two people, it's an incredible team environment because neither of us do the same

317
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:28,220
thing in sailing on a 470, the boat, the mixed dinghy. And it's two completely different roles,

318
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,059
but you've got to work in unison because of the nature of the role.

319
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:36,799
You also have sometimes an introvert and extrovert. So there's different dynamics. So it's really

320
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:42,380
about what we learned there through the communication and coaching a team of two versus

321
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:50,039
coaching a single handed individual. You multiply the time by three or four when it becomes two

322
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:55,700
people involved, because there's another element of getting the communication right. And so you

323
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:01,019
take that to broader teams, to organizations like, you know, I worked for Westpac, but

324
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:06,220
you know, going all the way back to my childhood and growing up in Zimbabwe and learning communication

325
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,480
right from the word go in a different way, different culture, understanding different

326
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:18,759
cultures. And as we travel, communicating to everybody from the cleaner to the CEO and back

327
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:26,200
down again. And, you know, communication is, it's the art and connection piece for all of us, I think.

328
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,660
I love what you said. It's not something that's ever got a tick next to it. It's,

329
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,940
you're always having,

330
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:36,980
to work on and never really solve, is it? You're having to learn all the time. I haven't heard

331
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,079
anyone say it in quite that way. You've mentioned collaboration. How important has that been for you?

332
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,960
A little story around my career as an athlete. And I came from Zimbabwe. Mum and dad was still

333
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,980
there when I was sailing. And I had a brother and a sister, two sisters in the country and

334
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:58,079
Olympic campaigning is not cheap. And we won the trials and I had the grand total of $89.43

335
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:01,000
in my account. So if ever you want to know about collaboration,

336
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,799
it's how do you get more in your bank account when you're trying to go and win a gold medal.

337
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:11,420
So, you know, reaching out to my yacht club, my brother was integral in helping that and being

338
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:16,799
able to collaborate with the community first and your home community. And everybody at that yacht

339
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:24,119
club was asked to donate $20, you know, and boy, did that 20 grand from 2000 members, put another

340
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:29,700
step towards Jenny and I being able to go and spend four months in Europe and buy proper equipment to

341
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:36,180
be able to compete at the games. And so, you know, collaboration starts right at home, but it

342
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:42,259
extends now. And I'm so lucky in collaborating. I've got a brilliant team with the AIS coach

343
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:49,640
development team. I always applaud Bill Davrin, who leads up our team in how he managed to recruit

344
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:55,880
great people. And Alan McConnell is one of our team members. And so to be, and he's also on the

345
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,680
leader, but yeah, I think collaboration now, I haven't been able to do that. I haven't been able to

346
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:05,079
really step outside my comfort zone and ask people for time, but I feel better about it because I

347
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,720
think collaboration and learning is critical. It feeds all the other things.

348
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:15,920
Linda, what a great story to have your home club, literally everyone chipping in to help you

349
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:21,700
fulfill your dream. That must have been incredible to go back and say thank you with an Olympic gold

350
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,740
medal. That must have been incredible.

351
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,900
I get tingles still thinking about that because being able to come home with a gold medal when

352
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,680
we were ranked seventh.

353
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:35,599
27 or something ridiculous outside of the seventies before in that campaign. And to be

354
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:40,940
able to come home with a gold medal and that heavy medal in your hand and to everyone realized, hang

355
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:46,240
on, I've got a small piece of that. And even in Australia, I always say that gold medal is part

356
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,740
of Australia and to bring it out and to show it to people, the joy that it brings, that's also

357
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,859
collaboration because it's a country's medal. It's not just your own.

358
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,920
Yeah, beautifully said. Belinda, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

359
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,119
Look, I think there's been a few and there's some people who I look up, look at and say at

360
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:09,039
different times, people have stood up and been great leaders. I always think someone like Nelson

361
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:14,960
Mandela was an incredible leader for all of us and coming from Africa and seeing what he did was

362
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,480
something where you go, that's just remarkable to change how things are done and being able to lead

363
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:27,579
culture and culture differences and racial differences. I think, you know, I experienced

364
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:29,559
that myself, but I think it's remarkable.

365
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,859
To have somebody like that, even though, you know, you don't know him, but I think somebody

366
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:38,859
like that leading is important in our lifetime. I sort of lean on Arthur's leadership and what

367
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:44,539
he's done recently. I think it's fantastic to build a class and build momentum behind it to

368
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:51,240
create success for that. So we probably challenge each other's leadership at home, but it's always

369
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:58,299
in such a good way. But yeah, I think there's just phenomenal leaders out there as well as

370
00:29:58,299 --> 00:29:59,599
that personal side.

371
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,799
And a lot of people I know have said it's their father or something like that. But, you know,

372
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:09,940
definitely my dad was a leader from behind rather than a leader from the front. And so I think,

373
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:13,519
yeah, there's just probably not one that stands out.

374
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:20,059
I love that you've been able to take from Nelson Mandela to your partner that you live with every

375
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:26,960
day. It's grabbing bits and pieces of that is fascinating to me. In the world of a leader,

376
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,680
we are a bit obsessed with collaboration and what happens when you're in a relationship,

377
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,819
and you bring people together and the connections and the brilliant stories that come out of it. And

378
00:30:34,819 --> 00:30:40,440
you've got access to great opportunities to do that in your world. Has there been someone you

379
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,539
thought, wow, you know what, whether it's in the sailing world or your coaching world or

380
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:48,180
another curiosity of yours, you thought, I'd love to connect and collaborate with that person. Is

381
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,500
there a name that springs to mind? Yeah, I was thinking about this because I knew you'd throw

382
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:57,440
it to me. So I was trying to go, right, who are those leaders out there that I meet? And from one

383
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,579
side, I'm so lucky in this role.

384
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:05,259
That I play now in working with coaches, and that I do have connections. And so from one side,

385
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:10,200
it's like, who could I spend more time with that I already know? And recently, Ray Simpson,

386
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:15,160
a fighter pilot, or Miriam Fox with Jess, where I know them, and I'm already spending time with

387
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:20,160
them. But I also kind of went, no, what outside the square? Who else is a phenomenal leader? And

388
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,579
thinking of female leaders as well as males, it's quite out there. But I'd really be interested in

389
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:29,259
Pink, because she's a leader in the arts world. She changed how, you know, the,

390
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,359
how women look, but she also changed things, because she just does things her way. And I think,

391
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,119
yeah, she'd be a really interesting leader to sit down and have a chat with.

392
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:44,440
Yeah, I'm on to it. I'm on to it, Belinda. That's, you know, how incredible would that be? I'd love

393
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,740
to get her with you. And as you said, it's when you think about, I'm, I'm curious with your answer,

394
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:52,920
isn't it? For an era where so many young girls are growing up with body image issues, and

395
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:59,279
yeah, it's an epidemic that's out of control. And, and she's just as tough and sells out everywhere

396
00:31:59,279 --> 00:31:59,680
she goes. And I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think,

397
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,319
but being herself and yeah, what a remarkable story. It's not an answer I was expecting.

398
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:10,000
She's such a performer. And I kind of went, wow, it'd be really interesting to see where

399
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,819
her self-leadership comes from, because that's a big piece. She obviously is a strong self-leader.

400
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:18,039
And I love that someone from the arts with some, with your unique sporting background,

401
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:22,640
when you get those different ways of thinking together, incredible things happen. And that

402
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,079
would be a collaboration. I would love to, to be a part of all for Belinda. Thanks so much.

403
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:29,680
I've heard so much about you. I know you're revered.

404
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,920
In the world that you're in, we're really privileged to have you part of the leader

405
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,180
community. Thanks so much for your contribution and your curiosity.

406
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,859
And thanks so much. And thanks very much to a leader. It's, it's opened a lot of doors for me.

407
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,500
Thanks for listening to another episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast. Huge thanks as always
