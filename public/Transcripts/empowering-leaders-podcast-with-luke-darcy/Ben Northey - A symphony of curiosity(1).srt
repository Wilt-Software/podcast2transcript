00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,250
What an incredible conversation this week on the Empowering Leaders podcast.

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,910
I had the great pleasure of talking to the principal conductor of the Melbourne Symphony

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,429
Orchestra and two-time ARIA Award winner, Benjamin Northey.

4
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:22,769
Listening to Ben's thoughts on curiosity as the ultimate path to learning and the most

5
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,350
important thing we can pass on to our kids, I found fascinating.

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,670
Ben's perspective on pressure and musical performance was equally compelling.

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,170
I learnt an incredible amount from Ben and I'm sure you're going to enjoy this conversation.

8
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,890
Ben has collaborated with a plethora of musicians across the world, including the likes of Ben

9
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:45,590
Folds, Nick Cave, KD Lang, Sting, the late, great Archie Roach, and the list goes on and

10
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:45,810
on.

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,770
And this type of collaboration is a big part of the world I love to explore through Alita,

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,329
a business founded with my great friend, Matt Wadowitz.

13
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:56,549
It's a place where leaders can collaborate and learn from one another.

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,649
We've had some incredible names join us, including Hamish and Andy's

15
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:05,530
Andy Lee, Ange Postacoglu from Celtic, Arsenal's Mikel Arteta, just to name a few.

16
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:08,769
And we are equally excited about you joining as well.

17
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,290
If it's a space that you are interested in, we would love you to check it out at

19
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:17,870
Encourage you to have a look at our signature Alita Connect program to understand how people

20
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,230
like Ben, who's part of that program, are collaborating and leading in their world.

21
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,450
Ben, it's a great privilege to spend some time with you.

22
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:37,170
I've been really looking forward to this.

23
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:37,769
Thanks for joining me.

24
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,069
Oh, it's a pleasure, Das.

25
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:40,549
And yeah, I get tired.

26
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,849
Just hearing that list of stuff that's been going on.

27
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,150
But yeah, it's amazing, actually, just to reflect on a few of those things that you

28
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:53,670
read out and and realize that before that, I actually had a different kind of life as

29
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,609
a performing musician.

30
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:58,969
I used to play the saxophone and I played in cover bands in Melbourne and did all kinds

31
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:00,090
of crazy work.

32
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,890
And as you mentioned, that diversity has ended up being a strength of mine.

33
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:05,989
So, yeah, it's interesting.

34
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:10,389
I want to talk to that in a minute, the diversity of your music passion.

35
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:13,610
But can I go back reading as young as two?

36
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,270
I understand that you were obsessed with your mum and dad's record collection.

37
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,310
And by the age of three, your mum, who's an outstanding pianist, had enrolled you in a

38
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,830
Yamaha early learning class.

39
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,370
Can you remember as young as that age having music in your DNA?

40
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,770
I remember listening to records back in, I'm born in 1970, so a child of the 70s.

41
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,009
And I remember they, mum and dad, did have a great record collection.

42
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,330
And that was the thing.

43
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,150
You're always looking for what your kids show interests in, aren't you?

44
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,530
You know, especially.

45
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:46,189
And they saw me stop when the music was playing and just sit there, you know, and listen as

46
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:46,550
a toddler.

47
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,129
And so they just kept feeding that interest and that appetite.

48
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,069
And so I do remember actually listening to records.

49
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:56,729
They, you know, they would play all kinds of stuff.

50
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:03,370
They actually had a really interesting collection of music for young children by a European

51
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,750
guy called Carl Orff, who had a sort of system of teaching music.

52
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,370
It was called Schulwerk, schoolwork for young.

53
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,750
And I think actually I got a hell of a lot out of listening to that because it was like

54
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,569
the building blocks of music and absorbing that at that young, really young age.

55
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:23,150
Music just sort of made sense to me a bit more after that.

56
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,810
It was interesting.

57
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,530
You mentioned, you know, playing and your diverse interests.

58
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,189
I read you started with the violin at school.

59
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:31,909
You moved to the trumpet, the flute.

60
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:36,050
At uni you played the saxophone, as you said, in a James Brown cover band.

61
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,050
And then you studied the soprano saxophone.

62
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:38,909
Yeah.

63
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,270
You know.

64
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,330
Now I look at you as one of the world's leading conductors.

65
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:47,530
Do you think that there's so much benefit for you and having played so many instruments

66
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,389
that that has really helped you in what you do now?

67
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:54,310
Well, yes, but it's a very unconventional pathway.

68
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:58,810
So if you were going to say to somebody or if they said, I want to be a conductor, that's

69
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,590
not the pathway that you would give them.

70
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:01,889
No, no, no, no.

71
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:05,050
It would be much more specialised.

72
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:10,050
They would say, you know, play the piano, work in an opera company.

73
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:15,669
Perhaps and accompany singers, work your way up to conducting as the second or third

74
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:19,149
conductor, get your opportunities in front of the orchestra that way.

75
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:23,529
Or what's more common now is play in an orchestra for a period of time.

76
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,209
And so I play because I was playing the saxophone primarily as a teenager.

77
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,769
I was in what they call wind ensembles.

78
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,050
So we had no strings.

79
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:32,930
It was just wind bands.

80
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,250
And that was very different, but similar in the same sense because they're large ensembles.

81
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,110
So I got the same kind of large ensemble.

82
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:48,250
But when I look at the crazy journey in music I went on because I was sort of curious about

83
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,110
the next thing, it seemed random at the time.

84
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,790
And it's only now that I look back on it and I go, actually, that's a great foundation

85
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,949
for the work I'm doing.

86
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:01,910
And it's kind of come in really handy for me.

87
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:02,629
Do you still play?

88
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:03,870
No, I don't.

89
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,689
I actually still own my soprano saxophone.

90
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:09,689
But, you know, the thing, Das, is now that I work, I don't play.

91
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:09,750
I don't play.

92
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:09,790
I don't play.

93
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:09,850
I don't play.

94
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:09,910
I don't play.

95
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:09,930
I don't play.

96
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:09,949
I don't play.

97
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:10,029
I don't play.

98
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:10,089
I don't play.

99
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,449
I don't work and collaborate with so many world-class performers.

100
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,209
It's ridiculous.

101
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,709
Like, if I pick up the saxophone after not having played it for 10 years or something,

102
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,949
it's not going to sound great.

103
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:25,290
And it's going to be even worse because I know what it can sound like, you know, the

104
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,430
way I used to play when I was working at it every day, but also working with these amazing

105
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,370
soloists, you just think, well, the world doesn't need to hear me play anymore.

106
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,370
That's an interesting way to think.

107
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,910
I suppose, as you said, you're with the world's best and your ear must be...

108
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,930
I look at your role without understanding it, but think, in some ways, it's the ultimate

109
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,750
leadership role.

110
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,230
You've got, is it up to 90 musicians in an orchestra?

111
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:52,230
Yeah, well, sometimes you've got a choir as well, so you can have, you know, 300 people

112
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,509
on stage at times, so it's big, yeah.

113
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:59,209
And they're looking at every movement you make, every bit of body language, every expression

114
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:03,310
to take their temperature, I suppose, from your lead.

115
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,930
I mean, what's been the key to your success in doing it at the level that you do?

116
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,629
Well...

117
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:16,389
First and foremost, it's, I guess, your musicality, your sense of having a vision for a piece

118
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:21,209
of music, because that's what the conductor has to bring, a vision that everyone buys

119
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:22,990
into and is willing to follow.

120
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:28,350
So it's very much that classic leader-follower kind of relationship with the orchestra.

121
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:34,250
But I think a lot of people think that it's about power, and it's not, really.

122
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:38,670
Power comes with the position, but that's not what it's about.

123
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:39,589
Like, a lot of people...

124
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:44,389
You see the maestro up the front waving their arms around and, like, you know, kind of dictating

125
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:47,990
how this is going to go to the obedient musicians who are following.

126
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,889
It's actually much more collaborative than that in terms of what's actually going on,

127
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:58,730
this kind of exchange of wills that's happening between the conductor and the musicians.

128
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:05,430
It's a frustrating job for musicians, and like any big group of people, there's a psychology

129
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,069
that you have to work out, and I think that's one of the strengths that I bring to it.

130
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:15,649
I'm always thinking about the people that I'm working with, and I'm trying to think about

131
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:23,350
the best way in which to guide them to an outcome whilst respecting them and involving

132
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,490
them in that process.

133
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:30,610
So, you know, I'm a collaborator, you know, by nature, and I'm trying to facilitate their

134
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,430
best performance the whole time.

135
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,990
I'm not trying to say, this is how it goes.

136
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:39,509
I'm like, what is the best outcome for this particular situation and this group of people?

137
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:41,110
So I'm really interested in that.

138
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:46,670
So, Ben, is that a shift in terms of conductors of the past would have been much more of a

139
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,649
dictatorship and stood out the front, and there would have been that hierarchical, I'm

140
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:53,230
the boss, and probably the reverse of what you're saying.

141
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:57,250
I'm fascinated by that because I know you've got a great passion for sport that I want

142
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:02,149
to get onto through this chat, and we've seen a massive shift as well in the world of sport

143
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,089
and the way coaches are much more collaborative as well.

144
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,970
When I played, you know, the coach was the boss.

145
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,610
You didn't give any feedback the other way.

146
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:13,350
You did what you were told, or you got, you know, put in your place pretty quickly.

147
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,529
That shift has been pretty profound.

148
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:16,829
Is that the same in your world?

149
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:17,889
Very much so.

150
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:23,290
So what's happened is the power has shifted from the maestro being the boss and being

151
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,850
able to fire people on the spot and that kind of stuff.

152
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:28,129
So that would have happened in the past, literally?

153
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,189
You're not pulling your weight, hop out of the orchestra.

154
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:35,690
It has happened, and often for no reason, just because people want to demonstrate their

155
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,049
power.

156
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:39,610
And, you know, it's the idea of how do you get the power?

157
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:43,570
The best out of people, and I think there was a sense back in those days, we're talking

158
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:49,929
mid-20th century and, you know, before, that fear was actually the best driver of people,

159
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,470
which is just an anathema to me.

160
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:59,110
You know, I'm trying to fight against that all the time because I think people are much

161
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:04,129
more responsive in a relaxed state, and they're much more able to bring their best in that

162
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:04,370
state.

163
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,710
But that's how I work.

164
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,129
So everyone's different.

165
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,610
But the big thing that's changed is the orchestras are much more.

166
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:15,190
They're self-determining now, so they are very responsible for who conducts them, for

167
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,529
example.

168
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:19,909
So at the end of a week, they'll fill out their surveys and give an opinion about the

169
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:25,230
work of the visiting conductor, for example, or their regular conductor, and that determines

170
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,090
whether you come back.

171
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:30,629
So the power has shifted, and that's been a good thing because it's made conductors

172
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:35,830
change the way in which they communicate and interact with the orchestra players.

173
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:39,350
We had a very brief chat before we hit record, and you said something.

174
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:45,370
It reverberated in my mind to say that the people playing an instrument orchestra almost

175
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,110
feel like they're doing brain surgery.

176
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,149
I think to paraphrase what you said, they feel that pressure of wanting to get it right

177
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:53,029
for the expanded team.

178
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,330
Is that how it is for a lot of them?

179
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,309
Yeah, the expectation is huge at that level.

180
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:03,149
We're talking about people who have dedicated their entire lives, often from very young

181
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:04,350
age, to one thing.

182
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,529
And because it's a big team, everyone's relying on everybody.

183
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:10,009
Everyone else.

184
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,389
And so you've got to think of an orchestra as kind of one thing.

185
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:21,090
It's like that's the goal, is to make it this one beautiful, in harmony machine of humanity.

186
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:23,610
Everyone's listening to each other.

187
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,549
They're all fitting in with each other, and some people are leading, some people know

188
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:30,330
when to stay out of the way and balance and let other things through.

189
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:37,850
And there's this whole kind of operational hierarchy within an orchestra as well.

190
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:45,149
I think in terms of the pressure, and yes, I think there have been studies done on that

191
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:50,090
where they say the pressure that people feel when they're playing, for example, a solo

192
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:54,210
in an orchestra is the same kind of pressure that a brain surgeon feels when they're operating

193
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,529
on somebody, which is, it's crazy when you think about it, because no one's going to

194
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:00,870
die in an orchestral context, but that's how they feel.

195
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:05,129
And so, you know, it's perform or die.

196
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:06,330
I mean, it's like that.

197
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:09,029
That's the mindset people come in with.

198
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:09,470
And I think that's the...

199
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:09,549
Yeah.

200
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:09,590
Yeah.

201
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:10,710
That's the same in sport.

202
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:15,350
You know, you've got to bring it when it counts, and that's in the concert.

203
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:20,669
So that's the magic and the terror of live music.

204
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,429
And that's, you know, we're not talking about amplified concerts.

205
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:29,190
This is just you and your instrument and the audience and your own expectations and the

206
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,190
group's expectations.

207
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,889
But in the world of team sport, if you have an off day in the team, it's pretty obvious,

208
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:39,470
you know, there's stats and there's data and most...

209
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,970
Athletes will know very, very quickly.

210
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:43,590
In fact, everyone does, if yet.

211
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:47,669
Is that the same in an orchestral sense that, you know, someone can have an off night?

212
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:49,029
And is it...

213
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:54,129
Do you need a, you know, a refined ear to understand that, or would the player themselves

214
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:55,250
feel as though they had a bad night?

215
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,330
Oh, they'd know for sure.

216
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:57,429
And it depends on the instrument.

217
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:01,389
You know, the way the orchestra's structured is there's a whole lot of string players,

218
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,590
like violins, violas, cellos, and basses.

219
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,529
That's a big section.

220
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:09,389
You can kind of blend in as a group in that section, but if you're one of what we call

221
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:14,269
the principal players, so principal oboe, principal French horn, diabolical instrument

222
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:19,049
to play, small margin for error, everyone can hear if you've made a mistake.

223
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:21,730
Like, you've got a real sympathy for these people.

224
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:28,750
First trumpet, but, you know, even on violin, if you've got a solo, yes, it's obvious when

225
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:34,429
something's going wrong, and if you hear somebody mentally really struggling in a concert,

226
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:37,049
it's a terrible scenario, because that...

227
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,129
I think...

228
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:45,649
From a conductor's perspective, what can I do, A, to help in this situation and bring

229
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:52,289
them back, and you feel bad because you haven't brought out their best at that time as well.

230
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:53,289
So something's gone wrong.

231
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,269
It might not be your fault, but you're the leader.

232
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,409
You have to take responsibility as well.

233
00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:01,710
Yeah, and in preparation for this, I, you know, read extensively your love of that collaborative

234
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,970
nature of large-scale music making.

235
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,590
There was one quote that was attributed to, I wanted to read back.

236
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,909
It's one of the few, this is your words, one of the few examples.

237
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:13,970
I have a large number of human beings cooperating in real time to achieve a very, very difficult

238
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:14,509
end product.

239
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:19,529
As a metaphor for what human beings can achieve, there's nothing like an orchestra.

240
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,730
I can hear the passion in those words.

241
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:26,769
Does that sort of sum up to you, the reason why you love getting out and trying to create

242
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:27,669
that sort of joy?

243
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,549
It is.

244
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,269
It is.

245
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:37,610
And see, you know, as human beings, we kind of want to collaborate, I think, by our nature.

246
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:39,110
We want to be part of something bigger.

247
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:44,309
The things we can achieve as a collective are much greater than the things we can achieve

248
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:44,809
by ourselves.

249
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,269
And that's the truth with music.

250
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:50,330
So my daughter, we were talking about before we started, she's just started violin.

251
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,409
She's 10 years old.

252
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,250
She, you know, is doing her practice.

253
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:58,330
She did her first state music camp this year and got to play in an orchestra for the first

254
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:58,649
time.

255
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,750
And so she hasn't really been that into the violin up to this point.

256
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,389
All of a sudden, she gets in the orchestra.

257
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,830
She says, Dad, you should hear it.

258
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,470
It's unbelievable.

259
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,350
I say, yeah, I know.

260
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,149
That's what I do.

261
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:08,250
She goes, no, you don't understand.

262
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:09,110
I really don't.

263
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:10,289
Like, it's really amazing.

264
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:19,470
And so, you know, it's that kind of feeling of the power of cooperation, you know, and

265
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:28,690
the orchestra, for all of its crazy kind of old world stigma and stereotypes, it's actually

266
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,809
still a very relevant institution.

267
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:34,389
I want to jump into the parenting thing for a moment.

268
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:36,370
Pick up on that conversation.

269
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,490
I love talking to leaders like you.

270
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,490
You know, a range of things.

271
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,029
But with parents, when your dad's one of the leading conductors around the world and you

272
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:47,610
pick up the violin and, you know, in the same in a football sense, I suppose, if your dad's

273
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,990
played and then you're running around in Auskick, there's an expectation.

274
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:56,490
Do you think she feels a little bit of that intuitively that, hang on, a few more people

275
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,529
are watching me than someone else?

276
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,309
It's possible.

277
00:14:58,429 --> 00:14:59,509
It's still early days.

278
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:01,210
And you've got to be careful of that, don't you?

279
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:04,049
You know, because that's the last thing I want her to feel.

280
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,049
And the way that I think about music is that it's really part of a full education.

281
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,009
So it's one of the things.

282
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:14,889
And it's a shame that it seems to have been more peripheral in particularly primary school,

283
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:15,429
for example.

284
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,049
Like, you know, there are schools still out there.

285
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,049
But when I went to school, it was kind of like you did your music lessons in the school

286
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:23,970
time and there was a specialist music teacher.

287
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,169
That's changed now.

288
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,649
So you don't have specialist music teachers in primary schools anymore.

289
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:36,250
And so I think of it as kind of this tool to, I guess, stimulate her creativity or any

290
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,169
child's creativity.

291
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:37,470
Yeah.

292
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:37,769
Yeah.

293
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:37,809
Yeah.

294
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:37,830
Yeah.

295
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:37,850
Yeah.

296
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:37,870
Yeah.

297
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:37,889
Yeah.

298
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:37,909
Yeah.

299
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:37,929
Yeah.

300
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:37,950
Yeah.

301
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:37,970
Yeah.

302
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:37,990
Yeah.

303
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,009
Yeah.

304
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:38,029
Yeah.

305
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:38,070
Yeah.

306
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,090
Yeah.

307
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:38,470
Yeah.

308
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:38,889
Yeah.

309
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:39,169
Yeah.

310
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:39,309
Yeah.

311
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,090
Yeah.

312
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:40,490
Yeah.

313
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:40,549
Yeah.

314
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:41,029
Yeah.

315
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:41,129
Yeah.

316
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:41,149
Yeah.

317
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:41,450
Yeah.

318
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:41,470
Yeah.

319
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:41,610
Yeah.

320
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:41,629
Yeah.

321
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:41,730
Yeah.

322
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:41,909
Yeah.

323
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:41,929
Yeah.

324
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:41,950
Yeah.

325
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:41,990
Yeah.

326
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,129
I mean, that's how I feel about it.

327
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:46,309
I don't want her to feel any expectation being a conductor's daughter, but I guess

328
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:47,529
that's going to happen at some point.

329
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,909
So Ben, we see a lot of, you know, to use the term that the sort of tiger mom, you're

330
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:55,690
getting a violin in your hand and no matter what, there's six lessons a week and I'm going

331
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,750
to, you know, enforce that for you for the better good.

332
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:00,269
I think the intention's always great.

333
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:04,850
I mean, you can hear in your world that you just through curiosity, chopped and chained.

334
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,049
What's your advice?

335
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,309
because I think we all see now, as you said,

336
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,909
the benefit of creativity through music.

337
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,250
But do you need to drive a little bit

338
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,610
or do you just let the kids find their own path?

339
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,289
I don't think it's a bad thing to drive a little bit

340
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:19,970
because that's one of the things it teaches you,

341
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:26,330
like any discipline, is that importance of actually sticking at it.

342
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,750
And that's the thing about music.

343
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,570
The more you practice, the more fun it becomes.

344
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,490
The more fun it becomes, the more you practice.

345
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,649
So it's this kind of loop.

346
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:35,309
So I don't know.

347
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:37,110
I feel like there is a limit.

348
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:39,970
I always say to Eva, you don't have to do a lot of practice.

349
00:16:40,289 --> 00:16:41,690
You just have to do it every day.

350
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,350
It's like 10 minutes.

351
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:46,490
So you can't do this until you've done your practice,

352
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:47,669
and that's the deal.

353
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:50,370
And she kind of goes, oh, yeah, fair enough, and just does it.

354
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,889
Look, she may give it up.

355
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:53,529
She complains about learning piano.

356
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:54,529
That's fine.

357
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:58,169
She complains about playing netball on the weekend sometimes too,

358
00:16:58,269 --> 00:16:59,169
but she still does it.

359
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,169
So it's just part of raising kids.

360
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,230
That's what I think anyway.

361
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:04,509
I love her coming back.

362
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:06,710
Dad, you don't understand how good an orchestra stands.

363
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,829
It's just genius, isn't it?

364
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:09,509
It's brilliant.

365
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:13,230
Can I ask you, for those that aren't regular listeners to classical music,

366
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:14,210
I'm going to put my hand up.

367
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,829
In preparation for this, I've been loving it

368
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,849
and listening to some of your work.

369
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:24,430
Is there one piece of music we all have heard of Beethoven's Fifth?

370
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:29,349
Is there one particular bit of music that sums up the genius

371
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,109
of what an orchestra does for you?

372
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:33,690
Oh, that's a really tough one, actually, Luke,

373
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,950
because there are so many amazing parts of the repertoire.

374
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:43,150
I mean, I guess the most impactful ones are the ones that are huge scale.

375
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,630
And actually, even most people would say they don't know much

376
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,950
about classical music, you know, but they do.

377
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,549
They hear it in ads on television.

378
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,930
They hear it in their computer games, in their movies.

379
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:59,109
The ones that really stick out for me are the huge scale works

380
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:00,710
that involve choir and orchestra.

381
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:03,329
So when you've got, we were talking before about the numbers

382
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:03,670
of people that are involved in classical music,

383
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,609
that you can be conducting at one time.

384
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:10,470
I recently conducted a piece by an Italian composer called Giuseppe Verdi.

385
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,089
And that's the other thing about, you know,

386
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,930
this kind of heritage of the orchestra.

387
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,170
That's Joseph Green in English translation.

388
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,049
You know what I mean?

389
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,990
But it sounds so kind of inaccessible in this, you know, Italian language.

390
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,369
But he wrote a requiem at the end of his life,

391
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,849
and he was primarily an opera composer.

392
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,869
And a requiem is meant to be a religious kind of work,

393
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:33,630
and a lot of the big composers have written,

394
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,470
you know, a kind of work like this.

395
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,509
And he wrote it in this very non-religious operatic kind of style.

396
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,670
And I conducted it for the first time this year,

397
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,930
Choir of 250 over in Christchurch in New Zealand,

398
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,210
one of the biggest projects we'd had since COVID, you know,

399
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,690
so it was a massive cathartic event anyway.

400
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:55,150
And that piece of music, if you want to just have your mind blown,

401
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:58,349
I mean, it's pretty long, but even one movement of it,

402
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:02,569
listen to the Dies Irae, the Day of Judgment of that particular requiem,

403
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:03,349
the Verdi Requiem.

404
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,670
And it will blow your mind.

405
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:08,549
It doesn't matter if you're into classical music or not,

406
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:10,089
it'll just completely blow your mind.

407
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,970
And there's, I could name a hundred pieces that are like that.

408
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,289
And is that the genius of when you get that amount of humans in a room together,

409
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:23,349
it creates an energy that recorded music can never, ever replicate, I suppose.

410
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:23,990
Exactly.

411
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,930
It's a completely different experience because you are witnessing,

412
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,910
and in the performance case, being a part of the creation of that work.

413
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,309
But if you're in the audience, you're also part of it.

414
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:37,589
Because the audience and the performers, that's a sacred relationship as well.

415
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,390
And you can feel that energy in a room.

416
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,490
Like when everybody has a reaction to the music together in a room,

417
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:47,089
the electricity that that creates, it's intangible.

418
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,210
I don't know how it works, but that's what it's all about.

419
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,089
And it's just, it's incredible the way it unites people like that.

420
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:57,130
Good luck being at the MCG with the Richmond Army, Ben,

421
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,049
and singing Tigerland and Richmond win another big final.

422
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:03,130
Well, it's a collective experience.

423
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,130
It is, isn't it?

424
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:04,509
It is.

425
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:06,390
Being there, there's no substitute.

426
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:09,990
And we understood that when they took the crowds away.

427
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:14,450
And, you know, we were commentating games at the MCG with no one there.

428
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:18,309
And the lifeless feeling, it was bizarre.

429
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,230
And so I suppose it's given us this appreciation.

430
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:25,569
But you can't replicate that energy, you know, my team are the red, white, and blue.

431
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:29,170
But when it's Collingwood or Richmond or that old history at a ground,

432
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:32,890
that influences the players and the standard of play, no doubt.

433
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:33,549
Well, when you think about it, Ben, it's a collective experience.

434
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:33,569
It's a collective experience.

435
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:33,609
It's a collective experience.

436
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:33,650
It's a collective experience.

437
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,109
When you think about it, that's what it's all about, actually.

438
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:36,470
Yeah.

439
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,509
Like, what's the primary function of sport?

440
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,990
What's the primary function of the arts?

441
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:49,609
And you can mount a very strong argument that it is simply about bringing people together

442
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:51,349
and having a sense of belonging.

443
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:56,809
That's, you know, that's very possible that that's the main game here, actually.

444
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:02,549
And it's a great segue, Ben, to wanting to talk about where we've intersected a space we created

445
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:03,549
called Alita Sports.

446
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,289
And, you know, connecting in with you has been a great joy.

447
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:13,009
And we love that world of collaboration, bringing people together from unique backgrounds.

448
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:17,730
And the group that you're connected with, if you're happy to share, it fascinates me

449
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,549
because you've got Michael Voss, who I played against as one of the greatest players I've

450
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:25,230
ever seen play the game, a triple premiership captain of the Brisbane Lions, now coach of

451
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,269
Carlton.

452
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:31,809
Trent Robinson is a legend of the rugby league world and a revered coach of the Roosters

453
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:32,829
and had success everywhere.

454
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:33,549
Dr. Chris Brown.

455
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:38,309
People know as the Bondi vet, but a beautiful person, Chris, and incredibly smart.

456
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:41,710
Richard Opp, he's probably got the biggest marketing job in the world.

457
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,549
He looks after global brands for a business called AB InBev, which is Budweiser and the

458
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:48,309
biggest consumer brands in the world.

459
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:49,630
And Ben Northey coming together.

460
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,190
We love the idea of sharing and learning and collaborating together.

461
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,950
Can you tell us a bit about what that's been like for her?

462
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,849
It's been an amazing experience.

463
00:21:58,329 --> 00:21:59,289
I've learned so much.

464
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:03,430
At the beginning, I was thinking, gee, I'm really the odd one out here, you know, coming

465
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,390
in from the arts.

466
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,990
I mean, it was good Chris was there as well, because he's sort of coming from that television

467
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,150
world as well.

468
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:17,970
But I, because I had so much respect for all of these guys on this panel, and I was just

469
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,869
thinking, gee, I hope I can bring something worthwhile to this conversation.

470
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:27,670
As it turned out, they were very interested in the orchestra and how it worked, had a

471
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,609
lot of questions around the structure of it, my role.

472
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:33,269
And it made me...

473
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:40,769
It reinforced the idea that leadership, there's so much common ground across disciplines.

474
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,950
You know, we're all dealing with the same kinds of things.

475
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,369
And usually, it's just about people.

476
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:48,410
It's about our relationships with people.

477
00:22:49,089 --> 00:22:54,369
It's about our relationships with ourselves, looking deep into how we are going about our

478
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:56,569
leading and how we can improve.

479
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,349
And that's been the beauty of this, is being able to have those discussions with those

480
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:02,470
guys, learning so much every time.

481
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,369
I mean, I just take...

482
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:08,890
I take pages of notes in every meeting that I reflect on later and look back on and think,

483
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:11,369
wow, that's a really great idea.

484
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,109
I wonder how I could apply that to the orchestra.

485
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:19,309
And just being challenged on things too, things that you've always done in a certain way.

486
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:21,690
And somebody sort of challenges, said, what about this?

487
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:22,710
Why don't you try this?

488
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,049
That's been really interesting.

489
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:33,410
And also, it's made me realize what values I admire in other people and which people,

490
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:39,190
who've helped me, and why do I kind of look back on with so much affection for those people

491
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:45,309
and so much gratitude because they kind of, you know, believed in me to the point where

492
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:46,569
I started believing in myself.

493
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,430
Really, that's kind of the one thing we've all got in common, I think.

494
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,890
We all had someone who believed in us at some point.

495
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:52,650
I think so.

496
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,230
And I was going to ask you about that.

497
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:58,609
I love the fact people like you with a schedule that you've got and all those people.

498
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:03,410
And we really love the idea and as passionate about, you know, people listening.

499
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:08,029
And so, I'd like to get together and collaborate and learn and that accountability to show up

500
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,289
and say, is there a better way?

501
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,009
You know, can I learn and share, you know, particularly when you come from different

502
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:13,450
backgrounds.

503
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:18,089
I love hearing that, you know, obviously, you know, private conversation, but, you know,

504
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:19,170
that world of a leader connect.

505
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:23,970
If you are interested, we are really passionate about sharing and expanding that space.

506
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:28,069
So, please, you don't have to be Ben Northey and doing what Ben's do to do the same thing

507
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:29,650
and share that.

508
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,390
You've had great mentors along the journey in reading about it.

509
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:37,890
And you've made that path to go and study overseas and, you know, names that probably

510
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:42,269
don't mean enormous amount to me and I might even be able to pronounce it, Leif Segström.

511
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,670
Oh, Leif Segström, yeah.

512
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,170
How did I go?

513
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,349
That was close enough, close enough.

514
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:47,789
John Hopkins, I can get out.

515
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:52,529
But it sounds like you've had people that, as you just said before, have really seen

516
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:53,230
something in you.

517
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:54,049
Can you tell us about that?

518
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:55,309
Yeah, well, it was mainly John.

519
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:00,190
I mean, the idea of a saxophonist, you know, I was in my late 20s at this point.

520
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,450
So, I'd had a performing career.

521
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,410
I went back to university as a mature.

522
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,670
I was a mature age student to do my Bachelor of Music, which I dropped out of when I was

523
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,329
in first year back in the day and started working.

524
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,750
I started getting gigs in Melbourne.

525
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:16,250
I had this fantastic life of a performing musician playing in, as you say, a James Brown

526
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:16,829
cover band.

527
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:18,789
So, were you done with study at that stage?

528
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,789
Did you see or did you always think you'd come back?

529
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:22,130
No, I didn't at all.

530
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,990
No, I kind of thought, no, I'll just be a professional musician.

531
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,670
I'll just work and do gigs.

532
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:31,670
And then the lifestyle, you know, we were working four or five nights a week and, you

533
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:33,390
know, I guess the first...

534
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,470
The fun had started to wear off a little bit.

535
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,390
Maybe I'd burn myself out having a bit too much fun.

536
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:42,650
So, I went back to the conservatorium and picked up where I left off.

537
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:46,450
And that was where I met my first conducting teacher, John Hopkins.

538
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,430
Now, I'm not one of these guys who's like, I have to be a conductor.

539
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:51,490
I have to be that guy standing up in front of the orchestra.

540
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:56,730
I didn't think that was possible from where I was and what I was doing.

541
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:00,950
I hadn't had a, you know, long career in orchestral music at all.

542
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:02,950
So, this amazing...

543
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:07,490
This amazing teacher, John Hopkins, who was an old man by this stage, he had just turned

544
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:12,190
up to set up a conducting program in fourth year, you know, kind of an elective that you

545
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:12,589
could do.

546
00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:18,150
And he'd done everything in Australian music by this stage and he was an extraordinary

547
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,390
person to learn from.

548
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:28,210
He was interested in the power of music as a medium for social change and really big

549
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:32,730
picture thinking, you know, and also this power of interactions with people as the power of music.

550
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,009
Yeah.

551
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,710
The main sort of area of expertise as a conductor.

552
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:43,990
So, he ended up, you know, seeing something in me and encouraged me to continue my studies

553
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:49,910
and said, look, okay, you're playing catch up, I get it, but let's come and study with

554
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,190
me.

555
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:54,490
I'm setting up a master's program here, it's, you know, two years, give it a go.

556
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:56,549
You're going to have to stop everything else that you're doing.

557
00:26:58,109 --> 00:27:02,390
And I was still working at that point and I didn't have a family or anything.

558
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,349
So, I thought, oh, if I'm ever...

559
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:04,990
If I'm ever going to do it, now's the time.

560
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:06,890
How often do these opportunities come along?

561
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:07,109
Yeah.

562
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:10,930
And I said to him, I said, I just don't see how this is possible.

563
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:12,549
He said, you don't know what's possible.

564
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:14,470
He said, that's the beauty about it.

565
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:16,250
Nobody knows what's possible.

566
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:18,630
We're all just making it up as we go along.

567
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:21,829
There's no rules and that's the beauty of possibility.

568
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,009
You're just, the book's empty.

569
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:32,269
So, it was so inspiring and I remember just working really, really hard for that two years

570
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:33,269
and then I won this competition.

571
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:38,269
I won this competition and went overseas to study and, you know, spent six years learning

572
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:39,869
how to do it and then started work.

573
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,589
I mean, it's a really amazing kind of pathway.

574
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,750
Genuine sliding doors moment, that is, isn't it?

575
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:45,009
Totally.

576
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:49,690
For someone to see that in you and then for you to have the ability and the dedication

577
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,250
to take that opportunity and then to go overseas.

578
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:58,430
You know, I read in research that when you are applying in Finland and I, you know, apologies

579
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:01,069
to Leif for butchering his name before.

580
00:28:01,069 --> 00:28:01,150
That's all right.

581
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:01,529
That's all right.

582
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:03,109
But I'm told that you're just...

583
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:03,250
That's all right.

584
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:07,549
You passed the exam and you're asked to listen to some music and write it down.

585
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,829
I mean, was that something you felt comfortable with at that stage?

586
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:14,549
I did actually because I'd done so much work in music production.

587
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:19,230
So, I used to do a lot of work for advertising and in the recording studio and often people

588
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,930
would give you a piece of music and say, I need a backing track or something for this,

589
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:27,809
you know, and you'd have to make it and that involved you listening in micro detail and

590
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:31,630
kind of deconstructing the piece and, you know, putting it back together one line at

591
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:31,930
a time.

592
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,230
So, I knew how.

593
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:33,809
I knew how to do that.

594
00:28:34,869 --> 00:28:35,869
And that was the thing.

595
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:42,349
I sort of realized more and more as I went through, all of my musical experiences were

596
00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:46,809
exactly the kinds of things that I needed to be able to draw on and especially at a

597
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:50,069
time when orchestras are changing so much.

598
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,710
The kinds of concerts orchestras are doing now are so different than they were even 20

599
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,289
years ago.

600
00:28:54,970 --> 00:29:00,250
And so, my sort of diversity and all these crazy experiences all of a sudden became very,

601
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:01,690
very helpful at that point.

602
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:03,170
But yeah, I was surprised.

603
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:07,250
When I got into the Sibelius Academy and I kept being surprised, you know, I just kept

604
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,289
thinking, how is this happening?

605
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,549
You know, this is ridiculous.

606
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:12,970
And then at some point, you know, you start to believe.

607
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:13,390
Yeah.

608
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:21,710
And that's when you can really build on your skills because you believe that it's possible.

609
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,210
I mean, that's the thing about performance, isn't it?

610
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:31,690
You know, sport, anything, the belief, it's so often spoken about, but unless you've actually

611
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:32,890
felt it, it's really hard to explain.

612
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,349
It's hard to explain what it is, you know?

613
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:37,069
And does that, you know, it's a great point.

614
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,990
I think, you know, sports people and other will relate to that sense.

615
00:29:41,109 --> 00:29:42,869
You know, I go back to what I was in.

616
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,390
Do you belong?

617
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,549
Are you good enough to play?

618
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:49,650
And then you get a few games and then you look around and think, you know, I do belong

619
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,109
out here.

620
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,710
And then the opportunity is there to take it to the level that you possibly can.

621
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,769
Is there still nerves?

622
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:59,329
Do you get in front of the London Philharmonic Orchestra on a performance night?

623
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,029
Yeah, you still-

624
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:00,470
Oh, no, no.

625
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,349
I mean, I don't mean to say that.

626
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:03,750
I always believe.

627
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:05,970
I did then.

628
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,890
But yeah, of course you go through ups and downs with that.

629
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,190
And belief comes and goes.

630
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,369
Confidence comes and goes.

631
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:21,049
The nerves are absolutely at the core of this business and actually controlling your state

632
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:27,329
before you walk out onto that stage as a conductor with this immense responsibility of guiding

633
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:29,650
these musicians through a performance.

634
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,390
That can be a crushing burden.

635
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,650
So you have to-

636
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,109
You have to be very mentally prepared for that scenario.

637
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:39,329
So I'm nervous every time, not to the point of like, you know, throwing up or anything

638
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:39,730
like that.

639
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:41,529
Like I'm sort of, I've got a routine.

640
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:47,710
I put myself as close as I can to in the zone as it works for me, at least.

641
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:54,470
And I try and be, you know, calm and stable out there for the musicians.

642
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,569
So, you know, that's the thing.

643
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,970
I feel the responsibility to them.

644
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,869
It's like I have to be as good as they are.

645
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,309
I have to be as good as they are at their job.

646
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,730
And then we can do something amazing, you know?

647
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:07,549
Beautifully said.

648
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:11,890
I read that you're a fan of visualisation and meditation and mindful.

649
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,650
Can you tell us about your practice?

650
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:15,529
Can you go a little bit micro there?

651
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,789
What sort of things do you do to achieve that?

652
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,269
I do a lot of visualisation.

653
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,750
I mean, it's funny, the way that we prepare as conductors is that we learn a piece of

654
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,329
music from the notes on a page, generally.

655
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:30,549
You know, you can access recordings and things, but that's not really the way you do it as

656
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:30,930
a conductor.

657
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,329
You're building up your own version.

658
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:32,650
I had a naive question.

659
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:37,309
This may embarrass me here, but as I was reading and watching and listening and in

660
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:40,569
preparation for this and looking at you reading music, is that universal?

661
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:42,150
So if you're reading a piece, it is.

662
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:46,109
So there won't be a German twist to it or a Spanish twist to it.

663
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,130
Music's written.

664
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:51,829
In Western music, so, you know, yes, the notation is universal.

665
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:56,730
That's the beauty of it because any musician can go to these countries that use that system

666
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:02,089
of notation, which has been built up over centuries now, and make music.

667
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:02,630
They don't.

668
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,910
They don't have to speak the language.

669
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,369
They can just make music.

670
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,869
And conducting is like that, too.

671
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,329
Every conductor's different, but there is a framework that is universal.

672
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:15,670
So that means you can communicate through music without words anywhere.

673
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:15,970
Yeah.

674
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,710
And I'm sorry to interrupt your train of thought.

675
00:32:17,789 --> 00:32:20,769
You're talking about what you do to get into that state, into that zone.

676
00:32:20,869 --> 00:32:21,890
Yeah, so visualising.

677
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:27,230
So when I'm reading the score, you know, the goal is to build up a sound picture in your

678
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,069
mind of how you want the piece to go.

679
00:32:29,569 --> 00:32:31,710
And that in itself is a visualisation.

680
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:32,630
It's sort of visualisation.

681
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,009
It's just a sonic visualisation.

682
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:39,029
So you can sit in a chair, close your eyes, and imagine a piece from start to finish.

683
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:45,890
And that's really powerful because not only are you thinking about the music and sort

684
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:49,809
of forming your interpretation of the piece, you're actually visualising how you want the

685
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:51,089
performance to go as well.

686
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,170
So that's one aspect of it.

687
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:59,549
But in the immediate, you know, standing side of stage and in the dressing room waiting

688
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:00,970
for the call.

689
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:04,630
Obviously, there's breathing and that kind of thing.

690
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,970
But for me, it's the reinforcement of basic principles.

691
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:12,089
It's exactly like, you know, sport in that sense.

692
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:16,910
I've heard so many sports people talk about just going back to basics and simplifying

693
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,529
everything down to, for me, it's forget yourself.

694
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,529
Think about the music.

695
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:28,369
So take my ego away for that period of time when I'm out there.

696
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:31,910
You know, I can put it back on when I'm finished.

697
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:32,509
But honestly...

698
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:36,910
Honestly, for that time, it's just take away everything else and focus on what your job

699
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:37,150
is.

700
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,269
That's the music at that point in time.

701
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,630
And then the music becomes everything.

702
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,829
So when it's all working, that's how I feel.

703
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:45,930
It doesn't work all the time.

704
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,569
And does that help you in life as well, having that capacity?

705
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:53,970
I want to ask you about meditation as well, but I suppose that ability to be able to compartmentalise

706
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,509
and, you know, in other areas of your life, have you found?

707
00:33:56,829 --> 00:33:58,109
I'm not so good at that.

708
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:02,329
Yeah, I feel like I use up a lot of my discipline.

709
00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:04,470
In the work.

710
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:12,349
So, yeah, I feel like, you know, if I come back after, you know, three weeks on the road

711
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:16,650
or something, or, I mean, at the moment, I've just done 12 weeks because, you know, after

712
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:22,809
the pandemic's not over, but after the lockdowns, the arts organisations are making up for lost

713
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:23,030
time.

714
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,250
So it's just been flat chat.

715
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:30,570
So I am usually just really burned out at the end of those long stints.

716
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:31,889
And...

717
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:35,349
I feel like I haven't managed that very well in my life.

718
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:41,829
So it's, or it's been, you know, too, too kind of high octane in terms of the approach

719
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,469
to taking all the work.

720
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,510
And that's the thing when you're a freelancer, you think, oh, well, if I'm free, I'll say

721
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:53,409
yes, you know, and I love the work so much, but I have to get better at actually managing

722
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:59,369
my time and making sure that I'm not neglecting my family, making sure that I'm doing good

723
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:01,429
work, making sure I've got time to prepare.

724
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:03,369
Recover all that stuff.

725
00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:08,010
So, yeah, I would say I am a work in progress in that area, Luke.

726
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,150
I think we all are, Ben, aren't we?

727
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,429
It's that I find that same challenge, isn't it?

728
00:35:12,429 --> 00:35:17,610
You want to achieve enough and support your family enough by achieving and that's, you

729
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:21,429
know, without that, we really aren't able to do anything, but at the same time, not

730
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:22,630
miss the point of life, do you?

731
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:26,250
And I always talk of, you know, that parenting guilt that we, I've always felt, you know,

732
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:31,250
as a father of four and, you know, even now, travel through, being on the road through

733
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:35,550
winter and you miss out on certain things, it's that sweet spot you're always searching

734
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:35,809
for.

735
00:35:35,889 --> 00:35:40,389
I'm not sure we ever exactly find it, but perhaps even just in the consciousness of

736
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:44,409
trying to do it, we may be at least ahead of the game in that sense that you are thinking

737
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:44,889
about it.

738
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:49,530
You know what I have learned from it all is being present in whatever moment you're in.

739
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,309
That's the one thing, because the music happens just in real time.

740
00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:54,849
It's like, that's where it is.

741
00:35:54,929 --> 00:36:00,670
It's then and, you know, as a leader thinking ahead a bit, but actually it's all happening

742
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,230
in that moment.

743
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:05,469
And you're fully aware and you're in this heightened state of awareness, actually, as

744
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:09,809
a performer, because of all the nerves and the adrenaline that's flying through your

745
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:12,670
body and the alertness levels and all this kind of stuff.

746
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:20,449
When I'm with my kids and Joe, my wife, you know, I try and bring that same level of presence

747
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:25,789
and just like, okay, I'm just going to be here now and concentrate on my kids.

748
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,849
And so I have learned that.

749
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,969
That's one thing that I'll say.

750
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,170
That's a great gift to share.

751
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,230
That's a great gift to share, because, you know, you can be around, but not be there,

752
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:34,650
can't you?

753
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:35,050
Yeah, of course.

754
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:39,230
And so the guilt is I'm away, but then a lot of people are there and not there as well.

755
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:48,940
I have to touch on the sporting connection to the family.

756
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,280
Please.

757
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:54,579
Uncle John, he's a legend of the game that I loved and was lucky enough to play.

758
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:59,539
He's a two-time premiership player in the brilliant Richmond sides, 1967 and 69, and

759
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:01,099
then coached over 300 games.

760
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:06,039
Does your love of sort of Richmond come through Uncle John Northey or?

761
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:06,480
Yeah.

762
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,900
We were always Tigers growing up because of the premiership.

763
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,760
So I was born in 70.

764
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,000
So I missed those flags.

765
00:37:12,219 --> 00:37:14,880
But dad is, his name's Bob.

766
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,079
He's John's older brother.

767
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:20,260
And he taught him how to kick and they were brought up in Darren Allum in the Western

768
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,719
District.

769
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,639
And dad was a very fine footballer as well, but ended up being an academic.

770
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,440
And so he went to uni.

771
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:29,500
Johnny famously went on to play for the Tigers.

772
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:33,559
And I was just fascinated by his journey, you know, because I was a teenager when he

773
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:34,159
got to Melbourne.

774
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:36,280
But he'd been coaching in Ballarat before.

775
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,440
Before that, he was coaching country league, Victorian country side.

776
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,599
I think he was coach of that team initially.

777
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:47,199
Redan back in the day in Ballarat league, three premierships in a row.

778
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,320
He was captain coach.

779
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,420
So he was still playing.

780
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,780
It was amazing.

781
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,079
Yeah.

782
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:56,099
And his body was stuffed and, you know, he was still out there, you know, yelling at

783
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,260
people and leading by example.

784
00:37:58,539 --> 00:38:04,199
And then, yeah, he got that initially job at Sydney, then Melbourne, then famously Richmond,

785
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,400
which I was wrapped about.

786
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,239
I was like, you beauty.

787
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:06,900
Here we go.

788
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:11,079
And, you know, the 95, um, I think it was, well, it was a qualifying final.

789
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:11,940
Probably the final it was.

790
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,760
You got to a 95.

791
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:13,360
Yeah.

792
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:14,360
Tough day at that one.

793
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,480
The game before that against the Bombers.

794
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:20,099
That was, that was something where I went, okay, well, there's a sleeping giant here

795
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:21,519
that I didn't know about really.

796
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:21,840
Yeah.

797
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,559
And that was, you know, Richmond won in 80, but I was sort of a bit too young to really

798
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:27,539
experience that fully.

799
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:32,199
But I remember thinking, wow, there's just a beast ready to wake up here and didn't wake

800
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:34,619
up until 2017, but it got there in the end.

801
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:36,159
But no, I learned a lot from him.

802
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:42,760
Seeing him work, hearing him talk about his role, um, and just observing his journey,

803
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,219
the ups and downs of that journey.

804
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:48,360
That was, you know, quite brutal in the end, you know, he got fired from Brisbane and I

805
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,480
just remember thinking, and, and after the 88 grand final where Hawthorne belted the

806
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,440
demons, I know he came around the next day and he just didn't speak, you know, he was

807
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,619
just sitting at the table, just destroyed, you know?

808
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:02,739
And I just remember thinking, oh my God, look at what this does to you, you know, or can

809
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:03,320
do to you.

810
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,619
It was amazing.

811
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:06,139
It's a, it's a brutal role.

812
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:06,260
Yeah.

813
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:06,760
Isn't it?

814
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,980
And, and maybe even more so the scrutiny's, uh, become so extreme and, you know, it's

815
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,059
you're a hero to zero, isn't it?

816
00:39:14,139 --> 00:39:14,719
Highs and lows.

817
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,159
Yeah.

818
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:15,440
Yeah.

819
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,579
It's, it's incredible.

820
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,000
Is he a crossover into the music and arts world?

821
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:21,360
Is there, is that shared in the family?

822
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:21,659
Do you?

823
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,519
Well, dad, dad plays the guitar and he was sort of into, um, acting a bit, I guess, because

824
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:28,860
he'd gone to uni and done, done a bit of that there.

825
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:31,539
And, um, but Johnny, not so much.

826
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:35,460
So, you know, he's more into sport and business and that kind of thing.

827
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,179
And so, but.

828
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:40,099
But I mean, it's been interesting to talk to him about people management and that was

829
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:44,300
the one thing he was good at was bringing out things that people didn't know they had

830
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,239
in motivation.

831
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,480
I think that was probably his greatest strength, that constant underdog thing that he had, especially

832
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,760
with Melbourne, um, in the eighties and getting people to achieve things they didn't think

833
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,260
they were capable of achieving, you know, and that I thought I can really use in, in

834
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,039
music as well.

835
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:01,400
Yeah.

836
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,159
What a gift that is.

837
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:05,760
And you hear all those that played under the great sweeper norther, your uncle, uh, the

838
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,099
connection.

839
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:07,940
He had with his property ahead of his time, really.

840
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:12,500
And we see a lot of the great coaches now so much more about the whole person, but from,

841
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,360
from what you hear, uh, his players love playing, uh, for him.

842
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,400
And it's, I love hearing that shared sort of, um, you know, crossover in, in learning.

843
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,659
Uh, Ben, we've been talking, you know, about what great leadership looks like in different

844
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:24,960
settings.

845
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,599
We're becoming a bit obsessed with it.

846
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:30,400
And I love hearing from your world, a world that, you know, isn't, isn't from mine and

847
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,739
these dimensions of great leaders, as you said, learning people management from your

848
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:35,059
uncle in the sporting world.

849
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:35,980
But we think all the leaders.

850
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:40,980
Have a sense of self-leadership that they start there and understand, does that resonate

851
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,539
with you?

852
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,699
Um, what, what would self-leadership mean to you?

853
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:49,800
Uh, for me, I think it's, it's, uh, turning up, turning up ready for, for work.

854
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,059
I mean, that, that is such a big role for me.

855
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:55,840
If you're a leader, you have to have a vision in order for people to follow you.

856
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,400
Like it's, it's so simple.

857
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,239
It's ridiculous.

858
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:03,000
But sometimes, you know, if you're really flat out and you haven't done the work, you

859
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,980
can turn up and you're a bit underdone and you're sort of making it up as you go.

860
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,699
People just notice straight away.

861
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,980
So as a conductor on the podium, it's kind of like, you know, there's this x-ray machine,

862
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:17,820
um, that people can just strip away any pretense and they can see who you really are and where

863
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,159
you're at.

864
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,559
So there's no point trying to pretend that you're anybody else.

865
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:24,059
So for me, turning up ready, that, that would be the first thing.

866
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:29,460
I guess the other thing is what difference are you making, you know, and, and I try and

867
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:35,960
do things, um, in my working life that I, that are, that are mirrored by my values.

868
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:40,139
And, and, you know, John Hopkins, this first teacher we talked about, he was big on that.

869
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:45,800
He was like, you know, think about the power of music as something bigger than just, you

870
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,260
know, you up there conducting the orchestra to a bunch of paying customers.

871
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,900
What, what can it do as a tool, as a medium?

872
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:53,219
Yeah.

873
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,679
And so, you know, I'm often reflecting on my year, like I get to the end of the year

874
00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:59,920
and I look back and I go, well, how, what did I do?

875
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,239
What did I achieve this year?

876
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:05,940
And where are those areas that I think are the real value areas?

877
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:10,639
You know, not the great experiences of, you know, what's the best concert, but actually

878
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:13,280
what difference did you make for other people?

879
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,519
And, and I reckon that's probably self-leadership to me.

880
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,880
You know, where, where are you making the difference?

881
00:42:20,019 --> 00:42:25,699
And music has unlimited potential in that area, uh, just in so many different ways.

882
00:42:25,699 --> 00:42:28,739
And actually the orchestras are doing really good work in that area too.

883
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:29,380
Yeah.

884
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,139
What a brilliant answer, Ben, you know, coming back and listening to you and thinking of

885
00:42:33,139 --> 00:42:35,940
all the, the, the challenges the world currently, you know,

886
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:40,460
faces and, you know, we've still got wars going on in 2022 and what's happening over

887
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,400
in that part of the world is incredibly upsetting, of course, in Ukraine.

888
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,960
And, and then you think of what you do with the universal language of music, being able

889
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,500
to go and bring teams of people together and show that collaboration and connection doesn't

890
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:57,599
have different, uh, you know, it doesn't, uh, require borders.

891
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:01,239
You can actually share with anyone and, you know, it feels like, you know, do you sort

892
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:05,460
of think about it, that altruistic level in some ways that you're an example to what great

893
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:05,960
collaboration is?

894
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,139
I'd like to think so.

895
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:12,099
Every now and again, you feel like, you know, some major world event happens, you think,

896
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:16,260
well, what can I do, you know, as a musician, how ready, you know, what a peripheral kind

897
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:22,940
of irrelevant activity, um, this is, but actually then you realize, well, it's, it's what you

898
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,900
decide to do with it.

899
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,980
It's the tool that you have, right?

900
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:31,800
So our expertise, whatever it is in our lives, that becomes the way that you can, uh, influence

901
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,179
others, make a difference, improve the experience of life for people.

902
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:39,940
And I just think in terms of, yeah, what, what you're talking about in, um, listening

903
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:47,320
to and cooperating, collaborating, but it's actually, um, it's understanding other, other

904
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:53,320
people, their perspectives, including people in the experience of an orchestra is a powerful

905
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,480
gift that you can give to people.

906
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:57,340
It can change people's lives.

907
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:03,699
We've got a completely new, um, generation of musicians coming through now that are from

908
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:05,159
extraordinary.

909
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:06,639
Diverse backgrounds.

910
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:12,559
They're enriching the culture of the organizations that they're joining, um, bringing these new

911
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:13,599
ideas and perspectives.

912
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:18,699
Uh, we're able to connect with people in different ways now than that the orchestras never did

913
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:19,099
before.

914
00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:22,199
You know, it was always seen as a sort of a high level elitist activity.

915
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:27,760
It sort of still is that, but it's not only that it's much more than that.

916
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:31,980
And it's much more, um, relevant and accessible to more people now, which I'm really proud

917
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,400
of too.

918
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:33,119
It's brilliant, Ben.

919
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:35,039
We're seeing leaders are really conscious of how they.

920
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:38,579
Positively impact other people every day in their environment, listening to you already

921
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:43,639
talking about your humility and turning up for the musicians and taking your ego away

922
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,639
when you stand up there and conduct an orchestra.

923
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,440
I mean, clearly that's something you think about regularly.

924
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,380
Is that, is that how you think about daily having that positive impact on people?

925
00:44:52,539 --> 00:44:53,280
I think so.

926
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,539
I hope it's the right thing to do.

927
00:44:55,579 --> 00:44:59,440
Like I'm not convinced that it's, you know, I, why do you say that?

928
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,039
Well, only because, um, there's a time actually to just be strong and, and,

929
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:07,500
and stand there and go, no, no, no, this is what we're doing.

930
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,179
And have you got that in you?

931
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:09,519
Do you do?

932
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,119
I, I, it's, it's sort of subtle for me.

933
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:17,340
Um, so it's, it's there, but it's sort of like a, um, what would I say?

934
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:23,000
It's a insistence, a quiet insistence rather than a throw your, you know, the toys out

935
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:23,980
of the cot kind of thing.

936
00:45:24,739 --> 00:45:27,980
Um, and every lead is different and I can probably work on that.

937
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:32,340
Actually, I've seen, I've observed recently, even other leaders just being way more direct.

938
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:34,659
And I think actually that's probably the right thing to do.

939
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:37,920
That's, that's going to save a lot of time and just get straight to the point.

940
00:45:38,059 --> 00:45:41,739
We've talked about that actually, um, a little bit in, in the leader group as well.

941
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:48,840
Um, but yeah, I, I sort of, I like that because it works for me and, and it really comes down

942
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:55,119
to respecting others and, and, um, understanding that they, they want to feel empowered as

943
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:55,380
well.

944
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,260
They want to have their chance to be part of this creative process.

945
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,300
They don't want to just be drones who are sitting there, you know, taking orders.

946
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,119
They want to feel like a leader as well.

947
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,739
All, everyone wants that, wants that sense.

948
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:14,400
So if you can create an environment where everyone feels like they can contribute, wow,

949
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:16,619
you know, that's when things can really spark.

950
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,539
And I love your language, man, because it's what we really see is this big shift is that

951
00:46:20,539 --> 00:46:21,420
you don't need the title.

952
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:25,739
You don't have to be the conductor, you know, again, not knowing your world, but the person

953
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:30,420
who turns up, plays and really has that positive energy to the person that supports them to

954
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,360
play a little bit better.

955
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,280
Or it's just kind in the way.

956
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,019
It's the way they approach it.

957
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:38,179
I mean, you can genuinely make significant impact with small gestures, can't you?

958
00:46:38,179 --> 00:46:38,360
Yeah.

959
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,780
And you can model that behavior.

960
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:41,199
I think that's the biggest thing.

961
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,960
It's, and, and culture of, of these big groups, because they've got a massive negative bias.

962
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,000
So the psychology of the large groups of people is negative.

963
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:50,199
That's just how it is.

964
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,139
In all the large groups, do you mean?

965
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,300
Or in orchestras in particular?

966
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:59,420
Well, I think orchestras in particular, because it's a frustrating job as an individual, you

967
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,219
feel powerless, you know?

968
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:03,280
And, and so you're relying so much on the people.

969
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,219
You're relying so much on the conductor to set the culture, set the tone and, you know,

970
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:11,320
I've, I've felt, I've found that that's a big part of the job actually is, is, and culture.

971
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:16,900
I mean, that's so important in every organization, you know, is this a good working environment?

972
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:22,699
Are we creating an atmosphere where we can really be our best and contribute and, and

973
00:47:22,699 --> 00:47:26,199
bring out the best in others and respect other people, all that kind of stuff.

974
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:31,920
And also acknowledge that there is an expectation that we bring in if it's not being met, address

975
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,199
it head on.

976
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,940
So, you know, there's all these things around organisational culture, you just got to keep

977
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:38,940
at those things.

978
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,840
It doesn't happen automatically.

979
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,619
And all the research says, I mean, the amount of time and effort and money and resources

980
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:49,000
you put into improving culture, you get returned back exponentially, almost more than any other

981
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,739
thing you can do in any business or in the world of arts or social venture or whatever

982
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:54,739
it is.

983
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:58,960
But it's often the thing people overlook because you'd rather put another person on sales or

984
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,960
sell another ticket.

985
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,500
But we know sustainable success comes from.

986
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,039
Yeah.

987
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,380
Clearly what you're doing, which is building great culture and continue, we've heard you

988
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,980
talk a lot about vision and it's, it's the next dimension I want to ask you about.

989
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,340
So Lee's really conscious about how they create and share their vision.

990
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,139
It sounds like you've got a pretty clear formula on that.

991
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:17,980
Can you share that with us?

992
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:25,980
Well, I've got ideas around the ultimate performance of a piece, you know, when I, when I come

993
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:31,679
out onto the podium, but it never works out that way, you know, so, so it doesn't like

994
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:32,880
my vision can be.

995
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:33,480
Yeah.

996
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:38,639
Very strong, but it's always got built in flexibility and that's what I'm talking about

997
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:39,940
in, in it's collaborative.

998
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,539
It's not a power thing.

999
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:43,280
It's not like, this is what we're going to do.

1000
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,320
I can say that at the beginning of a week and that's great.

1001
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,260
That makes everyone feel like, okay, good.

1002
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,179
This person's got a clear plan.

1003
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,860
Can I understand that for a second, man?

1004
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,460
Sorry to jump in again, but I'm trying to, so you've got the vision for the, for the

1005
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:01,019
piece and you're conducting them in the way that you are, but a certain section suddenly,

1006
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:03,019
you know, gets catches fire.

1007
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:06,420
For want of a better term, you think, Hey, that sounds better.

1008
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:10,119
And I can let that go more than I initially planned.

1009
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:11,420
Is that the sort of living, breathing?

1010
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:11,940
It is.

1011
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:12,260
Yes.

1012
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,320
You've worked it out.

1013
00:49:13,539 --> 00:49:16,539
So, so that's the thing you let it, you know what it is?

1014
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:18,000
You've got to know when to help.

1015
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,139
And that means lead in this point and know when to get out of the way and let them, let

1016
00:49:23,139 --> 00:49:23,860
them do it.

1017
00:49:24,219 --> 00:49:28,059
So that's, that's the, the balancing act that's going on there.

1018
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:33,019
And so, you know, you might hear something, you might hear a player play something that

1019
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:37,039
you really like and it's different than how you thought about it and it's great.

1020
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:38,539
And you just, what are you going to do?

1021
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:41,400
You get to get out of the way, let, let that magic happen.

1022
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:41,699
Yeah.

1023
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:46,980
Um, and it's different also depending on where you are, what orchestra you're working with,

1024
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,820
that particular group dynamic, what their strengths and weaknesses are, the hall you're

1025
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:56,139
in, different acoustic sounds, the occasion, uh, you know, energy levels of the group,

1026
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,239
time of the day.

1027
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:02,880
I mean, there's so many variables around this, uh, that you have to be ready to, you know,

1028
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,000
Yeah.

1029
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,019
Yeah.

1030
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:05,079
to respond as well as lead.

1031
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,340
You know, that's what I've learned.

1032
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,539
It's, you've got to be so alert to be able to respond in the moment.

1033
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:10,659
I'm fascinated by it.

1034
00:50:10,659 --> 00:50:16,480
I find it so, so your, would you have a good read if you go over to London or, you know,

1035
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,300
I mentioned in the intro, the, the international space, have you, have you got a good idea

1036
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,780
who the French horn player is and the, is it to that level of detail or on the night

1037
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:29,099
are you getting surprised by, hey, someone's doing something that you didn't believe in?

1038
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:33,000
Oh, that, that happens, that spontaneity happens in performances, but it's more

1039
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,019
the rehearsal process because that's when the conductor really does their work.

1040
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:37,360
Yeah.

1041
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,579
It's, it's away from the performance space.

1042
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:43,820
It's, it's the working the orchestra out, especially a new orchestra.

1043
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:49,179
So one of the teachers in Finland, um, he said, know who the Dave, the divas are in

1044
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:49,639
the orchestra.

1045
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:55,380
So if there's somebody who you really need to be aware of, find out early, get there.

1046
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:55,840
Oh yeah.

1047
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:56,739
Just yeah.

1048
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,440
Principal Ovo.

1049
00:50:57,659 --> 00:50:57,800
Yeah.

1050
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:58,119
Okay.

1051
00:50:58,539 --> 00:50:58,940
Be ready.

1052
00:50:59,039 --> 00:50:59,300
I'm on you.

1053
00:50:59,380 --> 00:50:59,719
Be ready.

1054
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,780
Um, and so, you know, you, you were, and that's.

1055
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:02,840
Yeah.

1056
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:07,400
Part of the working with the personalities as well, but also, um, celebrating what they

1057
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,659
can bring as, as individual leaders in, within the orchestra itself.

1058
00:51:11,659 --> 00:51:14,119
There's, there's all of that hierarchy going on as well.

1059
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:14,400
So.

1060
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:15,119
It's amazing.

1061
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:15,719
Yeah, it is.

1062
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,400
I heard you talk about curiosity a lot.

1063
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:22,579
And as, as a kid, just following curiosity into different instruments, we see leaders

1064
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:27,420
now really curiosity is their launching pad for then how they learn and continue to develop.

1065
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,280
Can you share with us what, what curiosity means for you?

1066
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:31,260
Yeah.

1067
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,480
I, I was lucky that.

1068
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,139
Um, particularly mum, cause she was the sort of the musical one in the family, she allowed

1069
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:38,199
that to happen.

1070
00:51:38,659 --> 00:51:43,159
So she, when I was, you know, playing the violin at, at primary school, piano, which

1071
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:44,800
I hated in primary school.

1072
00:51:45,579 --> 00:51:50,019
Um, and I, I think it was in grade two and I said, I want to learn the trumpet, you know,

1073
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,599
and I, I don't know if my kids said that to me, I'd probably say, yeah, sure.

1074
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,539
But deep down, I'd be thinking, oh, is this the right thing?

1075
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:59,079
Like, shouldn't I make them stick out one instrument for longer?

1076
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:00,699
And she was like, yeah, no worries.

1077
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,460
I was like, I'm not going to play.

1078
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,119
I'm not going to play the violin anymore.

1079
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:03,460
Okay.

1080
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,739
So I went and played trumpet for four years and then grade six, I want to learn the flute

1081
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:08,579
mum, you know?

1082
00:52:09,019 --> 00:52:09,219
Yep.

1083
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:09,579
Okay.

1084
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:10,280
No worries.

1085
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:14,659
I'll get your flute and, you know, ordered a flute and, and off I went in and then it

1086
00:52:14,659 --> 00:52:16,159
was, I want to learn the saxophone.

1087
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:21,320
And so there was this constant permission to be curious as, as a kid.

1088
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,920
And I think, um, you know, that, that taught me a great lesson because it was like, well,

1089
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,320
I, you know, this isn't a bad thing to be sort of moving on to the next thing all the

1090
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,179
time, to be fair.

1091
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:31,639
Yeah.

1092
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:32,460
When I got to the saxophone.

1093
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,539
I really zoomed in on that and, um, that became my thing.

1094
00:52:36,179 --> 00:52:41,079
Uh, but you know, that's at the root of development and, and has to be rewarded.

1095
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:46,039
And, and actually, you know, the things that we've spoken about in that group, often I've

1096
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:51,900
been struck by the curiosity of all of those high level leaders in their roles.

1097
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:55,059
That's actually probably the one thing that they've got in common there.

1098
00:52:55,539 --> 00:53:00,400
They're constantly looking for the next way to learn and progress and develop.

1099
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,699
And that's curiosity.

1100
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:02,440
Yeah.

1101
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,980
It's at the base of everything, isn't it?

1102
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:09,360
It's all learning, you know, that's what you want to teach your kids to be curious.

1103
00:53:09,739 --> 00:53:15,079
It's all, it's better than teaching them anything concrete facts, figures, anything like that.

1104
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:19,500
If you can instill a sense of curiosity in a young mind, job done.

1105
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,519
What a brilliant, uh, summation of, uh, you know, it's inspiring to hear you to, to sum

1106
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:26,179
it up in that, in that particular way.

1107
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:30,980
I mean, communicating with clarity is something that we see leaders are really understand

1108
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,420
their communications strategy.

1109
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,500
And, and yours is so unique again, isn't it?

1110
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:39,599
Because it's not spoken word when you're performing and, and then also, I suppose, you know, you,

1111
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:44,840
you're incredibly articulate as well and trying to expand your space and bring more people

1112
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,880
to, I suppose that's part of it.

1113
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,880
Can you explain how you've gone about your communication?

1114
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:48,460
Yeah.

1115
00:53:48,579 --> 00:53:50,980
I, um, had some really great models here.

1116
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:53,119
There's, there've been some great communicators in music.

1117
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:57,820
You know, we're talking about, um, there's an older American conductor who, who passed

1118
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:00,159
away decades ago, Leonard Bernstein, right?

1119
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:01,380
And he might be familiar.

1120
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,440
He wrote West Side Story.

1121
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:05,619
He's a musical theatre expert like you, Luke, you know, West Side Story.

1122
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:12,000
I conceded that, uh, I married a, uh, musical theatre performer back and, uh, was pretending

1123
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,760
in the early phase of our relationship that I was a very much, uh, an attender of, uh,

1124
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:19,980
musical theatre, but got found out pretty quickly, but, uh.

1125
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:26,099
No, no, but he was a great communicator and educator and he talked about music a lot.

1126
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:29,219
And this is funny because music doesn't really need to be spoken about.

1127
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:29,980
It can just be experienced.

1128
00:54:30,699 --> 00:54:30,760
Yeah.

1129
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,460
And everyone experiences it differently.

1130
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,340
And it's, there's no right or wrong way to experience music, but it is interesting as,

1131
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:41,940
um, a way to learn how to appreciate it more to hear someone talk about it.

1132
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:47,480
So, um, you know, I've done a lot of education concerts for school kids and all kinds of,

1133
00:54:47,539 --> 00:54:51,940
even adults as well, where we unpack a piece of music and talk about how it, how it's built

1134
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,000
and possible meanings behind it.

1135
00:54:54,019 --> 00:54:57,099
What's a composer trying to say, uh, through this piece of music.

1136
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,320
And yeah, I, I've enjoyed that aspect of it.

1137
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,320
And I do, as you could probably tell from this, I've enjoyed it.

1138
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,719
In this podcast, enjoy talking.

1139
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:10,460
So I, I now incorporate that into the beginning of my weeks, you know, cause I've realized

1140
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,480
the orchestras appreciate that as well.

1141
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:18,400
So take my five to 10 minutes at the first rehearsal, just to talk about what I want

1142
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,820
to achieve out of the week and what I think, what our goals are and our mission and why

1143
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:29,139
this is an important week reset everybody's, you know, expectations and possible prejudices

1144
00:55:29,139 --> 00:55:30,639
against a project or something.

1145
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,139
And, you know, explain why it's important.

1146
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:37,880
Get everybody buying into that first and then get into the music after that.

1147
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,159
And you don't have to talk so much.

1148
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:44,940
So yeah, it's, it's interesting, but the conducting of course is a, a nonverbal art form.

1149
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:51,360
So in the concert, you're not speaking, uh, it's all gestural and body language, facial

1150
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:56,880
expressions, and you have to communicate everything with those tools.

1151
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,719
So that is a big challenge.

1152
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:01,900
And is that something that just evolves as well?

1153
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:02,199
Are you?

1154
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:07,199
Did you, is it a learned skill in, in, in, and is it, is there a certain cues that all

1155
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:07,940
conductors use?

1156
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:08,539
I mean, or is it?

1157
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:13,980
Well, there are, there are musical cues to invite someone to play at the right time because

1158
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:17,619
often they don't play for ages and then suddenly they've got to come in with an entry and you

1159
00:56:17,619 --> 00:56:21,019
can, you can, I call it an invitation rather than a cue.

1160
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:24,199
Like it's not point and say now, you know, it's like it makes a magic.

1161
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,119
Can't wait to hear this.

1162
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,679
Um, and then there are other players you learn very quickly.

1163
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:30,260
Never look at them.

1164
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,260
They, they, they, they perform worse.

1165
00:56:32,739 --> 00:56:35,460
When you look at them and create that expectation.

1166
00:56:35,739 --> 00:56:36,139
Wow.

1167
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:40,380
And so I've worked out there are, you know, not many, but there are some players that

1168
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:43,219
you're better off just leaving alone, um, and, and doing their own thing.

1169
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,300
And understand that they will be watching along anyway.

1170
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:47,599
And, and yeah, they'll know, they'll know what to do.

1171
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,599
And they're in their own world and they're, they're, they're better like that.

1172
00:56:50,599 --> 00:56:51,940
And they're, they're going to perform better.

1173
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:53,900
Particularly we're talking about French horn solos.

1174
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,960
Like often it's them who are, who are just like, no, no, no, I don't need any distractions.

1175
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,239
I just need to be in the zone here in my own little world to make.

1176
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,659
Um, but you know, some players enjoy a smile.

1177
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,880
Um, it, it all depends on the, the musician, but also the music.

1178
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:16,480
So you're sort of trying to visually paint the emotions of the music in your face and

1179
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,019
in your body.

1180
00:57:17,219 --> 00:57:18,320
That's really interesting.

1181
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:22,019
I know I'll keep going back to the sporting analogies, which, because they're so profound

1182
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:26,920
for me and what you do and the way coaching has evolved in the, you know, in the past,

1183
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,500
it was, this is the way, you know, it's done.

1184
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,199
And if you're not capable, then you're out.

1185
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:37,059
And you're weak and you're, and it was really left a lot of people who just had different

1186
00:57:37,059 --> 00:57:39,820
as you know, needs of how they needed to be coached.

1187
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,199
It just was so unproductive.

1188
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:45,780
You look back and you think the sophistication now to understand that, you know, people respond

1189
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:46,219
differently.

1190
00:57:46,219 --> 00:57:47,519
That's just the way it works.

1191
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:51,320
And so to hear that in, in the orchestral sense as well as.

1192
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,699
Don't you reckon that's also the expectation that the leaders felt?

1193
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:55,539
Yeah.

1194
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:56,000
Yeah.

1195
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,159
In fairness to them, I agree.

1196
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,800
They thought that was the job.

1197
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,199
Correct.

1198
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,699
It's, it's really interesting.

1199
00:58:01,699 --> 00:58:02,179
It's a good point.

1200
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:02,500
It's a good point.

1201
00:58:02,539 --> 00:58:07,059
And I reckon I'm a little, you know, you're trying to apply 2022 logic to 20, it's never

1202
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:07,840
fair, is it?

1203
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:08,059
No.

1204
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:08,980
It's never fair.

1205
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:13,099
I think probably spawned a generation like you though, who probably looked and thought

1206
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:15,579
certainly did in, in sport from my view.

1207
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:16,920
They went, I think there's a better way.

1208
00:58:17,019 --> 00:58:17,179
Yeah.

1209
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:18,260
There's a, there's a better way.

1210
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,360
I think there's a healthier way.

1211
00:58:19,639 --> 00:58:20,039
Absolutely.

1212
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:21,500
We'll achieve more success.

1213
00:58:21,659 --> 00:58:25,360
So it's, it's a profound how it's happened in, in our time.

1214
00:58:26,059 --> 00:58:27,159
Collaboration is your world.

1215
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:30,780
And we see collaboration now for leaders as being something they really value.

1216
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,440
I mean,

1217
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,699
and clearly you don't get to do anything without collaboration, but can you, can you

1218
00:58:35,699 --> 00:58:36,760
describe what it means to you?

1219
00:58:37,539 --> 00:58:38,019
Yeah.

1220
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:39,900
I, I, I love that part of the job.

1221
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:45,079
And for me doing the different kinds of, um, combinations of genre.

1222
00:58:45,219 --> 00:58:50,440
So you'll have the orchestra and, uh, you know, a comedian, or you'll have an orchestra

1223
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:56,260
and a rock band or, um, artists from different areas, non-classical areas, often a theater

1224
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:01,420
thing, or, you know, just, there's so many different kinds of, um, uh, areas of music.

1225
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:06,099
That orchestras are reaching into now and reaching a much wider audience through that

1226
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:06,500
as well.

1227
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,619
And that's the, that's the bringing of two worlds.

1228
00:59:09,619 --> 00:59:14,280
Uh, and, and that conductor becomes the kind of person who's the translator, you know,

1229
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,480
between these two worlds.

1230
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,739
And, uh, I love that because that's the understanding.

1231
00:59:19,739 --> 00:59:24,019
And often when people get, um, to the point where they've got a concert with an orchestra,

1232
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:28,340
if they're, you know, a pop singer or somebody, somebody who doesn't work with orchestras

1233
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:31,420
all the time, that's like a serious high point of their career.

1234
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:32,420
Yeah.

1235
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:35,579
Like I'm here with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, I'm about to perform with them

1236
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:39,420
and they are terrified most of the time.

1237
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:44,079
And that's another part of my job is to kind of say, no, no, it's not this big scary thing,

1238
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:47,039
you know, well it can be, but it doesn't have to be.

1239
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:53,340
And so let's find what we've got in common here and let me be that conduit to, to take

1240
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,380
some of that heat off how you're feeling and it's going to be fine, you know, don't worry

1241
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:57,380
about it.

1242
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:59,880
And so I, I really enjoy that role, I gotta say.

1243
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:00,960
I, I just, I love bringing people in.

1244
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:06,500
I love bringing these, these, um, incongruous kind of worlds of, of different music together.

1245
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:10,260
And I mentioned that in, you know, you've worked with Ben Folds and Nick Cave and James

1246
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:14,719
Morris and Archie Roach and the list goes on and on and on and on and other classical,

1247
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:16,940
uh, legends of music.

1248
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:21,780
Is that been one of your real passions around, you know, bringing that sort of those combining

1249
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:22,780
those worlds?

1250
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:23,780
Is that.

1251
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:29,079
I think it's just been a product of my background because I have played in very many different

1252
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:30,920
kinds of musical groups.

1253
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,679
I mean, the Nick Cave, Warren Ellis one was very interesting.

1254
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:38,219
Um, Warren Ellis, it turns out it's from Ballarat, same as me.

1255
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:43,159
And we had the same, uh, flute teacher when we were kids, which we didn't know.

1256
01:00:43,159 --> 01:00:48,559
And, and, you know, Warren's like, you know, mega rock star and, uh, he and Nick have got

1257
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:53,099
into composing music for films and they came and worked with the MSO the first time they'd

1258
01:00:53,099 --> 01:00:57,159
ever worked with an orchestra and, and these are two legendary world musicians.

1259
01:00:57,159 --> 01:01:00,920
And it was all of a sudden, like they were little kids again, you know, like with the

1260
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:01,920
orchestra.

1261
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,920
Yeah.

1262
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:03,920
They were just like, whoa, this is a world we don't understand.

1263
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:10,739
And, um, you know, that was such a special collaboration because it showed to me that

1264
01:01:10,739 --> 01:01:16,920
they had started their lives as, as, um, rock musicians in bands.

1265
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:22,179
They've gone on this amazing global journey, evolving their musicality and now they're

1266
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:30,320
writing for films and now they're absolutely comfortable being celebrated with an orchestra,

1267
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:30,719
playing their music.

1268
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:30,820
Yeah.

1269
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:30,920
Yeah.

1270
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,579
That's amazing.

1271
01:01:32,579 --> 01:01:37,579
Like that journey there, that, that to me is, is just, well, that's how open-minded

1272
01:01:37,579 --> 01:01:39,380
the musical world is now.

1273
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:44,139
And, and that would very rarely have happened, um, in decades gone by.

1274
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:44,559
Yeah.

1275
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:48,880
So I, I just think that's a fantastic development, the, the open-mindedness and the fact that

1276
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,960
you can have these, these, you know, diverse experiences musically.

1277
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:53,780
It's so great.

1278
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,400
My mind's going, uh, Ben, to, to, to, if I'm driving in the car with Ben Northey or I'm,

1279
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,719
I'm at home, what are, what are you listening to?

1280
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:02,280
And how, how diverse?

1281
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:04,699
I mean, is it, is it mostly classical or is it?

1282
01:02:04,699 --> 01:02:06,639
No, no, God, no, no, very rare.

1283
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,099
I mean, that's, that's kind of work for me.

1284
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:15,380
So, um, yeah, ABC Classic is a great radio station and I do listen to it every now and

1285
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:18,679
again, but I'm, I'm, I'm in a different listening space.

1286
01:02:18,679 --> 01:02:19,500
I'm critical.

1287
01:02:19,719 --> 01:02:21,880
I'm analyzing, you know, I'm working.

1288
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:22,579
So as soon as.

1289
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:24,820
So if you're listening to an orchestra play, your mind's.

1290
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:26,619
I'm constantly, I'm, I'm on the podium.

1291
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:27,139
Yeah.

1292
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:30,300
I'm on the, I'm, oh, they could have done this or, you know, why aren't they?

1293
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,219
And, and, oh, that was really good.

1294
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,000
Like, you know, you can learn a lot from listening.

1295
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,460
I don't mean to say I never listen, but, um, yeah, it's, it's not classical music.

1296
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:41,880
The kids are dominating the air, the airwaves at our house all the time.

1297
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,699
So there's heaps of music that I'm discovering for the first time through them.

1298
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:48,880
But no, it's a wide palette, a lot of jazz.

1299
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:54,820
Um, I've, I've gotten in recently to, uh, I've been doing a spot on ABC Melbourne, um,

1300
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,380
afternoons, which we call Calm the Farm.

1301
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,000
And it's like little two, three minutes.

1302
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:04,699
Snippets of music just to give everyone a chance to actually recenter their day and

1303
01:03:04,699 --> 01:03:09,960
go, okay, just let's take a breather for a second and recalibrate and just listen.

1304
01:03:10,139 --> 01:03:12,159
Just that's all just focus on one thing.

1305
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:13,659
People have got so much out of it.

1306
01:03:13,699 --> 01:03:16,019
We did it during the lockdowns and it was so popular.

1307
01:03:16,179 --> 01:03:17,219
They've just kept it going.

1308
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,840
And, um, I've actually discovered a whole genre of music called contemporary classical,

1309
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:23,460
they call it.

1310
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:29,360
And it's often piano based, very meditative, minimal, not kind of new agey at all, but,

1311
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:29,960
but just beautiful.

1312
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:36,219
Beautiful and really relaxing and, and, um, sort of affirming to listen to.

1313
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:39,039
And, and so I've actually started using that quite a lot now.

1314
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,519
Um, just in the middle of the day, just go, okay, I'm just going to, it's like a meditation,

1315
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:46,059
I guess, but it's like three minutes of just listen to music.

1316
01:03:46,139 --> 01:03:47,980
That's a meditation as it turns out.

1317
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:48,780
Calm the Farm.

1318
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,719
I love it, Ben.

1319
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:55,159
It's funny that I, I consider myself not musical in any way, but there is not a moment in the

1320
01:03:55,159 --> 01:03:57,579
car and that's something he's playing constantly.

1321
01:03:57,860 --> 01:04:00,280
And so you are really, and you, and you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,

1322
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:04,139
you can appreciate everything and, you know, and through your kids, you suddenly discover

1323
01:04:04,139 --> 01:04:08,400
this whole, you know, um, you know, there's a fair bit of rap going on this morning before

1324
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:08,940
I got up.

1325
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:13,800
I've got, I've got this, uh, band called Tokyo Machine that, um, cause Leo, my eight

1326
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,059
year old son, he's massively into video games.

1327
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:17,300
So it's disturbing.

1328
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,900
We went to PAX on the weekend and this big convention.

1329
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:20,860
What a phenomenon that is.

1330
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:21,559
Unbelievable.

1331
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,320
Hundreds of thousands at the convention center in Melbourne.

1332
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:28,659
It's the biggest convention by a factor of about two, I think.

1333
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:29,940
So, so, you know, and music.

1334
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,300
Music is huge in this, right?

1335
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:36,360
So video games and music, it's like film, but video games is a bigger industry than

1336
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:36,820
film.

1337
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:37,860
All film.

1338
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:38,460
It's incredible.

1339
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:39,920
It's amazing what's happened there.

1340
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,760
But anyway, he's listening to this band, Tokyo Machine and it's all computer game music.

1341
01:04:44,059 --> 01:04:47,940
And yeah, it's all computer game music and like remixed and all this kind of stuff.

1342
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:51,579
And I'm listening to it going, wow, that's like nothing I've ever heard before.

1343
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:52,260
That's amazing.

1344
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,280
And you can appreciate it in that sense.

1345
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:55,480
Oh yeah.

1346
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:56,900
Now good music's good music.

1347
01:04:57,099 --> 01:04:57,940
That's the thing.

1348
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,280
It doesn't matter what genre it is.

1349
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,079
It's hard to do it well.

1350
01:05:02,219 --> 01:05:05,860
And when you hear it done well, it doesn't matter if it's a three minute pop song or

1351
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:10,159
a 50 minute symphony, you know, there you can appreciate the artistry in each of those

1352
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:10,559
things.

1353
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,639
I love it.

1354
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:16,679
Ben, I've got so many more questions, but in the interest of time, there's two final

1355
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:18,679
questions that I've been asking all the ladies.

1356
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:23,460
I've had a great privilege to sit down alongside and learn from, as I have from you incredibly

1357
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:26,619
today, who has been the greatest leader in your life?

1358
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:29,380
Wow.

1359
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:30,340
Big question.

1360
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:38,079
You know, I'd have to say the, one of the teachers at the Sibelius Academy is a guy

1361
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:42,920
called Jorma Panola, and he is considered to be the world's greatest conducting teacher,

1362
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:43,300
right?

1363
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:48,760
And he, um, is in his nineties now still going around the world, giving masterclasses to

1364
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:49,659
groups of conductors.

1365
01:05:49,739 --> 01:05:53,440
He's dedicated, uh, the second half of his life to this teaching role.

1366
01:05:54,019 --> 01:05:55,420
And he found you, didn't you?

1367
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,559
You won the prize in.

1368
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:57,059
Yeah.

1369
01:05:57,059 --> 01:06:01,760
I first met him in 2001, where he was the main teacher of this.

1370
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:04,619
Um, symphony, Australia, young conductor of the year competition.

1371
01:06:04,619 --> 01:06:06,159
And that wasn't just a competition.

1372
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:11,360
That was a 10 week development program that culminated in a competition that I unexpectedly

1373
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:15,400
won much to the horror of some of the other participants who'd been doing it for years.

1374
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,500
Um, but that led me to the Sibelius Academy and he was there as well, even though he wasn't

1375
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:24,900
the main teacher, I still worked with him and finished my studies with him at the Stockholm

1376
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:25,940
Royal College of Music.

1377
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:30,519
It was like learning from Yoda, you know, like this is the level we're talking about, like

1378
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:31,760
Zen kind of.

1379
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:37,300
Um, teaching and, and it was from him that it was that forget yourself only music.

1380
01:06:38,019 --> 01:06:41,659
Um, he was an extraordinary person in the way that he taught.

1381
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,159
He allowed everybody to be themselves.

1382
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,199
He brought out the strengths of everybody.

1383
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:49,139
Uh, he didn't have a one size fits all approach.

1384
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:53,579
All of his students are very different than each other, but the big thing he did was he

1385
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:56,280
set up a structure of teaching that has endured.

1386
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:58,280
And that was the thing that struck me.

1387
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,280
I thought, wow, the great leaders, they actually leave a legacy that remains.

1388
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:07,539
And so he set up a new way of teaching conducting, which was video analysis and people never

1389
01:07:07,539 --> 01:07:08,460
thought about it before.

1390
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:12,980
And, you know, he set up like three cameras and did all of his teaching in the video room,

1391
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:16,880
not while the conductors were in front of the orchestra, which is generally how teachers

1392
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:21,019
had done it up to that point, or just let people, you know, sink and swim, um, sink

1393
01:07:21,019 --> 01:07:22,260
or swim, work it out on the job.

1394
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:29,079
So I really admire the fact that he was able to reinvent conductor training globally, but

1395
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:31,400
also what he gave me personally, which was just.

1396
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:36,400
You know, again, like John Hopkins, he, he made me, um, believe that I could do it.

1397
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,920
And at the end, I'll never forget after I did all this work with him, you know, for

1398
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,099
five years or something, I worked with him and I saw a lot of him and, and at the end,

1399
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:45,280
he just looked at me, he said, you're welcome.

1400
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:46,159
Yeah.

1401
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:52,039
And it was really so moving to, to have that, you're done, you're ready.

1402
01:07:52,219 --> 01:07:52,539
Yeah.

1403
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:55,699
You know, that's where I started my career.

1404
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:56,460
What a great story.

1405
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:58,679
Did he stay in touch and follow you?

1406
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:00,420
Would he, would he drop in if you're.

1407
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:00,500
Yeah.

1408
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:01,320
Look.

1409
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,039
If it, cause he's in Finland, not really.

1410
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:07,940
And I think that was also part of his, that was, you're welcome.

1411
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:08,579
Yeah.

1412
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,900
It's time for you to go out on your own now.

1413
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:12,380
Yeah.

1414
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,960
I've got, I've got the next.

1415
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:14,539
Yeah.

1416
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:14,920
Group.

1417
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:15,780
Yeah.

1418
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,520
To look after.

1419
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:21,100
And so, you know, I, I keep in touch with him, send him postcards and, and, um, you

1420
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,479
know, email and he'll send a reply every now and again.

1421
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:28,760
And, but, uh, you know, it was really that sort of period of time was my time with him.

1422
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:29,800
And now.

1423
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:31,180
It's other people.

1424
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:31,760
It's time with him.

1425
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:32,819
It's really amazing.

1426
01:08:32,939 --> 01:08:33,439
I love it.

1427
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:39,000
In the, uh, spirit of collaboration, Ben, we, we, uh, obsessed with, uh, what great

1428
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,800
collaboration looks like and including what you're doing with the Alita Connect group

1429
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,979
we mentioned and collaborating, bringing people together to share.

1430
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:47,500
Is there, is there anyone in the world?

1431
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:52,560
I mean, that, you know, or maybe even historically, if you could come back and, and, um, you know,

1432
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,539
get Mozart back or, uh, you know, if you could collaborate with anyone on any project

1433
01:08:56,539 --> 01:08:59,180
and anything, is there someone that, that might spring to mind?

1434
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:03,479
Oh, there's so many people you'd love to reanimate.

1435
01:09:03,659 --> 01:09:07,760
I mean, there's so many questions I'd have for some of these bloody composers that you

1436
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:12,500
work with because, you know, they write this stuff down and you've got to work it out and

1437
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:16,239
you can't call them up and ask questions and everyone's got a different idea.

1438
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:23,220
I think, you know, this is a little bit, um, in my area and I'm sure there's more interesting

1439
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:28,180
people out there that I could think of, but, but actually asking Ludwig van Beethoven some

1440
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:28,779
questions.

1441
01:09:28,779 --> 01:09:33,840
Some questions at a dinner party would be very appealing because he was somebody who

1442
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:36,760
incorporated politics into his music.

1443
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:38,920
He was one of the first people really to do that.

1444
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:47,140
And the meaning behind what he was writing about, he sort of covers more spiritual terrain

1445
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:48,619
than any other composer.

1446
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:53,420
And, and people talk about Beethoven and I don't know what people's, um, images when

1447
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:57,359
they hear that name, you know, of this grumpy old composer with gray hair and everything.

1448
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:58,760
And he was that.

1449
01:09:59,159 --> 01:10:02,880
But he just had this amazing humanity in him as well.

1450
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:13,420
But he was using music for something bigger than what it was.

1451
01:10:13,579 --> 01:10:16,500
So he was trying to send a message in his symphonies.

1452
01:10:16,659 --> 01:10:21,760
So Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is about, uh, rebellion.

1453
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,619
It's about resistance.

1454
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:31,319
It's about not, you know, putting up with, um, at that point it was the, the, um, Napoleonic

1455
01:10:31,319 --> 01:10:34,420
Empire and, um, sweeping through Europe at that time.

1456
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,880
You know, there's always these subtexts to music.

1457
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:41,460
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, the Ode to Joy, the Choral Symphony.

1458
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,439
That's about borderless worlds.

1459
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:53,060
That's about one, you know, one planet, everybody being united through music.

1460
01:10:53,159 --> 01:10:55,159
So it's that kind of level.

1461
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:59,779
I reckon that, you know, it's a great model to, to look back on.

1462
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,500
I'd love to ask him more about that.

1463
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:02,100
That's for sure.

1464
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:03,899
Was it controversial at the time?

1465
01:11:03,899 --> 01:11:05,380
The politics did that.

1466
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:07,260
Did he create some enemies for him?

1467
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:08,479
He had to be very careful.

1468
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:09,060
Yeah.

1469
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:13,279
So he was in Vienna at that time when he wrote the Fifth Symphony and that was a police state

1470
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:13,779
basically.

1471
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:19,000
Um, and he was very subversive and, uh, he had to be very careful.

1472
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:22,539
He did, he did get into trouble every now and again, but you know, there's composers

1473
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:23,579
through history have done that.

1474
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:28,319
Some of the Russian composers, Shostakovich in the 20th century, uh, had his music cancelled

1475
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:31,720
by the regime, um, over there, Stalin.

1476
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:35,220
Um, so, you know, the musicians have been used.

1477
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:40,720
They've been using their music in all of these ways for centuries, you know, it's been going

1478
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:41,000
on.

1479
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:44,199
And was Beethoven as appreciated at the time?

1480
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:47,260
Was he, was he as massive as, as he should have been in his life?

1481
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:52,939
Yeah, he, he was one of, he was one of the guys who actually was revered when he was

1482
01:11:52,939 --> 01:11:53,380
alive.

1483
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,859
Now, many of them weren't.

1484
01:11:55,039 --> 01:12:00,380
So, you know, Mozart was, you know, famously died at 34 and nobody celebrated his passing

1485
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:01,380
and it was only later.

1486
01:12:01,699 --> 01:12:05,140
Cause back in those days, you, you didn't re-perform music of people.

1487
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:08,359
They would write it for a certain thing and you just do it and then it was done.

1488
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,220
And it was only in the 19th century.

1489
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:12,439
People look back on, we're getting onto another podcast here.

1490
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:15,039
People would look back on it and go, you know what?

1491
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:16,239
We should play that music again.

1492
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,260
And that's when the understanding came.

1493
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:21,779
Now we're probably overbalanced too far where we don't play enough new music.

1494
01:12:21,899 --> 01:12:23,140
You know, we need to get back to that.

1495
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,220
It's brilliant, Ben.

1496
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:26,460
As I said, I, I keep, uh, having questions.

1497
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:30,939
It's a space that I'm, uh, I'm fascinated about and I'm really grateful that you've

1498
01:12:30,939 --> 01:12:34,539
taken the time and explain the genius of your world.

1499
01:12:34,619 --> 01:12:35,319
It's a, it's a great.

1500
01:12:35,319 --> 01:12:38,319
Um, feel really grateful that you were able to take the time.

1501
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:38,819
Thanks so much.

1502
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,000
No, no worries, Luke.

1503
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:40,460
Anytime.
