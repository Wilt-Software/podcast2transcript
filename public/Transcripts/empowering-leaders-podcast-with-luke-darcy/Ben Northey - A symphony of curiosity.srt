00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,250
What an incredible conversation this week on the Empowering Leaders podcast.

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,910
I had the great pleasure of talking to the principal conductor of the Melbourne Symphony

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,429
Orchestra and two-time ARIA Award winner, Benjamin Northey.

4
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:22,769
Listening to Ben's thoughts on curiosity as the ultimate path to learning and the most

5
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,350
important thing we can pass on to our kids, I found fascinating.

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,670
Ben's perspective on pressure and musical performance was equally compelling.

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,170
I learnt an incredible amount from Ben and I'm sure you're going to enjoy this conversation.

8
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,890
Ben has collaborated with a plethora of musicians across the world, including the likes of Ben

9
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:45,590
Folds, Nick Cave, KD Lang, Sting, the late, great Archie Roach, and the list goes on and

10
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:45,810
on.

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,770
And this type of collaboration is a big part of the world I love to explore through Alita,

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,329
a business founded with my great friend, Matt Wadowitz.

13
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:56,549
It's a place where leaders can collaborate and learn from one another.

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,649
We've had some incredible names join us, including Hamish and Andy's

15
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:05,530
Andy Lee, Ange Postacoglu from Celtic, Arsenal's Mikel Arteta, just to name a few.

16
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:08,769
And we are equally excited about you joining as well.

17
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,290
If it's a space that you are interested in, we would love you to check it out at

18

19
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:17,870
Encourage you to have a look at our signature Alita Connect program to understand how people

20
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,230
like Ben, who's part of that program, are collaborating and leading in their world.

21
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,450
Ben, it's a great privilege to spend some time with you.

22
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:37,170
I've been really looking forward to this.

23
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:37,769
Thanks for joining me.

24
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,069
Oh, it's a pleasure, Das.

25
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:40,549
And yeah, I get tired.

26
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,849
Just hearing that list of stuff that's been going on.

27
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,150
But yeah, it's amazing, actually, just to reflect on a few of those things that you

28
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:53,670
read out and and realize that before that, I actually had a different kind of life as

29
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,609
a performing musician.

30
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:58,969
I used to play the saxophone and I played in cover bands in Melbourne and did all kinds

31
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:00,090
of crazy work.

32
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,890
And as you mentioned, that diversity has ended up being a strength of mine.

33
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:05,989
So, yeah, it's interesting.

34
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:10,389
I want to talk to that in a minute, the diversity of your music passion.

35
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:13,610
But can I go back reading as young as two?

36
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,270
I understand that you were obsessed with your mum and dad's record collection.

37
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,310
And by the age of three, your mum, who's an outstanding pianist, had enrolled you in a

38
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,830
Yamaha early learning class.

39
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,370
Can you remember as young as that age having music in your DNA?

40
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,770
I remember listening to records back in, I'm born in 1970, so a child of the 70s.

41
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,009
And I remember they, mum and dad, did have a great record collection.

42
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,330
And that was the thing.

43
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,169
You're always looking for what your kids show interests in, aren't you?

44
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:40,530
You know, as parents.

45
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:40,870
As parents.

46
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:46,189
And they saw me stop when the music was playing and just sit there, you know, and listen as

47
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:46,550
a toddler.

48
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,150
And so they just kept feeding that interest and that appetite.

49
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,150
And so I do remember actually listening to records.

50
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:56,729
They, you know, they would play all kinds of stuff.

51
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:03,349
They actually had a really interesting collection of music for young children by a European

52
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,770
guy called Carl Orff, who had a sort of system of teaching music.

53
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:10,370
It was called Schulwerk, schoolwork for young.

54
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,750
And I think actually I got a hell of a lot out of listening to that because it was like

55
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,569
the building blocks of music and absorbing that at that young, really young age.

56
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:23,150
Music just sort of made sense to me a bit more after that.

57
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,810
It was interesting.

58
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,530
You mentioned, you know, playing and your diverse interests.

59
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,189
I read you started with the violin at school.

60
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:31,909
You moved to the trumpet, the flute.

61
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:36,050
At uni you played the saxophone, as you said, in a James Brown cover band.

62
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,050
And then you studied the soprano saxophone.

63
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:38,909
Yeah.

64
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:40,270
You know.

65
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,330
Now I look at you as one of the world's leading conductors.

66
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:47,530
Do you think that there's so much benefit for you and having played so many instruments

67
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,389
that that has really helped you in what you do now?

68
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:54,310
Well, yes, but it's a very unconventional pathway.

69
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,810
So if you were going to say to somebody or if they said, I want to be a conductor, that's

70
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,590
not the pathway that you would give them.

71
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:01,889
No, no, no, no.

72
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:05,009
It would be much more specialised.

73
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:10,250
They would say, you know, play the piano, work in an opera company.

74
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:15,669
Perhaps and accompany singers, work your way up to conducting as the second or third

75
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:19,129
conductor, get your opportunities in front of the orchestra that way.

76
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,529
Or what's more common now is play in an orchestra for a period of time.

77
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,209
And so I play because I was playing the saxophone primarily as a teenager.

78
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:30,750
I was in what they call wind ensembles.

79
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,050
So we had no strings.

80
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:32,930
It was just wind bands.

81
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,250
And that was very different, but similar in the same sense because they're large ensembles.

82
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,110
So I got the same kind of large ensemble.

83
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:48,250
But when I look at the crazy journey in music I went on because I was sort of curious about

84
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,110
the next thing, it seemed random at the time.

85
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,790
And it's only now that I look back on it and I go, actually, that's a great foundation

86
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,949
for the work I'm doing.

87
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:01,910
And it's kind of come in really handy for me.

88
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:02,629
Do you still play?

89
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:03,870
No, I don't.

90
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,689
I actually still own my soprano saxophone.

91
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:09,990
But, you know, the thing, Darce, is now that I work...

92
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:16,209
I work and collaborate with so many world-class performers, it's ridiculous.

93
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,709
Like, if I pick up the saxophone after not having played it for 10 years or something,

94
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:20,949
it's not going to sound great.

95
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:25,290
And it's going to be even worse because I know what it can sound like, you know, the

96
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,410
way I used to play when I was working at it every day, but also working with these amazing

97
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,370
soloists, you just think, well, the world doesn't need to hear me play anymore.

98
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,389
That's an interesting way to think.

99
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:39,889
I suppose, as you said, you're with the world's best and your ear must be...

100
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:45,370
I look at your role without understanding it, but in some ways it's the ultimate leadership

101
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:45,750
role.

102
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,389
You've got...

103
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,230
Is it up to 90 musicians in an orchestra?

104
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:52,230
Yeah, well, sometimes you've got a choir as well, so you can have, you know, 300 people

105
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,509
on stage at times, so it's big, yeah.

106
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:59,209
And they're looking at every movement you make, every bit of body language, every expression

107
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:03,310
to take their temperature, I suppose, from your lead.

108
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,930
I mean, what's been the key to your success in doing it at the level that you do?

109
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:09,670
Well...

110
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:16,389
First and foremost, it's, I guess, your musicality, your sense of having a vision for a piece

111
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:21,209
of music, because that's what the conductor has to bring, a vision that everyone buys

112
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:22,990
into and is willing to follow.

113
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:28,329
So it's very much that classic leader-follower kind of relationship with the orchestra.

114
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:34,250
But I think a lot of people think that it's about power, and it's not, really.

115
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:38,670
Power comes with the position, but that's not what it's about.

116
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,670
Like, a lot of people see the...

117
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,389
The maestro up the front waving their arms around and, like, you know, kind of dictating

118
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:47,990
how this is going to go to the obedient musicians who are following.

119
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,910
It's actually much more collaborative than that in terms of what's actually going on,

120
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:58,730
this kind of exchange of wills that's happening between the conductor and the musicians.

121
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:05,430
It's a frustrating job for musicians, and like any big group of people, there's a psychology

122
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,089
that you have to work out, and I think that's one of the strengths that I bring to it.

123
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,370
I'm always thinking about the people that I'm working with, and I'm trying to think

124
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:23,350
about the best way in which to guide them to an outcome whilst respecting them and involving

125
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,490
them in that process.

126
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:30,610
So, you know, I'm a collaborator, you know, by nature, and I'm trying to facilitate their

127
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,430
best performance the whole time.

128
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:34,990
I'm not trying to say, this is how it goes.

129
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,490
I'm like, what is the best outcome for this particular situation and this group of people?

130
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:39,990
So I'm...

131
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,110
I'm really interested in that.

132
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:46,670
So, Ben, is that a shift in terms of conductors of the past would have been much more of a

133
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,649
dictatorship and stood out the front, and there would have been that hierarchical, I'm

134
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:53,230
the boss, and probably the reverse of what you're saying.

135
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:57,250
I'm fascinated by that because I know you've got a great passion for sport that I want

136
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:02,149
to get onto through this chat, and we've seen a massive shift as well in the world of sport

137
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,089
and the way coaches are much more collaborative as well.

138
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:07,970
When I played, you know, the coach was the boss.

139
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:09,870
You didn't give any feedback the other way.

140
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,350
You did what you were told, or you got, you know, put in your place pretty quickly.

141
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,529
That shift has been pretty profound.

142
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:16,829
Is that the same in your world?

143
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,889
Very much so.

144
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:23,290
So what's happened is the power has shifted from the maestro being the boss and being

145
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,850
able to fire people on the spot and that kind of stuff.

146
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:28,110
So that would have happened in the past, literally?

147
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,209
You're not pulling your weight, hop out of the orchestra.

148
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:35,690
It has happened, and often for no reason, just because people want to demonstrate their

149
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,049
power.

150
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,909
And, you know, it's the idea of how do you get the best?

151
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,990
How do you get the best out of people?

152
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:47,429
And I think there was a sense back in those days, we're talking mid-20th century and before,

153
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:52,669
that fear was actually the best driver of people, which is just an anathema to me.

154
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:59,250
You know, I'm trying to fight against that all the time, because I think people are much

155
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:04,370
more responsive in a relaxed state, and they're much more able to bring their best in that

156
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,370
state.

157
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,370
But that's how I work.

158
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,370
So everyone's different.

159
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,909
But the big thing that's changed is the orchestras are much more self-disciplined.

160
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:15,149
They're very self-determining now, so they are very responsible for who conducts them,

161
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:16,149
for example.

162
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:19,830
So at the end of a week, they'll fill out their surveys and give an opinion about the

163
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:25,250
work of the visiting conductor, for example, or their regular conductor, and that determines

164
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,250
whether you come back.

165
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,230
So the power has shifted, and that's been a good thing, because it's made conductors

166
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,850
change the way in which they communicate and interact with the orchestra players.

167
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,590
We had a very brief chat before we hit record, and you said something that

168
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,710
was very important.

169
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:39,750
Yeah.

170
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,850
Yeah.

171
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:39,870
Yeah.

172
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:39,889
Yeah.

173
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:45,070
You know, reverberated in my mind to say that the people playing an instrument orchestra

174
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,110
almost feel like they're doing brain surgery.

175
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,129
I think, to paraphrase what you said, they feel that pressure of wanting to get it right

176
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:53,029
for the expanded team.

177
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,289
Is that how it is for a lot of them?

178
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:55,610
Yeah.

179
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:58,309
The expectation is huge at that level.

180
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:03,149
We're talking about people who have dedicated their entire lives, often from very young

181
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:09,730
age, to one thing, and because it's a big team, everyone's relying on everyone else.

182
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:09,750
Yeah.

183
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,750
else and so it's you got to think of an orchestra as kind of one thing it's it's like that's the

184
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:22,750
goal is to make it this one beautiful in harmony machine of humanity you know that that's everyone's

185
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,070
listening to each other they're all fitting in with each other and some people are leading some

186
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,169
people know when to stay out of the way and balance and let other things through and there's this whole

187
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:40,330
kind of um you know uh operational hierarchy within an orchestra as well um i think in terms

188
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:45,769
of the pressure uh and and yes i i think there have been studies done on that where they say

189
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:51,649
the pressure that people feel when they're playing for for example a solo in an orchestra is the same

190
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:55,909
kind of pressure that a brain surgeon feels when they're operating on somebody which is it's crazy

191
00:10:55,909 --> 00:11:00,389
when you think about it because no one's going to die in an orchestral context but that's how they

192
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,889
feel

193
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:07,450
and so you know it's it's perform or or die i mean it's it's like that that's that's the mindset

194
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:13,490
people come in with and i think that's the same in sport you know you've got to bring it when it

195
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:21,009
counts and that's in the concert so that that's the magic and the terror of of live music and

196
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:24,950
that's you know we're not talking about amplified concerts this is just you and your instrument

197
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:30,190
and the audience and your own expectations and the group's expectations

198
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:36,269
well to team sport if you have an off day in the team it's pretty obvious you know you you know

199
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:42,730
there's there's stats and there's data and and most athletes will know very very quickly in fact

200
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,110
everyone does if yet is that the same in in an orchestral sense that's you know someone can have

201
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:53,149
an off night and and is it do you need a you know a refined ear to understand that or or would the

202
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:56,889
the player themselves feel as though they had a bad night oh they'd know for sure and it depends

203
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:00,429
on the instrument you know the the way the orchestra is structured is there's a whole lot of

204
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:06,970
players like violins violas cellos and basses that's a big section you can kind of blend in as a as

205
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:12,049
a group in that section but if you're one of what we call the principal players so principal oboe

206
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:18,269
principal french horn diabolical instrument to play small margin for error everyone can hear if

207
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:22,590
you've made a mistake like it's if you've got a real sympathy for these people first trumpet

208
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:30,009
um but you know even on violin if you've got a solo yes it's obvious when something's going wrong

209
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:36,669
you hear somebody mentally really struggling in a concert it's a terrible scenario because

210
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:44,590
that i i think from a conductor's perspective what what have what can i do a to help in this

211
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:51,350
situation and bring them back and um you feel bad because you haven't brought out their best

212
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,269
at that time as well so something's gone wrong might not be your fault but you're the leader

213
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:59,990
you have to take responsibility as well yeah in preparation for this i you know read extensively

214
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:05,049
of that collaborative nature of large-scale music making there was one quote that was

215
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:08,909
attributed to i wanted to read back it's one of the few this is your words one of the few examples

216
00:13:08,909 --> 00:13:13,970
of a large number of human beings cooperating in real time to achieve a very very difficult

217
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:20,090
end product as a metaphor for what human beings can achieve there's nothing like an orchestra i

218
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:25,529
can hear the passion in those words does that sort of sum up to you the the reason why you

219
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:30,129
love getting it out trying to create that sort of joy it is it is and and see

220
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:38,009
you know as human beings we we kind of want to collaborate i think um by our nature we want

221
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:43,549
to be part of something bigger the things we can achieve as a collective are much greater than the

222
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:47,690
things we can achieve by ourselves and that's the truth with music so my daughter we were talking

223
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:53,669
about um before we started she's just started violin she's 10 years old she you know is doing

224
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:57,990
a practice she did her first state music camp this year and got to play in an orchestra for

225
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,870
the first time and so she hasn't really been that into the violin she's just started playing the

226
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:04,830
violin up to this point all of a sudden she gets in the orchestra she says dad you should hear it

227
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,230
it's unbelievable i said yeah i know that's what i do she goes no you don't understand

228
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:16,289
i really like it's really amazing and so you know it's that kind of feeling of um of of the power of

229
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:25,009
of um cooperation you know and and the orchestra for all of its crazy kind of old world um

230
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:30,870
stigma and stereotypes it's actually still a very relevant

231
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:35,230
institution i want to jump into the parenting thing for a moment they've been pick up on

232
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,389
on that conversation i love talking to leaders like you on a range of things but but with parent

233
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:44,029
when your dad's one of the leading conductors around the world and you pick up the violin and

234
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:48,710
and you know i in the same in a football sense i suppose if your dad's played and then you're

235
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,009
you're running around an oz kick there's a there's an expectation do you think she

236
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:57,149
feels a little a bit of that intuitively that hang on a few more people are watching me than

237
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:00,870
someone else yeah it's possible it's still early days and you've got to be careful of that don't

238
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:05,570
you you know because that's the last thing i want want her to feel and the way that i think about

239
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:11,429
music is that it's really part of a full education so it's one of the things and it's a shame um that

240
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:15,710
it seems to have been been more peripheral in particularly primary school for example like

241
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:19,509
you know there were there are schools still out there but when i went to school it was kind of

242
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:23,610
like you did your music lessons in the in the school time and there was a specialist music

243
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:28,190
teacher that's changed now so you don't have specialist music teachers in primary schools

244
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,870
anymore and so i i think of it as kind of

245
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:38,690
this tool to um i guess stimulate her creativity or any child's creativity and that can manifest

246
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:43,470
then in other areas of of their personal growth so i'm hoping that that's how she feels i don't

247
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,750
want her to feel any expectation being a conductor's daughter but i guess that's going to

248
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,690
happen at some point so ben we see a lot of um you know to use the term that the sort of tiger mom

249
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:56,029
you're getting a violin in your hand and no matter what there's six lessons a week and i'm going to

250
00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:00,649
you know enforce that that for you for the better good i think the intention's always great i mean

251
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:06,029
you can hear in your world that you just through curiosity chopped and chained what's your advice

252
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:10,169
because i think you know we all see now as you said the benefit of creativity through music but

253
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:15,370
do you need to to to drive a little bit or just let the kids find their own part i don't think

254
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:21,029
it's a bad thing to drive a little bit because that's one of the things it teaches you like any

255
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:27,070
any discipline uh is that importance of of actually sticking at it and and that's the

256
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,690
thing about music the more you practice the more fun it becomes yeah the more fun it becomes the

257
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:37,110
more you practice so it's this kind of loop yeah um so i don't know i i feel like there is a limit

258
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:42,029
i always say to eva you don't have to do a lot of practice you just have to do it every day you know

259
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:46,490
it's it's like 10 minutes it's not you know so you can't do this until you've done your practice

260
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:51,389
and that's the deal and she kind of goes oh yeah fair enough and just just does it look she may

261
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:56,970
give it up she complains about learning piano that's fine um she complains about playing netball

262
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,750
on the weekend sometimes too but she still does it so you know it's just it's just

263
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:05,450
part of raising kids that's what i think anyway i love her coming back dad you don't understand

264
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:11,150
how good an orchestra stands it's just genius isn't it it's brilliant can i ask you for those

265
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:15,289
that aren't regular listeners to classical music i'm going to put my hand up i in preparation for

266
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:20,529
this have been i've been loving it and uh and listening to to some of your work and is there

267
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:25,670
one piece of music you know we all have heard of beethoven's fifth or the you know is there

268
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:30,809
one particular you know bit of music that sums up the genius of of what an orchestra does

269
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:37,470
oh that's a that's a really tough one actually luke because there are so many amazing parts of

270
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:43,890
the repertoire i mean i guess the most impactful ones are the ones that are huge scale and actually

271
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:49,230
even most people would say they don't know much about classical music you know but they do they

272
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:56,589
hear it in ads on television they hear it in their computer games in their movies um the the ones

273
00:17:56,589 --> 00:18:00,730
that really stick out for me are the the huge scale works that involve choir and orchestra

274
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,009
so when you've we were talking before about the numbers of people that you can be conducting at

275
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:10,990
one time uh i recently conducted a piece by an italian composer called giuseppe verdi and that's

276
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,930
the other thing about you know this this kind of heritage of the orchestra that that's joseph green

277
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:21,910
in english translation you know what i mean but it sounds so kind of inaccessible in in this you

278
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:27,130
know italian language but he wrote a requiem at the end of his life and he was a primarily an

279
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,869
opera composer and a requiem is meant to be a religious piece of music and it's a piece of

280
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,329
religious kind of work and a lot of the big composers have written a work like this and he

281
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:40,130
wrote it in this very non-religious operatic kind of style and i conducted it for the first time

282
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:45,970
this year choir of 250 over in christ church in new zealand one of the biggest projects we'd had

283
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:53,329
since covid you know so it was a a massive cathartic event anyway and that piece of music

284
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:58,349
if you want to just have your mind blown i mean it's pretty long but even one movement of it

285
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:00,849
listen to the dears era the day of judgment

286
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:06,470
of that particular requiem the verdi requiem and it will blow your mind it doesn't matter

287
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:11,069
if you're into classical music or not it'll just completely blow your mind and there's i could name

288
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:16,289
a hundred pieces that are like that and is that the genius of when you get that amount of humans

289
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:23,250
in a room together it creates an energy that recorded music can never ever uh replicate i

290
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,470
suppose exactly it's a completely different experience because you are witnessing and

291
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,869
in you know the performance case being a part of the creation of that work

292
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:36,029
but if you're in the audience you're also part of it because the audience and the performers that's

293
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:40,710
a sacred relationship as well and you can feel that energy in a room like when everybody has

294
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:47,309
a reaction to the music together in a room the electricity that that creates it's intangible i

295
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:52,509
don't know how it works but that's what it's all about and and that and it's just it's incredible

296
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:57,130
the way it unites people like that good luck being at the mcg with the richmond army uh ben

297
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,769
and uh you know singing tiger land and and richmond winning

298
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:05,490
another uh a big fight it's a collective experience isn't it it is being there there's

299
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:11,230
no substitute and and we we understood that when they took the crowds away and you know we were

300
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:18,789
commentating games at the mcg with no one there and the lifeless feeling it was bizarre and so i

301
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:24,369
suppose it's given us this appreciation but you can't replicate that energy you know you know my

302
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:28,690
team are the red white and blue but when it's collingwood or richmond or that old history at

303
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,869
a ground that influences the play and it's a collective experience and it's a collective

304
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,490
and the standard of play no doubt when you think about it that's what it's all about

305
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:42,009
actually yeah like what's the primary function of sport what's the primary function of the arts

306
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:49,210
and and you can you can um mount a very strong argument that it is simply about bringing people

307
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:55,349
together and having a sense of belonging that's you know that's very possible that that's the

308
00:20:55,349 --> 00:21:00,849
main game here actually and it's a great segue ben to wanting to talk about where we've intersected

309
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:06,809
uh a space we created called elita uh seven years ago and you know connecting him with you has been

310
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:11,710
a great joy and and we love that world of collaboration bringing people together from

311
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:16,809
from unique backgrounds and the group that you're connected with if you're happy to share it

312
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:21,430
fascinates me because you've got michael voss who i played against as one of the greatest players

313
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,230
i've ever seen play the game a triple premiership captain of the brisbane lions now coach of

314
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,710
uh carlton trent robinson is a legend of uh of the rugby league world and

315
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,869
uh revered as one of the greatest players i've ever seen play the game and he's been a great

316
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,490
lead coach of the roosters and had success everywhere dr chris brown people knows the

317
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:39,170
bondo vet but a beautiful person chris and incredibly smart richard opp he's probably

318
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:44,450
got the biggest marketing job in the world he looks after um global brands for a business

319
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:49,130
called abm bev which is budweiser and the biggest consumer brands in the world and and ben norther

320
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,509
coming together we love the idea of sharing and learning and collaborating together can you tell

321
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:59,250
us a bit about what that's been like for her it's been an amazing experience uh i've learned so much

322
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,650
at the beginning i i

323
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,950
was thinking gee i'm really the odd one out here you know coming in um from the arts i mean it was

324
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,109
good chris was there as well because he's sort of coming from that um television world as well

325
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:16,529
um but i because i had so much respect for uh all of these these guys on this panel

326
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:21,269
and i was just thinking gee i hope i can bring something worthwhile to this conversation as it

327
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:27,769
turned out they were very interested in the orchestra and and what how it worked had a lot

328
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:30,869
of questions around the the structure of it um and and and and and and and and and and and and

329
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:39,569
my role and it made me it made it reinforced the idea that um leadership there's so much common

330
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:44,509
ground across disciplines you know we're all dealing with the same kinds of things and usually

331
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:50,269
it's just about people it's about our relationships with people it's about our relationships with

332
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:56,150
ourselves looking deep into how we how we are going about our our leading and how how we can

333
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,349
improve and that's been the beauty of this is being able to have those discussions with those

334
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:06,250
learning so much every time i mean i just take pages of notes in every meeting that i reflect

335
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:12,049
on later and look back on and and think wow that's a that's a really great idea i wonder how i could

336
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:17,109
apply that to the orchestra and and just being challenged on things too things that you've always

337
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:22,329
done in a certain way and somebody sort of challenges said what about this why don't you try

338
00:23:22,329 --> 00:23:29,829
this um that's been really interesting and also it's made me realize what i what values i admire

339
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:30,609
in other people

340
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:37,950
and um and and which people who've helped me and why do i kind of look back on with so much

341
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:44,730
affection for those people and so much gratitude because they they kind of you know believed in me

342
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,789
to the point where i started believing in myself really that's kind of the one thing we've all got

343
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:53,289
in common i think we all had someone who believed in us at some point i think so and i was going to

344
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:58,029
ask you about that i love the fact people like you with a schedule that you've got and and all

345
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:00,049
those people and we really love the idea

346
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:05,210
and as passionate about you know people listening to this and say i'd like to get together and

347
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,789
collaborate and learn and that accountability to show up and say is there a better way you know

348
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:13,869
can i learn and and share you know particularly when you come from different backgrounds i love

349
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:18,809
hearing the you know obviously um you know private conversation but uh you know that world of a leader

350
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:23,650
connect if you are interested we are really passionate about um sharing and expanding that

351
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,809
space so please um you don't have to be ben northing doing what ben's do to to do the same

352
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:30,869
thing and and and share that you've had great mentors and i've had great mentors and i've had

353
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:36,069
along the journey in reading about it and you've made that path to go and study overseas and

354
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:41,130
you know names that probably don't mean enormous amount to me and i might even be able to pronounce

355
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:47,789
leaf segstrom is it like segastam that was close enough close enough john hopkins i can get out

356
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:53,069
but it sounds like you've had people that as you just said before have really seen something in

357
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:57,910
you can you tell us about that yeah well it was mainly john i mean the idea of a saxophonist

358
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,869
um you know i was in my late 20s at this point so i'd had a performance and i'd had a performance

359
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:05,869
career i went back to university as a mature age student to do my bachelor of music which i dropped

360
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:10,309
out of when i was in first year back in the day and and started working he started getting gigs

361
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:15,410
in melbourne had this fantastic life of a performing musician playing in as you say um

362
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:20,009
a james brown cover band so were you done with study at that stage did you see or did you always

363
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:24,289
think you'd come back or no i didn't at all no i i kind of thought no i'll be i'll just be a

364
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:29,509
professional musician i'll just i'll just work and do gigs and and and then the lifestyle you

365
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:30,869
know we're working four or five nights a week and i'm just like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it

366
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:36,190
a week and um you know i guess the fun had started to to wear off a little bit maybe i'd

367
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:41,670
burn myself out having a bit too much fun um so i went back to the conservatorium and and picked

368
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:47,569
up where i left off and um that was where i met my first conducting teacher john hopkins now i'm not

369
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:50,829
one of these guys who's like i have to be a conductor i have to be that guy standing up

370
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:56,309
in front of the orchestra um i didn't think that was possible from what i where i was and what i

371
00:25:56,309 --> 00:26:00,869
was doing hadn't had a uh you know long career in orchestral music at all

372
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:07,950
so this amazing teacher john hopkins who was an old man by this stage he had just turned up to

373
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:12,589
set up a conducting program in fourth year you know kind of a elective that you could do

374
00:26:12,589 --> 00:26:18,150
and um he'd done everything in australian music by this stage and he was an extraordinary

375
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:26,730
person to learn from he was interested in the power of music as a medium for social change

376
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,869
and really big picture thinking you know and that and also this

377
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:36,710
power of interactions with people as the the main sort of area of expertise as a conductor

378
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:44,490
so he ended up uh you know seeing something in me and encouraged me to continue my studies and said

379
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:51,109
look okay you're playing catch up i get it but let's come and study with me i'm setting up a

380
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:55,829
master's program here it's you know two years give it a go you're gonna have to stop everything

381
00:26:55,829 --> 00:27:00,049
else that you're doing and i was still working at that point

382
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,049
and i didn't have a family or anything so i thought oh if i'm ever going to do it

383
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:09,490
now's the time how often do these opportunities come along yeah and i i i said to him i said i

384
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,630
just don't see how this is possible he said you don't know what's possible he said that's the

385
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:18,650
beauty about it nobody knows what's possible we're all just making it up as we go along

386
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:24,730
there's no rules and and that's the beauty of possibility you you just the books the books

387
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:30,710
empty so it was so inspiring and i remember um just working really really

388
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:36,230
hard uh for that two years and then i won this competition and and went overseas to study and

389
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:41,470
you know spent six years learning how to do it and then started work i mean it's a really amazing

390
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:46,130
kind of pathway genuine sliding doors moment that isn't it for someone to see that in you

391
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:51,190
and then for you to have the uh ability and the dedication to take that opportunity and

392
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:55,309
and then to go overseas you know you know i read in research that when you are applying

393
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:59,829
in finland and i um you know apologies to the life for uh

394
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:06,869
but i'm told that you you just aced the the exam and that you're asked to listen to some music and

395
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:11,809
write it down i mean was that something you felt comfortable with at that stage i did actually

396
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:16,930
because i'd done so much work in music production so i used to do a lot of work for advertising and

397
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:21,750
in the recording studio and often people would give you a piece of music and say i need a backing

398
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:26,210
track or something for this you know and you'd have to make it and that involved you listening

399
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:30,670
in micro detail and kind of deconstructing the piece and you know putting it back

400
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:36,730
together one line at a time so i knew how to do that um and that was the thing i sort of realized

401
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:44,089
more and more as i went through all of my musical experiences were exactly the kinds of things that

402
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:50,069
i needed to be able to draw on and especially at a time when orchestras are changing so much

403
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:54,289
the kinds of concerts orchestras are doing now so different than they were even 20 years ago

404
00:28:54,289 --> 00:29:00,450
and so my sort of diversity and and the all these crazy experiences all of a sudden became very very

405
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:06,009
at that point but yeah i was surprised when i got into the sibelius academy and i kept being

406
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:10,069
surprised you know i just kept thinking how's this happening you know this is ridiculous this and

407
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:15,730
and then at some point you know you start to believe yeah and that's that's when you can really

408
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:22,990
um build uh on your skills because you believe that it's possible i mean that's the thing about

409
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:30,009
performance isn't it you know sport anything the belief it's so it's so uh often spoken about

410
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:35,450
but unless you've actually felt it it's really hard to explain what it is you know and is that

411
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:40,990
you know it's a great uh point i think you know sports people and other will relate to that sense

412
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:45,109
you know i go back to what i was in do you belong are you good enough to play it and then

413
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:50,630
then you get a few games and then you look around and think you know i do belong out here and and

414
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:54,730
then the opportunity is there to to take it to us to the level that you that you possibly get

415
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:59,009
is there still nerves you get in front of the london philharmonic orchestra on a performance

416
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:00,690
night yeah you still oh no no i'm

417
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:08,410
I mean, I don't mean to say that I always believe I did then, but yeah, of course you

418
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:13,390
go through ups and downs with that and belief comes and goes, um, confidence comes and goes.

419
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:20,369
The nerves are absolutely at the core of this business, uh, and actually controlling your

420
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:26,410
state, um, before you walk out onto that stage as a conductor with this immense responsibility

421
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:33,009
of guiding these musicians through a performance that can be a crushing burden. So you have to be

422
00:30:33,009 --> 00:30:38,210
very mentally prepared for that scenario. So I'm nervous every time, not to the point of like,

423
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:42,430
you know, throwing up or anything like that. Like I'm sort of, I've got a routine. I put myself as

424
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:50,369
close, um, as I can to in the zone, um, as, as it works for me at least. And I try and be, um,

425
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:56,329
you know, calm and stable out there for the musicians. So, you know, that's the

426
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:56,390
thing.

427
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:04,309
I feel the responsibility to them. It's like, I have to be as good as they are at their job

428
00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:06,730
and then we can do something amazing, you know?

429
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:11,670
Beautifully said. I read that you're a fan of, uh, of visualization and meditation and

430
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:16,069
mindful. Can you tell us about your practice? Can you go a little bit micro there? What sort

431
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:17,789
of things do you do to achieve that?

432
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:22,230
I do a lot of visualization. I mean, it's funny, the way that we prepare as conductors is that,

433
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:26,369
um, we learn a piece of music from the notes on a page generally,

434
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:30,650
you know, you can access recordings and things, but that's not really the way you do it as a

435
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,269
conductor. You're building up your own version.

436
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:35,769
I had a naive question. This may, uh, embarrass me here, but as I was reading and watching

437
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:40,549
and listening and in preparation for this and looking at you reading music, is that universal?

438
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:45,109
So if you're reading a piece, it is. There's no, so there won't be a German twist to it or

439
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:47,130
a Spanish twist to it. It's music's written.

440
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:52,809
In, in Western music. So, you know, um, yes, the notation is universal. That's the beauty of it

441
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:56,250
because any musician can go to these countries that use that.

442
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:00,369
They can create a system of notation, um, which has been built up over centuries now

443
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:06,009
and make music. They don't have to speak the language. They can just make music and conducting

444
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:10,329
is like that too. Every conductor is different, but there is a framework that is universal.

445
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:15,670
So that means you can communicate through music without words anyway.

446
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,089
Yeah. And I'm sorry to interrupt your train of thought. You're talking about what you do to

447
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:20,769
get into that state, into that zone.

448
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:25,789
Yeah. So visualizing. So when I'm reading the score, you know, the, the goal is to build up a,

449
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:31,470
a sound picture in your mind of how you want the piece to go. And that in itself is a visualization.

450
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:37,650
It's sort of just a sonic visualization. So you can sit in a chair, close your eyes and imagine

451
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:44,410
a piece from start to finish. And that's really powerful because not only are you, are you thinking

452
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:48,589
about the music and sort of forming your interpretation of the piece, you're actually

453
00:32:48,589 --> 00:32:53,569
visualizing how you want the performance to go as well. So that's one aspect of it in the,

454
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:55,109
in the immediate, um,

455
00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:59,990
you know, standing side of stage and in, and in the dressing room waiting for the,

456
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:05,509
for the call. Um, obviously there's breathing and that kind of thing, but for me, it's,

457
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:12,089
it's the reinforcement of basic principles. It's, it's exactly like, you know, sport in that sense.

458
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:17,390
I've heard so many sports people talk about just going back to basics and simplifying everything

459
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:25,710
down to, for me, it's forget yourself. Think about the music. So take my ego away,

460
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:31,910
for that period of time, when I'm out there, you know, I can, I can put it back on when I'm finished,

461
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:37,170
but honestly, for that time, it's just take away everything else and focus on what your job is.

462
00:33:37,329 --> 00:33:43,150
That's the music at that point in time. And then the music becomes everything. So that's that when

463
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:46,049
I, when it's all working, that's how I feel. It doesn't work all the time.

464
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:50,450
And does that help you in, in life as well? Having that capacity, I'm going to ask you about

465
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:54,970
meditation as well, but I suppose that ability to be out of compartmentalize and, you know,

466
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:55,769
in other areas of your life.

467
00:33:55,769 --> 00:34:04,509
I'm not so good at that. Yeah. I feel like I use up a lot of my discipline in, in the, in the work.

468
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:11,230
So, yeah, I, I, I, I feel like, well, like, you know, if I come back after, you know,

469
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:16,150
three weeks on the road or something, or, I mean, at the moment I've just done 12 weeks because,

470
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:21,949
you know, after the pandemic's not over, but after the lockdowns, the arts organizations

471
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:24,269
are making up for lost time. So it's just been flat chat.

472
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:33,070
So I am usually just really burned out at the end of those long stints. And I feel like I haven't

473
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:40,409
managed that very well in my life. So it's, or it's been, you know, too, too kind of high octane

474
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:45,070
in terms of the approach to taking all the work. And that's the thing when you're a freelancer,

475
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:50,929
you think, oh, well, if I'm free, I'll say yes, you know, and I love the work so much,

476
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:54,050
but I have to get better at actually managing my time.

477
00:34:54,269 --> 00:34:59,730
And making sure that I'm not neglecting my family, making sure that I'm doing good work,

478
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:05,730
making sure I've got time to prepare, recover, all that stuff. So, yeah, I, I would say I,

479
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:10,510
I am a work in progress in that area, Luke. I think we all are, Ben, aren't we? It's that,

480
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:15,510
I find that same challenge, isn't it? You want to achieve enough and support your family enough

481
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:20,570
by achieving. And, and that's, you know, without that, we really aren't able to do anything,

482
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,769
but at the same time, not miss the point of life, do you? And I always talk, you know,

483
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:29,309
in guilt that we, I've always felt, you know, as a father of four and, you know, even our travel

484
00:35:29,309 --> 00:35:34,849
through being on the road through winter and you miss out on certain things, it's that sweet spot

485
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:39,610
you're always searching for. I'm not sure we ever exactly find it, but perhaps even just in the

486
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:43,989
consciousness of trying to do it, we may be at least ahead of the game in that sense that you

487
00:35:43,989 --> 00:35:48,710
are thinking about it. You know, what I have learned from it all is being present in whatever

488
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:53,530
moment you're in. That's the one thing, because, because the music happens just in real time. It's

489
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,250
like that.

490
00:35:54,269 --> 00:35:59,150
That's where it is. It's then, and you know, you, you, you, as a leader thinking ahead a bit,

491
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:03,969
but actually it's all happening in that moment and you're fully aware and you're in this heightened

492
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:08,829
state of awareness actually as a performer, because of all the nerves and the adrenaline

493
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:12,690
that's flying through your body and the alertness levels and all this kind of stuff.

494
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:18,989
When I'm with my, with my kids and, and, um, Joe, my wife, you know, I try and bring that

495
00:36:18,989 --> 00:36:24,070
same level of presence and just like, okay, I'm just going to be here now.

496
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:29,969
And concentrate on my kids. And so I have learned that. Um, that's one thing that I'll say.

497
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:34,230
That's a great gift to share because you, you know, you can be around, but not be there,

498
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:39,250
can't you? And so the guilt is I'm away, but then a lot of people are there and not there as well.

499
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:49,760
I have to touch on the sporting connection to the family. Uncle John,

500
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:54,800
he's a legend of, uh, of the game that I, uh, loved and was lucky enough to play. He's a

501
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,679
two-time premiership player in the brilliant Richmond sides, 1967 and 69. And then,

502
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:06,039
and coached over 300 games. Is, does your love of sort of Richmond come through Uncle John Northy or?

503
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,760
Yeah, we were always Tigers. So growing up, um, because of the premierships, I was born in 70.

504
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:16,079
So I missed those flags, but, uh, dad is, uh, his name's Bob. He's John's older brother.

505
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,260
And, uh, he taught him how to kick and they were brought up in Darren Allum in the Western

506
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:24,659
district. And dad was a very fine footballer as well, but ended up being an academic.

507
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:29,500
And so he went to uni, uh, Johnny famously went on to play for the Tigers.

508
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,460
And, and, uh, I was just fascinated by his journey, you know, cause I was a teenager when

509
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,739
he got to Melbourne, but he'd been coaching in Ballarat before that he was coaching country

510
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:42,619
league, um, Victorian country side. I think he was coach of that, that team initially

511
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:48,320
Redan back in the day in Ballarat league, uh, three premierships in a row. He was captain coach.

512
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,920
So he was still playing. It was amazing. Yeah. And his body was stuffed and, you know,

513
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:59,300
he was still out there, um, you know, yelling at people and leading by example. And then, yeah,

514
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:04,579
he got that, that, uh, initially job at Sydney, then Melbourne, then famously Richmond, which I

515
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:10,119
was rapped about. I was like, you beauty, here we go. And you know, the 95, um, I think it was,

516
00:38:10,219 --> 00:38:13,519
well, it was a qualifying final. It was, you got to a 95. Yeah.

517
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:18,639
The game before that against the Bombers, that was, that was something where I went, okay,

518
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:22,780
well, there's a sleeping giant here that I didn't know about really. And that was, you know,

519
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:27,539
Richmond one in 80, but I was sort of a bit too young to really experience that fully.

520
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,280
But I remember thinking, wow, there's just,

521
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:35,159
a beast ready to wake up here and didn't wake up until 2017, but it got there in the end. But no,

522
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:41,900
I learned a lot from him, seeing him work, hearing him talk about his role, um, and just observing

523
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:46,280
his journey, the ups and downs of that journey. That was, you know, quite brutal in the end,

524
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:51,139
you know, he got fired from Brisbane. And I just remember thinking, and after the 88 grand final

525
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:55,960
where Hawthorne belted the demons, I know he came around the next day and he just didn't speak,

526
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,260
you know, he was just sitting at the table, just destroyed, you know, and I just remember,

527
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:04,699
thinking, oh my God, look at what this does to you, you know, or can do to you. It was amazing.

528
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:10,360
It's a, it's a brutal role that isn't it. And maybe even more so the scrutiny's, uh, become

529
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,059
so extreme and you know, it's, you're a hero to zero, isn't it?

530
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:14,800
Highs and lows.

531
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,300
Yeah. It's, it's incredible. As he, uh, cross over into the music and arts world, is there,

532
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,639
is that shared in the family? Do you?

533
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,260
Well, dad, dad plays the guitar and he was sort of into, um, acting a bit, I guess,

534
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,940
because he'd gone to uni and done, done a bit of that there.

535
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:35,139
And, um, but Johnny, not so much. So, you know, he's more into sport and business and that kind

536
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:39,980
of thing. And so, but I mean, it's been interesting to talk to him about people management and that

537
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:44,300
was the one thing he was good at was bringing out things that people didn't know they had

538
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:49,599
in motivation. I think that was probably his greatest strength, that constant underdog thing

539
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:55,079
that he had, especially with Melbourne, um, in the eighties and getting people to achieve things

540
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:59,219
they didn't think they were capable of achieving, you know, and that I thought I can,

541
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,039
really use in, in music as well.

542
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:04,300
Yeah. What a gift that is. And you hear all those that played under the great sweeper

543
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,619
norther, your uncle, uh, the connection that you had with his probably ahead of his time,

544
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:12,500
really. And we see a lot of the great coaches now so much more about the whole person, but from,

545
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,880
from what you hear, uh, his players love playing, uh, for him. And it's, I love hearing that shared

546
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,360
sort of, um, you know, crossover in, in learning. Uh, Ben, we've been talking, you know, about what

547
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:27,019
great leadership looks like in different settings. We're becoming a bit obsessed with it. And I love

548
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:31,179
hearing from your world, a world that, you know, isn't, isn't from mine and these dimensions of

549
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:34,840
great leaders, as you said, learning people management from your uncle in the sporting

550
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,119
world. But we think all the leaders have a sense of self-leadership that they start there and

551
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,679
understand. Does that resonate with you? Um, what, what would self-leadership mean to you?

552
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:50,260
Uh, for me, I think it's, it's, uh, turning up, turning up ready for, for work. I mean, that,

553
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:54,960
that is such a big role for me. If you're a leader, you have to have a vision in order for

554
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,960
people to follow you. Like it's, it's so,

555
00:40:57,019 --> 00:41:02,059
simple. It's ridiculous. But sometimes, you know, if you're really flat out and you haven't done the

556
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:06,219
work, you can turn up and you're a bit underdone and you're sort of making it up as you go along.

557
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,579
People just notice straight away. So as a conductor on the podium, it's kind of like,

558
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:16,300
you know, there's this x-ray machine, um, that people can just strip away any pretense and they

559
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,019
can see who you really are and where you're at. So there's no point trying to pretend that you're

560
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:25,159
anybody else. So for me, turning up ready, that, that would be the first thing. I guess the other

561
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:26,960
thing is what difference?

562
00:41:27,019 --> 00:41:34,480
You're making, you know, and, and I try and do things, um, in my working life that I, that are,

563
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,900
that are mirrored by my values. And, and, you know, John Hopkins, this first teacher we talked

564
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:44,480
about, he was big on that. He was like, you know, think about the power of music as something bigger

565
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,639
than just, you know, you up there conducting the orchestra to a bunch of paying customers. What,

566
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:56,639
what can it do as a tool, as a medium? And so, you know, I'm often reflecting on my year,

567
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,320
like I get to the end of the year and I look back and I go, well, how, what did I do? What did I

568
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:06,559
achieve this year? And where are those areas that I think are the real value areas, you know, not

569
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:11,619
the great experiences of, you know, what's the best concert, but actually what difference did

570
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:18,079
you make for other people? And, and I reckon that's probably self-leadership to me, you know,

571
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:24,760
where are you making the difference? And music has unlimited potential in that area, uh, just in so

572
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,619
many different ways. And actually the,

573
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,739
orchestras are doing really good work in that area too.

574
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:33,139
Yeah. What a brilliant answer, Ben. And, you know, coming back and listening to you and thinking of

575
00:42:33,139 --> 00:42:38,780
all the challenges the world currently, you know, faces and, you know, we've still got wars going on

576
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,960
in 2022 and what's happening over in that part of the world is incredibly upsetting, of course,

577
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,780
in Ukraine. And, and then you think of what you do with the universal language of music, being

578
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,500
able to go and bring teams of people together and show that collaboration and connection doesn't

579
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,619
have different, uh, you know, it doesn't, uh,

580
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,820
require borders. You can actually share with anyone. And, you know, it feels like, you know,

581
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,539
do you sort of think about it, that altruistic level in some ways that you're an example to

582
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:06,980
what great collaboration and connection looks like?

583
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:11,519
I'd like to think so. Every now and again, you feel like, you know, some major world event

584
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,019
happens. You think, well, what can I do? You know, as a musician, how ridiculous, you know,

585
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:21,139
what a peripheral kind of irrelevant activity, um, this is, but actually then you realize,

586
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:26,420
well, it's, it's what you decide to do with it. It's the tool that you have, right? So our

587
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:31,780
expertise, whatever it is in our lives, that becomes the way that you can, uh, influence

588
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:37,719
others, make a difference, improve the experience of life for people. And I just think in terms of,

589
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,840
yeah, what, what you're talking about in, um, listening to and cooperating, collaborating,

590
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:48,920
but it's actually, um, it's understanding other, other people, their perspectives,

591
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:55,480
including people in the experience of an orchestra is a powerful gift that you can give to people.

592
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:01,900
It can change people's lives. We've got a completely new generation of musicians coming

593
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:09,360
through now that are from extraordinarily diverse backgrounds. They're enriching the culture of the

594
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:14,639
organizations that they're joining, um, bringing these new ideas and perspectives. Uh, we're able

595
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:19,400
to connect with people in different ways now than that the orchestras never did before. You know,

596
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,159
it was always seen as a sort of a high level elitist activity. It's sort of still is that,

597
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:25,440
but it's not.

598
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,519
It's not only that it's much more than that. And it's much more, um, relevant and accessible to

599
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:33,900
more people now, which I'm really proud of too. It's brilliant. Ben, we're seeing leaders are

600
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,500
really conscious of how they positively impact other people every day in their environment,

601
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:42,579
listening to you already talking about your humility and turning up for the musicians and

602
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:46,440
taking your ego away when you stand up there and conduct an orchestra. I mean, clearly that's

603
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,019
something you think about regularly. Is that, is that how you think about daily having that

604
00:44:51,019 --> 00:44:55,460
positive impact on people? I think so. I hope it's the right thing to do.

605
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:01,239
Like, I'm not convinced that it's, you know, I, why do you say that? Well, only because, um,

606
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:07,000
there's a time actually to just be strong and, and stand there and go, no, no, no, this is what

607
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,099
we're doing. And have you got that in you? Do you do that? I, I, it's, it's sort of subtle for me.

608
00:45:12,219 --> 00:45:18,960
Um, so it's, it's there, but it's sort of like a, um, what would I say? It's a insistence,

609
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:23,980
a quiet insistence rather than a throw your, you know, the toys out of the cot kind of thing.

610
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:28,739
Um, and every lead is different and I can probably work on that. Actually. I've seen,

611
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:33,300
I've observed recently, even other leaders just being way more direct. And I think actually,

612
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,159
that's probably the right thing to do. That's, that's going to save a lot of time and just get

613
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:40,659
straight to the point. We've talked about that actually, um, a little bit in, in the

614
00:45:40,659 --> 00:45:47,820
leader group as well. Um, but yeah, I, I sort of, I like that because it works for me and,

615
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:52,760
and it really comes down to respecting others and, and, um, understanding that they,

616
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:57,079
they want to feel empowered as well. They want to have their chance to

617
00:45:57,079 --> 00:46:01,480
be part of this creative process. They don't want to just be drones who are sitting there,

618
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:08,219
you know, taking orders. They want to feel like a leader as well. All, everyone wants that,

619
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:13,219
wants that sense. So if you can create an environment where everyone feels like they

620
00:46:13,219 --> 00:46:16,619
can contribute, wow, you know, that's when things can really spark.

621
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,679
And I love your language, man, because it's what we really see is this big shift is that you don't

622
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:22,619
need the title. You don't have to be the conductor.

623
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:28,199
You know, again, not knowing your world, but the person who turns up plays and really has that

624
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:32,500
positive energy to the person that supports them to play a little bit better, or it's just kind in

625
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:37,119
the way they approach it. I mean, you can genuinely make significant impact with small

626
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,440
gestures, can't you? Yeah. And you can model that behavior. I think that's the biggest thing. It's,

627
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:46,420
and, and culture of, of these big groups, because they've got a massive negative bias. So the

628
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:50,199
psychology of the large groups of people is negative. That's just how it is.

629
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,139
In all the large groups, do you mean?

630
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:58,960
Well, I think orchestras in particular, because it's a frustrating job as an individual,

631
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:04,239
you feel powerless, you know, and, and so you're relying so much on the conductor to set the

632
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:09,400
culture, set the tone. And, you know, I've, I've felt, I've found that that's a big part of the

633
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,699
job actually is, is, and culture. I mean, that's so important in every organization, you know,

634
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,619
is this a good working environment? Are we creating an atmosphere where we can

635
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:22,739
really be our best and contribute and, and,

636
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,920
and bring out the best in others and respect other people, all that kind of stuff. And also

637
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:32,519
acknowledge that there is an expectation that we bring in. If it's not being met, address it

638
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:37,340
head on. Yeah. So, you know, there's all these things around organizational culture. You just

639
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:41,739
got to keep at those things. It doesn't happen automatically. And all the research says,

640
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:46,159
I mean, the amount of time and effort and money and resources you put into improving culture,

641
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:50,760
you get returned back exponentially, almost more than any other thing you can do in any business

642
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,579
or in the world of arts or social venture or whatever it is. But it's often the thing people

643
00:47:55,579 --> 00:48:00,900
overlook because you'd rather put another person on sales or sell another ticket. But we know

644
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:05,800
sustainable success comes from clearly what you're doing, which is building great culture and

645
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,699
continue. We've heard you talk a lot about vision and it's, it's the next dimension I'd ask you

646
00:48:10,699 --> 00:48:14,940
about. So Lee's really conscious about how they create and share their vision. It sounds like

647
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,980
you've got a pretty clear formula on that. Can you share that with us?

648
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,739
Well, I've got ideas. I've got ideas. I've got ideas. I've got ideas. I've got ideas. I've got

649
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:26,920
ideas around the ultimate performance of a piece, you know, when I, when I come out onto the podium,

650
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:34,179
um, but it never works out that way, you know? So, so it doesn't like my vision can be very strong,

651
00:48:34,179 --> 00:48:39,420
but it's always got built in flexibility. And that's what I'm talking about in, in it's

652
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:44,440
collaborative. It's not a power thing. It's not like, this is what we're going to do. I can say

653
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:49,440
that at the beginning of a week. And that's great. That makes everyone feel like, okay, good. This

654
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,659
person's got a clear plan. Can I understand that for a second,

655
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:56,800
man? Sorry to jump in again, but I'm trying to, so you've got the vision for the, for the piece

656
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,739
and you're conducting them in the way that you are, but a certain section suddenly, you know,

657
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,239
gets, catches fire for want of a better term. And you think, Hey, that sounds better. And I can

658
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:11,440
let that go more than I initially planned. Is that the sort of living, breathing?

659
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,980
Exactly. Yes. You've worked it out. So, so that's the thing you let it, you know what it is? You've

660
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,420
got to know when to help. And that means lead.

661
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:25,940
And know when to get out of the way and let them, let them do it. So that's, that's the,

662
00:49:26,019 --> 00:49:30,840
the balancing act that's going on there. And so, you know, you might hear something,

663
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,780
you might hear a player play something that you really like, and it's different than how you

664
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:39,360
thought about it. And it's great. And you just, what are you going to do? You get to get out of

665
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:45,599
the way, let, let that magic happen. And it's different also, depending on where you are,

666
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:49,219
what orchestra you're working with that particular group dynamic, what their strengths

667
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:55,099
weaknesses are, the hall you're in, different acoustic sounds, the occasion, you know, energy

668
00:49:55,099 --> 00:50:01,340
levels of the group, time of the day. I mean, there's so many variables around this that you

669
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:07,119
have to be ready to respond as well as lead. You know, that's what I've learned. It's, you've got

670
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:13,019
to be so alert to be able to respond. I'm fascinated by it. I find it so, so your, would

671
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:17,480
you have a good read if you go over to London or, you know, I mentioned in the intro, the,

672
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,840
the international space.

673
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,199
Have you got a good idea who the French horn player is and the oboe? Is it to that level of

674
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:28,579
detail or on the night you're getting surprised by how someone's doing something that you didn't

675
00:50:28,579 --> 00:50:28,900
believe?

676
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:33,480
Oh, that, that happens. That spontaneity happens in performances, but it's more the rehearsal

677
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:38,739
process because that's when the conductor really does their work. It's, it's away from the

678
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:44,599
performance space. It's, it's the working the orchestra out, especially a new orchestra. So

679
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:49,420
one of the teachers in Finland, he said, know who the divas are in the orchestra.

680
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:55,599
So if there's somebody who you really need to be aware of, find out early, get there though.

681
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:02,059
Yeah. Just yeah. Principal oboe. Yeah. Okay. Be ready. Be ready. And so, you know, you,

682
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,400
you were, and that's part of the working with the personalities as well, but also

683
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:12,059
celebrating what they can bring as, as individual leaders in, within the orchestra itself. There's,

684
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:14,400
there's all of that hierarchy going on as well. So.

685
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:20,500
It's amazing. I heard you talk about curiosity a lot. And as, as a kid, just following curiosity

686
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:25,320
into different instruments, we see the leaders now really curiosity is their launching pad for

687
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:30,119
then how they learn and continue to develop. Can you share with us what, what curiosity means for

688
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:30,280
you?

689
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,679
Yeah, I was lucky that particularly mum, cause she was the sort of the musical one in the family.

690
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:42,840
She allowed that to happen. So she, when I was playing the violin at primary school piano,

691
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,800
which I hated.

692
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,500
Primary school. And I, I think it was in grade two. And I said, I want to learn the trumpet,

693
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:54,079
you know? And I, I don't know if my kid said that to me. I'd probably say, yeah, sure. But

694
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,320
deep down, I'd be thinking, oh, is this the right thing? Like, shouldn't I make them stick out one

695
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:02,840
instrument for longer? And she was like, yeah, no worries. I was, I'm not going to play the violin

696
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:07,480
anymore. Okay. So went and played trumpet for four years and then grade six, I want to learn the

697
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:13,099
flute mum, you know? Yep. Okay. No worries. I'll get you a flute and, you know, ordered a flute

698
00:52:13,099 --> 00:52:14,099
and off I went.

699
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,219
And then it was, oh, I want to learn the saxophone. And so there was this constant permission to be

700
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:25,400
curious as, as a kid. And I think, um, you know, that, that taught me a great lesson because it

701
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:30,099
was like, well, I, you know, this isn't a bad thing to be sort of moving on to the next thing

702
00:52:30,099 --> 00:52:34,440
all the time, to be fair. When I got to the saxophone, I really zoomed in on that and, um,

703
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:40,639
that became my thing. Uh, but you know, that's at the root of development and, and has to be

704
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:44,320
rewarded. And, and actually, you know, the things that we've spoken about in that,

705
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:51,940
the group often I've been struck by the curiosity of all of those high level leaders in their roles.

706
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:56,539
That's actually probably the one thing that they've got in common there. They're constantly

707
00:52:56,539 --> 00:53:02,820
looking for the next way to learn and progress and develop. And that's curiosity. So it's at

708
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:06,900
the base of everything, isn't it? It's all learning, you know, that's what you want to

709
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:13,800
teach your kids to be curious. It's all, it's better than teaching them anything concrete facts,

710
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,500
anything like that. If you can instill a sense of curiosity in a young mind, job done.

711
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:24,860
What a brilliant, uh, summation of, uh, you know, it's inspiring to hear you to, to sum it up in

712
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:29,940
that particular way. I mean, communicating with clarity is something that we see leaders are

713
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:34,800
really understand their communications strategy and yours is so unique again, isn't it? Because

714
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,619
it's not spoken word when you're performing. And, and then also, I suppose, you know, you,

715
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:44,219
you're incredibly articulate as well in trying to expand your space and

716
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:44,380
bring people together. And I think that's, I think that's, I think that's, I think that's

717
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:47,880
I suppose that's part of it. Can you explain how you've gone about your communication?

718
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:52,599
Yeah. I, um, had some really great models here. There's, there've been some great communicators

719
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:57,239
in music. You know, we're talking about, um, there's an older American conductor who,

720
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,960
who passed away decades ago, Leonard Bernstein, right? And he might be familiar. He wrote West

721
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:08,800
Side Story, musical theatre expert like you, West Side Story. I conceded that, uh, I married a,

722
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:13,940
uh, musical theatre performer back and, uh, was pretending in the early phase of our relationship

723
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:19,239
that I was a very much, uh, an attender of, uh, musical theatre, but got found out pretty quickly,

724
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:26,099
but, uh. No, no, but he was a great communicator and educator and he talked about music a lot.

725
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:30,539
And this is funny because music doesn't really need to be spoken about. It can just be experienced

726
00:54:30,539 --> 00:54:35,480
and everyone experiences it differently. And it's, there's no right or wrong way to experience music,

727
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:41,780
but it is interesting as, um, a way to learn how to appreciate it more to hear someone talk about

728
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:47,880
it. So, um, you know, I've done a lot of education concerts for school kids and all kinds of even

729
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:53,059
adults as well, where we unpack a piece of music and talk about how it, how it's built and possible

730
00:54:53,059 --> 00:54:58,500
meanings behind it. What's a composer trying to say, uh, through this piece of music. And yeah,

731
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:02,900
I, I've enjoyed that aspect of it. And I do, as you could probably tell from this podcast,

732
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:09,840
enjoy talking. Uh, so I, I now incorporate that into the beginning of my weeks, you know,

733
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,760
cause I've realized the orchestras appreciate,

734
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:18,400
that as well. So take my five to 10 minutes at the first rehearsal, just to talk about what I want

735
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,320
to achieve out of the week and what I think, what our goals are and our mission and why this is an

736
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:29,480
important week reset everybody's, you know, expectations and possible prejudices against

737
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:34,440
a project or something. And, you know, explain why it's important, get everybody buying into that

738
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:40,460
first and then get into the music after that. And you don't have to talk so much. So yeah,

739
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:41,699
it's, it's interesting, but,

740
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:46,980
but conducting of course is a, a non-verbal art form. So in the concert, you're not speaking,

741
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:54,900
uh, it's all gestural and body language, facial expressions, and you have to communicate

742
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:58,719
everything with those tools. So that is a big challenge.

743
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:04,900
And is that something that just evolves as well? Are you, did you, is it a learned skill in, in,

744
00:56:05,139 --> 00:56:08,539
in, and is it, is there a certain cues that all conductors use? I mean, or is it?

745
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:11,760
Well, there are, there are musical cues to invite,

746
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,460
to invite someone to play at the right time because often they don't play for ages. And

747
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:20,019
then suddenly they've got to come in with an entry and you can, you can, I call it an invitation

748
00:56:20,019 --> 00:56:24,480
rather than a cue. Like it's not point and say now, you know, it's like it makes a magic. Can't

749
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:29,300
wait to hear this. Um, and then there are other players you learn very quickly, never look at

750
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:37,000
them. They, they, they perform worse when you look at them and create that expectation. And so I've

751
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,980
worked out there, you know, not many, but there are some players that you're better off just

752
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,639
leaving alone.

753
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,219
Um, and, and doing their own thing.

754
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:46,099
And understand that they will be watching along anyway. And, and yeah,

755
00:56:46,099 --> 00:56:49,300
they'll know, they'll know what to do. And they're in their own world and they're,

756
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:52,820
they're, they're better like that. And they're going to perform better. Particularly we're

757
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:57,460
talking about French horn solos. Like often it's them who are, who are just like, no, no, no,

758
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:02,239
I don't need any distractions. I just need to be in the zone here in my own little world to make

759
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:10,780
this work. Um, but you know, some players enjoy a smile. Um, it, it all depends on the, the musician,

760
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:15,480
but also the music. So you're sort of trying to visually paint the emotions of the music

761
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,300
in your face and in your body. That's really interesting.

762
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:22,019
I know I'll keep going back to the sporting analogies, which, because they're so profound

763
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:27,280
for me and what you do and the way coaching has evolved in the, you know, in the past, it was,

764
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:32,639
this is the way, you know, it's done. And if you're not capable, then you're out and you're

765
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:37,940
weak and you're, and it was really left a lot of people who just had different as you know,

766
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:40,719
needs of how they needed to be coached. It just was so,

767
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:44,659
so unproductive when you look back and you think the sophistication now to understand that,

768
00:57:44,659 --> 00:57:47,860
you know, people respond differently. That's just the way it works. And so

769
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:51,320
to hear that in, in the orchestral sense as well as.

770
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,699
Don't you reckon that's also the expectation that the leaders felt?

771
00:57:55,159 --> 00:57:57,159
Yeah. Yeah. In fairness to them, I agree.

772
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,800
They thought that was the job.

773
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:00,219
Correct.

774
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,699
It's, it's really interesting.

775
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:06,000
It's a good point. And I reckon I'm a little, you know, you're trying to apply 2022 logic to

776
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,699
it's never fair, is it? No, it's never fair. I think probably spawned,

777
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:15,039
a generation like you though, who probably looked and thought, certainly did in, in sport

778
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:18,260
from my, I went, I think there's a better way. Yeah. There's a, there's a better way.

779
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,519
I think there's a healthier way that.

780
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:20,039
Absolutely.

781
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:25,360
We'll achieve more success. So it's, it's a profound how it's happened in, in our time.

782
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:29,500
Collaboration is your world and we see collaboration now for leaders as being

783
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:34,360
something they really value. I mean, clearly you don't get to do anything without collaboration,

784
00:58:34,539 --> 00:58:36,760
but can you, can you describe what it means to you?

785
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:43,579
Yeah, I, I, I love that part of the job and for me doing the different kinds of, um,

786
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:49,380
combinations of genre. So you'll have the orchestra and, uh, you know, a comedian,

787
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:53,940
or you'll have an orchestra and a rock band or, um, artists from different areas,

788
00:58:54,099 --> 00:58:58,539
non-classical areas, often a theater thing, or, you know, just, there's so many different

789
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:05,219
kinds of, um, uh, areas of music that orchestras are reaching into now and reaching a much wider

790
00:59:05,219 --> 00:59:06,480
audience through that as well.

791
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:11,579
And that's the, that's the bringing of two worlds. Uh, and, and that conductor becomes

792
00:59:11,579 --> 00:59:15,699
the kind of person who's the translator, you know, between these two worlds. And,

793
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:22,699
uh, I love that because that's the understanding. And often when people get, um, to the point where

794
00:59:22,699 --> 00:59:27,139
they've got a concert with an orchestra, if they're, you know, a pop singer or somebody,

795
00:59:27,139 --> 00:59:31,099
somebody who doesn't work with orchestras all the time, that's like a serious high point of

796
00:59:31,099 --> 00:59:35,480
their careers. Like I'm here with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. I'm about to perform with

797
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,320
them. And they are,

798
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:41,980
I'm terrified most of the time. And that's another part of my job is to kind of say,

799
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:47,019
no, no, it's not this big, scary thing, you know, well, it can be, but it doesn't have to be. And,

800
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:53,599
and so let's find what we've got in common here and let me be that conduit to, to take some of

801
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:57,119
that heat off how you're feeling and it's going to be fine, you know, don't worry about it. And so

802
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:03,519
I really enjoy that role. I gotta say, I just, I love bringing these, these, um, incongruous

803
01:00:03,519 --> 01:00:06,039
kind of worlds of, of different music together.

804
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:10,280
You mentioned that in, you know, you've worked with Ben Folds and Nick Cave and James

805
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:14,639
Morris and Archie Roach and the list goes on and on and on and on and other classical, uh,

806
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:20,420
legends, uh, of music. Is that been one of your real passions around, you know, bringing that

807
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:22,800
sort of those combining those worlds? Is that?

808
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:29,039
I think it's just been a product of my background because I have played in very many different

809
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:33,920
kinds of musical groups. I mean, the Nick Cave, Warren Ellis one was very interesting. Um,

810
01:00:34,219 --> 01:00:36,739
Warren Ellis turns out it's from Ballarat, same as me.

811
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:43,440
And we had the same, uh, flute teacher when we were kids, which we didn't know. And, and,

812
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:49,139
you know, Warren's like, you know, mega rock star and, uh, he and Nick have got into composing

813
01:00:49,139 --> 01:00:53,699
music for films and they came and worked with the MSO the first time they'd ever worked with

814
01:00:53,699 --> 01:00:58,000
an orchestra. And, and these are two legendary world musicians. And it was all of a sudden,

815
01:00:58,019 --> 01:01:01,699
like they were little kids again, you know, like with the orchestra. Yeah. They were just like,

816
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:06,699
this is a world we don't understand. And, um, you know, that was such a

817
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:14,920
collaboration because it showed to me that they had started their lives as, as, um, rock musicians

818
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:22,139
in bands. They've gone on this amazing global journey, evolving their musicality and now they're

819
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:30,039
writing for films and now they're absolutely comfortable being celebrated with an orchestra

820
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:36,099
playing their music. That's amazing. Like that journey there, that, that to me is, is just,

821
01:01:36,099 --> 01:01:36,360
well,

822
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:43,019
how open-minded the musical world is now. And, and that would very rarely have happened, um,

823
01:01:43,019 --> 01:01:48,340
in decades gone by. Yeah. So I, I just think that's a fantastic development, the, the open-mindedness

824
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:53,780
and the fact that you can have these, these, you know, diverse experiences musically. It's so great.

825
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,400
My mind's going, uh, Ben to, to, to, if I'm driving in the car with Ben Northey or I'm,

826
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,619
I'm at home, what are, what are you listening to and how diverse? I mean, is it, is it mostly

827
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:06,639
classical or is it? No, no, God, no, no, very rare.

828
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:13,460
I mean, that's, that's kind of work for me. So, um, yeah, ABC classic is a great radio station

829
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:18,940
and I do listen to it every now and again, but I'm, I'm, I'm in a different listening space. I'm

830
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:23,659
critical. I'm analyzing, you know, I'm working. So as soon as you're listening to an orchestra

831
01:02:23,659 --> 01:02:28,880
play, your mind's constantly, I'm, I'm on the podium. Yeah. I'm on the, I'm, oh, they could

832
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,639
have done this or, you know, why aren't they? And, oh, that was really good. Like, you know,

833
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:36,679
you can learn a lot from listening. I don't mean to say I never listened, but, um,

834
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:41,320
no, it's not, it's not classical music. The kids are dominating the air, the airwaves at our house

835
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:45,699
all the time. So there's heaps of music that I'm discovering for the first time through them,

836
01:02:45,699 --> 01:02:52,659
but no, it's a wide palette, a lot of jazz. Um, I've, I've gotten in recently to, uh, I've been

837
01:02:52,659 --> 01:02:59,300
doing a spot on ABC Melbourne, um, afternoons, which we call calm the farm. And it's like little

838
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:04,420
two, three minutes snippets of music just to give everyone a chance to actually recenter their day

839
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:10,380
and go, okay, just let's take a breather for a second and recalibrate and just listen. Just,

840
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:14,320
that's all just focus on one thing. People have got so much out of it. We did it during the

841
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:20,280
lockdowns and it was so popular. They've just kept it going. And, um, I've actually discovered

842
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:24,440
a whole genre of music called contemporary classical, they call it. And it's often piano

843
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:31,639
based, very meditative, minimal, not kind of new agey at all, but, but just beautiful and really

844
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:33,940
relaxing and, and, um,

845
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:39,039
sort of affirming to listen to. And so I've actually started using that quite a lot now.

846
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,519
Um, just in the middle of the day, just go, okay, I'm just gonna, it's like a meditation,

847
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:47,699
I guess, but it's like three minutes of just listen to music. That's a meditation as it turns

848
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:53,039
out. Calm the farm. I love it, Ben. It's funny that I consider myself not musical in any way,

849
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:59,260
but there is not a moment in the car and that's something he's playing constantly. And so you are

850
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:03,739
really, and you, and you can appreciate everything and, you know, and through your kids, you suddenly

851
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:04,340
discover this.

852
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:08,559
There's a whole, you know, um, you know, there's a fair bit of rap going on this morning before I

853
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:08,960
got up.

854
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:14,039
I've got, I've got this, uh, band called Tokyo Machine that, um, cause Leo, my eight year old

855
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:19,300
son, he's massively into video games. So it's disturbing. We went to PAX on the weekend and

856
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:19,900
this big convention.

857
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:20,860
What a phenomenon that is.

858
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:21,579
Unbelievable.

859
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:27,039
Hundreds of thousands at the convention center in Melbourne. It's the biggest convention by a

860
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:28,619
factor of about two, I think.

861
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:33,559
So, so, you know, and music is huge in this, right? So video games and music, it's like film, but

862
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:34,400
video games are huge.

863
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:37,860
Video games is a bigger industry than film, all film.

864
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:38,480
It's incredible.

865
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:42,400
It's amazing what's happened there. But anyway, he's listening to this band, Tokyo Machine and

866
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:48,539
it's all computer game music and like remixed and all this kind of stuff. And I'm listening to it

867
01:04:48,539 --> 01:04:52,239
going, wow, that's like nothing I've ever heard before. That's amazing.

868
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:55,679
And you can appreciate it in that sense.

869
01:04:55,699 --> 01:05:00,519
Oh yeah. Now good music's good music. That's the thing. It doesn't matter what genre it is.

870
01:05:00,739 --> 01:05:04,400
It's hard to do it well. And when you hear it done well, it doesn't matter if it's a good music,

871
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,699
it's a three minute pop song or a 50 minute symphony, you know, there you can appreciate

872
01:05:08,699 --> 01:05:10,539
the artistry in each of those things.

873
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,280
I love it. Ben, I've got so many more questions, but in the interest of time,

874
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:19,860
there's two final questions that I've been asking all the ladies. I've had a great privilege to sit

875
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:25,679
down alongside and learn from, as I have from you incredibly today. Who has been the greatest

876
01:05:25,679 --> 01:05:26,619
leader in your life?

877
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:35,199
Wow. Big question. You know, I'd have to say the,

878
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:41,179
one of the teachers at the Sibelius Academy is a guy called Jorma Panola. And he is considered to

879
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:47,099
be the world's greatest conducting teacher, right? And he is in his nineties now, still going around

880
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:51,900
the world, giving masterclasses to groups of conductors. He's dedicated the second half of

881
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:56,300
his life to this teaching role. And he found you, didn't you? You won the prize.

882
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:03,000
Yeah. I first met him in 2001, where he was the main teacher of this Symphony Australia

883
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,179
Young Conductor of the Year competition. And that was the first time I'd ever met him. And I've

884
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:08,400
never met him. So it wasn't just a competition. That was a 10 week development program that

885
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:13,619
culminated in a competition that I unexpectedly won, much to the horror of some of the other

886
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:18,980
participants who'd been doing it for years. But that led me to the Sibelius Academy and he was

887
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:22,880
there as well, even though he wasn't the main teacher, I still worked with him and finished

888
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,719
my studies with him at the Stockholm Royal College of Music. It was like learning from Yoda,

889
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:34,619
you know, like this is the, we're talking about like Zen kind of teaching. And it was from him

890
01:06:34,619 --> 01:06:35,179
that it was that.

891
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:42,579
forget-yourself-only music. He was an extraordinary person in the way that he taught. He allowed

892
01:06:42,579 --> 01:06:48,559
everybody to be themselves. He brought out the strengths of everybody. He didn't have a one-size-fits-all

893
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:53,579
approach. All of his students are very different than each other. But the big thing he did was he

894
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:58,559
set up a structure of teaching that has endured. And that was the thing that struck me. I thought,

895
01:06:58,659 --> 01:07:04,280
wow, the great leaders, they actually leave a legacy that remains. And so he set up a new way

896
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:09,059
of teaching conducting, which was video analysis. And people never thought about it before. And he

897
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:13,760
set up like three cameras and did all of his teaching in the video room, not while the

898
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,619
conductors were in front of the orchestra, which is generally how teachers had done it up to that

899
01:07:17,619 --> 01:07:24,860
point, or just let people sink or swim, work it out on the job. So I really admire the fact that

900
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:30,519
he was able to reinvent conductor training globally, but also what he gave me personally,

901
01:07:30,519 --> 01:07:33,860
which was just, again, like John Hopkins,

902
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:39,239
he made me believe that I could do it. And at the end, I'll never forget after I did all this work

903
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:44,099
with him, for five years or something, I worked with him and I saw a lot of him. And at the end,

904
01:07:44,119 --> 01:07:52,019
he just looked at me and said, you're welcome. And it was really so moving to have that, you're ready.

905
01:07:53,619 --> 01:07:58,199
Amazing. That's where I started my career. What a great story. Did he stay in touch and

906
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:02,760
follow you? Would he drop in if you were- Look, because he's in Finland,

907
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:10,760
really. And I think that was also part of his, that was your welcome. It's time for you to go

908
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:18,680
out on your own now. I've got the next group to look after. And so I keep in touch with him,

909
01:08:18,739 --> 01:08:25,560
send him postcards and email, and he'll send a reply every now and again. But it was really

910
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:32,100
that sort of period of time was my time with him. And now it's other people's time with him. It's

911
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:33,420
really amazing. I love it.

912
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:40,060
In the spirit of collaboration, Ben, we're obsessed with what great collaboration looks

913
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:43,840
like and including what you're doing with the Alita Connect group we mentioned and collaborating,

914
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,359
bringing people together to share. Is there anyone in the world, I mean, or maybe even

915
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:55,500
historically, if you could come back and get Mozart back or if you could collaborate with

916
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:59,159
anyone on any project and anything, is there someone that might spring to mind?

917
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:03,840
Oh, there's so many people you'd love to reanimate. I mean,

918
01:09:03,859 --> 01:09:08,180
there's so many questions I'd have for some of these bloody composers that you work with,

919
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:13,180
because, you know, they write this stuff down and you've got to work it out and you can't call

920
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:19,720
them up and ask questions and everyone's got a different idea. I think, you know, this is a

921
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:24,460
little bit in my area and I'm sure there's more interesting people out there that I could think

922
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:30,800
of, but actually asking Ludwig van Beethoven some questions at a dinner party would be very

923
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,840
appealing because he was somebody who,

924
01:09:33,859 --> 01:09:38,899
who incorporated politics into his music. He was one of the first people really to do that

925
01:09:38,899 --> 01:09:47,800
and the meaning behind what he was writing about, he sort of covers more spiritual terrain than any

926
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:53,579
other composer and people talk about Beethoven and I don't know what people's image is when they

927
01:09:53,579 --> 01:09:57,619
hear that name, you know, of this grumpy old composer with grey hair and everything and

928
01:09:57,619 --> 01:10:02,859
he was that, but he just had this amazing humanity in him as well.

929
01:10:03,859 --> 01:10:15,600
But he was using music for something bigger than what it was. So he was trying to send a message

930
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:25,340
in his symphonies. So Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is about rebellion. It's about resistance. It's

931
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:33,199
about not, you know, putting up with, at that point it was the Napoleonic Empire and sweeping

932
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:39,199
through Europe at that time. You know, there's always these subtexts to music. Beethoven's Ninth

933
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:49,579
Symphony, the Ode to Joy, the Choral Symphony. That's about borderless worlds. That's about one,

934
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:55,159
you know, one planet, everybody being united through music. So it's that kind of level,

935
01:10:55,439 --> 01:11:01,500
I reckon that, you know, it's a great model to look back on. I'd love to ask him more about that,

936
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:07,260
that's for sure. Was it controversial at the time, the politics? Did that create some enemies for him?

937
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:10,899
He had to be very careful. Yeah. So he was in Vienna at that time,

938
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:11,000
when he was in Vienna, he was in Vienna, he was in Vienna, he was in Vienna, he was in Vienna,

939
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:18,239
the Fifth Symphony, and that was a police state basically. And he was very subversive and he had

940
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:21,979
to be very careful. He did, he did get into trouble every now and again, but you know,

941
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:25,699
there's composers through history have done that. Some of the Russian composers, Shostakovich in the

942
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:34,640
20th century had his music cancelled by the regime over there, Stalin. So, you know, the musicians

943
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:40,920
have been using their music in all of these ways for centuries, you know, it's been going on.

944
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:46,979
And was Beethoven as appreciated at the time? Was he as massive as he should have been?

945
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:54,479
Yeah, he was one of the guys who actually was revered when he was alive. Now, many of them

946
01:11:54,479 --> 01:12:00,600
weren't. So, you know, Mozart, you know, famously died at 34 and nobody celebrated his passing. And

947
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:05,979
it was only later, because back in those days, you didn't re-perform music of people. They would

948
01:12:05,979 --> 01:12:10,000
write it for a certain thing and you just do it and then it was done. And it was only in the 19th

949
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:10,840
century, people looked back and they were like, oh, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's,

950
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:15,039
we're getting onto another podcast here. People would look back on it and go, you know what,

951
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:19,060
we should play that music again. And that's when the understanding came. Now we're probably

952
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:23,140
overbalanced too far where we don't play enough new music. You know, we need to get back to that.

953
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,439
It's brilliant, Ben. As I said, I keep having questions. It's a space that I'm

954
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:33,560
fascinated about and I'm really grateful that you've taken the time and explained the genius

955
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:38,300
of your world. It's a great story. I feel really grateful that you were able to take the time.

956
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:40,439
Thanks so much. No, no worries, Luke. Anytime.
