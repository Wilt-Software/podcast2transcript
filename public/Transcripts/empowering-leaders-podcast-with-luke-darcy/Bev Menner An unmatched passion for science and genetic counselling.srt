00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,039
This week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is the remarkable Bev Menna, the CEO

2
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:16,219
of Cell Therapies, voted as one of the entrepreneurs of the year and life-saving treatments that

3
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,539
are coming out of her incredible background and knowledge in the world of science.

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,780
Bev's childhood journey has been different to so many we've spoken to on the Empowering

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,140
Leaders podcast, finding out who she is and where she belongs in the world at a very young

6
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:29,440
age.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,640
I'm adopted, so I have a different sort of background to the people, to my family that

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,740
I grew up with, and I think I've always been a little bit fascinated by genetics, fascinated

9
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,420
by nature, fascinated by, you know, our relationships with each other.

10
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:50,560
So for me, I just naturally fell into being really interested in science.

11
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,979
Bev talks about her path to becoming a genetic counsellor, and that has sent her around Australia

12
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:58,979
to study a vast array of topics that included wallabies.

13
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,740
Wallaby lactation, of all things.

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,099
First in Perth, and then I made a move over to Canberra, to the ANU, where I studied wallaby

15
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:10,500
lactation, which is much more interesting than you probably, I can tell from the look

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,540
on your face, which is very, very interesting.

17
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:17,640
As the CEO of Cell Therapies, an incredible start-up business, Bev and her team are now

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,239
on the cusp of revolutionising the way cancers are being treated.

19
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:27,040
This type of immune therapy is really, is really going to revolutionise medicine.

20
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,219
The challenge is, though, it's very expensive.

21
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,200
This is having a medicine made for you and you alone.

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,980
We are really privileged and love having Bev Manor as part of our expanding Alita Connect

23
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,359

24
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,540
the globe from backgrounds like science and technology.

25
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,079
You just heard from Bev to the world of sports, social venture, the arts.

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,939

Of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

32
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,260
Bev Manor has years experience across the Australian and global biopharmaceutical and

33
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,099
healthcare sectors.

34
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:12,780
She holds a PhD in molecular medicine and additional qualifications in genetic counselling,

35
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,419
project management and decision analysis.

36
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:20,699
Bev commenced her career with postdoctoral roles in cancer research before moving to

37
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:25,180
genetic counselling practice and then commercial roles in research and development, portfolio

38
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,120
management and strategic partnerships.

39
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,120
Bev is CEO of Cell Therapies.

40
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:35,020
A biotech company that specialises in personalised cancer therapies and was nominated as the

41
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,919
Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year.

42
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:37,960
Bev, it's great to see you.

43
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:38,479
Thanks for joining me.

44
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,500
Thanks very much, Das.

45
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,180
Great to be here.

46
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:41,800
I hope I've done justice to what is in it.

47
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:42,500
Yeah, wow.

48
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:43,340
Yep, thank you.

49
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,599
Extraordinary life's work.

50
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:47,819
You know, PhD in molecular medicine.

51
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,719
You've gone on and got the additional qualifications, genetic counselling, a range of things.

52
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,199
Why did science grab you?

53
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,419
What was the passion for that?

54
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,919
Yeah, it's a great question.

55
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:59,419
I mean, I grew up in a small country town in Western Australia.

56
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,460
Busselton, in a family where no one had been to university before.

57
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,020
I'm adopted, so I have a different sort of background to the people, to my family that

58
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,860
I grew up with.

59
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:18,400
And I think I've always been a little bit fascinated by genetics, fascinated by nature,

60
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:22,039
fascinated by, you know, our relationships with each other.

61
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,000
So for me, I just naturally fell into being really interested in science.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,379
And then it was one of those things, you know,

63
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,199
I went to the local high school and I did well at science.

64
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,139
I did well at maths.

65
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,439
You know, when you like something, you do well at it, yeah.

66
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,840
And then I just sort of found my way forward from there, I think.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,960
Have you gone back as a genetic counsellor and looked back at the birth heritage?

68
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:44,419
Yes.

69
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:46,139
Is there some science in that world?

70
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,080
Yeah, interesting.

71
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,939
So I actually, I know my biological family.

72
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,419
So my natural mum, she's actually an artist.

73
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,280
So I did say to her recently, you know, I really wish you'd passed on some artistic genes,

74
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,599
because I don't have any of those.

75
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,639
And my natural dad, he was actually in the SAS.

76
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:08,259
He was an elite performer on a different stage.

77
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,360
He was probably, you know, more academic than my mum.

78
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,740
So it was sort of interesting that they had quite different pathways.

79
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,120
But again, growing up in country Western Australia, you know,

80
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,540
not a natural breeding ground maybe for scientists.

81
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,259
And for someone who sounds like you grew up in a really loving family in country,

82
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,420
you know, Western Australia.

83
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,220
And then you have this whole second, you know, and as you say, natural family.

84
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,220
How did that evolve for you as a young woman growing up?

85
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:38,800
Was it challenging?

86
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:43,720
It's interesting, you know, I think, I mean, I was born back in 1970.

87
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,839
So that's a long time ago.

88
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,480
And my mum and dad, I think, were pretty special people to make a choice to adopt

89
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,980
after they'd already had kids because they just wanted more kids just because they

90
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,019
loved raising kids and raising a family.

91
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:59,019
And so they were incredibly loving.

92
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,660
They were incredibly loving, incredibly positive.

93
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,800
They referred to myself and my other adopted sister as their chosen children.

94
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:06,040
It was always a real positive.

95
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,540
And they always sort of said to us, your mum didn't give you up because she didn't love you.

96
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,779
She actually just couldn't look after you.

97
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:18,139
And they were always very encouraging for me to find my natural family.

98
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,259
And so, which was awesome.

99
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:25,379
And then I went through a process when I turned 18 where you can actually apply for your birth

100
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:25,740
certificate.

101
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,420
And my mum had, my natural mum had also applied to the Australian National University.

102
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,040
So we contacted each other very quickly.

103
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,000
And it was interesting.

104
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:35,920
Her and I have a really close friendship.

105
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,680
She's a really lovely woman, but not my mum.

106
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,899
You know, the family you grow up in, I think, are really special in a different way.

107
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,959
Certainly, if you saw my mum and I sitting here next to each other, you know, we're mistaken

108
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,439
as sisters very frequently.

109
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:51,939
I see it as nothing but a positive.

110
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:57,600
And for me, it was also always, I think, a point of fascination that I was in this family

111
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,339
that was very loving and encouraging.

112
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,000
And supportive.

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,279
But then, you know, there was this, there was this other thing, this genetics thing

114
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:07,060
that was, you know, that was something altogether different.

115
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,959
Well, as a scientist, it's the ultimate study in some way.

116
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,180
Nature versus nurture.

117
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,560
You're a living, you know, breathing.

118
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,459
Experiment.

119
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,199
I was trying to choose a better word than that, Bev, at the time.

120
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,779
But there's been some fascinating studies done on that.

121
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:22,160
Oh, yeah.

122
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,000
Which side do you sit on?

123
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,779
Yeah, I think it's fascinating.

124
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:29,279
So, you know, my natural mum said to me a few years.

125
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,339
Actually, we were standing around and she just looked across from me and went,

126
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:37,120
oh, my God, the way you are standing right now, like, is exactly like your natural dad.

127
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,800
My natural dad was actually killed when he was 27 in combat.

128
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:42,839
So I've never had the opportunity to meet him.

129
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,100
I know all of his family.

130
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,639
So she could pick a characteristic in the way I was standing, which is incredible.

131
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,740
Yeah, you think this is a person I've never met.

132
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,699
I truly believe, and now we've many decades working in medical science,

133
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,759
I truly believe that what happens to us

134
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:03,639
and where we end up in life is an absolute combination of our genes and our circumstances.

135
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,680
I think there are some things, and even right down to diseases, you know,

136
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,439
there are some things that we just have written into our genes.

137
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,120
But then whether or not they play out in our lives or how they play out,

138
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,079
I think really does come down to what we surround ourselves with.

139
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,379
There's a famous story that I saw recently where it might have been an orphanage in America,

140
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,540
I'm not sure if you saw that, where they were trying to conduct that experiment,

141
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,759
and they were getting twins and triplets that were put into that orphanage

142
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,600
and then strategically sending them to affluent families,

143
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,079
non-affluent families around the New York area.

144
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:41,220
And what happened when those kids grew up,

145
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,399
some of them crossed over at college, had no understanding that that study had been.

146
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:46,860
Have you seen that story?

147
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,420
I mean, you wouldn't ethically do it ever again.

148
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,699
There was some tragedy that evolved out of it,

149
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,360
separating triplets when perhaps you didn't need to.

150
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,600
And I think that study's been locked away because of the,

151
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,360
the ethical issues of it.

152
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,699
But it's probably the great question we're thinking about.

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,420
Is our environment the thing more than our genetics?

154
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,540
Yeah, I really believe it's 50-50.

155
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,740
I really think.

156
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,019
And especially when you come down to working in genetics and genetics of diseases,

157
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:18,740
you know, when you have exactly the same genetic kind of makeup to animals

158
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,259
and one will get a disease and one won't,

159
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:25,379
or, you know, we really are a reflection of our environment as well, I think.

160
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,339
And I think the more we learn about medicine and biology,

161
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,159
the more we know how much the environment can actually impact,

162
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,500
you know, our own health.

163
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,159
But there is that underlying genetic element that we,

164
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:38,419
that we certainly can't escape.

165
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,679
So the genetic counselling is probably where to go to, isn't it?

166
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,379
I mean, for those that, like me, non-medical people,

167
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,080
what's the possibility of genetic counselling?

168
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,580
Why are you so fascinated with that?

169
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,580
Yeah, so I, I had an interesting path to get to genetic counselling.

170
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,440
So I went through my university years in, first in Perth,

171
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,580
and then I made a move over to Canberra,

172
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,679
to the ANU where I studied wallaby lactation,

173
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,500
which is much more interesting than you probably,

174
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,419
I can tell from the look on your face, which is very, very interesting.

175
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,580
And then I actually made a move here to Melbourne

176
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,120
and I did my PhD here at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute.

177
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:15,580
You're going to ask me something about wallaby lactation.

178
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,159
I know you are.

179
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:19,519
How does that become a field of study?

180
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,799
Okay, so let me tell you something very cool about wallabies and kangaroos, actually.

181
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,539
So in their pouches, they have four teats to feed their young.

182
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,419
And you know how when baby wallabies are born, they're like, like a centimetre long,

183
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:36,799
but then they can grow up to be, you know, 20 centimetres high and still feeding.

184
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,720
So the mother can actually produce different milk from neighbouring,

185
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,860
from neighbouring teats in her, in her pouch, which is pretty bloody amazing.

186
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:44,139
Yeah.

187
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,039
So how that's controlled and how we learn more about milk production and,

188
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,340
you know, and a whole lot of stuff associated with that.

189
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,620
It's, it's a big field of study.

190
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,860
It's, it's an important thing.

191
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,879
We can learn a lot from the animals around us.

192
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,580
I didn't cut you off when you're trying to pass to genetic counselling.

193
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,059
Yes.

194
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,080
So sorry for that.

195
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,399
No, no.

196
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:06,440
So I, I moved on and did my PhD in cancer genetics here in Melbourne and love the science.

197
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:13,080
Like I'm just so fascinated by science, but I did work out on that path that being in a lab

198
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,919
wasn't for me.

199
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,759
I love people.

200
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm energised by people.

201
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:20,440
I'm a true extrovert and being in a lab, you know, for long hours by myself,

202
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,000
wasn't really the path for me.

203
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:28,580
So I was over in New York working in a lab over there after my PhD and I was in a lift one day.

204
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,539
And I saw a notice about genetic counselling and I'd never heard of it.

205
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,059
It was a term I'd never heard.

206
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,980
So I thought I'm going to go along and listen to that seminar.

207
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:39,860
And it was, I came out of that going, yeah, I'm going to give that a crack.

208
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,399
So I came back to Australia.

209
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,840
So what genetic counselling is, is it's a field of, of endeavour where we train as,

210
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,679
as counsellors, but we sit with people who are trying to make decisions about whether

211
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,480
they will or won't have a genetic test.

212
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:54,539
And there's a lot that can impact that.

213
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:57,059
And that might be in the setting of a pregnancy.

214
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,539
It might be in the setting.

215
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,159
A very strong family history of cancer.

216
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:04,919
So helping people to work out, do they want to have testing?

217
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:10,259
And then before they have the testing, help them actually walk down the paths of, okay,

218
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,980
if you got this result, what would you do?

219
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,580
And help them kind of walk, walk through the positives and negatives of those things.

220
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,919
So helping people, you know, who have a strong family history of breast cancer and they

221
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:24,860
carry a genetic predisposition, helping them manage that.

222
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,519
What would you do?

223
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,379
Would you go and have prophylactic surgery to remove your breasts?

224
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:29,340
So you don't get cancer.

225
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:34,259
So it's helping people with those really important life decisions.

226
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:40,000
And I think, um, that was a time when I really learnt about how important connection

227
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,299
with patients, connection with family members, connection between family members

228
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:46,159
and is, is just so critical.

229
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,460
And Bev, you're the CEO of Cell Therapies and we have just seen you recently nominated.

230
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,019
Congratulations on that again for an Entrepreneur of the Year award, a crystal ball out.

231
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:57,379
Yeah.

232
00:11:57,379 --> 00:11:57,659
As someone who's passionate about breast cancer.

233
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:57,759
Yeah.

234
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:57,820
Yeah.

235
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,639
As someone who's passionate about science and health, what, what are you hoping to achieve?

236
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:05,120
Um, so the therapies that we make at Cell Therapies are sort of the next generation

237
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,779
cancer therapies.

238
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,820
So we, this is where, you know, patients that have, um, have, have exhausted all hope of

239
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,000
treatment with their cancers.

240
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,159
There's this new way of treating them where we can actually take that patient's own blood

241
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:23,139
cells, bring it to our labs, genetically change those cells so that they, when we put them

242
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:27,700
back into that patient, they recognise the cancer cells and they literally seek and destroy

243
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:27,960
them.

244
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,440
So then with one treatment, they can go from having not very many weeks to live to being

245
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,080
cancer free.

246
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:40,200
It's truly the most exceptional thing I think I've seen in, in my career of many decades.

247
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,899
Like it is truly, and this is happening down the road here in Melbourne and all over the

248
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:45,159
world.

249
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,840
So it's really, truly amazing, amazing science that we're, so we actually are the ones that

250
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,379
do that work for patients that are, that are here in Australia and around the world.

251
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:57,679
That's a profound thing that you just said, Bev.

252
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,860
And, you know, your eyes light up with that.

253
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,379
Is it applied to all sorts of different cancers?

254
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,299
You're having success across the range of cancers?

255
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:12,480
Yeah, it's at the moment there, um, the cancers where we have approval for these drugs around

256
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,440
the world, um, are in leukaemias and lymphomas, but there are hundreds and hundreds of new

257
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,299
versions of this type of therapy and development, um, that are coming through clinical trials

258
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:24,759
now and we're supporting a lot of those.

259
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:27,600
And they are in everything from solid cancer.

260
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,740
Cancers like bowel cancers to sarcomas, and then even outside of cancers, they're being

261
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,139
tested, um, this type of treatment for lupus and other immune disorders.

262
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:43,519
So this type of immune therapy is really, is really going to revolutionize medicine.

263
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,659
The challenge is though, it's very expensive.

264
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,679
This is having a medicine made for you and you alone.

265
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,159
So we're, we're trying to now work out, all right, how do we actually, you know, it's

266
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,139
great that we can do this really clever science, but how do we make that available to more

267
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:57,500
patients?

268
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,379
So that's the, that's the big challenge.

269
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:03,159
And I think where we want to get to is we want to be making these therapies in an affordable

270
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:07,940
way so that people don't have to wait until they're really, really sick before they get

271
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,059
off of this type of therapy.

272
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:11,940
Yeah, you can feel the energy and the passion that comes out of you.

273
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,539
And so it should, I mean, given what, uh, you know, so many people are facing and I

274
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:21,080
think everyone's been touched by cancer in one shape or another, you're now the CEO of

275
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,519
this business.

276
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,340
And so you've got this incredible academic background and great history and you work

277
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,600
at CSL and in research.

278
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,419
So now you've got to tap into a whole different set of skills as a leader of a, of a growing

279
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:31,860
space.

280
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,379
What have you found within yourself to achieve that?

281
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,539
Do you know, I actually feel like all of the different jobs that I've done that have led

282
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:42,620
me to the last year when I've stepped into this role have all played a really key part.

283
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:46,960
So I think being a genetic counsellor, you need to learn how to listen to people and

284
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,399
to communicate with people in a, you know, in a clear way.

285
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,220
And that's not just scientists, that's, you know, all sorts of people.

286
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,000
I think I have my grounding in science.

287
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,179
I obviously need that to be able to understand what it is that we're doing and to make sure

288
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:03,279
that the people that we're working with are on the same page.

289
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,460
I think just my innate passion for people and communication and connection is, you know,

290
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,620
is just really central.

291
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:15,100
We've, you know, we've rebuilt a leadership team and we're, we're hiring new people all

292
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,740
the time into our business because it's, it's a really, you know, rapidly growing field.

293
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:25,159
So I think for me, it's, it's, it's bringing all that experience that I've had to, to bring

294
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:25,980
a team together.

295
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:31,360
To focus everyone on the mission that we have and, and then to keep people motivated and

296
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,419
on track and help them get there, help get the hurdles out of the way.

297
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,000
My job's not to do the work.

298
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,840
The smart people that work with me do that.

299
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:41,940
My job is to really set the vision and then get out of the way so they can do it.

300
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:47,379
I was reading some of the health data out of the US in recent times and to use the word

301
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,120
alarming, I don't think it's being excessive.

302
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,159
When you see that 75% of Americans are now technically overweight, 50% are obese, every

303
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:55,960
second person.

304
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,059
They've either got diabetes or pre-diabetic.

305
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,240
There's a whole range of chronic health issues that are going on.

306
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,500
And at times it feels like Australia to me is becoming a mini version of the US and we're

307
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,080
seeing these chronic health issues.

308
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:11,419
As a scientist passionate about health, you can tell your world lights up.

309
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,340
You want, you want to make the world better for people.

310
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,259
Should we be alarmed at the state of health in the West?

311
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:22,159
I think there's a lot to be alarmed about, but I do think there's also, you know, there's

312
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,440
a lot to feel positive about.

313
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:25,919
I mean, I have a lot to do with the younger generation.

314
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,440
I'm involved with a, with a, an independent school here.

315
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,360
And so I get to actually engage with a whole lot of students at that school.

316
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,700
And you actually see this next generation.

317
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,159
I know lots of people say negative things about the generations that are coming.

318
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:45,299
I, I, I feel, I feel eternally optimistic because I see these bright young people that

319
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:46,559
are passionate about their health.

320
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,100
They're actually drinking more than probably you or I did back in the day.

321
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,320
Less, sorry.

322
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:52,080
They're drinking a lot less.

323
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,080
They're drinking a lot less, aren't they?

324
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:53,720
A lot less.

325
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:53,919
Yeah.

326
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:55,960
I think we're all, you know, very optimistic.

327
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,600
Very aware of the impacts now of, of diet and smoking and those sorts of things.

328
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:03,179
So I, I think there's a lot to feel positive about.

329
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,180
I mean, I think, you know, I think, I think we're on the right path.

330
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:06,720
Yeah.

331
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,900
When I hear the genius of what someone like you is doing, taking someone's blood and personalising

332
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,839
a therapy that can kill cancer cells and take someone from stage four cancer to reverse

333
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,519
their health outcomes and give people, family members a second chance at life.

334
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,220
It's remarkable.

335
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,880
To me, it seems at times that, you know, you've got that genius of what,

336
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,420
the world you operate in, but then sometimes the, the, the obvious natural things like

337
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:36,119
diet, like a bit of exercise, like some sunlight, like sleeping better, all these things that

338
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:39,559
are applicable to everyone has almost been lost.

339
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:44,440
Do we need those worlds to collaborate better than they have done that the holistic way

340
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,839
to health?

341
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,259
Is that something that the science world can maybe find a way to collaborate with a bit

342
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:49,500
more?

343
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,500
Yeah, I think that's a great point.

344
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,819
And I do think, um, I think collaboration's at centre of everything, but I do think,

345
00:17:55,819 --> 00:18:03,740
we need to, we as scientists actually need to do a better job, um, of communicating and

346
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,740
connecting and collaborating with the non-scientific community.

347
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:13,039
And I think, uh, I think we saw this in, in stark, you know, kind of contrast, contrast

348
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,299
during the pandemic, like the scientists had a particular view on what was going on and

349
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:21,039
that was quite different to what, you know, the most of the people in the community thought

350
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,799
because scientists are generally not particularly good at communicating and, and teaching.

351
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:27,160
People and educating them.

352
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,940
So I think there's a bit of a responsibility on us as a community to be better at that

353
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:38,740
education and communication piece, um, be it around vaccination or be it around, um,

354
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:42,759
the impacts of, you know, um, of obesity on, on your health.

355
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,720
So I think we've got to do it better.

356
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,980
And I think there's a role, um, you know, there's a role for the scientists, but then

357
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,359
there's a role sort of in the broader community as well.

358
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,779
I'm keen to come back and ask you a question about the COVID period in a moment, but I

359
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:55,720
wanted to jump off.

360
00:18:55,819 --> 00:19:00,180
The collaboration piece is why we're so excited, uh, Bev, to have you join our leader

361
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,779
community as a, as a world renowned expert in, in the field of science.

362
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:08,779
And to see you collaborate with, um, Don Pike, who's a legend of the AFL world, John

363
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:13,480
Horst from the Walkie Bucks and the NBA, uh, Jeremy is, uh, doing great things at Google.

364
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,940
Lisa Kaplan's an Olympic gold medalist and a legend in every sense, Ed Policy from Green

365
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,099
Bay.

366
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:23,039
It's a very different minds getting together to connect and to share and to learn, which

367
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,440
we're really fascinated about.

368
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,180
Can you tell us about.

369
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:30,940
Yeah, it's, it's been brilliant and it's the reason that I, the reason I got involved

370
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,599
was to get out of my bubble of talking to other scientists, you know, like I think in,

371
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:39,579
in our professional lives, generally, I don't know if it's worse in science or in than in

372
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:44,619
other parts, but I think we very quickly get channeled down a path where you look around

373
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:48,200
and you find that you're in a bit of an echo chamber and the people that you're talking

374
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,680
to all the time are people that have the same background, the same experiences have read

375
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,880
the same things as you have.

376
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
So I think.

377
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,819
You know, I think that's, I think that's, um, limiting and to your previous question,

378
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:03,640
I think that's what doesn't help us in terms of connecting, you know, science and lifestyle

379
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,640
and wellbeing.

380
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,440
And, you know, I think we actually need to look outside of our little lane that we get

381
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
in.

382
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,759
So for me to be sitting around a virtual table with, you know, um, with that group of people

383
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:16,940
is, is just sensational.

384
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,500
And I think we learn and we're reminded every time we talk about the similarities are greater

385
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
than the differences.

386
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,759
And for me, that's really key.

387
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:27,440
That's the key to everything that we do in leadership.

388
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,019
It's like, even if you're working with someone or working with a group and you think there's

389
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:33,920
real difference, there's always more similarities.

390
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,140
And so I think with a group of people in such different fields, we get together and we can

391
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:43,200
help each other solve problems because we're looking at it through different lenses and

392
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,700
we're all actually suffering through pretty similar problems.

393
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,640
It really doesn't matter what, you know, what area you're working in.

394
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,920
And I just think it's such a wonderful space to, to be able to do that.

395
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,519
And there's not many places in life where you get the opportunity to do that.

396
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,519
Yeah.

397
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,519
Beautifully said, Bev, thanks for, for sharing that.

398
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:56,519
And I love that you met, you mentioned that, isn't it?

399
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:01,519
That often the similarity, when you sit down, you think you're at the other end of the debate

400
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:02,519
to someone.

401
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:07,519
And over time, it used to be the great skill that I think we've lost, isn't it?

402
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:12,019
We used to sort of come together with different views and then often meet in the middle and

403
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:16,400
it feels like the council culture world and the algorithms are pushing us further and

404
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
further apart.

405
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,400
But I think you described that in a beautiful way.

406
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
You've got to come back to the COVID era.

407
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
I think, you know, as you and I are residents of, of Melbourne, Victoria.

408
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
Yeah.

409
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
Yeah.

410
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Yeah.

411
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
Yeah.

412
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,740
Which holds a record not many would want to have as one of the most locked down cities

413
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,240
in the world through that period of time.

414
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,400
And I think if we weren't interested in health before that or science, you became very interested

415
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
in it.

416
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,400
And it felt like a time, Bev, where if you asked a question about, do you think keeping

417
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,900
our kids out of school for two years has some cost and, and, and tragedy attached to it

418
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,900
as well?

419
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,759
Do you think that the idea that everyone has to take a medical product is fair?

420
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:52,400
I think they're reasonable questions to ask.

421
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
A hundred percent.

422
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,900
People got smashed for asking questions, simply asking questions like that.

423
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,859
People got arrested in their house for, you know, pregnant women in Melbourne for the

424
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:04,740
thought that maybe this was getting a little bit excessive.

425
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,400
As a scientist with all your knowledge.

426
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Yeah.

427
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
What, what should we learn from that period?

428
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:15,940
So I think, so for me in that period, so I was, I was at CSL and I was leading the work

429
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:21,400
to actually manufacture the AstraZeneca vaccine alongside the UQ vaccine.

430
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,900
So I was working as the bridge between CSL, AstraZeneca and the federal government.

431
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,900
Right at the coalface.

432
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,400
So that was my job and, and it was, it was crazy.

433
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
Yeah.

434
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
Like it was really going back to collaboration.

435
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,900
It is the most impressive, impressive collaborative effort that I have seen in my life.

436
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:45,400
Like I was sitting on phone calls with people from nine different pharmaceutical companies

437
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
around the one table.

438
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,900
Now we're fierce competitors.

439
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,900
Yeah.

440
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,900
98% of the time.

441
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,900
Yeah.

442
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,400
So I sat on the other side and went, okay, how do we actually work out, how do we solve

443
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,500
this together to get to a vaccine as fast as we humanly can?

444
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,400
And that was the most amazing sense of collaboration that I, that I think I've seen.

445
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,900
So, so for me, that period was a period that actually shows that science and our world

446
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:14,559
of pharmaceutical companies, we can do like amazing good when, you know, when we actually,

447
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,900
when we, when we need to, and to answer, you know, to answer that call, I think in terms

448
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,900
of how that impacted us as a society.

449
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,900
Yeah.

450
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:26,460
My biggest concern is that we won't learn from what we did.

451
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,180
I think we have to look very holistically at what was the impact, not just on the number

452
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:36,099
of people who contracted COVID because most of us are fine.

453
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:40,079
Or we have to look at the number of people that died, but we do have to look at the longer

454
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:45,380
term mental health impact on our community, in particular, our young people.

455
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,740
And I think we've got to look at the impact on our business and our economy, and we've

456
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,900
got to look at as a whole.

457
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,740
And we have to compare it with global data.

458
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,960
We're in this, this unique position now where we can sit back and we can look at data from

459
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,440
every country around the world.

460
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,579
And we know how everyone handled it differently.

461
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:03,240
Sweden didn't do a single enforced lockdown.

462
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,000
So let's actually look, did they have a better outcome or a worse outcome than what we did

463
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,079
in Victoria?

464
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,019
And I just really hope that we pause and do that.

465
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:13,019
Use the data.

466
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:14,519
We've got all this fabulous data around.

467
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:18,920
Let's use it so that the next time we come to a pandemic, we're going to actually handle

468
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,900
it a lot more intelligently.

469
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,900
Yeah.

470
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,819
Which is a great way to think about it, isn't it?

471
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:27,180
And a balanced and fair way is actually, because you actually have got, you said, unique case

472
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,180
studies, isn't it?

473
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,660
The Swedes were very different to other parts of the world.

474
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,720
To the agendas that drive some of these things, as someone who gets a little concerned, I

475
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,859
mean, around outcomes, there's huge dollars to be made in any of these spaces at times.

476
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:45,380
And people wanting to set certain agendas, does that allow those independent studies

477
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,380
to be, to be had?

478
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,339
Well, I think that the data will be there.

479
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:49,339
The World Health Organization.

480
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:49,460
Yeah.

481
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:49,539
Yeah.

482
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:49,599
Yeah.

483
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:49,619
Yeah.

484
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:49,660
Yeah.

485
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:49,720
Yeah.

486
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:49,759
Yeah.

487
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:49,859
Yeah.

488
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,119
The World Health Organization have that data.

489
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,480
So we've got the data.

490
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,980
I think the bit that's the concern, it's more the political, it's the political lens.

491
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:58,200
Yeah.

492
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:03,880
It's like, will we allow ourselves to actually sit down and put ourselves under that scrutiny

493
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,819
and allow ourselves to go, okay, well, we did what we thought was best at the time,

494
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,880
best intentions.

495
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,680
But now looking back, we actually know that wasn't the right thing.

496
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:15,680
Like someone has to be the grown up in the room and actually do that.

497
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,779
So whether we look to our politicians or what leaders we look to.

498
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:22,119
We don't know what they're going to do to actually do that, but we really have to do

499
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:22,700
that piece of work.

500
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:26,000
There's every chance that there will be another pandemic at some point.

501
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,119
Hopefully it won't be to the extent of the one we've just lived through, but we've, we

502
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:33,480
should really go into it much better prepared than we did this time.

503
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:33,779
Yeah.

504
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:37,880
I've said in this space a number of times that one of the subsets was that there were

505
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,559
in this state that we live in 600 teenage girls a week in the end were getting diagnosed

506
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,460
with eating disorders.

507
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,259
And if that's not readily shared that information, how do you learn from it?

508
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:47,460
Yeah.

509
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,259
Is that cost worth the...

510
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:51,579
The benefit of keeping kids away from school?

511
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:54,980
There's a whole range of things, but I love the way you think about it is let's hopefully

512
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,440
learn from it and work out if we can do it better in the hope that it doesn't happen

513
00:25:59,440 --> 00:25:59,700
again.

514
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:03,720
We love this idea that success leaves clues and I love your background and the unique

515
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,799
way that you think.

516
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:09,079
And we think it's very hard to lead someone else in any form of your life without this

517
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:10,380
idea of self-leadership.

518
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,579
So how do you make you feel good so that you can lead others, Bev?

519
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:15,420
What do you do for yourself?

520
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,799
There's a number of things.

521
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,019
Yeah.

522
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:19,740
I go to the gym five mornings a week.

523
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:21,579
I wake up really early in the morning because I love it.

524
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,200
As I said, I'm an extrovert.

525
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:26,640
There's another group of really mad people that like go to the gym at five o'clock in

526
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,339
the morning and they're freaking awesome.

527
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,579
They're not there to dick around.

528
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,900
They're there to do a workout and to have a bit of a laugh.

529
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,299
And so for me, exercise is really, really key.

530
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:40,460
We live on the beach, which is very, very lucky and I just love it.

531
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,019
So being near water is really important.

532
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,740
Being able to go with my son and grab a stand up paddle board and walk out the front and

533
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,839
go for a paddle.

534
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:49,240
Those things.

535
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,339
Those things.

536
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:49,359
Those things.

537
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:49,380
Those things.

538
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:49,480
Those things.

539
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:49,500
Those things.

540
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:49,519
Those things.

541
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:49,759
Those things.

542
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:52,720
Those sorts of things to me, you know, nature, fresh air.

543
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:58,500
We've also, a year ago, we, my husband and I bought a block of land out in East Gippsland

544
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,619
and it's a five acre block, little tiny house on it, which is off grid.

545
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,819
And our plan is to regenerate it with indigenous plants and trees.

546
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,740
So we've started that.

547
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,779
That's a lifelong project.

548
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:13,759
We want, we want there to be a little piece of the world that's actually better off because

549
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,400
we were here when we leave.

550
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,099
So that's what we're working on.

551
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:19,099
So we go out there and that's, there's just kangaroos.

552
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:20,460
There's no fences.

553
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,019
It's very basic and I just love it to bits.

554
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,079
Any lactating wallabies out there?

555
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,099
No, there's probably are lactating wallabies, yes, but I don't.

556
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,880
And if anyone knows what's going on with those wallabies, you're the person.

557
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,900
I love what you said.

558
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,819
That's incredible that you can just see really clearly what makes you feel good.

559
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,039
I love hearing that from different people.

560
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,940
If you go to the gym at 5am, you're not mucking around.

561
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:40,519
No.

562
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,380
You're there for business.

563
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:41,680
Correct.

564
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,579
And you want to get in and get it done.

565
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:47,079
Is there one piece of leadership advice that you pass on regularly?

566
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:53,819
Uh, yeah, actually, I think for me, and it comes down to what we, what we focus on at

567
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:57,359
a leader, I think it's, um, connection ahead of content.

568
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:03,660
I think you can't lead another person or a group or an organisation unless you actually

569
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:08,759
can connect with people, um, and really properly connect with them and understand where they're

570
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:13,720
coming from, what's motivating them so that you can then point people in the direction

571
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,440
that they, that they need to head.

572
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:15,500
Yeah.

573
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:15,559
Yeah.

574
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:15,579
Yeah.

575
00:28:15,579 --> 00:28:15,599
Yeah.

576
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:15,619
Yeah.

577
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:15,640
Yeah.

578
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:15,660
Yeah.

579
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:15,680
Yeah.

580
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:15,740
Yeah.

581
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:15,759
Yeah.

582
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:15,779
Yeah.

583
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:15,799
Yeah.

584
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:15,819
Yeah.

585
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:15,839
Yeah.

586
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:15,859
Yeah.

587
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:15,900
Yeah.

588
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:15,960
Yeah.

589
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:15,980
Yeah.

590
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,039
Yeah.

591
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:16,099
Yeah.

592
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:16,140
Yeah.

593
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,559
Yeah.

594
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,059
Yeah.

595
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,359
Yeah.

596
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:18,420
Yeah.

597
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:18,440
Yeah.

598
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:18,519
Yeah.

599
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:18,579
Yeah.

600
00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:18,740
Yeah.

601
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:18,779
Yeah.

602
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:18,880
I think that's what I went on to the CEO role a year ago.

603
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,359
I promised that I would sit down one-on-one and meet the 70 staff that are

604
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:27,279
in the organisation, which I did, and I continue as new starters come into the organisation.

605
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,059
I sit down just for half an hour, just to have a conversation to find out what they do

606
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:31,859
in their spare time.

607
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,099
What do they do to, you know, kind of fill their bucket?

608
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,099
Then I think being able to connect with people is so important as a leader, because if you

609
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:44,400
make yourself available in a really honest and open way, then, then you're available

610
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,359
for them to come to you.

611
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:45,440
Yeah.

612
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,500
Yeah.

613
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:45,519
Yeah.

614
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:45,539
Yeah.

615
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:47,059
If they've got a problem, an idea, then they can come to you and help you develop something

616
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:49,980
you know, they've got something to kind of share with you.

617
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:53,400
I think if you can't make that connection, I think it's a real problem.

618
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,400
Connection ahead of content is genius.

619
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:00,279
We were talking before we started recording Brian McNamee,

620
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:01,819
who I've had the pleasure of talking to,

621
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,880
who was the leader of a business you worked in for a long period of time.

622
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,380
That was a very similar thing that he spoke about.

623
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,819
That is a massive, massive global behemoth of a business.

624
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,380
But even in that scale, connection still works for you.

625
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:15,400
Yeah, absolutely.

626
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,359
And Brian is just one of the most impressive leaders I've ever worked with.

627
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:26,019
And even my 14 years at CSL working, most of that was working globally.

628
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:29,500
And so you need to find ways to connect remotely with people.

629
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:33,299
I mean, my team was spread over Europe, the US and Australia.

630
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:37,799
But still being able to connect as humans first before,

631
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,460
I think if you can't do that,

632
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,779
you can't drive a group of people to do what you need to get done.

633
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:43,940
Beautifully said.

634
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,319
Setting the vision is one.

635
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,940
Do you have any advice on how to deliver a vision within a team?

636
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,960
I mean, what you're doing in your space is just so incredible and unique,

637
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:55,799
but I'm assuming to get 70 people focused,

638
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,400
how do you go about sharing that vision?

639
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,980
In a way, our area is really easy

640
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,599
because at the end of every single thing that we do,

641
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:08,099
there's a patient who is going to potentially live a long and healthy life

642
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:09,559
as opposed to not.

643
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,519
So that's a pretty big driver.

644
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,720
So for me,

645
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,440
I try and always bring it back to the patient and even at Cell Therapies,

646
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,640
we've actually had a patient who's received these types of therapies

647
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,640
and was a young woman with a young family who was in a really bad way

648
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,619
and now is cancer-free and she came and spoke to all the staff.

649
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,440
And that for me,

650
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:36,559
that is the clearest way to articulate vision and to remind people,

651
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:38,960
this is why we're here, this is why we're doing this.

652
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,319
And I think bringing it back in our space,

653
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,700
certainly bringing it back to the patient,

654
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,640
is the most important thing.

655
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,940
Curiosity is a word we use all the time in this world.

656
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,880
Does that show up for you?

657
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,599
Can you describe maybe a rabbit hole that your curiosity has taken you down in recent times?

658
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,859
I think science, you have to be intrinsically curious.

659
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:02,519
I think it's what we do is ask questions and challenge what we already know

660
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,220
to see if we can get it better or see if we can do something in a smarter way.

661
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:12,539
I think for me, the curiosity shows up more almost

662
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:13,599
in terms of the people.

663
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:16,460
I'm really curious about the people that I work with

664
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,000
because some people you meet and you just go,

665
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:21,079
oh my God, I just did not connect with that person at all.

666
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,740
But I need to, to make this work.

667
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:25,099
So what is it about that person?

668
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,339
What is it that I can actually be curious about?

669
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,460
How can I find a way that we can get on the same page

670
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,940
so that we can actually form the connection that we need to make

671
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,880
to be able to work?

672
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,640
So I think humans, I'm really, really curious about.

673
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,740
That's, you know,

674
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,720
I heard one of our sporting coaches on the podcast

675
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,480
in our little world is that, you know,

676
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,240
some people are quite hard to love in that space,

677
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,420
but you have to keep trying until you find that one connection point,

678
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,579
that one thing that you're both curious about,

679
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:57,980
and then you can build a relationship from there.

680
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:00,180
Sounds like you work hard to do that.

681
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:01,099
Yeah, absolutely.

682
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:04,039
I think because I think you've got to find that point of connection

683
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:06,240
and it can be really hard to find.

684
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:08,200
And that really frustrates me, actually.

685
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,380
That's one of the things that frustrates me.

686
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,720
If I can't connect with someone,

687
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,359
that I really want to connect with,

688
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,440
then I find that pretty hard, actually.

689
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,319
So, yeah, I work at it.

690
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,119
We love this quote that the cost of leadership is time.

691
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,940
How do you juggle your workloads and your demands

692
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,779
to be able to live the life that you want to live

693
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,839
but still foster that connection and collaboration?

694
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:30,759
It's challenging, yeah.

695
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:35,880
So I also am the chair of a board at an independent school here in Melbourne

696
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,140
that just does brilliant things around education,

697
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,359
and I love pouring my time into that.

698
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:41,700
I love pouring my time into that.

699
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,019
I love pouring my time into my family and, you know,

700
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,160
obviously then, you know, my role as a CEO and myself.

701
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,420
I think you've got to be kind to yourself sometimes.

702
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,940
I think, I mean, I could put each one of those things

703
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,480
could almost be a full-time job.

704
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:59,579
So I think you've got to actually say I can only give a certain percentage

705
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:01,119
of my time this week to that.

706
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,200
And for me, when people talk about that work-life balance,

707
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:08,400
it's not like 50% work, 50% non-work.

708
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,700
I think it's some weeks, you know,

709
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,700
you actually have to tip it off.

710
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,579
You have to tip it a little bit towards the CEO role.

711
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,259
But then there are other weeks where it's like that needs to take a back seat

712
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:18,980
because, you know, my family needs to take priority.

713
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:23,380
So I do think just being mindful and just being a little bit easy on yourself

714
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,000
and realising that that's actually okay.

715
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,119
Yeah, be kind to yourself is a good way to think.

716
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,700
I think talking about communication and people's communication strategies

717
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,480
is probably the most common thing I hear in those conversations.

718
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,200
Have you got a mantra of your own when it comes to the way you communicate?

719
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,200
I think I've learnt,

720
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,299
and I'm still learning that everyone receives information in different ways.

721
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,700
And I think assuming that the person that's sitting across from you

722
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,000
receives the information the same way that you do is a mistake.

723
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,059
That will set you up for failure.

724
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,400
I think trying to work out, okay,

725
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,059
how does this person need to hear this information?

726
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,279
Is it in the written form?

727
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,759
Is it in a pictorial form?

728
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:05,019
Is it in the verbal form?

729
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,599
And so I think just trying to, again,

730
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,219
be curious about the person that you're sitting across from

731
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:10,980
and working out, okay,

732
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,900
how do they need to hear this?

733
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,760
Because it's really important for me,

734
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,360
for them to understand that.

735
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,300
And then when I'm talking to the whole group,

736
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,800
really trying to make sure I'm using a whole variety of things,

737
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,539
that I'm using verbal communication,

738
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,880
that I've got slides,

739
00:34:26,019 --> 00:34:29,480
that I've got written documents if they're helpful.

740
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,300
So I think it's that style,

741
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,739
it's that communication style

742
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,599
and finding what works for the other person.

743
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,980
Bev, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

744
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:37,800
My mum.

745
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:38,699
No hesitation?

746
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,199
No hesitation, no.

747
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:41,000
And she was...

748
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,179
She was an uneducated,

749
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:47,840
not formally educated person living in a small country town,

750
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,780
but she raised four pretty strong independent women.

751
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,380
Four girls?

752
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:54,119
Yeah, four girls.

753
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,900
And I think if you looked at her now

754
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,019
or if you had looked at her before she passed,

755
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:04,079
you would say that she was your classic 1950s housewife

756
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,079
that was very focused about keeping the house nice

757
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,559
and making sure the kids were quiet

758
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:11,179
when dad came home from work.

759
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:13,320
Which was absolutely all her.

760
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,820
But underneath that,

761
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:18,320
she was fiercely strong and independent

762
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,420
and kind of really knew...

763
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,820
She really taught us all how to stand up for ourselves

764
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,679
and how to be heard.

765
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,960
So I just think it's pretty impressive

766
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,320
to wear all of those hats.

767
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,679
And adopted two other girls on top of the two...

768
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,400
That she already had, yeah.

769
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,460
That's pretty special, isn't it?

770
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:34,239
Yeah, yeah.

771
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,480
Really, really impressive, impressive woman.

772
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,659
She must have been incredibly proud of you

773
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:41,039
and the path you went down.

774
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:41,980
I think so.

775
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:45,119
Although she did still like to remind me

776
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,340
right up until like the week before she passed

777
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,519
that a mother's role is at home with her children.

778
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:53,000
And of course I have a child

779
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,199
and of course I love being at home

780
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:56,239
and spending time with my child

781
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:59,460
but I also have a career which she did struggle with.

782
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,219
But yeah, it came from a place of love.

783
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,219
But I love that you can celebrate that era

784
00:36:04,219 --> 00:36:05,840
of what it was, isn't it?

785
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,280
I've got to be careful as a male talking about that

786
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,099
because you sound...

787
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,099
My mother-in-law is very...

788
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:12,320
Very much of that generation.

789
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:12,579
Yeah.

790
00:36:12,699 --> 00:36:13,440
Makes me laugh.

791
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:15,800
Some of the things she says to my beautiful wife

792
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,400
and I'm like, I would never say that.

793
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:22,119
But it's to see that someone was so incredible

794
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:24,900
and able to, as you said, give so much

795
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,639
and form so much of who you and your sisters are,

796
00:36:27,699 --> 00:36:28,980
that's an incredible legacy, isn't it?

797
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:29,900
Yeah, absolutely.

798
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:31,300
Yeah, 100%.

799
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,920
So we're obsessed with this idea of collaboration

800
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,900
and it's been such a pleasure to meet you

801
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,639
and to see what you're doing in the elitist world

802
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:41,079
inside tour and any other of your passions.

803
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,000
Has there been...

804
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,840
God, I'd love to connect with that

805
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,860
or collaborate with a particular person.

806
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,980
Is there a name that springs to mind?

807
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:50,539
I think if it was kind of like pick anyone in the world

808
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:53,599
kind of exercise, then David Attenborough.

809
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,780
I mean, I think what we want to do

810
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,239
in our tiny piece of the world in terms of our block

811
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:02,920
and regenerating that and being kind to the environment

812
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,900
is really important to us in our family

813
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,760
and in our household.

814
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:08,780
But then also at the school,

815
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,039
the school that I'm involved with,

816
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:13,719
they're on 100 acres of native bushland

817
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:17,659
and are really committed to looking after that 100 acres

818
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:19,480
and doing the right thing by that,

819
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,820
not just for this generation, but for those that come.

820
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,639
So I would just love to be able to sit down

821
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,219
and work with someone like David Attenborough

822
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:29,659
and to understand what are the things that we can do

823
00:37:29,659 --> 00:37:32,860
to actually set up ourselves and the next generation

824
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:36,199
so that we can actually do better in that space

825
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:37,820
of looking after our environment.

826
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,679
And I think in particular here in Australia

827
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:40,420
where we have...

828
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:43,599
It's such a unique set of plants and animals.

829
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:46,119
We have to work particularly hard, I think,

830
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:49,539
to make sure that we keep our environment in good shape.

831
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:51,579
So yeah, I would just love that.

832
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,159
I just could also listen to him all day.

833
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,239
I mean, he sounds wonderful.

834
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,199
It's the best voice you've ever heard, isn't it?

835
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,019
Bev, I am that full of optimism

836
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:01,000
having just spent some time with you now.

837
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:04,480
You're saving people's lives from the hardship

838
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,679
and tragedy of cancer that we've all been touched with.

839
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:08,820
And then you're looking after your piece of land

840
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,820
that's going to be, I'm sure,

841
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,780
a legacy that shows how we can be sustainable

842
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,699
and look after the native flora and fauna here in Australia.

843
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,679
It's a great pleasure to spend some time with you.

844
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,099
Congratulations on everything you're doing

845
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:20,340
and really appreciate it.

846
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:21,320
Lovely. Thanks so much.

847
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,239
And thanks for a leader.

848
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,480
Yeah, it really is absolutely awesome.

849
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:27,260
And I think I've never come across a space like that

850
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,099
where we can connect in such a genuine and real way

851
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,699
with people from such diverse backgrounds.

852
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,699
And I just, yeah, I really value it.

853
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,219
So thank you for everything you're doing.

854
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,579
