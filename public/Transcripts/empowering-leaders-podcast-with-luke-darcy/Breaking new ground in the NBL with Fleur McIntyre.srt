00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,080
I'm sure you're going to enjoy this week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,119
Fleur McIntyre is the first ever female coach in NBL history to win a championship.

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,300
She has helped guide the Sydney Kings to back-to-back championships in her first two years.

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:25,039
Fleur talks about the life-changing call she received from NBA legend Luke Longley.

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,379
She also talks about the front row seat she had recently to the debut of Victor Wimbanyana,

6
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:33,579
the number one NBA draft pick to the San Antonio Spurs.

7
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,159
The 226-centimeter French 19-year-old Fleur was working with the Spurs as a guest coach.

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,219
It's an incredible story.

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,320
Fleur McIntyre brings an incredible energy to everything she does.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,520
You're going to love this conversation.

11
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,880
And her skill of asking genuine questions and listening deeply is something that I certainly took away from her.

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,780
We love the fact that Fleur McIntyre has chosen to be part of our bespoke facilitated leadership program we call Alita Connect.

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,179
We bring together diversities.

14
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,460
We ask leaders from different backgrounds to learn, to connect and share.

15
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,120
Fleur's group includes Australian legend of sport Harry Kuehl,

16
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,159
one of the great round ball players in Australian sports history.

17
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,340
Simon Goodwin, legendary AFL player, premiership player on two occasions with the Crows

18
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,920
and now super successful premiership winning coach of the Melbourne Football Club.

19
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:22,219
Jan Sterling, Australian basketball legend.

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,079
And Andrej Borovic, the assistant coach of the Australian cricket team who comes with an outstanding reputation.

21
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,159
You don't have to be a high-profile coach to be part of it.

22
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:36,140
We love connecting with leaders from education, from small business, from the arts and from different backgrounds.

23
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:38,819
Please check out Alita Connect at alitacollective.com.

24
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:41,340
We'd love to take a call and connect with you.

25
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,780
Huge thanks as always to Jason Nicholas and his team from Temper, Australia and New Zealand.

26
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,060
The world's best in betting for enabling us to have conversations with people like Fleur McIntyre.

27
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,700
Great leaders understand the importance of great sleep.

28
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,159
And if you choose a Temper mattress, it is a mattress like no other.

29
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,219
It will change your life.

30
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,609
Fleur McIntyre is breaking news.

31
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:05,349
Breaking new ground for female coaches.

32
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:10,449
After taking a call from her friend Luke Longley, the Australian Sports Hall of Fame basketball legend

33
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,930
who won three NBA championships alongside Michael Jordan,

34
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,069
encouraging Fleur to take on an assistant coaching role with the Sydney Kings in the NBL.

35
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:22,210
The Kings have won back-to-back championships in Fleur's first two seasons

36
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,990
and Fleur has an extensive history in the high-performance world,

37
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,750
including her role as Discipline Head of Exercise and Sport Science at the University of Notre Dame in Australia.

38
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:33,650
She was recently invited by the San...

39
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,129
Antonio Spurs as a guest coach with the Spurs in the Summer League Series.

40
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,189
Fleur, you've got an incredible reputation as a great leader in Australian sport.

41
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:43,949
It's second to none and I really appreciate you joining me.

42
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:45,389
Thanks, Duff.

43
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,469
It's such an honour to be invited onto the podcast.

44
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,370
Well, how does it feel?

45
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,030
You use the term sort of pioneer and female leadership in sport in Australia.

46
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,849
Is that something that sits comfortably with you?

47
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,770
Because it does feel like you are breaking new ground.

48
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:01,469
Yeah, look, it's something that I think initially was a little bit confronting,

49
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:06,289
but I've definitely leaned into that space and I accept the responsibility

50
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:11,069
and I'm hopeful that it paves the way and at least gives confidence and eyes

51
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:12,669
for other women to walk into this space,

52
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:15,550
particularly in coaching roles in professional men's sport.

53
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,530
So I'm fully invested.

54
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,129
I really enjoy, you know, the role now.

55
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:22,729
It took me a little bit of a while to lean into,

56
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,930
but I'm really happy to do that and hopefully helping women everywhere

57
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,349
move into, you know, other areas of Australian sport.

58
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,030
Yeah.

59
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:34,930
In history to coach in the NBL here in Australia,

60
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:36,310
the first to ever win a championship.

61
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,090
Can you tell us about your friend Luke Longley picks up the phone

62
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,210
and has that conversation.

63
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,449
What was that call like and how has that changed your life?

64
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,629
Yeah, it's quite the story.

65
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:47,129
I get asked about this often.

66
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:51,069
I was, my former job, I was an associate professor at a university

67
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:56,090
working in Fremantle in Western Australia and had been there sort of 15 years

68
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,830
heading up different programs, a lecturer, a researcher,

69
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,210
and I had actually taken a voluntary,

70
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,930
I was itching for a bit of a change.

71
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,129
I loved my job.

72
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:10,050
I had the greatest job ever engaging with students and staff on campus.

73
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,930
And I just felt like the time was right for a change.

74
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,769
So took a voluntary redundancy, six months off work.

75
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,230
It was glorious, but I was spending money like no tomorrow and thought,

76
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,389
I really need a job.

77
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,149
And then out of the blue, I got a phone call,

78
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:27,810
a voice message from Luke Longley asking me to give him a call.

79
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,769
And I'd known Luke through Fremantle and Western Australian basketball,

80
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:31,069
but I hadn't heard from him.

81
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:33,410
Hadn't been connected for a few years.

82
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:36,129
And he'd actually reached out to another friend of mine,

83
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:39,829
Adam Caporn, who's currently assistant coach for the Australian Boomers and

84
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:41,209
with the Brooklyn Nets and the NBA.

85
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:44,930
And sort of Luke had been tasked with finding assistant coaches to shortlist

86
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,069
for the City Kinks and wanted someone different.

87
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:50,209
Luke tends to look at things a little bit differently.

88
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:53,550
He sort of had a list of current men in the NBL.

89
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,029
And he said to Adam, I don't want the same old.

90
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,730
I want to go a little bit different, maybe a little bit, try something new.

91
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,829
And Adam said to him, have you called Flo McIntyre?

92
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:05,230
And if you listen to Adam tell the story, he reckons Luke hung up on him right there

93
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,069
and then, didn't even say goodbye and just made a phone call.

94
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:10,329
And that was it.

95
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:12,870
So he rang me and said, what are you doing?

96
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,870
Not much.

97
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,870
I need a job.

98
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,870
And he said, oh, do you want to apply for a job with the City Kings?

99
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,129
And I'm thinking to myself, what?

100
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:23,990
You know, I was coaching a semi-professional at that time around my other job, my full-time

101
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,990
job.

102
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,089
And, you know, I applied and went through the process of the interview.

103
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:29,769
And then nine days later, I think I was offered the job as the assistant coach.

104
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:30,769
And I was like, what?

105
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:32,250
I'm going to be assistant coach of the Sydney Kings.

106
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,490
So I packed up my bags and made the move to Sydney to embrace this journey.

107
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,149
What a life-changing moment and the first two years result in two championship wins

108
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:44,290
and an incredible trajectory.

109
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,329
You mentioned your dream job that you were in, but you're looking for a change.

110
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:51,610
You've got a background in research on children and adolescents and healthy aging and their

111
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,769
development and where the intersection of mental health and wellbeing sit.

112
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:58,930
Has that helped you as a coach in your professional role?

113
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,930
Definitely.

114
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,750
I think.

115
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:05,250
The diversity of my background and my experiences, I think has helped me in really good stead

116
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,889
to make the switch over into professional sports and professional coaching.

117
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:12,790
I think, you know, there's a lot of people in professional sports and professional coaching

118
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,310
that that's all they've ever known and being in that life.

119
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,430
And that's probably a strength of theirs, but I think my diversity of experiences, I

120
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:25,449
have dealt with so many kids, adolescents, young adults, as they navigate life and deal

121
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:30,170
with different issues, different circumstances, different contexts, and I think my applicability,

122
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:36,209
to be able to reach people, to understand people, to engage in people, no matter the

123
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:41,069
circumstance and no matter what their backgrounds are, has been a real strength of mine in being

124
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:44,629
able to foster rapport and trust and connection with people.

125
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:48,449
So I feel like it's been a really positive element to me making the switch over to work

126
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,449
with the Kings.

127
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:54,389
And Fleur, it might be a great lesson to everyone out there who sits on a panel that has got

128
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:59,970
some sort of say, as Luke Longley with his history to think outside the square, and I

129
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:04,889
had a similar fortune some time ago, my old club, the Western Bulldogs, asked me to sit

130
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:05,889
on a panel.

131
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,850
Luke Beveridge ended up being appointed as the coach of the Bulldogs and had enormous

132
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,850
success.

133
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,829
And what people didn't really understand about Luke Beveridge was that he had this breadth

134
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:17,350
of experience outside of his football expertise, which was enormous.

135
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,670
He worked in the tax office at the ATO in a role where he had 150 people reporting to

136
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,670
him.

137
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:28,009
He coached amateur levels incredibly successfully from C grade to B grade to A grade.

138
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:29,009
And you're right.

139
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:29,930
Often it was.

140
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,069
You only look at one factor, but it's the range of experiences, doesn't it, that help

141
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:35,069
us whatever our role.

142
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:38,610
I think you're spot on, and it's the transferability of skills.

143
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,129
And as we flip it, we talk about athletes finishing up in their pro sports life and

144
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,649
moving to the next stage in the next chapter.

145
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:48,870
And that can be exceptionally daunting for people as they come to the end of their career.

146
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,430
But then we also know they have these unbelievable traits and characteristics and skill sets

147
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:58,629
that's been honed in a professional sports level that we encourage employers and organizations

148
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:59,629
to tap into that.

149
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,170
And that athlete mindset and those traits and characteristics, that will see them blossom

150
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,170
in other areas.

151
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,290
So I think both ways, I'm in complete agreement with you that I think if we expand the way

152
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:14,430
we look at things, we certainly keep things broad and understand that the transferability

153
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,430
I think is key.

154
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,050
And Phileo, I will jump in.

155
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,670
At some stage, I was going to talk to you about Alita Connect, a space we're really

156
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,670
passionate about.

157
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,589
And we're incredibly privileged to have you as part of an Alita Connect program.

158
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:29,649
I think you summed it up beautifully there in some ways around that cross-pollination

159
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:29,769
of skills.

160
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:33,950
You've jumped into a really fascinating group with some interesting coaches around

161
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,950
the world.

162
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,350
Harry Kuehl, one of Australia's greatest ever sportsmen, Simon Goodwin is a legend

163
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:43,169
as an Australian rules player, an extraordinary successful coach, as a premiership coach in

164
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:48,009
Melbourne and having great success, Jan Stirling, an Australian basketball legend, Andrej Borovic,

165
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:50,889
who's got a great reputation with Cricket Australia.

166
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:52,769
Have you found that space?

167
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:56,330
We call it Alita Connect, which is exactly that, getting diverse thinking together of

168
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,490
different people from different backgrounds to sort of share and learn.

169
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,669
And how's that been for you?

170
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:02,309
It's been incredible.

171
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,629
I feel very fortunate and very lucky.

172
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:10,309
You try not to be overruled walking or clicking online for the first meeting and Harry Kuehl's

173
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:14,350
in the first meeting and you're like, oh my goodness, try not to fangirl too much.

174
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:19,990
But it was so amazing, I think, just to connect with all these different people.

175
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,870
And I think people are so willing to be vulnerable and share their stories.

176
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,509
And at times, you tackle some things that you're facing and you realize through shared

177
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:29,470
experience.

178
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,950
So, you know, Goody chiming in and saying, Fleur, I've been through exactly the same

179
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,470
thing in this football context.

180
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,629
So that shared experience, I think, is one of the most powerful things.

181
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:43,370
And the capacity to connect and be able then to help and offer some solutions.

182
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:48,070
I say to Matt Wadowitz, obviously, who was our leader through it all, that it's such

183
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:53,070
almost a therapy session sometimes that you get to go on there and obviously listen.

184
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,610
You learn so much from others.

185
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,669
But there's the opportunity, I think, to say, well, I'm struggling with this and to gain

186
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:03,389
some advice and insights from these incredible people that work across different professions

187
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:08,889
and in other sports has been so invaluable to me as I tackle this journey with the City

188
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:11,429
Kings and in the National Basketball League.

189
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:17,549
And I know your contribution has been incredibly well received at their private conversations.

190
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:21,610
But I know you've been an amazing contributor and heard so much about it.

191
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,570
I haven't discussed this, but I have started a group of my own, Fleur, because I've been

192
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,570
talking about it so much.

193
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,570
And Matt, who does a great job for us, has been an amazing contributor and heard so much

194
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,570
about it.

195
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,590
And I know you've done a great job facilitating and Stacey Moorlaying, and we've been fortunate

196
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,470
enough to expand our facilitators in this space.

197
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,789
I thought, I'll talk about it all the time, I've got to do it.

198
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:37,950
And I felt exactly the same with you.

199
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,009
I got on the screen and suddenly a couple of people I'd interviewed on the podcast,

200
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:45,830
Jeff Harris from Flight Center, and talk about it in some more detail.

201
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:50,809
Ben Shuri is this incredible legendary chef from Attica and Kate Keenan has got an amazing

202
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:54,429
story and Mia Basic, and I'll go on at some stage.

203
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:58,289
But I sat there the same thing and thought, there was a vulnerability and a nervousness,

204
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:02,649
isn't it, around fronting up and going, what have I got to offer here at day one, which

205
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:05,529
is probably part of the joy of it once you get through it.

206
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:07,669
Yeah, it really is.

207
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:12,750
Just sitting there and I'm thinking to myself, two years ago, how am I sitting in this group?

208
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:17,889
I often think that to myself at times, it's the pinch me moments that I get to sit here

209
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:22,169
with Simon Goodwin and Andrej Borovic and they're sharing stories with me how they manage

210
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:23,970
and lead their programs.

211
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,309
My initial thought is, hey, you know, the first session, what am I doing here?

212
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:28,289
And then secondly, thank you.

213
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:32,850
I'm thinking, how lucky am I that I get to have this experience with these people.

214
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,210
I completely appreciate it.

215
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,210
I'm right there with you, Darcy.

216
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,570
And how lucky are they to have your wealth of experience and talk about life-changing

217
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,570
moments.

218
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,929
You're fresh back from the San Antonio Spurs Summer League.

219
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:50,789
You've been invited over there as a guest coach, an incredible story, they've recognized

220
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:57,649
your talents and I need to go to the legendary already number one draft pick, the 226 centimeter

221
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:03,710
Frenchman, Victor Wimbanyana, if I get his name right, 19 years of age, number one draft

222
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,710
pick from France.

223
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:09,590
You turn up at the Summer League and you're there as a coach in his first couple of games.

224
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,049
Tell us about that experience.

225
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:14,429
It was a circus for want of a better word.

226
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:18,409
I have never witnessed anything like it in my entire life.

227
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:20,129
He wasn't with us.

228
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:24,870
We had a couple of leading games in Sacramento, which he wasn't part of and then met us in

229
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,090
Vegas and played the first two games of Summer League.

230
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:31,929
Like, Darcy, I'm not kidding, there were people chasing our bus to games, like people

231
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:36,470
lined up on the streets and this is just Summer League NBA games, there were people hanging

232
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,230
out at the hotel.

233
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,669
Everyone was angling for a photo, a signature, whatever they could.

234
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:48,429
It was incredible to watch and every seat was filled the opening two nights that he

235
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:50,190
played at Thomas and Mac Center.

236
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:56,750
So it was like nothing else I've ever seen in terms of the hype and the star power surrounding

237
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:56,870
this game.

238
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,090
It was incredible.

239
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,090
It was incredible.

240
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,090
It was incredible.

241
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,090
It was incredible.

242
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,090
And he handled it with such grace.

243
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,429
Everyone's asked me what he was like.

244
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:08,230
He was such a lovely human being and that's sort of, I guess the reputation that the Spurs

245
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,850
have as an organization, that it's culture first and you get good people.

246
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,269
We don't care how talented you are, you've got to be a good person first.

247
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:18,950
And you could see that the moment you walked in the door in terms of the collaboration

248
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,990
within the staff, but also their players, obviously NBA players are at times put up

249
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,990
on these huge pedestals.

250
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,289
There's a lot of money that is spent.

251
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:26,330
Yeah.

252
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:26,429
Yeah.

253
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:26,470
Yeah.

254
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,529
Yeah.

255
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:26,590
Yeah.

256
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:26,649
Yeah.

257
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:26,710
Yeah.

258
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,769
Yeah.

259
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:26,789
Yeah.

260
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:26,809
Yeah.

261
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:26,830
Yeah.

262
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:26,850
Yeah.

263
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:26,870
Yeah.

264
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,909
Yeah.

265
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:27,909
Yeah.

266
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:27,970
Yeah.

267
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:28,090
Yeah.

268
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:28,190
Yeah.

269
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:28,210
Yeah.

270
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:28,250
Yeah.

271
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:28,350
Yeah.

272
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:28,450
Yeah.

273
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:28,509
Yeah.

274
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:28,669
Yeah.

275
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:28,809
Yeah.

276
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:28,870
Yeah.

277
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:34,610
But the graciousness that Victor handled himself, how he interacted with the staff, the interns,

278
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,409
his teammates was really, really nice to watch.

279
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:42,429
So I feel again, very, very lucky that I had a front row seat to his first couple of games

280
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:46,850
and just getting to be in that whole atmosphere was like nothing else I've ever seen.

281
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,029
Oh, what a brilliant experience.

282
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:54,269
And I have to ask you because I feel like there's this escalation in sport and he may be the

283
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:55,750
greatest pinnacle we've seen.

284
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,669
19 years of age.

285
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:03,110
age 226 centimeters athletic profile that we've never seen before but literally you know plays

286
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,769
whatever minutes he does in his first game and and finding his feet and the articles that were

287
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:12,669
written post that were some of the most ridiculous things i've ever seen in my life we heap a level

288
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:16,850
of pressure on young athletes you see it here in australian rules football which is getting

289
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,990
to the point where i'd call it disgraceful the level of pressure that we put on these first

290
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,950
round picks who are kids they're 19 years of age he was being called a bust it was you know from

291
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:31,529
30 minutes of summer league game time he came out in game two and shot 27 points and did whatever

292
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:36,669
he did but i mean you saw that firsthand i mean did that penetrate did that get back through the

293
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:42,830
through the walls the spurs kept a pretty tight knit around victor the entire time i mean you

294
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:47,889
can't help what people are posting on twitter and the articles that they're writing but i'm with you

295
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:54,110
i think it's absolutely ludicrous um the pressure that we put on these kids and particularly in

296
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,929
basketball when you've got a

297
00:14:55,929 --> 00:15:02,090
bigger guy so a guy who plays you know your four five and raw they they take longer to develop

298
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:06,809
they take longer to develop they're still figuring it out they're a little bit late and he's going to

299
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:11,169
take some time he's gone from you know he's a 19 year old kid going up against grown men

300
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:17,429
um so again the physicality the fatigue factor and people are judging him off one game of basketball

301
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:23,870
that's why those people aren't scouts in leagues there's reasons for that so you know making those

302
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,870
quick judgments there's a reason that you're

303
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:31,690
not out there identifying talent because you don't make those judgments off a 30 you know a three

304
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:37,750
minute window and making your pick so yeah for me it was ludicrous when i read that sort of um

305
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,309
that's the things that were being written about him and i'm so pleased in his second game that

306
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:46,230
he was able to showcase a little bit more about what he's about and he's going to be a slow burn

307
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:51,730
it's an 82 game season it is going to take its toll on this kid his first season in the nba so

308
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,769
i'm sure the spurs will have lots of strategies in place to protect him

309
00:15:55,929 --> 00:16:01,049
load management how they develop him with a long-term mindset rather than oh we've got to go

310
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:05,129
out and win the first 28 straight off the bat that's not what they're thinking they know that

311
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:09,730
it's going to be a process and they're invested in this kid long term yeah what you love about

312
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:14,129
great organizations they understand it it's the the loud voice now isn't it that takes a bit of

313
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:19,629
management and i know you'll be too humble to share too much of this but i've got a good source

314
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:24,889
that tells me the legendary greg popovich one of the great coaches in world sport wandered past

315
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:30,190
said now you're the person i hear about in australia he's having the biggest impact of

316
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:36,529
all that that must have been a nice uh little interaction i text our ceo of the kings i text

317
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:42,210
luke and i was like stick a fork in me i'm done pops just walked past me and he just acknowledged

318
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:46,309
my role with the sydney kings i'm sure matt nielsen his assistant coach who was heading up

319
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:51,549
summer league who i know really well i'd sort of said it but yeah i was done i just i was like a

320
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:55,909
day into that experience and i just said i'm done my life is made that greg bopper

321
00:16:55,929 --> 00:17:00,190
bitch looked me in the eye i knew who i was and gave me a compliment so i'm out it's officially

322
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:05,470
the pinnacle i don't know if it gets much better if it's all over tomorrow you can die happy uh

323
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,730
flair on the back of that but it's a great thing about great leaders too isn't it flair is that

324
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,750
they take the time and they realize he's as human as you and i are but to acknowledge someone is a

325
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:19,750
really powerful thing it takes a couple of seconds of his time but it has a big impact doesn't it

326
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,730
when someone takes that time absolutely and we spend a bit of time as you would know one of the

327
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:30,529
things we talk about is you know connection and collaboration and i think it's the willingness

328
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:35,569
of people leading organizations to know the people that are in the organization whether they are

329
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:39,369
interns whether they're working there whether it's your athletes whether it's your players

330
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:43,910
and i think that capacity to have those conversations and know that you know someone's

331
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:49,210
name and perhaps a little bit of their story is so important to make people feel connected

332
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,809
and part of something that's bigger than themselves so yeah it meant a lot to me and

333
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:55,910
it's something that i've noticed with a lot of leaders and i've noticed that a lot of leaders

334
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:01,589
that i've had the opportunity to be around is the time that they take to understand people and

335
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:07,710
connect with them as they go along one of those leaders uh the current mbl mvp xavier cooks who's

336
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:13,289
been a great part of the success story the kings that you have also been enormous contributor to

337
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:18,609
is it describes you as one of the most influential people in the sport of basketball what has been

338
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:24,529
the key to you having the impact you've had in such a short space of time look i think the biggest

339
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,029
thing that i've learned from working with people and i love working with people and has been i

340
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:33,910
actually find it one of my greatest joys to ask that i get the privilege every single day to go

341
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,769
to work and connect with the guys that i get to work with i think the number one thing i get asked

342
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:42,630
is what's it like being the female walking in and all i can tell you is i walked into the sydney

343
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:48,329
kings and those guys were incredible the moment i walked in with the door and i love learning about

344
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:52,970
people i ask a lot of questions i love learning about people's backgrounds and their families so

345
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,630
i think that capacity to connect

346
00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:00,049
and you know i'm really biased saves one of my favorite human beings you know i've had the

347
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:04,990
privilege of working with him for the last two years but helping zave obviously he's had a lot

348
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:10,450
of influential people on his journey but uh nothing makes my heart burst with pride than

349
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:15,730
seeing someone that you care and adore and that you've worked with go on and reach the goals um

350
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,569
that's why we're in this business you know what's your why and helping people achieve their whys and

351
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:25,910
their goals so i think i think i always know who i am and what my goals are and i think that's what i

352
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:31,490
values are and i always try to be authentic in my connections and interactions with people it's

353
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:36,529
never transactional for me i'm there for the purpose of how do i help you how do i learn more

354
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:43,410
about you and so that for me i think has been the cornerstone of me coming into this um but it's

355
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:48,390
also who i am and i've stayed true to myself um i'm just trying to be me and i've just shifted

356
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:53,930
to a different context i'm working in men's pro sport i love it flirt i love the authenticity

357
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,890
that comes out of you and as i said her

358
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:01,329
so much about you and you you can just see the energy that you would bring every day to whatever

359
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:06,509
space you are in it would make you smile and i think perhaps again it's another great lesson

360
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:10,769
isn't it is that the skill sets can look in different ways can't they they don't have to

361
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:14,930
be what it's been always in the past and you know someone with your background who brings that high

362
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:20,390
level of empathy and care as you said without transaction is incredibly worthwhile the ups and

363
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:24,970
downs of team sport and we know now the pressures we just spoke about what the number one draft

364
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:25,910
has to deal with

365
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:31,349
he's going to need that sort of empathy around him regularly isn't it do you think there's more

366
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:36,210
of a role for that in team sport that it can be a bit brutal and clinical sometimes or perhaps

367
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:42,690
those skills are maybe the most valuable i certainly do and i think that um particularly

368
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:48,730
in pro sport there is pressure that sits there and you are under a microscope and i think people

369
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,289
tend to talk to us all the time about the highs and the championships but what people don't

370
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:55,910
understand is that we are with each other six days a week for nine days a week and we're not

371
00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:01,809
months a year so i see these guys and they see me obviously at our best but we also see each other

372
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:07,549
at our absolute worst and i think it's in those moments knowing that the people that are willing

373
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:13,630
to stand alongside you to tell you the truth but tell you the truth with a care and an empathy and

374
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:17,490
knowing that i've got your back no matter what happens i'm going to push you as far as you want

375
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:23,089
to go i think that's really important and i think there's been a shift particularly from a coaching

376
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:25,910
and a leadership perspective in where sport is so i think that's really important and i think there's

377
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:30,390
um you know i've listened to your previous podcast and you've alluded to it a lot you know

378
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:35,009
it's not so much like when you were playing i know you talk about it a fair bit but no we don't talk

379
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:39,690
about that and we don't show vulnerability um but if you can't be vulnerable with the people that

380
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:44,630
care about you and that are going to be with you in the good and the bad then then how can you

381
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:49,549
progress how can you be at your absolute best and knowing that i can pick myself up tomorrow

382
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:54,589
and i can face whatever i'm facing and persevere and i'm ready to go again because i've got the

383
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:55,569
support of my leaders

384
00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:01,630
and my peers through the good and the bad and it is such a healthier space flurries and i love

385
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:06,650
talking to people like you and understanding the environs now better and the coach that you

386
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:12,849
coached alongside of chase buford who's got nba royalty as a family behind him he spoke about

387
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:17,789
you earning trust really quickly and that that was something that he valued uh it must have

388
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:23,829
been enjoyable to learn from someone with his experience as well it really was um and you know

389
00:22:23,829 --> 00:22:25,849
being around chase and as a result our

390
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:30,250
his father is the reason that i got to go to summer league you know that that connection with

391
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:35,730
the spurs um rc spoke to me after game five the championship win versus new zealand and said you

392
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:40,150
know do you want to come coach this summer um and i was like absolutely i was thinking he was a fair

393
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:46,690
few beers deep at the time when he when he asked me but i'll take it um so yeah no it was it was

394
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,789
wonderful to learn off chase and i think um you know now we've got a new head coach and i think

395
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:55,450
just that exposure to different leadership styles and different experiences and again diversity

396
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:01,809
i think adds on to my current experience and i'm just i feel very very lucky that i've gotten some

397
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:06,809
insight into the way that different people lead um and the way that they tackle you know the good

398
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:12,269
the bad adversity how we stretch this out across the season so you know it's been wonderful

399
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:17,490
it's a fantastic story and not surprised that you're having the success that you are in a range

400
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:22,650
of different areas i want to ask you these questions i'm really fascinated by your response

401
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,750
to it because it sounds like you've got as good an understanding of yourself as

402
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:31,349
one that i've spoken to in this format self-leadership is something we discuss as a

403
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:35,569
really key ingredient without that it's hard to lead others what does self-leadership mean to you

404
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:42,470
i think the capacity to reflect um and seek feedback on the things that you're doing you

405
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:48,569
know i'm really lucky that i have luke um who is really willing to give me feedback um he watches

406
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:53,569
a lot of our training sessions and the way i coach so i'm always seeking you know i have an

407
00:23:53,569 --> 00:23:55,910
idea in my head and i reflect but it's nice to get that feedback and i think that's a really good

408
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:59,890
way to get that feedback from people that are watching me coach um understanding from the

409
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:04,990
players the things that they need um and as i keep evolving and growing things that i could

410
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:09,329
perhaps do better on this leadership journey and things where i'm i'm strong but there's the

411
00:24:09,329 --> 00:24:14,509
capacity for me to grow so the self-leadership for me is obviously looking internally and being

412
00:24:14,509 --> 00:24:20,210
able to reflect but i also seek opinions from people that um you know are important to me

413
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:25,289
uh so luke and our new coach makhmud like my peers daniel kickett that i get to coach with

414
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,250
their feedback on things that they think i'm doing well and things that i can prove and also

415
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:35,430
the players that i'm working with so self-leadership for me is taking on some ownership of looking at

416
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:40,650
yourself um and attempting to grow not just staying you know stationary where you are always

417
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:46,609
being willing to move forward change things up uh show some initiative innovation and go from there

418
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:51,730
and often people overlook that don't they you've got a you know friendship with luke longley

419
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:55,910
uh and an opportunity to to be able to take on board someone who's had a

420
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:01,509
fairly extensive history in the game that you're uh looking to get the best results you possibly

421
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:07,049
get do you do that in a formal way or is it informal with luke yeah so interestingly enough

422
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:12,690
sunday morning luke when luke comes to sydney you know he he shares an apartment apartment with me

423
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:16,609
and it was sunday morning and we had the day off and he said right i want to have a discussion

424
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:22,630
about this and i was like oh my god it's a sunday morning like turn it off um but i need that push

425
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:31,490
here into your soul and drag information out of you which is a special gift i tell him that all the

426
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:37,029
time um but it's good for me because it causes me to self-reflect and it makes me ask questions of

427
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:42,329
myself of not just what i'm doing now but what my vision is for the future and where i see this

428
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:47,410
going so i don't have to have all the answers but he forces me to probe in my own head what that

429
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:53,589
might look like and if you haven't uh seen luke longley's uh story on australian story go to abc

430
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:01,690
of the sort of human being luke longley is we all saw him winning nba championships but uh got a

431
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:06,410
deep understanding of just the big-hearted human being that that he is how do you go about

432
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,250
positively impacting others on a daily basis you come from an academic background where you've got

433
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:15,609
a huge amount of research really in this space how about practically on a day-to-day basis have

434
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:21,970
you gone about that so i'm pretty energetic das as you can probably tell from this from this podcast

435
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,769
i think that um you bring in the energy that you put out

436
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:30,109
i can't ask these guys for positive energy if i'm not i'm not giving the same out so

437
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:36,170
i pride myself is that um having that impact daily my sort of mantra is be where your feet are so

438
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:41,890
whatever's going on in my life when i set foot at the kings and i'm with those guys and i'm with

439
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:47,230
running an individual workout or a team practice i am in that moment in the here and now i'm not

440
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:52,549
worrying about anything else and that those people that i'm interacting with are my sole focus so

441
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:55,769
they know that hopefully my authenticity and my

442
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:02,630
engagement is with them um and so i think again those conversations those little sections i think

443
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:07,589
are really important in positively impacting people's lives i tend to ask a lot of questions

444
00:27:07,589 --> 00:27:13,269
um i you know you spend so much time with people you know all about their families and you know um

445
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:17,390
what's going on in their lives so i always make sure that i'm asking those questions and i'm

446
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:21,869
checking up on them so that they know that you know i'm engaged in their life and they know that

447
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:25,869
if they've got anything going on i i hope that they know that they can come to me and share so

448
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:30,250
those are some of the things that i do to positively impact when i first went to the kings

449
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:35,190
um my morning ritual i'm a huge coffee drinker and there's not a lot of coffee drinkers at the

450
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:40,809
kings which is most disappointing um but my number one thing was i used to bring in my own coffee i'm

451
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:46,190
a bit of a coffee snob to the club um and i started my morning ritual with like sean bruce

452
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:50,609
and angus glover and we'd all have a coffee together that was our connection um sort of

453
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:55,849
sharing a cup of coffee so i think those little moments aren't so little in the big

454
00:27:55,930 --> 00:28:00,789
scheme of things i think to sit down be in that moment whether it's sharing a cup of coffee or

455
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:05,349
whatever it is that you're doing there's ways that you can positively impact people's lives

456
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:09,049
just by sitting there and taking the moment and being present with the people that you're with

457
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:15,230
be where your feet are i love that it's uh it's a great mantra and a great reminder isn't it to

458
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:20,349
have your head where you are at the time i mean you you've got an energy that's uh

459
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:25,789
hard to miss and is that been you from a young age is that something you've had to work on i

460
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:30,869
do meet people that that's hard you just see them a little more down and their heads dropped is

461
00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:35,970
that something that you've taught yourself or you like this from day one always be like it to be

462
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:42,849
honest i think as i've gotten older and wiser and more life experience i think you realize that i

463
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:48,150
think having gratitude um and finding joy in in what you do there's so many things that happen

464
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:52,730
that are so unfortunate there's so many people struggling with different things so i always try

465
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,910
to you know my values are that i try and find joy in things that i've done and i've done a lot of

466
00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:00,690
i do and i'm always grateful um for the opportunities that i'm presented with for

467
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:05,650
the people that i get to be surrounded by so i think that underpins my kind of positive energy

468
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:11,750
and um you know i can't walk out on court and not give these guys the energy that i'm expecting back

469
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:17,150
from them so for me it's kind of putting it out there and hoping that you know it comes back so

470
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:20,829
i like to think i've always had it but maybe it's just getting older and wiser and

471
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:25,910
uh figuring it out as i go along well you're a five-time mvp in your own right you had an

472
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:31,210
incredible success story in your academic career and then amazing success in this chapter it doesn't

473
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:36,970
happen by accident i imagine have you gone about creating and sharing your vision for the success

474
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:42,970
that you've had yeah it's an interesting one i think that it's often hard it's not something

475
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:47,369
that i think about a lot of the time it's often when you get to go do the podcast and i get to go

476
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:52,930
out and talk to people and do keynotes that you have the opportunity um so i think understanding

477
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,690
that i do harness a little bit of responsibility

478
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:01,210
i think to pay it forward so any chance i get to be able to create and see a vision where

479
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:06,230
i'm empowering other women to feel like this is a space that they can step into whether that's

480
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:11,170
with confidence or perhaps a vision to our organization or other organizations across the

481
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:17,089
mbl to perhaps be a little bit more open-minded about the spaces that they're willing to open up

482
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:21,829
in leadership for women to enter into so that's something i'm really passionate about in terms

483
00:30:21,829 --> 00:30:25,910
of my vision and i think my current role in terms of looking forward to the future of the

484
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:26,230
organization and i think that's something i'm really passionate about in terms of looking forward to the future of the organization

485
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:31,029
i'd be lying if i didn't think about what would i look like if i was leading a program so i've had

486
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:36,730
the privilege of of learning under chase and now makhmud um and i'm taking notes and figuring it

487
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:41,890
out and watching these two great leaders empower their support staff and their coaching staff and

488
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:46,769
i think for me that's sort of figuring out in my own head how would that look for me going forward

489
00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:51,849
how would i interact with the organization how am i going to manage my players how does it look

490
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:55,829
rather than going just the x's and o's in my mind how am i

491
00:30:55,829 --> 00:30:55,910
going to manage my players how does it look rather than going just the x's and o's in my mind how am i

492
00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:01,950
sharing how i want our values to look and as a result impact our organization and community so

493
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:06,529
that's something i'm still tinkering with in my head but it's an ongoing process

494
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:11,369
and i love you putting that out there flair and i would love to see that happen and even from

495
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:16,589
this small interaction with you i've got no doubt that you'll be an extraordinary success so

496
00:31:16,589 --> 00:31:21,930
i can see uh the process is underway and i'll watch on with great interest curiosity is something

497
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:25,809
matt what do it's and i are a bit obsessed with and we see that so many people are

498
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:30,130
curious and through that they approach their learning and development through that lens is that

499
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:35,430
a word that resonates with you curiosity it absolutely does as i've mentioned a couple of

500
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:41,750
times i love learning about people and i think from my research background uh curiosity underpins

501
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:47,450
everything in research you're trying to always seek answers and whether that's from reading and

502
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:52,390
listening uh going and attending different research conferences there is an innate curiosity

503
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:55,690
to find the solution to things and typically

504
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:59,950
the solution always shifts you know that's research that's why research changes that's why

505
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:04,589
you know our ideals and what we know is constantly evolving because people are curious and they're

506
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:09,690
trying to seek answers um and that sort of innovation is i think incredibly interesting

507
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:14,910
to me and as a result i'm just naturally curious i i've you know i've said i ask a lot of questions

508
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:20,529
i think when i get to know people um i want to understand people's why and their backgrounds and

509
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:25,609
i think having that capacity to engage with people um asking questions

510
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:30,569
as you get to know them engaging with them i think again builds that trust and rapport so

511
00:32:30,569 --> 00:32:37,190
i'm naturally very curious i i read a lot i'm an absolute nerd like i read every single night

512
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:42,730
um i listen to a lot of different things i'm always sort of flitting around i'm just so curious

513
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:48,930
with lots of different angles and avenues so for me curiosity has been such a huge underpinning of

514
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:54,369
who i am in academia and then transferring through to pro sport and fleur i love that you've mentioned

515
00:32:54,369 --> 00:32:55,789
that a number of times isn't it when you sit down and you're like oh my god i'm so curious and i'm

516
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:59,230
down with someone they're asking questions and finding out about their family and their

517
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:03,809
background and what's happening in their life and you know why the same as you everyone has

518
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:08,849
got an interesting story when you ask the second question or the third question we've all got stuff

519
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:16,089
going on and you know ultimately we're hardwired to be connected and we're supposed to have those

520
00:33:16,089 --> 00:33:21,089
interactions and you see when they're removed people don't live long lives really when you put

521
00:33:21,089 --> 00:33:25,789
them in isolation but the opportunity's there all the time i feel like we're losing that skill you've

522
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:31,410
got it you keep mentioning it it's not that you're trying to brag about it's just who you are and i'm

523
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:35,809
fascinated with that because it's it's a free hit people listening you can actually just sit down and

524
00:33:35,809 --> 00:33:41,230
it doesn't matter who it is it can be a random person you meet it doesn't have to be someone

525
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,250
you've known your whole life and even then you can actually people are married to people they

526
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:50,490
don't really even ask enough questions sometimes it's it's a strange thing i think isn't it it is

527
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:55,069
and i think the capacity and what i've learned as i've got older in this sort of leadership space is

528
00:33:55,809 --> 00:34:00,049
leaders aren't always the talkers they're the greatest listeners and i think being able to ask

529
00:34:00,049 --> 00:34:06,089
questions and then actually listen to people's responses is a really important skill um particularly

530
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:11,190
as you sort of you know just being a good human being but also in the leadership capacity as well

531
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:15,469
yeah it's great for them you know is it when someone's asking that question because they're

532
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:20,630
ticking your box and they're not really listening you immediately know it goes straight through to

533
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:24,550
the keeper and you make a brilliant point there isn't a listening part it's huge communicating

534
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,670
with clarity i can see

535
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:28,449
he's a great skill of yours have you put some thought into it

536
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:36,289
i do try to be really direct in terms of how i communicate i also make sure that i'm open

537
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:41,190
to questions from from athletes and staff as well when i'm explaining something i remember always

538
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:45,829
growing up but you often had certain leaders that you were too afraid to ask a question to

539
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:51,769
or if you didn't understand something so that's not who i am i want to make sure that i have open

540
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:55,789
and honest communication with my athletes and my peers but it also is the other way around

541
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:59,969
so i'm always trying to be the other way as well that if i haven't been direct or provided clarity

542
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:05,110
that they feel comfortable enough that they can ask me and seek guidance on something so i do tend

543
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:11,849
to make sure that i'm directing what i say i definitely am quite conscious of as well my tone

544
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:18,190
i think at times again i've been in spaces where messages are relayed uh they can be condescending

545
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:21,969
they can be sarcastic and again i think that falls flat when you're trying to build trust and

546
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:26,250
rapport with people these are people's careers that we're talking about um and it's high pressure

547
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:32,829
situations so i think if you're honest and direct people might always not might not always love you

548
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:36,389
know that they're getting called out of the accountability but i think when it comes from

549
00:35:36,389 --> 00:35:41,889
a place of honesty and care people are very open to it they'd rather that than mixed messages

550
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:47,690
and creating that mistrust and feeling like they're being attacked if the tone isn't right

551
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:52,929
in that clarity of the message yeah it's another great lesson uh fleur and i totally respect that

552
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:58,210
isn't it it's harder sometimes it feels like at the time but people pick up on if you're not really

553
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:02,809
being transparent isn't it if you've got a reputation for that it just becomes easy isn't

554
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:06,849
it you go well i'm dealing with fleur i know i'm going to know exactly where i stand at any

555
00:36:06,849 --> 00:36:13,469
given point in time how important has collaboration been for you huge uh particularly working for this

556
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:17,670
space but i've come from a space as well where you know at the university and working

557
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,849
at the university i have had students to deal with i've got staff i've got collaborators

558
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:27,409
on research projects so i've come from that real collaboration space i worked at an organization

559
00:36:27,409 --> 00:36:32,869
in the university which was very small so we were so dependent on each other in each department we

560
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:37,929
knew that we couldn't function in a silo it had to be a collaborative effort if we were ever going

561
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:43,610
to be successful um in underlying our processes and to achieve the outcomes that we needed um

562
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,650
and i've taken that with me and i think that again walking into the king's

563
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:52,809
space i remember working in my first day and i just took a deep breath i thought what am i

564
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:58,590
doing i have no idea how this is going to go um and i've had nothing but collaboration

565
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:04,130
from the organization i have great relationships with our front office um and then we've got

566
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:07,869
obviously our performance and our medical staff the players and the coaching staff and

567
00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:12,889
it doesn't work if people aren't willing to work together and listen to each other you know there's

568
00:37:12,889 --> 00:37:17,650
always people that have got to lead each areas but everything falls over if there's not a

569
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:22,530
willingness to listen to each other to communicate and then where whatever happens whether we're in

570
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:27,510
an office having a discussion we don't agree at the end of the day we make a decision we walk

571
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:32,070
out of that office onto the court and we're together we're together in everything whatever

572
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:37,769
happens i've got my moods back i've got kicks back i've got my players back but you know through the

573
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:43,289
highs and lows if you're not totally with each other and you can you can disagree um and everyone's

574
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:47,550
going to have different opinions but at the end of the day it's a willingness to listen and to share

575
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:52,630
and then ultimately when we walk out on that court as the sydney kings we're one and we're ready to go

576
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:58,389
that's what great organizations do you sum that up beautifully isn't it it's uh the melting pot of

577
00:37:58,389 --> 00:38:03,369
discussion and debate but ultimately once you do you get on the same page and you win and lose

578
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:08,570
together and you keep that trust and openness not surprised you're part of an organization that has

579
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:12,610
had the success it's had in the last couple of years who's been the greatest leader in your life

580
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:17,530
oh goodness me i should i should be prepared for this question

581
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:22,750
i've listened to all the other podcasts and here i'm sitting here absolutely stumped i've been

582
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:29,610
privy to an enormous amount of wonderful leaders um at my university life i was very very lucky in

583
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:33,989
that i always had female leaders which is very very unusual um our vice chancellor was a leader

584
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:39,829
my two department heads were were females as well our bc was a female um so they had an enormous

585
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:45,130
role in shaping me to understand that i could do whatever i wanted to do what i wanted to be as

586
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:47,650
well so um they had a huge impact on me and i'm very proud of them and i'm very proud of them

587
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:54,269
um and i think ultimately my parents as well if i come to my family um they've always been so

588
00:38:54,269 --> 00:39:00,530
wonderfully supportive um watching my parents and how they support their kids um their willingness

589
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:05,909
to always do anything for us you know the people that they look after and love i think has been a

590
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:12,329
staple in uh the leadership and that i hope to inspire i give that same love forward i had the

591
00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:16,349
experience going for a walk with my wife beck and she said you love asking the questions she started

592
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:17,650
firing a few of those back at me and i'm like oh my god i'm so proud of you and i'm so proud of you

593
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:22,449
and i was the same i was like actually it's a lot easier asking someone else than uh than putting

594
00:39:22,449 --> 00:39:27,869
your own uh words to it but uh your answers have been uh absolutely brilliant and full of honesty

595
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:34,769
as uh as i would have expected uh you said before your greg popovich uh interactions uh that's it

596
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:39,909
put a fork in you but if you can collaborate with anyone on anything is there another name is there

597
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:45,909
another uh person that jumps out at you to be honest if i could coach with pop that would be

598
00:39:45,909 --> 00:39:47,550
really interesting the man has

599
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:53,530
so much experience i would love the opportunity to pick his brain and just be part of his circle

600
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:59,750
to see how he operates um obviously he has had such a huge part in this spurs culture you know

601
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:05,650
the spurs are regarded as you know the poster of where people want to be in in the nba so pop is

602
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:11,610
definitely one i think in the female space again someone that works under pop is becky hammond is

603
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:17,650
doing amazing things in the wmba she worked for poppers in san antonio spurs as an assistant and

604
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:23,250
then has gone on to head coach the las vegas aces so i hear incredible things about her capacity and

605
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:28,289
interactions with players as well so she'd be she'd be someone and i don't have a name but i

606
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:35,150
think that if i wasn't in sport i'm hugely passionate about social justice issues um so

607
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:39,869
you know that was my background as well in exercise sport science so if i could work with

608
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:45,289
people in the space of um you know helping groups that perhaps aren't as privileged and facing

609
00:40:45,289 --> 00:40:47,650
challenges that um that you know we're not going to be able to do that um so i think that's a really

610
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:52,010
we're not used to and and really helping them working with anyone in that space i think would

611
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:56,869
