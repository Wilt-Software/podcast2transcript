1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:11,000
The Australian Boomers basketball team were an incredible story

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,660
of inspiration and success in winning the bronze medal

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,420
at the Tokyo Olympics, achieving a first in Australian basketball history.

4
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:20,820
As a coach, how do you adapt your leadership style

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,940
in a way that supports a group of players

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,359
who have already established an environment destined for success?

7
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,370
G'day, it's Luke Darcy.

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,229
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

9
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:35,969
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

10
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,909
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

11
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,649
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

12
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:44,810
in education, sport, industry and the arts

13
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,770
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

14
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,250
where everyone has a voice.

15
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,810
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

16
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:13,590
I was joined by Australian Olympic basketball coach Brian Gorgian

17
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,189
to discuss how he positively impacts his environment

18
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:18,629
by listening to his players and coaches,

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,049
how sharing and community are important

20
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:21,150
to his team and his team-mates.

21
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,129
And we get an insight into Paddy Mill's great leadership style as captain.

22
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,239
Well, this is a great pleasure to speak to a man

23
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,659
who has had incredible success on every measure

24
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,480
as a leader and as a coach.

25
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:37,920
He's coached over 500 wins at a success rate of 70%,

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,620
which is just an extraordinary coaching record.

27
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,719
He's a six-time NBL champion coach here in Australia in the basketball,

28
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:46,780
a six-time NBL coach of the year.

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,060
In over a 20-year period, Brian Gorgian finished no worse

30
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,939
than a semi-final level every season in a row.

31
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:56,000
For 20 seasons, including 12 grand finals.

32
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,319
Remarkable achievement.

33
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,159
He's fresh from coaching the Australian Boomers

34
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,340
to their first ever Olympic medal.

35
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,939
It was an extraordinary moment.

36
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,079
Brian Gorgian joins me.

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,959
He's in Howard Springs.

38
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,480
He's quarantining his way back through.

39
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,120
Gord, you gave Australians so much joy, mate.

40
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:09,620
Congratulations.

41
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,300
It was a remarkable moment.

42
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,539
No, thank you.

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,860
It's, yeah, we're in Darwin.

44
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:19,319
I got about three or four of the guys down next to me

45
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,639
sitting in bungalows.

46
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,340
We're side by side.

47
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,080
And it's one of those things where you get up in the morning each day

48
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,259
and stick your fist up with your coffee in the morning.

49
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,719
We get fresh air here, which is a real positive.

50
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,500
We get to go outside during our quarantine.

51
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,060
And I think one of the things that just the thoughtful to this all

52
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,580
is to make sure you enjoy it.

53
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,580
And we all know it was something special, something we're proud of.

54
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:52,039
And it was, we knew Australia was following us.

55
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,319
And we knew Australia was following us.

56
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,340
And, yeah, just really excited about everything about it.

57
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,379
Gord, you've got to ask you in a moment about the leadership of Joe Ingalls

58
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:02,560
and Paddy Mills in particular.

59
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,460
It was just extraordinary leadership.

60
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,759
But I want to go back a little bit to you coming across.

61
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,000
You were born in Glendale, California.

62
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,300
You went to Crescenta Valley High School and Pepperdine University in Malibu.

63
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:17,099
You come out and you said you play under Lindsay Gaze

64
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,860
and you're the captain of the first Melbourne Tigers NBL team back in 1984.

65
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,819
Your love for Australian sport as a young American growing up

66
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:28,759
and your connection to Australia, what makes Australian sport special

67
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:32,740
for an island of 25 million people that tends to punch above its weight?

68
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,639
You've observed Australian sport a lot.

69
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,939
What sets it apart?

70
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,300
I mean, you know, culture is a difficult word.

71
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:41,259
It really is.

72
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,699
And it encompasses a lot.

73
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,479
Teamship encompasses a lot.

74
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:50,039
But I came from an environment where there was much more a mindset

75
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,379
in American sport.

76
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:54,960
About starting right from the elite.

77
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,180
You know, when you're a kid on the playground, when you're in fifth grade,

78
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,800
100 kids try out for the team and 10 make it.

79
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:07,039
The other 90, I was asked in Australia, well, what happens to a guy in fifth grade

80
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,039
that gets cut?

81
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:09,280
What do the other 90 do?

82
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,479
They go do another sport.

83
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,419
If you miss that out, you know, join the band.

84
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:15,039
You're out.

85
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,560
Where I came back to Australia, came to Australia, you know, at night,

86
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,199
the ANZ bankers are playing.

87
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,560
We're off the court.

88
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,000
We're the pro team and we're off court night at Albert Park because the bankers are playing.

89
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:30,819
I mean, everyone, you know, it encompassed everybody.

90
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,839
Many more people were involved.

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It was much more cutthroat in the States is what I'm trying to say.

92
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:39,759
And then you go to when you get to those higher levels,

93
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,899
gets basically to say, if you get along, great.

94
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:49,540
If you don't, give me your 15 points and 10 rebounds and just bring your bag and do your job.

95
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,139
And when I came to Australia.

96
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:56,879
Right from the beginning, meeting Lindsay Gaze with, you know, I said, I come in,

97
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,000
he's a national coach.

98
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,699
I expect this guy with a tremendous ego that you, you get to talk to every now and then,

99
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,879
and just, you know, demands respect.

100
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:14,779
Lindsay just under, you know, under 18s, under 20s mop the court before he took us at three

101
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:18,759
o'clock would play if we needed another player in it.

102
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:19,759
Absolutely.

103
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,680
No ego.

104
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:26,379
Only cared about the team and taught team basketball and the guys that, you know, I arrived

105
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:32,240
there, the guy I play ahead of invites me to his house for Christmas and I've got a present under

106
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,699
the tree.

107
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:40,660
I was just, it just, as you go forward now, 400 Australian kids playing in America right now,

108
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,160
and some are attracted to, you know, certain coaches have a lot of Australians on their team.

109
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,779
And I remember one incident where a guy said, you know,

110
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:53,160
I want it, your team's doing really well.

111
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:55,639
I want to get into this concept of your play.

112
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,899
And the guy says, before we do that, it's not really about the concept of play.

113
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,439
It's about the Aussies.

114
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,579
They care about each other.

115
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,100
They practice hard.

116
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,459
They're about team.

117
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:09,360
A good example of that.

118
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:15,360
And I'm proud of was, was the boomers accomplishment and how the boomers had been over the last

119
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,600
period of time.

120
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,120
And now everyone through the names of those NBA players.

121
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,540
And through the profile of basketball right now, they're, they're becoming visual.

122
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,240
The Olympics was such a gift for so many people around the world and here in Australia,

123
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,879
lots of people facing lockdown and the stories were incredible and emotive.

124
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:39,920
But for me, I genuinely feel like you and the boomers captured that mood almost in a way that

125
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,600
very few sporting teams have had.

126
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,839
And I'm assuming you've heard this, but I'd needed to play it again because the great Andrew

127
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,740
Gay is a five-time Olympian himself.

128
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,879
And the Gay's family are basketball royals.

129
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,920
Boy, it's in Australia and they're, they're closely linked to you too, Gorge.

130
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,379
But I thought Andrew's reaction, the moment you won the bronze medal was, was something

131
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:57,959
to savor.

132
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,500
And I just want to play it to you and I want to get your thoughts listening to Andrew Gay's

133
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,300
and how much, what you achieved meant to him.

134
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,019
But when you're in there and you're in the trenches and you see that resilience being

135
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:13,639
rewarded in this way, and it hasn't been for a long, long period of time.

136
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:19,779
So for me, selfishly, I feel a part of it.

137
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
You should feel part of it.

138
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,439
You should.

139
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,939
You should feel a significant part of this, mate.

140
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:24,879
And to see Paddy and the boys.

141
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,560
Come on.

142
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,699
We're so, Australia is so thrilled for you.

143
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:35,680
I mean, it's, um, it's going to be quite emotional tonight, Lise.

144
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,680
This country loves you, mate.

145
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,980
You were there in 88.

146
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,959
You were there in 96.

147
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,240
You were there in 2000 when you got to this stage.

148
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,660
They're beautiful journeys.

149
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,680
You don't have to win a medal to have a beautiful journey.

150
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
And it's about what we want to stand for.

151
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,199
In representing Australia and representing this sport.

152
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,319
And I think of those that have been along for the journey that have their DNA on this.

153
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:06,879
You know, there's so many that you look back on that toiled when you don't get a cent for

154
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,480
playing the game.

155
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,639
When you're building stadiums, you're building a sport, you're trying to generate it.

156
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:19,000
And for me, I am so grateful that, and it is tough.

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,600
But I'm...

158
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,680
Incredibly grateful that before the game, I called on my dad.

159
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,939
Yeah, I want to know how that ends.

160
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:33,700
And just to hear him talk about what this means to the sport and the humility and nothing

161
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:40,620
to do with him, just about how this is going to be good for Australia and Australian basketball

162
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,419
and another tangible bit of evidence to say that we have arrived as a sport, both our

163
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:47,399
men and women.

164
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,399
And he started when there was...

165
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:57,379
200 registered players and he toured away as a coach and an administrator to build facilities,

166
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:00,840
propagate the game, take it to the people.

167
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,620
And the whole way, it was about the Olympics.

168
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,639
The values of the Olympics, the spirit of competition were instilled in me at a very

169
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,820
early age.

170
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:17,039
And it's all about getting on that podium and showing the friendship and love and making

171
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,440
sure that you do the right thing by the game.

172
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,120
And the nation and the pride that comes in pulling on a green and gold jersey.

173
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,940
What you hear there, I know I've got a voice like this, but my history goes back that far.

174
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,840
You know, when I arrived in Australia, Lindsay brought me over and he was my coach and he

175
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,740
was the national coach at that time.

176
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:45,679
And Andrew Gaze, my last year of playing, you know, we played together and staunch rivalries

177
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,600
all the way through my coaching career.

178
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,240
A deep respect.

179
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:56,080
And even going prior to that, Lindsay's mentor, Ken Watson, you know, Ken Cole.

180
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,480
I mean, all these people, all these people that have such pride.

181
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:06,700
And you've got to remember in our sport, we've been in a constant battle to survive.

182
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,320
You know, you've got, you know, I always say when I was in China or when I'm talking to

183
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,960
the people from Japan today, you know, what it means to our country as a sport.

184
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,460
Andrew talks about it.

185
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:25,220
And his father, the battle we were in to compete, to have a competition, to have a

186
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,779
pro league.

187
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:31,480
You know, you've got Australian rules football, you've got rugby, you've got cricket, you've

188
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,580
got all these sports.

189
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,960
And now in this event, all eyes are on basketball.

190
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,139
And there started to be some momentum with the growth of the NBL.

191
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:48,179
With now we've got NBA players and a lot of work's been done.

192
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:48,440
Over.

193
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,980
For a lot of years.

194
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,960
And this was, it's not something that this team just did.

195
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,940
It was a process of a lot of bodies and a lot of hard work by a lot of people to build

196
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,899
to this crescendo.

197
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:09,740
And it makes my skin, you know, I just, yeah, my hair, my three hairs that I got on my head

198
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:15,320
stand on end when I hear his voice, because I felt that going into the game.

199
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,259
We knew the nation was watching.

200
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,340
We knew we had a responsibility.

201
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:26,299
You know, you can't always win, but it was our time and, but you can put on the floor

202
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:27,299
that.

203
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:28,299
Culture.

204
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:33,100
I thought, you know, right from the start of the game that was there and it kind of

205
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,259
relaxed me during the game.

206
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:41,340
The other aspect of this Luke is that Patty mills, Joe down the road in their career,

207
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:46,220
but they were definitely on board with all this and driving it.

208
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,059
It wasn't just about the presence.

209
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:53,820
There was a lot of work by Patty and Joe and that leadership group to acknowledge the

210
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,019
gazes, the bogus pro going back to 1964 team.

211
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:03,820
We had on our wall, all the players that have ever played from the boomers on plaques, making

212
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:10,059
sure that the young guys Tybalt and Josh green and Josh Giddey were aware of the history.

213
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:16,019
So they did a great job of, of that and making the current boomers and a lot of young guys

214
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,019
that haven't.

215
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:21,899
They wouldn't know Lindsay that in that form and making sure they were educated and knew

216
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,480
it was at stake.

217
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
They're becoming visual.

218
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,899
You had an extraordinary captain who was part of that legacy and sums up everything you

219
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:33,840
said Gorge in Patty mills and all of those qualities you speak about for those that didn't

220
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,179
know Patty mills before the Olympics, you got to see this extraordinary leader, a young

221
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:41,980
boy of indigenous and Torres Strait Islander background.

222
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,419
You know, I say young boy, cause I remember him as a 15 year old when he was maybe the

223
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:47,019
greatest.

224
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:51,220
NFL player of his age at 15 and we were waiting to see him come through and play the game

225
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,220
that I love.

226
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,960
And he went on a clearly this path and said, extraordinary, describe to me the captain

227
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,259
that you had and the leadership qualities of Patty mills.

228
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:00,259
Boy.

229
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:05,259
I mean, it, one, it's, it's a blessed that, that, I mean, a unique scenario for me to,

230
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:12,519
to be a part of the boomers when he just joined in Beijing at 18, nine year old, virtually

231
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,120
young kid.

232
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,480
And to see that.

233
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
Man.

234
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:25,419
That kid at that age, and now come back 12 years later and see what's transpired.

235
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:31,279
Sometimes you have to have a role and steer the thing and, and, and start the culture.

236
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,480
And, and I mean, what I'm trying to say is when I walked in the gym in Irvine, the first

237
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:43,379
two days, I didn't say anything, the flags on the wall, the music being played gold vibes

238
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:45,639
only all of this stuff.

239
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,379
I said, it was a drop.

240
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:47,379
It was a drop in center.

241
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:53,120
I go, I got to take this in for two days before I run my mouth and his leadership and Joe's

242
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,320
leadership were so strong.

243
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,000
I honestly changed my whole coaching persona for these games.

244
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,659
And I know that sounds strange, but it's like, I'm going to take a lesser voice in this.

245
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:10,179
I'm going to run it more like the Australian rules football, more like a soccer team, more

246
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:16,259
managerial, just sit on the top of this, have lesser of a voice and let these guys.

247
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:17,259
Be them.

248
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:19,639
Let these guys be the voice of the team.

249
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:26,759
It was that strong and his respect, as I said, and his, his push, not only for the past that

250
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:33,840
we've just talked about, but the present, the present was gold vibes only and gold vibes

251
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,539
only was a standard of today of excellence for everything that you did.

252
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:40,759
It wasn't the metal.

253
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,259
It was about when you walk through the door, the music being played, that it's an Australian

254
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,259
music.

255
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:52,559
The food that's being, that's being fed Milo there's a Lamington's there's there's, you know,

256
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:57,159
Aussie pies, there's pasties, the socks that you wore the gear.

257
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:01,059
There's no mistake in the color of the top it's gold.

258
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:02,159
It's forest green.

259
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,360
It's the proper green.

260
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,259
There's no, you know, we, we were, everything was gold standard.

261
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:12,960
The practice session had to be gold standard, the effort gold standard.

262
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,559
And that was driven by him.

263
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,159
And then.

264
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,659
The last part of this is the future.

265
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:24,860
So again, I've been a part of the boomers where in, in Sydney, when I took over all

266
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,759
of them stayed a longer period of time and they all retired at the same time, you start

267
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,759
from zero.

268
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,159
It takes six years to start this.

269
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:35,940
So he touched Josh Giddey.

270
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,659
He touched Josh green.

271
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:39,460
He touched Matisse title.

272
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,759
He touched wreath do up.

273
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,460
And in that these guys now understand the culture.

274
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:52,960
Understand leadership, understand the past, understand the now, and that is so valuable.

275
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,960
And again, I could see this.

276
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,059
I could sense this.

277
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:01,960
And it gave me an opportunity to take a step back and let them do their thing.

278
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,860
What a great summation gorge of, of what you saw firsthand.

279
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,860
And, and just, you know, Joe's leadership and Patty's language.

280
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,360
He referenced his uncle, Danny, the second ever indigenous Australian to represent Australia.

281
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,159
The Olympics, he touched on the past great players, as you said, and I didn't understand

282
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,960
that he's also got an eye to the future of Australia.

283
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,299
This is a prophetic leader, isn't he?

284
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:30,500
And in lots of ways to, to have that vision and understanding and, and what it means is

285
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,500
quite incredible for you to walk into that environment.

286
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,019
Was that hard for you at your stage, you clearly got a way of doing things.

287
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:41,820
Did you walk in and then really have to say, I'm changing my style here.

288
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,659
This has got an energy about it.

289
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:44,860
I'm backing away from what I'd normally do.

290
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,960
Was that, was that a challenge for you?

291
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,299
Uh, no, no, it was exciting for me.

292
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:53,539
I don't look at it as challenging, but I was aware of it.

293
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:58,799
I was, I could see and how the team had played prior that there was a strong presence of

294
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,799
team ship.

295
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:07,279
And I had discussions with that leadership group in leading into taking the job and going

296
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:12,960
into this drop-in center, but the impact of it in the power of it, when you first walked

297
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,660
in the gym, took me back.

298
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:21,000
And honestly, um, you know, I'm not exaggerating and I had guys come up to me and said, man,

299
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,119
you know, on the middle, at the end of the second day, after the practice was over, one

300
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:30,599
of the managers came up to me and said, God, we were all waiting for you to say something.

301
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:36,339
You haven't said anything for, you know, it was very noticeable to them, but I was trying

302
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:42,339
to make a statement of, you know, um, I didn't want to step on it and you gotta make, when

303
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:44,660
it's going like that, you gotta make sure.

304
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,660
You're competent.

305
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,859
You're in the, you know, you're going where you need to go and you're not just, there

306
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:57,980
was no room for air and, uh, it was moving, uh, honestly, it was, uh, they were spot on

307
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:04,220
it, spot on it leading to the next phase of it, which was the culture night.

308
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:10,700
And then leading to the, there was steps and they thought about it, knew what they were

309
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,700
doing.

310
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,599
And, uh, that also enabled me to spend time.

311
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:21,099
At night when the drop in center talk, communicate, we even talked about, you know, they had an

312
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:23,019
input in style of play.

313
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:29,000
I think a huge thing of this leader was communication both ways.

314
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,400
And, uh, and that was strong.

315
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
Such a great shift.

316
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,339
I want to talk to you about something, you know, we're really passionate about is that

317
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:38,440
shift in leadership that you've identified really clearly.

318
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,420
I just want to touch a bit more on, on Patty Mills for those that maybe don't know, you

319
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,599
know, his story with his over a decade at San Antonio.

320
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:49,640
Gorge and going into that team, he's an NBA championship winning player now, but he really

321
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:57,119
became a legend in America because the Americans picked up on his incredible capacity to support

322
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:58,119
his teammates.

323
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,119
He's flagged.

324
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:01,740
So he's towel waving on the sidelines became a thing in America.

325
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,359
You want to have someone like Patty Mills on your team and his performance in the Olympics.

326
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:10,220
He now goes onto the Brooklyn nets and with, with three of the greatest players in the

327
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,220
game.

328
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,599
At the moment you play with in Harden and Kevin, uh, Duran and Kyrie Irving.

329
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:13,599
He's a great guy.

330
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:14,599
He's a great guy.

331
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:17,299
You say, can you describe how he's perceived in America?

332
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:24,000
Because they get the essence of Patty Mills over there.

333
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah.

334
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,519
They play him playing with, you know, one of the greatest team coaches of all time.

335
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:31,599
And, uh, Tim Duncan, one of the greatest captains have all time, not, you know, he's smart enough.

336
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:38,259
I'm sure he learned, and I'm sure those guys are part of Patty's development and it was

337
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:40,559
in Patty, but they brought it out.

338
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,599
They brought it to the surface and let Patty be Patty.

339
00:19:43,599 --> 00:20:03,119
And nope, he figured out the role that he needed to play to best suit the team and help them win a championship and also was a huge part of the team off the floor, like you said, with support, whether it's on the bench or whether it's in the locker room.

340
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:21,039
He was a really important piece to that. And you could see after the medals were handed out that, you know, him and Kevin Durant, you could see the smile on Kevin Durant's and the kind of the hug and how he gets it and is so excited to have Patty on board.

341
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:33,039
Because with those three big, big guns, you couldn't get a better guy to be that piece that will find whatever is required and whatever is needed for them to go on.

342
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:42,500
And win it all, not only skill wise, but as you're saying, just that piece that's going to help glue the team together and take it the direction it needs to go.

343
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:54,220
I keep going back, you know, I was reading today, looking at Patty, that his great uncle is Eddie Marbo, who achieved the amazing land right, you know, high court recognition of land for Indigenous Australians for the first time.

344
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:02,460
He was inspired, Patty, by Kathy Mills at her win at the Olympics in Sydney 2000 when she won the 400 and he made contact with Kathy.

345
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:10,700
She attended his wedding and he's just, as you said now, carried a spirit of Australian leadership and culture that you described so beautifully, Gorge.

346
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:19,839
I feel like he set that up for a generation of Australians who maybe didn't get it, who maybe know it and touch so many people with what you guys have just done a couple of weeks ago.

347
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:32,420
I know, I know he's had a huge effect on those young guys that have come in, a guy like Matisse Tybel, a guy like Josh Green that don't know they're Australian, but they've spent less time in Australia than me.

348
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:41,380
I mean, they have, they were kids, they've been in the American system and, you know, in some ways at the start, they were not getting the piece that they wanted.

349
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:48,240
You know, Matisse was coming off the bench, Josh Green didn't play much, and I loved watching their expression.

350
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:54,579
I love watching them grow and change and start, wow, this can really happen.

351
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,740
It was something really special to see the effect it had on guys like that.

352
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,339
And then the other aspect of this, you can't take away.

353
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:16,400
With what's going on in our sport and going on in the country, I thought, as I was coming to this team, I'm going to be honoring, it's the first time ever to have an Indigenous captain of the Boomers.

354
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,160
And I was really excited.

355
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,720
Obviously, there was no question, but really excited to present that.

356
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:31,559
And then before that even took place, it's like, hey, this guy's going to not only captain the Boomers, he's going to captain.

357
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:41,279
And then the Australian Olympic team and what a tremendous job he did with that and what's going on in our country and around the world right now.

358
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:49,579
And in Australian sport, Eddie Betts, you know, the things that are taking place and to have a guy like this stand up and do it right.

359
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,460
He cares about everybody.

360
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,160
He supports everybody.

361
00:22:53,160 --> 00:23:01,539
In the village, he just blew my, I mean, he'd walk around and, you know, the other events, be inquisitive, watching, taking notes.

362
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,259
Go up and congratulate.

363
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:06,579
You know, he didn't walk around there like he's a rock star.

364
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:07,980
He was one of the team.

365
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:17,140
Again, I walked in that gym in Irvine and looked up at the wall and go, God, the flags had such a strong, you know, a little simple thing like that.

366
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:27,880
But it's like, wow, floor to ceiling, man, bang, you know, the jukebox in the middle, Jimmy Barnes, you know, Kylie Minogue, you know, Tina Arena, Johnny.

367
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,839
You know, like in the songs I keep.

368
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:35,140
The songs were, you know, you are, we are, we are Australia.

369
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:35,660
I don't know.

370
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:43,619
But when you're in that band and you've come out of a game and you've won and that's blaring in the background, tears come to your eyes.

371
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,039
We can't be beaten.

372
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,539
It's something that will stay with me in coaching.

373
00:23:49,799 --> 00:24:00,680
How valuable and how strong music was and how it was orchestrated by those guys and was had a really strong impact.

374
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,420
They touched it.

375
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:09,400
You mentioned in part of that, Gorgie, you changed your style to be more managerial, like a soccer coach or an AFL coach for a time.

376
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:19,940
And I know we've connected over this great collaboration you're doing with what we've called the Australian Coach Symposium, facilitated by my great friend, Matt Waterwitz.

377
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:25,680
And you, Luke Beveridge, who's a legendary AFL coach, the Bordeaux Premiership coach in 2016.

378
00:24:25,819 --> 00:24:29,440
Eddie Jones from English Rugby has got an incredible history in English Rugby.

379
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:30,940
Ange Postacoglu is doing extraordinary.

380
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:38,779
Extraordinary things, fresh from winning a Premiership in Japan and now coaching the famous Celtic and Scotland First Australian to do that.

381
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:41,440
Neil Craig is a legend of Australian coach and high performance.

382
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:47,680
Tell us about your collective and your collaboration with those guys and what impact that's had on you and your coaching.

383
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:56,500
One of the big things was how much more listening and communication, more two-way.

384
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,279
I've been kind of a personality that I have.

385
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,500
And I'll...

386
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:04,480
I'll give you everything I've got if you want it.

387
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,779
I'll give everything you got.

388
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:13,799
But to give more power to the assistant coaches and what you're looking for in those guys.

389
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:21,079
And it's helped me develop them by giving them more and what the requirements are of them.

390
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:31,039
And I think with this team, I think they would have been probably taken back if they got in and talked to you and said, well, what did you get from Brian Gorgian?

391
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:31,180
Yeah.

392
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:34,079
Well, he said, shit, he gave me more.

393
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,099
He let me, hey, here's your deal.

394
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,119
You're competent.

395
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:39,039
Take it.

396
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:44,440
And then that's not the Brian Gorgian that they were expecting to get.

397
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:51,180
Again, that word, I guess, empowerment, not only as players, you give more, you get more.

398
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:59,920
You have a short window, five-day drop-in center, five days of practice, three practice games, and you're in it.

399
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,039
Now, how...

400
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,920
How I operated would not have worked.

401
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,319
Don't have enough time and not enough of you.

402
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,660
So the timing of those pearls from those guys was perfect.

403
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:18,180
And I knew as soon as I saw it, I've got something for this.

404
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,759
It's amazing how the staff was with the power that they had.

405
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:30,160
And Gorg, we're identifying that shift to exactly as you did and empowering your assistant coaches more.

406
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,180
I certainly played...

407
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:35,839
I footy in an era where even if you had 300 games experience or you'd been around 15,

408
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:40,880
your opinion wasn't valued because you weren't the senior coach and you didn't take on board.

409
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:48,160
And you look back and you think there was these resources that were probably there to support that environment a little bit more that were wasted.

410
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:50,480
And then you didn't feel as though you had a voice in your environment.

411
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,819
Sometimes that could be...

412
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:58,359
It was the era that we were in, but I feel like you and this next generation of coaches who, a lot of them are my friends now,

413
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,539
get the value in understanding these resources.

414
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,880
Your assistant coaches can give so much more if you empower them.

415
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,779
I just want to pivot slightly.

416
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:13,799
That is a bit of a word of the times, which I'm a bit over, but I've got some questions to ask you.

417
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,880
But I want to just change to a bit of family because I read that...

418
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,920
And I'm passionate about leadership in the family.

419
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,440
And clearly, you've got leadership in your coaching and day-to-day.

420
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:27,680
But your dad was your initial coach in high school, I believe.

421
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,519
Your father read and just what sort of leadership he left with you.

422
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:33,819
And what that's done for you in your life.

423
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:38,700
He is a Hall of Fame high school coach.

424
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,599
He had whatever years of coaching.

425
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,819
At the time I came through, he'd never had an NBA player.

426
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:49,740
So one of the first conversations was, you know, you come into this program.

427
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:55,579
It's, you know, we're going to make you a better basketball player, but you're going to become a better person.

428
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,420
And you're going to become something special in society.

429
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,420
And if you don't, you know, we haven't produced an...

430
00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:04,160
You know, we haven't produced an NBA player, but you'd have a board up there.

431
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:05,220
This guy's a doctor.

432
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:06,279
This guy's a lawyer.

433
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,480
This guy's a mayor.

434
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,660
You know, you look at your classmates and you sit next to them in the classroom.

435
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,779
You're a part of this basketball team.

436
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:18,980
You're going to kick ass when it comes time to compete outside of these doors.

437
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:25,859
And it gave you the values, the principles, the understanding of how to be great and how to be...

438
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:31,400
Go about winning, whether it's on the court or whether it's off the court.

439
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:32,940
That's what I got from him.

440
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,940
And then the coaching side of it, you don't...

441
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:35,980
So many...

442
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:40,359
You know, you're sitting in the back seat from the time I'm seven or eight years old,

443
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:45,180
sitting behind the bench at the high school games and my dad's coaching.

444
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,880
And I'm just in a knot because I want my dad to win so bad.

445
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:55,900
And then sitting in the back seat of the car, coming back and him reliving the game with the assistant coach

446
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,700
and talking about all the things we're talking about now, roles.

447
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,420
That was...

448
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,859
That was going in my ears at nine, 10, 11 years old.

449
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,259
And then graduating from him and having my first pro deal.

450
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,940
And I'm with Lindsay Gaze for 10 seasons.

451
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,299
So, I mean, I've been blessed.

452
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,900
And, you know, it doesn't fall far from the tree.

453
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:24,079
What you're around, what influences you has a huge effect on what the outcome is.

454
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,220
And there are two men that I owe a tremendous amount to.

455
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,789
I'm interested.

456
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:40,910
Some of your success and consistent success in people's daily habits.

457
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:44,950
Is there stuff you do, Gorge, every day that sets you up to be successful?

458
00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:47,650
I try to be active.

459
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,910
Real important, I think, is not letting yourself go physically.

460
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:55,589
And it gets more and more a battle as you get older.

461
00:29:56,009 --> 00:30:03,289
I think as a leader, when I'm involved in basketball, I've got to bring an energy to this.

462
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:05,890
And I got to bring an excitement to this.

463
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,289
Not just when...

464
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:09,630
You're turning on the TV and the whole nation's watching.

465
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:13,490
But at, you know, 7 o'clock in the morning when you're in the weight room.

466
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:17,269
Or 8 o'clock in the morning when you're rebounding balls and throwing it to a guy.

467
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:22,369
You can't be an old man sitting on the sideline eating a donut with a cup of coffee.

468
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,589
That is something that you've got to work at.

469
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:34,250
And in turn, I think a real important aspect of anything you do is that you've got to have a hunger to get better.

470
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,250
And, you know...

471
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:37,529
I did.

472
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,910
I walked in.

473
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,890
I listened to those assistant coaches.

474
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:41,690
I've been away.

475
00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:43,069
I listened to Patty.

476
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,170
I listened to Joe.

477
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,509
I want to learn.

478
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,569
I want to get better.

479
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,470
I have a respect.

480
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:52,589
And I think a horrible trait for an experience...

481
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:55,529
You see it a lot in guys my age is arrogance.

482
00:30:56,069 --> 00:30:56,930
I know it all.

483
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,109
I know what I'm doing.

484
00:30:58,269 --> 00:30:59,369
I've been around the block.

485
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:00,450
Listen to me, Junior.

486
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:06,630
And again, for me, these guys that I've been speaking to on a...

487
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,569
on a fortnightly basis, just my mind opens up.

488
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,890
And they're all about learning.

489
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,730
They're all about getting better.

490
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:14,630
Other codes, the young...

491
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:18,450
I've learned, you know, again, so much from Joe and Patty.

492
00:31:18,589 --> 00:31:22,470
Patty's been around the best coach in the world for how many years?

493
00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:28,109
You don't think a guy with his intelligence and his nous and his energy hasn't learned?

494
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:29,490
I picked his brain.

495
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:33,009
And again, I think I've been around.

496
00:31:33,009 --> 00:31:34,009
I give myself...

497
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:36,009
When you say, okay...

498
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,930
What do you get a pat for?

499
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,529
I've had that in me.

500
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:42,529
I haven't had an arrogance about me, that I'm good.

501
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,569
I know what I'm doing.

502
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,589
I've won these...

503
00:31:44,589 --> 00:31:45,569
You know, irrelevant.

504
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,630
You know, it's about pursuit.

505
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,369
You're not defending anything.

506
00:31:49,569 --> 00:31:50,569
You're moving forward.

507
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:56,349
And again, the Aussie thing, the boomer, that's a point Patty made loud and clear.

508
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,490
A kangaroo never takes a step backwards.

509
00:31:58,970 --> 00:31:59,910
You're moving forward.

510
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:00,569
You're learning.

511
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:02,650
Everybody has something to give you.

512
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,589
Yeah, I love that constant never-ending self-improvement.

513
00:32:05,829 --> 00:32:06,549
And a great...

514
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,650
Reflection of modern leadership, Gorge.

515
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:11,970
You embody that in everything you say and everything you do.

516
00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:16,670
We're trying to capture in these podcasts, Gorge, from a range of different people,

517
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,589
what we think make up great leadership.

518
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:21,269
And I want to ask you firstly about self-leadership.

519
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,410
What does that mean to you?

520
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:28,789
Well, self-leadership, you know, or a part of it, I don't know if I've got you right,

521
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,549
but it lead by example.

522
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,809
You got to have an understanding of it.

523
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:36,589
You can't be over here and be preaching.

524
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:42,829
I guess I use it that the communication's both ways, that it's not, you're not asking

525
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:46,509
something of somebody and you're not living it.

526
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:51,690
How do you actively go about positively impacting others in your environment?

527
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,650
I guess I try to keep things simple.

528
00:32:55,410 --> 00:33:00,329
When I went to China and I walked in the door and I'm with all of a sudden out of nowhere,

529
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:02,430
I'm with the Chinese national team.

530
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,170
Yi Jilin, NBA player.

531
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:06,190
Yao Ming.

532
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:06,609
NBA player.

533
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:12,130
These guys are 7'5", 7', you know, they've got the gear on.

534
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,730
I walked in, I'm the only Western person in there.

535
00:33:15,069 --> 00:33:18,630
And you walk in there and there it is, what you're asking.

536
00:33:19,089 --> 00:33:20,269
How do you get respect?

537
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:23,589
And two things came out loud.

538
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,289
They don't speak my language.

539
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:26,750
We can't talk.

540
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,609
So how do you make this happen?

541
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:35,069
And what stuck out to me within work ethic, you don't say nothing.

542
00:33:35,069 --> 00:33:36,589
You got to keep your mouth.

543
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:36,950
You got to keep your mouth shut.

544
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:40,730
And man, you're going to, you know, I was on every basketball.

545
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:41,910
I was rebounded.

546
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,150
I was wiping the floor.

547
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:44,190
I was high five.

548
00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:46,970
I was, you know, active with the passes.

549
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:50,269
Afterwards, I was the last guy to leave when they walked in the gym.

550
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,109
I was in there with my notebook.

551
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,589
Second aspect.

552
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:58,150
And again, the men and I speak to it at night on this stuff.

553
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,190
You look and you go, they're competent.

554
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:05,250
You better be competent in your craft when they ask the question or look at you.

555
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,529
You know, no, this.

556
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:12,030
What goes here, this hand goes here, you know, and slap them on the ass and give them the ball.

557
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:19,989
Do this ten times, you know, do this ten times and you want them walking out of the gym going, you know, in their own language.

558
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,909
Hey, that guy knows what he's talking about.

559
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,889
I can get better from that guy.

560
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,710
You realize everybody wants to get better.

561
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:31,329
And two, he works his ass off because everyone has a respect for that.

562
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,369
And I know maybe I'm older and they're simple things.

563
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:36,269
But man, when I was in China.

564
00:34:36,269 --> 00:34:37,949
It got bared to the bone.

565
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:45,750
And when you've got six days or seven days to prepare for a, you know, a medal, you get bared to the bone.

566
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,530
It gets down to things like this.

567
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,750
How about creating and sharing your vision?

568
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:52,010
How do you think about that?

569
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:58,130
You know, all the things that we talk about, communication, talk a lot, talk a lot.

570
00:34:58,389 --> 00:35:06,010
When you say in quiet times, you know, the practice finishes, you know, I try to pick two guys a day.

571
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:10,769
You know, that I, you know, touch everybody as they come in the door.

572
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:18,650
Make sure you bet two guys a day, shoot the ship with and kind of get, you know, they get a feeling.

573
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:24,869
And then and then you're, you know, simply your actions, you know, your your actions on a day to day.

574
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,190
We're in entertainment, man.

575
00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:29,130
We're we're there's a role to play as head coach.

576
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:32,210
Like I said, come in sharp, come in with energy.

577
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,369
The high road all the time.

578
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,170
Never get dragged down.

579
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,869
Just the visual.

580
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,409
Curiosity and leadership.

581
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,449
What are your thoughts on on curiosity?

582
00:35:42,449 --> 00:35:46,530
And then how does that work for you in terms of your own learning and improvement?

583
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,070
Really important.

584
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:53,010
And I guess I I put that in the back bag of wanting to get better.

585
00:35:53,750 --> 00:36:01,409
The great ones that I've been fortunate, whether it's been business, you know, I mean, it's been an interesting journey.

586
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,150
A guy that doesn't have a lot.

587
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,250
But I've been around people.

588
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:07,050
I've been around people with a lot.

589
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:17,269
You know, the the the owners of of the kings, the owners of the dragons, you know, you're around Ruffy Jaminda, the the, you know, the Pratt family.

590
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:26,250
And you learn and, you know, constantly being in an environment where you're getting better and you're learning.

591
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:35,489
And when that stops or when you lose the appetite for that, that passion and energy, when that goes.

592
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:37,429
And you can see it hasn't.

593
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:43,469
And when you're when you're you know, you have that thirst for getting better and wanting to learn.

594
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,869
The funny thing is, it can be somebody.

595
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:57,050
One of the massage girls can be massaged in a guy and walk by you and say something and go, shit.

596
00:36:57,489 --> 00:36:59,530
Yeah, because he's relaxed and he's talking.

597
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,530
He's comfortable and they talk about something.

598
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:05,469
And wow, you get hit with a pearl and go, man, I never thought about.

599
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:09,389
That aspect of this guy and coming to him with this.

600
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,909
And they're not even sharing it with you.

601
00:37:11,989 --> 00:37:12,489
It's just communication.

602
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:17,969
But, you know, the guy at the front gate is everybody walks in every now.

603
00:37:18,389 --> 00:37:21,250
You got a little notebook and you take a pearl from the.

604
00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:27,369
You got to be listening and you got to have an open mind and and want to get better.

605
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,550
You talked about communication.

606
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,889
How do you think about communicating with clarity?

607
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,269
When you talk about communication, what I learned on the court.

608
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:41,489
Let's say as a coach, I talk too much and it affected the flow at practice.

609
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:54,969
So through working through an interpreter and somebody that doesn't speak another language that we don't speak the same language, the process to teach was ridiculously tough.

610
00:37:55,429 --> 00:38:03,309
So you started one teaching in phrases, passing lane, driving lane instead of a long winded situation.

611
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:05,489
And then you'd go to say something.

612
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:08,130
You'd hold it and go and they ain't worth it.

613
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:09,289
Pick your moment.

614
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:14,409
So, again, communication and picking your spots is huge.

615
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:21,869
And then, too, in that environment, I was in a situation where they came to me as a coach.

616
00:38:21,989 --> 00:38:26,570
I was on the receiving end a lot more than I am normally.

617
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,389
Like here, it all came from me.

618
00:38:28,449 --> 00:38:29,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

619
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:30,949
OK, what do you got?

620
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:31,869
I'm open.

621
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,190
I'll listen back.

622
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,090
We're there.

623
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,050
It came from the other direction a lot more.

624
00:38:37,429 --> 00:38:39,650
And I think that's been really helpful for me.

625
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:43,409
I'll have an open ear and wait or I'll throw something out.

626
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:49,550
And then it's much better to take in information, especially early, than give it out.

627
00:38:49,809 --> 00:38:51,230
It's got to be two ways.

628
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,949
But again, I go to this national thing.

629
00:38:54,230 --> 00:39:00,050
I learn right away that that group, I want to hear a lot more than I want to say.

630
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:03,510
And I got a lot of value in the country.

631
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:07,650
We got a lot of value out of me listening as opposed to running my mouth.

632
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:11,449
Yeah, and incredible leadership to be able to do that in real time, Gorge, isn't it?

633
00:39:11,469 --> 00:39:16,690
When your temptation is to share your wisdom as much as you've got it there.

634
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,989
Collaboration, what does that mean to you and how do you go about it?

635
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:28,590
Probably always had that mindset of collaboration, but probably wasn't real good at it.

636
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:32,909
And again, you go through every experience.

637
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:33,489
And I learned.

638
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:37,130
I learned so much of 12 years in China.

639
00:39:37,929 --> 00:39:42,110
And I saw how they operated.

640
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,590
And there was a lot of things I liked.

641
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:49,230
But there was things that I go, no, I'm kind of like that.

642
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,250
And I don't want to be like that.

643
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:57,989
And I give you an example of that aspect, the head coach, my way or the highway.

644
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,090
That's how that thing operates.

645
00:40:00,469 --> 00:40:02,610
Players, they don't have an opinion.

646
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,489
One, it's a.

647
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:12,690
It's a sign of respect there and it's you lose face if they're it's kind of a sign that you don't know you're vulnerable.

648
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,309
You don't know what you're talking about.

649
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:17,369
There's kind of that pressure on the guy.

650
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:31,710
And what's coming back to this again, those meetings and everything and taking a deep breath and going, wow, you know, I'm on the outside and I think different, but now I'm seeing it, it is extreme.

651
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,389
And so when I came back.

652
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:43,510
If you said that I worked with some guys prior that I came back to, they would say, you know, you had a little bit of that in you, but you've gotten a lot better that way.

653
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:49,409
It's really important that that you do involve those people listen.

654
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,250
And also, it's a two way after you take it all in.

655
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,429
One of the things in my age is mentoring.

656
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:57,690
You listen.

657
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:03,150
And then if you know, there's certain times you go, hey, man, I'm dead against that, to be honest with you.

658
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:13,550
But for this reason, this reason and this reason, and I would definitely go about it this way and to be truthful with you now we're going, I'm kind of demanding that it's the same with it.

659
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:25,469
At the end of it, you are the head guy and you take in and maybe eight out of 10 things, you get three pearls and you maybe get one that you go, no, man, I don't want that happening, not here.

660
00:41:25,469 --> 00:41:28,349
And for the, and you explain the reasons and we move on.

661
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:33,050
But you're happier feeling as though as a leader, people around you, you've got that.

662
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:33,710
You've got that voice now.

663
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:38,809
Is it make you feel like a, you know, you're a better coach by understanding that more now?

664
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:39,670
Correct.

665
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:51,150
And not, not only that, I do feel as, as you get my age and you got guys coming to your program, there's a responsibility is especially as a staff in every form.

666
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:55,050
I take pride in these guys getting better at their craft.

667
00:41:55,329 --> 00:42:03,050
And I said to you before a real important aspect of, of this is that the coaches that get spit out down my back.

668
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,429
Are competent and they do well.

669
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:11,809
And that's, you know, again, I look at a guy like Greg Popovich and you talk about Patty Mills, but look at staff.

670
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,449
The NBA is just cluttered with people that have played under him.

671
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:21,150
And now we're head coaches and doing great things in the competition.

672
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:29,889
I've been asking this one question of the leaders that I've been talking to and a question without notice for you, but who is the greatest leader in your life?

673
00:42:30,489 --> 00:42:31,690
It'd have to be my dad.

674
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:32,889
It'd have to be my dad.

675
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:43,710
Everything that I believe in and, and respect and, you know, my life, all the things I'm grateful for and thankful.

676
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:45,510
It comes through him.

677
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:57,909
And you realize, you know, a lot about a man by it, you know, and I, as coaching, you know, you meet a kid and you deal with a kid and then you get introduced to the parents.

678
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:02,010
And I have a great feel for what the parents are going to be like.

679
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:02,969
When you've dealt.

680
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:10,409
Dealt with the sun and you go, man, this kid's a special kid, an unbeliever, and it doesn't fall far from the tree.

681
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:22,170
And all the good things that I feel about that have happened in my life have been from, you know, the lessons learned when you're really, really young.

682
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:33,030
And he was tireless in his, in his work and development and about all the things that are important.

683
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:36,889
And, uh, yeah, I, it's, it's not even close.

684
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:38,510
It's, it, it's, it's there.

685
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:47,250
What a wonderful way to finish and what a wonderful start in life for you, Gorge, to start and finish with, uh, with your dad and his, uh, his leadership.

686
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:52,829
And, and our hope is that people listening to this get a sense of, uh, how you can positively impact your environment.

687
00:43:52,909 --> 00:43:56,969
You don't have to be a champion coach or a CEO of a business.

688
00:43:56,969 --> 00:44:01,050
You can have an impact on those around you as Brian Gorgian did.

689
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,670
What you achieved, man.

690
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:06,230
What you have achieved over such a long period of time is remarkable, but we're fresh from the Olympics.

691
00:44:06,449 --> 00:44:07,349
It made us all smile.

692
00:44:07,469 --> 00:44:12,230
It felt like the world needed what you guys were able to deliver and the other athletes around the world.

693
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:19,349
Our Australian athletes were brilliant, but the language and the, the sense of sharing and community, mate, was just quite, uh, quite special.

694
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:21,150
So thank you so much for your time.

695
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:23,750
I look, I look forward to you back, back out of quarantine soon.

696
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:27,230
And, uh, once again, we, uh, we're just incredibly proud of what you achieved.

697
00:44:27,309 --> 00:44:27,929
Thank you so much.

698
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:28,650
Thanks, mate.

699
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:34,170
