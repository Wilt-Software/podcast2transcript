1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:13,529
How do you handle yourself under great adversity

2
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:16,149
and how important is it to take radical responsibility?

3
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,780
G'day, it's Luke Darcy.

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,239
The idea of self-improvement and leadership

5
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:26,399
both on and off the field has been a lifelong passion of mine.

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,320
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,060
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,240
in education, sport, industry and the arts

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,140
that have helped shift to what we see

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,200
as the 21st century style of leadership

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,659
where everyone has a voice.

12
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,240
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

13
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:04,040
I sat down with the ex-CEO of the Westpac Bank, Brian Hartzer,

14
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,200
to chat about how he managed himself

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,439
as well as those around him

16
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,340
during one of the most difficult times of his life

17
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,239
and how he built a new path for himself

18
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,900
using self-reflection and a clear sense of purpose.

19
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,019
Well, this is a great pleasure and a great honour

20
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:21,680
to speak to Brian Hartzer.

21
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,439
I need to give a summary, which I may be not due justice to,

22
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,359
but certainly the list of achievements is

23
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,760
is lengthy and many.

24
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,000
Born in Manhattan, New York.

25
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:32,159
Graduated with a degree in European history

26
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,040
from Princeton University, which is in itself fascinating.

27
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,200
I'm keen to talk about that.

28
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:38,840
Spent 10 years at the first Manhattan Consulting Group

29
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,359
in New York, San Fran and Melbourne.

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,519
Potentially, that's where the Australian link comes in for Brian.

31
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,739
Divisional CEO roles at the Royal Bank of Scotland,

32
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,900
ANZ Banking Group over a 15-year period.

33
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,060
Chairman of the Australian Banking Association,

34
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,879
Retail Banking Committee of the British Bankers Association.

35
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,180
CEO of the Westpac Banking Group, 2015 to 2019.

36
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,680
Chair of the Save the Children Australia Fund.

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,359
The Director of the Financial Market Foundation for Children.

38
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,260
Chair of the Business Advisory Committee

39
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,159
for the Australian National University, the ANU.

40
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,639
And in recent times,

41
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,419
Chair of the Australian Museum Foundation.

42
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:13,879
Brian, on any measure, that is an extraordinary life's work.

43
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,120
Thanks for joining us today.

44
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,120
That's kind of, maybe as you read it,

45
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,840
it just makes me think, gosh, I'm getting old.

46
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,419
Well, perhaps Brian may have overlooked your greatest achievement,

47
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:25,520
and that's being a father of six.

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,020
Can I ask, how do you manage that?

49
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,780
How do you manage that?

50
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,219
A career of that length and that breadth,

51
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:32,939
and a father of six at the same time?

52
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:35,979
Well, in fairness, I have four children of my own

53
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:36,840
and two stepchildren,

54
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,699
so it's not quite as overwhelming as it sounds.

55
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:42,500
But yeah, it's certainly the thing that makes

56
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,500
the biggest difference long-term is doing that well.

57
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,780
And I'm continuing to work at that like lots of parents do.

58
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,979
Lots of teenagers, lots of challenges.

59
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,020
Father of four myself with a few teenagers in my house, Brian.

60
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,919
So, yeah.

61
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,020
So, I think that's one of the things that I've been able to do

62
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,020
to relate to the evolving nature of that.

63
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,020
And I should have also introduced you

64
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,020
as the author of The Leadership Star,

65
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,020
A Practical Guide to Building Engagement,

66
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,020
a fantastic book that I encourage anyone listening to check out.

67
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,020
And Brian, the overwhelming sense I got reading it was

68
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,020
that there was this incredible, I suppose, discovery in you

69
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,020
that you perhaps prefer other people's success

70
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,020
and supporting other people's success

71
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,020
and got more satisfaction out of that than your own success.

72
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,020
Is that fair to say?

73
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,020
Yeah.

74
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,020
And I think the way you describe that as a discovery is right.

75
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,020
Yeah.

76
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,020
I didn't think that was going to be the case.

77
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,020
You talked about my educational background.

78
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,020
I was one of those kids who worked really hard in school

79
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:39,020
and wanted to achieve and achieved in a corporate world

80
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,020
and found myself put into a position of managing other people

81
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,020
and found genuinely a bit to my surprise

82
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,020
that the satisfaction I got out of helping other people do well

83
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,020
was deeper and longer lasting

84
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,020
than when you were the smart guy in the corner

85
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,020
and achieved something and got rewarded at the end of the year.

86
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,020
That felt great the first year.

87
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,020
A little less great the second year.

88
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,020
And by the third and fourth year, it was kind of over in minutes

89
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,020
and yet the satisfaction from seeing other people thrive

90
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,020
stays with you for a really long time

91
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,020
and that just became something I really enjoyed

92
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,020
and wanted to have more of.

93
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,020
I think you referenced one of your first management roles in the 90s

94
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,020
and you felt like you were cast in this role.

95
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,019
I think you describe it as being part-time psychologist,

96
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,019
cheerleader, consultant all in one.

97
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,019
Was that a specific moment where you thought,

98
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:25,019
hey, I've got some skills here

99
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:27,019
or I really want to pursue this?

100
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:31,019
Well, I think it was more that I enjoyed the feeling of doing it

101
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:34,019
and realized I didn't really know what I was doing.

102
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:36,019
I hadn't had any formal training in it

103
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:39,019
and my first 10 years in management consulting,

104
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:43,019
I like to say that you don't really manage management consultants.

105
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:47,019
You point them because they're all insecure overachievers like me

106
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:50,019
and so you just tell them what you want and off they go.

107
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:53,019
And suddenly I found myself having to manage a group of people

108
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:54,019
who weren't like me.

109
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:58,019
And realizing that I didn't really have any training to do that,

110
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:00,019
but it was something I wanted to do well.

111
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:04,019
I love the clear language that you've come up with in your book

112
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:06,019
and the five C's.

113
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:10,019
It's really well written and easy to stay with you.

114
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,019
And maybe delve into a bit of it if that's okay, Brian.

115
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:16,019
You talk about care, context, clarity, clear the way, celebrate.

116
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:18,019
In the middle of the star is about you and your self-reflection

117
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:21,019
and you flirted with communication as a sixth C,

118
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,019
but we might talk about that separately.

119
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:25,019
And you had some great anecdotes, I suppose.

120
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:28,019
They're words that we all know, but to put them into practice.

121
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:31,019
I love your story around care and the great story of empathy

122
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:34,019
you had from a work colleague called Miriam.

123
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:36,019
I'm assuming that's her real name.

124
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:37,019
Can you pick up that story?

125
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:38,019
Yeah.

126
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:42,019
So that was the thing that really started me off on this intellectual journey,

127
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:47,019
I suppose, was I was working at ANZ and we had received

128
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:49,019
our staff satisfaction surveys.

129
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:53,019
And as a senior leader, we were measured on how we were doing,

130
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,019
how satisfied our staff were.

131
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:57,019
That was one of the things each year.

132
00:05:57,019 --> 00:06:01,019
And we had a business in Hong Kong that we had decided to shut down.

133
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:07,019
And I had sent this woman, Miriam, up to Hong Kong to do the shutdown.

134
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:11,019
And so I thought, well, we're going to get a terrible staff satisfaction

135
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:12,019
result out of there.

136
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:16,019
And to my surprise, when it arrived, she had 100% staff satisfaction.

137
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:21,019
And I rang her up and said, Miriam, you have 100% staff satisfaction.

138
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:22,019
She said, yes.

139
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:25,019
I said, you have told them that we're closing the business.

140
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,019
She said, yes.

141
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:30,019
And I said, you have told them that they're all going to lose their job.

142
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:31,019
And she said, yes.

143
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:34,019
And I remember saying, OK, I give up.

144
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,019
What are you feeding them?

145
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,019
And she laughed.

146
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:42,019
And then she said, I speak to every staff member every day.

147
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:43,019
And she paused.

148
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:44,019
And I said, OK, tell me about that.

149
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:46,019
She said, well, we're not that busy.

150
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:50,019
So each day I go around and I go up to one of the people and sit down with them

151
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:52,019
and just say, how are you?

152
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:53,019
How's your family?

153
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:55,019
How's your job hunt going?

154
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:57,019
Are you getting all the support you need?

155
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:58,019
Do you know what you need to get done?

156
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:00,019
Is there anything we can do for you?

157
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,019
And I just have a conversation with them.

158
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:06,019
And then at the end of that conversation, I go to the next person and I say, how are

159
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:07,019
you?

160
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:10,019
And she said, I have that conversation 35 times a day.

161
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:13,019
And then the next day I start all over.

162
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:18,019
And the consequence of that was 100% satisfaction out of a bunch of people who were all losing

163
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:19,019
their jobs.

164
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:20,019
And that just blew me away.

165
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:24,019
Because we're so used to, in corporate life, thinking that when there's a restructure going

166
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:29,019
on or there's something bad happening in the business, you can't possibly expect leaders

167
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:32,019
to do a good job of keeping their people engaged and feeling good.

168
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:38,019
And that just proved to me that that wasn't right and that actually leaders have a tremendous

169
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:42,019
ability if they're willing to care about people as individual human beings.

170
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:47,019
And that's the key to it is it's not a generic, I care about my people.

171
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:49,019
It's actually care as an action verb.

172
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:52,019
And what are you doing to demonstrate that care?

173
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:57,019
And that was what Miriam taught me and really started focusing me on thinking about what

174
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,019
leadership is all about.

175
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:02,019
And she sounds like a remarkable, empathetic person.

176
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:05,019
Is that something, Brian, that was just in her DNA?

177
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:10,019
And is it something that can be a learned skill for people who don't necessarily gravitate

178
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:12,019
to natural empathy and care?

179
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:13,019
Can you learn it?

180
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:15,019
So it is natural for her.

181
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:17,019
She is an extraordinary person.

182
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:18,019
She's had a really difficult life.

183
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:23,019
She's a practicing Muslim woman working in an Australian environment.

184
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:28,019
Not an easy thing, but everybody who comes in contact with her just falls in love with

185
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,019
her and she's unbelievable at what she can deliver in a business.

186
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:34,019
In terms of can you learn it?

187
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:35,019
Absolutely.

188
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:38,019
I mean, my sense is most people have good intentions.

189
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:41,019
If you ask leaders, do you care about their people, they'll say, well, of course.

190
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:45,019
But it's a matter of learning that, well, you have to demonstrate that care through

191
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:47,019
the interest that you take in people and the actions you take.

192
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:49,019
The actions you take to follow up.

193
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,019
And I use the word discipline a lot.

194
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:56,019
A lot of leadership is about the discipline of applying these things and practically thinking

195
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:57,019
about how you do it.

196
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:02,019
A lot of the ideas, the five Cs, as you say, it's not rocket science, this stuff, but it's

197
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:07,019
about using that as a framework and being disciplined about how you apply it and having

198
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,019
ideas about specific things you can go and do to bring that to life for people.

199
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,019
Yeah.

200
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:16,019
We had a story, Brian, that in a start-up business that is probably the foundation for

201
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:18,019
wanting to talk to great leaders like yourself.

202
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:20,019
And we've been working with our own leaders.

203
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,019
And one was a 24-hour production line.

204
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,019
And one section of the production line was so much more efficient than the other.

205
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:28,019
It's a bottling group.

206
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:33,019
And the organization just couldn't work out why one part was so much more effective than

207
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:34,019
it's a six-hour shift.

208
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,019
You put bottles on the line.

209
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:37,019
Why is there a 40% difference?

210
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,019
And that equates to serious bottom line improvement, as you would well know.

211
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:45,019
And observing one of these leaders on the shift and just worked out that he would, at

212
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,019
the end of the shift, walk down the line.

213
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,019
And say, hey, thanks for doing your job today.

214
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:49,019
We really appreciate it.

215
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,019
Shake everyone's hand.

216
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:51,019
Look them in the eye.

217
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:56,019
He put on a barbecue once a month that probably cost the organization $50 in white bread and

218
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:57,019
a few sausages.

219
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:58,019
But the team were engaged.

220
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,019
They loved being there at work.

221
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:01,019
They didn't take sick leave.

222
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:04,019
They found much more efficiency in that group.

223
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:07,019
And to be able to share that with the guy, you're right.

224
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:09,019
It wasn't that he was uncaring.

225
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:12,019
He just didn't understand his impact on those around him.

226
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:14,019
It sounds simple, but it can be really powerful, can't it?

227
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:15,019
Yeah.

228
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:16,019
Absolutely.

229
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,019
And it is just that recognition that each person, as an individual human being, has

230
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,019
choices on how they spend their time.

231
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:28,019
And if they feel like they matter and that you care about them and you demonstrate that

232
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:34,019
through your actions, then that will get reflected back on the leader and on the organization.

233
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,019
So you mentioned care.

234
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:38,019
We're going to work through a bit of the leadership star.

235
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:43,019
The idea of context and a great story you talk about, bricklayers building a cathedral.

236
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,019
Can you share that with me?

237
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,019
Yeah.

238
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,019
So it's a story.

239
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,019
A great friend of mine once told me about this idea that this guy was walking down the

240
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:54,019
road and he saw a guy by the side of the road laying bricks and went up to him and said,

241
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:55,019
what are you doing?

242
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:56,019
And he said, I'm laying bricks.

243
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:57,019
He said, okay, that's kind of interesting.

244
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:01,019
And then he went to the next person and there was another guy laying bricks and he said,

245
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,019
what are you doing?

246
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:06,019
And he said, I'm building a wall so I can feed my family.

247
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:07,019
He said, oh, that's pretty interesting.

248
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,019
And then he saw another guy laying bricks and went up to the third guy and said, what

249
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:12,019
are you doing?

250
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,019
And he said, I'm building a cathedral so I can serve God.

251
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:20,019
And it was just that notion of helping people find meaning in their work and connecting

252
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:24,019
that meaning back to them, I think, is one of the jobs of leaders.

253
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:27,019
Typically, people grow up in a company and they take for granted.

254
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:32,019
As they get more senior, they understand why the organization is there and what it's doing,

255
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:37,019
but they then forget that you need to explain that to people and you need to help people

256
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,019
connect.

257
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:42,019
The best way I like to bring this to life is in my job in retail banking, I've visited

258
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:46,019
hundreds and hundreds of bank branches over the years.

259
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:50,019
Often, when I'd go in and introduce myself around, I'd say, hi, I'm Brian.

260
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:51,019
What's your name?

261
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:53,019
The person might say, I'm Ellen.

262
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:55,019
Then she'd say, I'm just a teller.

263
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:00,019
I always used to say that if someone said to me, I'm just a teller, I knew that the

264
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:05,019
manager was no good because they weren't helping that person understand how important their

265
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:09,019
role was as being the face of the organization to the customers.

266
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,019
It's just that.

267
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,019
It's giving that.

268
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:15,019
It's giving that people a sense of meaning, a sense of purpose, and connecting that purpose

269
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:17,019
with something that's important to them.

270
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:23,019
You worked in large organizations for lots of your career and 40,000 staff, or they're

271
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:26,019
close enough in the Westpac example.

272
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:30,019
For people that are listening to this and maybe starting a small business or have got

273
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,019
a handful of people, does that relate?

274
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:35,019
Can you still explain purpose and context in the same way?

275
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:36,019
Yeah, I think so.

276
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:40,019
I don't think that people get out of bed in the morning to go and grow shareholder value.

277
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,019
Or go and create product, create profitability.

278
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:47,019
That should be an outcome of a good business.

279
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:51,019
If the purpose is just to make money for the boss, that's not the kind of thing that's

280
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:52,019
going to sustain people.

281
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:56,019
In the same way, I don't think people are going to stay motivated just because they're

282
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:57,019
getting paid.

283
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:02,019
If you think about your own career in football, you didn't do it because you were a highly

284
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:03,019
paid sportsman.

285
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:04,019
That was a benefit.

286
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:09,019
You did it because of how it made you feel and what you were a part of and the sense

287
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:10,019
of achievement.

288
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:14,019
There was a clear sense of, in the best footy teams, there's a clear sense of purpose and

289
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:22,019
camaraderie and so forth that transcends just this outcome of winning games.

290
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,019
That's a measure of it.

291
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:27,019
I think it's just helping people understand that there is meaning.

292
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:31,019
I think that can be as important in a small business as a big business.

293
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,019
It certainly resonated with me.

294
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:36,019
I love your idea of celebrating along the way.

295
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:39,019
It's something that we weren't particularly good at in sport.

296
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:42,019
Brian, you're always told, until you win the grand final or the championship, that's

297
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:43,019
your time to celebrate.

298
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:48,019
If you didn't ever get to win one of those, was your career a failure all the way along,

299
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:50,019
not celebrating the little things along the way?

300
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:52,019
Something you point out really clearly.

301
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:55,019
You talk a lot about clarity, but clear the way was an interesting concept that you've

302
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,019
got as part of your thesis.

303
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:01,019
Can you explain what you mean by clearing the way?

304
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:08,019
What I found is that often leaders don't recognize the barriers that their people face

305
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:13,019
to success, either because they're just simply not aware of them or because they've forgotten

306
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:18,019
what it's like to be a person in that particular role.

307
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:22,019
I found that it's really important, once people have clarity as to what's expected of them,

308
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:26,019
that you actually, from time to time, are asking, how are you going?

309
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:27,019
What's getting in the way?

310
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:29,019
Is there anything we can do to help?

311
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:34,019
Often, those barriers can be people don't have the resources, they don't have the training,

312
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,019
they don't have the emotional resilience.

313
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:37,019
It can be all sorts of things.

314
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:42,019
It's up to the leader to actually take an interest and try to find those things out.

315
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:47,019
Sometimes, it might be that when people come into an organization, they take for granted

316
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:53,019
certain constraints, which a more senior person might not recognize.

317
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:58,019
If they don't make an effort to go out and look at what's holding people up, they can't

318
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,019
intervene and fix things so that people can be more successful.

319
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:06,019
You once got a standing ovation, I understand, because you fixed a copy machine.

320
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:07,019
Yeah.

321
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:10,019
That was where the whole thing started for me.

322
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,019
I was a new leader of a business.

323
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:16,019
I went to give a presentation to an operations team that was in my business.

324
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:21,019
I felt pretty impressed with myself, giving my slick PowerPoint presentation.

325
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:24,019
I thought everyone was going to be really excited with the brilliance of my strategy.

326
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:29,019
They all sat there, po-faced, looking at me.

327
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:31,019
I asked for some questions and got nothing.

328
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:35,019
Then, eventually, said something to the effect that I'm not leaving until I get a question.

329
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,019
Some guy at the back of the room put his hand up and said,

330
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,019
Can we have a new copy machine?

331
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:41,019
Which was not at all the question I was expecting.

332
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:44,019
I said, What's up with the copy machine?

333
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:46,019
He said, Well, ours breaks down all the time.

334
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,019
I said, Well, do you need that to do your jobs?

335
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:53,019
He said, Yeah, there's often 70 people standing in a queue waiting for the copy machine to be fixed.

336
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,019
I said, Well, that's ridiculous.

337
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:57,019
Okay, of course you can have a new copy machine.

338
00:15:57,019 --> 00:15:59,019
Suddenly, everyone got incredibly excited.

339
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:03,019
I said to them later, Why don't you have a new copy machine?

340
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:05,019
They said, Oh, well, the management said that we didn't have the budget for it.

341
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:16,019
I was able to go and have a fairly short and sharp conversation with the manager of the area about how to think about managing budgets and fix the issue.

342
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:18,019
Suddenly, everybody felt empowered.

343
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:25,019
They felt like, Okay, the leaders are finally here to make our jobs easier rather than just heap more pain on our heads.

344
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:32,019
I think even though a very small thing and an easy thing for me to say yes to, it had a pretty profound impact in terms of the message I was trying to send.

345
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:34,019
Brian, I read with Ian.

346
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:44,019
I read with interest that you spoke about some of the managers, some of the people you worked under initially that had the most effect, that maybe taught you the most, were also some of the most unreasonable.

347
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:45,019
What do you mean by that?

348
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:46,019
Yeah, I'm glad you picked up on that.

349
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,019
Not many people have asked me about that.

350
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:54,019
It's just one of these reflections that most people want to be liked, and I'm certainly no different.

351
00:16:54,019 --> 00:17:01,019
That's been something that I've become aware of over the years, and it can hold you back in terms of having difficult conversations.

352
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:16,019
When I've been reflecting on my own journey as a leader, one of the things that I recognized was that a couple of the bosses I had when I was starting out were total assholes and really, really difficult.

353
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:23,019
Now, funny enough, I learned way more from them than I learned from people who took it easy on me.

354
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:29,019
Over the years, I came to appreciate that, really, they just had incredibly high standards.

355
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:30,019
Yes, they were a bit uncomfortable.

356
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:31,019
Yeah.

357
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:33,019
They were unskilled in how they dealt with that.

358
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:38,019
But I would not have been as successful as I was able to be if they hadn't pushed me.

359
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:49,019
And so it's just, I guess, something to reflect on is, as a leader, are you pushing your people or are you holding back because you're afraid they're not going to like you?

360
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:50,019
Where's that balance?

361
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:56,019
There's a quote that you also had, a CEO friend of yours said, hey, Brian, your ability to reduce misery is greater than you think too.

362
00:17:56,019 --> 00:18:00,019
So how do you find that line between high expectation and not, as you said, being a complete loser?

363
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:05,019
Yeah, I think that you have to have certainty.

364
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:11,019
The way I process it for myself is you've got to have a level of certainty as to what you need to achieve as a team.

365
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:20,019
And if you're certain about that and you convey that to people, then they understand where you're coming from with that standard that you set.

366
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:25,019
And you can be straightforward about that's not good enough or I need more than that.

367
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:28,019
And I have confidence that you can do that.

368
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:37,019
I think there's a way to do it and be very, very clear and blunt when you need to without people feeling like you don't value them as a person.

369
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:45,019
And I think if you do that right, I had an executive who worked for me at Westpac who was amazing at this.

370
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:57,019
He came in and he said to, he was in technology, and he came in and he said to his team, guys, our performance in terms of the uptime of our systems is just nowhere near good enough.

371
00:18:57,019 --> 00:19:03,019
And my intention and our aspiration is we want to have a world-class technology function.

372
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:08,019
And if we want to be world-class, then this has to be way better than it is.

373
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:13,019
And because he approached it from that standpoint, people were like, oh, yeah, I want to be part of a world-class team.

374
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:17,019
And so he could be very blunt with people going, that is not world-class.

375
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:19,019
World-class is over here.

376
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:22,019
And so everyone was very clear what they needed to get to.

377
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:24,019
And sure, not everybody made it.

378
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:26,019
But a lot of people who perhaps didn't make it.

379
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:27,019
Yeah.

380
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:36,019
And perhaps might have been thought of not being up to it turned out to be able to achieve a lot just because he was clear about what the aspiration was and why.

381
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:37,019
Yeah, it makes sense.

382
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:48,019
I think relating to we grew up in an era of sport, I think, where the coaches, one would or probably only plan was personal abuse and just to see if they could break people down.

383
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:50,019
If you survived, you got through.

384
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:52,019
But there wasn't any subtlety to that.

385
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:56,019
I think it spawned a generation for me of the next generation of coaches here in Australia and I think overseas.

386
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:57,019
They're still tough.

387
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:58,019
They still set high criteria.

388
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:03,019
But there is an element of empathy that goes with it as well and an element of fairness, I suppose.

389
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:06,019
I think they've worked out that perhaps the personal abuse doesn't work right.

390
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:07,019
Yeah.

391
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:11,019
Well, you might not be too thrilled with this, but I've actually been a Richmond Tigers supporter for 27 years.

392
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:22,019
And I'm incredibly proud of that association when I look at the way they rebuilt that team over the last few years and all the work they did as a team in terms of supporting each other.

393
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:24,019
I think it's really inspirational and shows it can actually work.

394
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:25,019
Yeah.

395
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:26,019
It is.

396
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:27,019
I'm not thrilled about it, Brian.

397
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:29,019
I think you picked the wrong group.

398
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,019
But they are a great story of leadership themselves.

399
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:46,019
And knowing those guys, Peggy from a board point of view and Brendan Gayle as a CEO and Damien Hardwick together, along with the whole team and the players, it's a fantastic story of turning that into an incredibly successful organization.

400
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:48,019
I want to talk about self-reflection.

401
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:50,019
You've got that at the middle of what you do and who you are.

402
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:52,019
And you're open to that.

403
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,019
And I love you talking about the fact you've had a coach.

404
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,019
The fact you've had a coach for a lot of your life.

405
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:04,019
And you're pretty open about working through stuff in your childhood and your parent separation and your relationship with your dad.

406
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:07,019
Can you explain that a little bit more and how beneficial that's been to you?

407
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:08,019
Yeah.

408
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:14,019
So it started with doing one of these 360-degree feedback exercises about 20 years ago.

409
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:21,019
And this woman was sent in to give me the good news, so to speak, on the feedback that I'd gotten.

410
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:23,019
And it started with this feedback.

411
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:29,019
And it started with this feedback that my colleagues said a lot of really nice things, but then they said, he's not very collaborative.

412
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:39,019
And I was really taken aback by that and kind of rejected the feedback because I thought, well, I would never do something in my benefit against the interest of a colleague.

413
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:41,019
And I'd always help people who ask.

414
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:44,019
And so I thought there was something wrong with the feedback.

415
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:47,019
And I resented it and kind of rejected it for three or four months.

416
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:51,019
And then eventually, in talking to this woman, who turned out to be incredibly insightful.

417
00:21:51,019 --> 00:22:03,019
I realized that what people were experiencing was driven by some stuff that was going on in my head and that I needed to deal with that.

418
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:05,019
And then the problem resolved itself.

419
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:12,019
So in my mind, I was insecure about my own ability as a manager because I was new to this big job.

420
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:18,019
And so I thought that the best way I could help everybody was by doing my job well because I wasn't sure I was up to it.

421
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:20,019
And she said to me, well, you know what?

422
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:23,019
She said to me, well, people can't see that.

423
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:26,019
All they see is you're only interested in your own stuff.

424
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:33,019
And once I realized that, and the thing that she said after that is, and by the way, you've had two good years, so actually you are up to it.

425
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:38,019
So why don't you just give yourself a tick and stop worrying so much about whether or not you can do this job.

426
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:40,019
You can do this job.

427
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:47,019
And actually, it was like a switch was flicked in my mind where I kind of gave myself a pass and went, yeah, okay, I can do this.

428
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:49,019
And so I stopped being so stressed out about that.

429
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:54,019
And that meant I had more brain space to be generous and helpful with other people.

430
00:22:54,019 --> 00:23:10,019
And I guess that was the start of recognizing that the beliefs I had about myself or the experiences that maybe bad experiences I had in the past that I was trying to avoid was having a flow-on effect into the way I dealt with people.

431
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:18,019
And so I have really become a big believer in the fact that the way people experience you is a consequence of the way they see you.

432
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:23,019
It's a consequence of what's going on internally, not just what you're trying to project.

433
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:25,019
And it's much easier to work on.

434
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:28,019
I mean, it's harder in a sense because you have to confront some stuff.

435
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:36,019
But if you can sort yourself out internally, then it gets easier because you're more able to just be yourself.

436
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:39,019
And that ends up being effective, if that makes sense.

437
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:40,019
Yeah, it does.

438
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,019
There's a great quote that you referenced.

439
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,019
Becoming a leader is synonymous with becoming yourself.

440
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:46,019
It's precisely that simple, and it's also that difficult.

441
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:48,019
I love that, Warren.

442
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:49,019
That's a fantastic quote.

443
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:56,019
And to me, I love that, to me, you don't think of CEOs of banks being self-reflective and vulnerable.

444
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:59,019
And I suppose there's stereotypes about footballers and sports people as well.

445
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:03,019
But were you open with those under you, that this was something you did and you worked on yourself?

446
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:04,019
Yeah.

447
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:10,019
Because to me, it helps a lot of other people to understand that it's perfectly normal and it helps you to be the person you want to be.

448
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:11,019
Yeah, absolutely.

449
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:17,019
I suppose a combination of taking a risk in that and just being pretty open about that sort of thing,

450
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:22,019
with a view that hopefully that encourages other people to do the same.

451
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:28,019
Because I've certainly learned that you build relationships by being willing to be vulnerable with people.

452
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:29,019
Relationships are about trust.

453
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:32,019
Trust is about vulnerability, actually.

454
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:35,019
And so I had to model that.

455
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:39,019
It's no good to tell everyone else to fix themselves and then pretend I'm perfect.

456
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,019
But actually starting with, look, here's what I'm working on.

457
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:46,019
I want to hear your feedback, and you'll see me trying to deal with that.

458
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:52,019
Once I can demonstrate being genuine about that, it's a lot easier for me to expect that of other people.

459
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:56,019
The other thing I found, it sounds silly, but there's an element of laziness about it,

460
00:24:56,019 --> 00:25:04,019
which I found it's just much easier to actually be myself than to try to be some stereotype of how you ought to be.

461
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:09,019
And I guess somewhere along in my career, I just decided I was just going to be myself.

462
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:14,019
And sure, you have to tune your frequency a bit for different situations.

463
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:15,019
And there's a level of accuracy.

464
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:17,019
There's a level of acting that's involved.

465
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:20,019
And when you're running a big organization, you have to play certain roles.

466
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:28,019
But I found ways to try to do that and have them all be true to who I was rather than being fake about it.

467
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:39,779
A lot of people would listen and think, God, the banking world and the finance world that you've been immersed in

468
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:42,779
and been a great success right throughout your career.

469
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:47,779
It's alpha male, a lot of ego, a lot of politics at times.

470
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:48,779
Was it challenging?

471
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:49,779
Did that challenge other people?

472
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:50,779
Was it your style?

473
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:53,779
Perhaps he's a little bit more vulnerable than others before you?

474
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:54,779
Occasionally.

475
00:25:54,779 --> 00:26:00,779
And these are really interesting points that you're highlighting.

476
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:08,779
So the alpha male thing, there was one point in my career where I found that actually the environment,

477
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:11,779
the people I was working with just really didn't work for me.

478
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,779
And it was just I wasn't enjoying getting out of bed and going to work.

479
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:18,779
And it took a while, but I left as a consequence.

480
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,779
I just decided life's not going to be the same.

481
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,779
Life's too short to put up with assholes, actually.

482
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:30,779
And to the extent that I've had control over the people who work for me in selecting the team,

483
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:37,779
I've always had a philosophy of I want to work with people who are world-class at what they do but are also nice people.

484
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:42,779
And just because an element of it is just life's too short to just deal with incredibly difficult people.

485
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:48,779
And I don't think that people like that in the end are good for big organizations either.

486
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:52,779
I think things have evolved a bit in big companies and financial services.

487
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:58,779
I think there's a lot more people probably who've come through and had the support that I've had along the way.

488
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:03,779
And I think there's much more of an understanding that you do need to have that element of humanity

489
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:07,779
when you're trying to get people engaged in what you're doing.

490
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:11,779
It really makes sense because that's something that I'm really passionate about, Brian,

491
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:16,779
in some of the work I'm doing at the moment is that idea that you spend a lot of time at work.

492
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:19,779
A lot of your well-being is generated by the people you're around.

493
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:25,779
And I suppose to me, you don't have to be the CEO of a bank or the captain of a footy team to have an impact.

494
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:29,779
And you can have an impact on the person sitting next to you and your environment.

495
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:31,779
Your philosophies to me relate to all that.

496
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:32,779
You show care.

497
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:35,779
That's not something that a leader can only be exclusive to.

498
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:40,779
Or you can create clarity for people around you and you can celebrate little wins.

499
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:42,779
And that language works for people.

500
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:46,779
But then when you bring more people along who've got bigger influence in managerial work,

501
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:51,779
managerial roles, who then show that sort of empathy and compassion and clarity along the line,

502
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:53,779
it changes people's lives, doesn't it?

503
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:58,779
Because people sitting in disengaged workforces tend to be miserable and unhealthy and unhappy

504
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:00,779
and it has a big impact on their life.

505
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:01,779
Absolutely.

506
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:04,779
I mean, I'm a believer that when you get engagement right,

507
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:07,779
it does have an impact on the performance of an organization.

508
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:13,779
But equally, it's just far more satisfying to work in an organization where people really want to be there.

509
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:15,779
They're excited about what they're doing.

510
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:19,779
And certainly, having left Westpac,

511
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:26,779
it is incredibly satisfying when you speak to people who were there a couple of years ago when I was there

512
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:31,779
who still reflect on how much it meant to them to be in the organization at that time

513
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:36,779
and how grateful they are for the way I was able to do things.

514
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:43,779
And that is an incredible satisfaction that transcends just the scoreboard.

515
00:28:43,779 --> 00:28:44,779
Yeah.

516
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:45,779
And I'll ask you about that.

517
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:48,779
I mean, you're looking for people with your success stories.

518
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:51,779
You're trying to find, hey, was there a moment where you had a challenge to face

519
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:55,779
and you've had a really public challenge to face on the back of the Royal Banking Commission

520
00:28:55,779 --> 00:29:01,779
and the subsequent issues regulatory that I suppose ultimately resulted in your departure from Westpac.

521
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:05,779
But you have a great sense of calmness about it and your language.

522
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:08,779
There was a great line that I read of yours, you know,

523
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:11,779
the privilege of leadership comes with accountability.

524
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:12,779
You might have caused it.

525
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:13,779
You might not have even known about it.

526
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:15,779
But the ultimate responsibility rests with you.

527
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:20,779
How did you find that calmness in such a public – the world was looking for a scalp

528
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:24,779
and unfortunately Brian Hartz's name was at the top of the tree.

529
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:25,779
Yeah.

530
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:28,779
Two things I'd say about – well, actually, there's three points I'd make about that.

531
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:31,779
So one was I knew what I was getting into.

532
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:36,779
So I had worked in the UK under a fellow called Stephen Hester running RBS.

533
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,779
RBS is the biggest bank failure in history.

534
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:40,779
Stephen was hired to fix it.

535
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,779
But everyone forgot that as soon as he was hired and started blaming him for it.

536
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:47,779
He had photographers trailing him when he'd go out for a run in the morning.

537
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:50,779
You know, it was just unbelievably abusive over there in the press.

538
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:52,779
And so I saw that.

539
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:56,779
And I always understood when I signed up for this job that that could happen.

540
00:29:56,779 --> 00:29:59,779
Regardless, it's just – there's an element of symbolism.

541
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:03,779
People personalize organizations into the CEO.

542
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:08,779
And so if they're frustrated about something, they want to, as you say, find a scalp.

543
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:11,779
So number one, I knew going in that was a possibility.

544
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:12,779
And I think, therefore, you know, it's a good thing.

545
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:16,779
Therefore, in a sense, I wasn't that surprised when it finally happened.

546
00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:21,779
It was like, okay, well, you know, that's a possibility that I've got to live with.

547
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:30,779
I think the second thing was I learned a number of years ago to separate how I felt about my career success from how I felt about myself as a person.

548
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:34,779
And I think that is a really, really important lesson that I learned.

549
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:41,779
It took a lot of stress out of my life because particularly as you get more senior in a large organization,

550
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:44,779
you can't control everything that's going to happen.

551
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:45,779
You can do your best.

552
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:46,779
You can work hard.

553
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:48,779
You can try and make good choices.

554
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:49,779
You can treat people well.

555
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:52,779
But in the end, there's a fair amount of randomness in life.

556
00:30:52,779 --> 00:31:00,779
And I happened to be the CEO at a time when the industry was going through what it went through and where regulators were doing what they did.

557
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:03,779
And so that's just my lot.

558
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,779
I did my best, but I had to accept that that could happen.

559
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:10,779
And so it was more important that how I feel about myself is driven by what I do.

560
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:15,779
It's driven by am I happy with the way I've made decisions?

561
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,779
Am I happy with the way I behaved?

562
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:18,779
Have I tried hard?

563
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:21,779
Have I been careful and thoughtful?

564
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,779
Have I treated people well?

565
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:26,779
Have I looked after my family and my friends?

566
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:29,779
And if I've done that, then I'm okay with myself.

567
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:34,779
And my mantra is all I can do is all I can do, and it will be what it will be.

568
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:38,779
And so I've tried to live that for the last probably 15 years.

569
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:41,779
And it's meant that I haven't experienced a huge amount of success.

570
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:51,779
Certainly, I find things in family life way more stressful typically than business stuff because I can control how I feel about myself based on that behavior.

571
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:55,779
And if we have a great month in the company, terrific.

572
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:57,779
If we have a bad month, that's a shame.

573
00:31:57,779 --> 00:31:59,779
But in both cases, it's, okay, what do we learn?

574
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:00,779
What do we need to do?

575
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:05,779
I don't try to internalize, hey, I'm brilliant because we had a good month last month.

576
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:08,779
Equally, I'm not terrible because we had a bad month last month.

577
00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:10,779
And because I built that up as a habit, that made it easier.

578
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:18,779
The third thing I would say, and this might sound a little corny, but I appreciate the opportunity to share this with people having gone through it.

579
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:26,779
When it finished, I had a conversation with my children, and I said, there's one real lesson that I want to share with you out of this.

580
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:38,779
And that is that I knew shortly after I got the job as CEO, I remember having this conversation with myself recognizing that I was going to be faced with challenges and choices

581
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:50,779
where I could make a choice that was maybe good for me or safe for me, or I could make a choice that I thought was right for the company and right for the people, but might put me personally at risk.

582
00:32:50,779 --> 00:33:00,779
And I made a decision that whenever I faced that, I was always going to do what I thought was right for the company, and I wasn't going to worry about what it meant for me.

583
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:06,779
And the consequence of that, of never choosing to protect myself and being willing to take risks, even if it was something that I didn't want to do, was that I was going to be faced with a lot of challenges.

584
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:07,779
I was going to be faced with a lot of challenges.

585
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:08,779
I was going to be faced with a lot of challenges.

586
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:15,779
And the fact that I had to leave, even if they had negative consequences for me, meant that when I did leave, I had a totally clear conscience.

587
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:20,779
And that was unbelievably important.

588
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:36,779
It sounds like a really obvious thing, like you tell your kids when they're five years old, but the fact that I never compromised my values in the decisions I made in order to protect myself or advance myself meant that I could leave without any regrets.

589
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:37,779
And if I had cut a corner.

590
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:46,859
cut a corner or tried to protect myself or not been courageous and then gotten something gone

591
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:53,299
wrong, I'd be beating myself up for the rest of my life. And I'm not. And that's a really good

592
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:59,059
place to be. And Brian, I think you can't fake the way you look and sound and feel. I think that's

593
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:04,000
just a testament to the authenticity that you share. I was just, as you were talking, thinking

594
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,940
about a wedding I went to a number of years ago. And as you do at weddings, you sometimes get to

595
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,500
sit next to someone and you turn around, you shake the hand of the person next to you, introduce

596
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:18,639
yourself. And this guy was really successful in the construction industry and made lots and lots

597
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,800
of money. And the GFC had just hit literally a week before. And he'd seen all of his net wealth

598
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,920
evaporate before his eye. I've never, ever sat next to a sadder person in my life. It was almost

599
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,760
to the point where you just couldn't engage at all. And it was just the sadness.

600
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
You could just tell his wellbeing and his life was attached to the financial success of his

601
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,500
career. And clearly it was raw and fresh, so in fairness. But what you're saying is that you've,

602
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:48,960
over a long period of time, been able to disengage your work life, your success with that family.

603
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:53,119
And obviously there's a great life lesson, isn't it, for you now? Because I look at you and you

604
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,920
look content, happy. You've got great stuff happening in your life post-banking. Can you

605
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,019
actually look back and think, I wouldn't choose that to be the case, but now that it's happened,

606
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,579
it's fine and it's a good chapter coming up?

607
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,320
Well, I am excited about the things I'm doing now. I'm certainly enjoying it.

608
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:12,239
I always knew that that role would only ever be a chapter in my life. And I think that was

609
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:18,920
also part of that same story. But I'm not going to pretend that I'm happy with the way that it

610
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:24,420
worked out. I wish it hadn't happened. And I wish I'd had a few more years to complete the agenda

611
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:30,679
that we were working on when I was there. I accept that that's what happens in life. Life

612
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:35,219
is what happens after you make plans. And one of the other things that people sometimes find

613
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:40,059
amusing is I used to joke that I had a list of things to do when I got fired, which I really

614
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:47,599
did. And one of which was to write that book. And it did help to remind myself from time to time that

615
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,639
there would be another chapter after that. And that I needed to think about what were the sorts

616
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:58,260
of things that I was going to want to do with myself so that I didn't suddenly find that my

617
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,519
world had ended. And can you share some of those

618
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:00,659
things? I think that's a great question. I think that's a great question. I think that's a great

619
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:05,159
I know you've jumped on as the, on the museum board and you're doing some work

620
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:11,699
with Luke Sayers here in Melbourne as well. Is this next chapter going to be as fulfilling

621
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:14,739
and successful as you'd hoped? Well, I hope it'll be good. A lot of what I'm doing,

622
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:18,840
so I'm really enjoying the museum. It's a really good time with the Australian Museum in Sydney,

623
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:23,920
but I'm also doing a lot of what I'm doing is working with startups actually. So I've done a

624
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,599
number of angel investments and there are two, maybe three companies that I'll actually be

625
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:34,519
chairing as startups. And I really think it's an exciting time in the economy, the impact that

626
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:38,199
technology is having. And that was something I was always really interested in, but didn't get to

627
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:43,500
spend as much time on in my previous role. So it's this period has given me the chance to pick

628
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,280
things I find genuinely interesting and spend my time on those things. A lot of people will be

629
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,860
listening to this who are in the startup phase and I'm in that myself. What's the key? What do you

630
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:58,579
see as being the practical things? There's no guarantee of sustained success, but what are the

631
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:04,219
practical bits of advice you'd give? Well, gosh, one of the main things I often find

632
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:11,440
myself saying to startup founders is that you're trying to build a business, not a product. So yes,

633
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,659
you need to build your product. And people often come to startups with a tremendous obsession about

634
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:21,840
a particular problem or a particular thing they want to build or an innovation, which is great.

635
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,780
And you need that, but that isn't enough to make a business a success. You have to really think

636
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,960
about the whole system.

637
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:33,000
The business, the team you've got around you, what customers you're going to go to,

638
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:36,199
how you're going to sell, how you're going to support those customers over time.

639
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:42,719
So I guess I would just say, in the end, the basics of business still apply. Sure,

640
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:47,760
you might invent some unbelievable thing and some company from Silicon Valley comes and pays you a

641
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,239
billion dollars for your brilliant innovation, but that's pretty rare. More likely, you've actually

642
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:57,179
got to come up with something that people want to buy and figure out a system whereby you can

643
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:58,559
actually sell it to them and make a quid.

644
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:02,880
And it doesn't sound very sexy, but I think people sometimes

645
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,880
lose sight of some of the basics of business. And how important in that space, your book's

646
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,440
about the practical guide to building engagement, how important, again, it comes back to those

647
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,400
principles that you've lived and thought about for 30 years.

648
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:22,079
Well, it sounds like a cliche, but building a great team around you of people who complement

649
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,599
each other, enjoy spending time together, and are highly motivated to deliver something amazing

650
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:33,840
is one of the most important elements in any business. And so I think what I've tried to do

651
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,400
with the framework of Leadership Star is give people a way to think about the elements that

652
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,219
go into building that kind of a culture and keeping it sustainable. And hopefully, people

653
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:48,199
will find that helpful as they reflect on the way they want to build a team and build a culture.

654
00:38:48,739 --> 00:38:53,219
Brian, across this podcast, we're talking to a range of different leaders from the world of

655
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:58,260
sport and from industry and the arts. And we've been, at the end, just trying to get what we think

656
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:58,559
is the difference between a team and a culture. And I think that's really important. And I think

657
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:03,000
dimensions of leadership, and you've covered them a lot in your book, so it might be challenging

658
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,480
to answer them. Take as much time as you like. But I want to start with this handful, or finish

659
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,559
with this handful of questions, I should say. How would you describe self-leadership to you?

660
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:17,179
I think it's about knowing yourself, knowing what's important to you, what drives you,

661
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:22,099
what sort of contribution you want to make, understanding where you're at your best,

662
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:28,460
what your foibles are that you need to avoid and manage, and deciding to discipline yourself

663
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:33,000
to achieve the things that are going to help you have a meaningful life.

664
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,860
And how do you go about positively impacting others in your environment?

665
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:43,849
I guess I go back to starting with showing that you're interested in care about people

666
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:47,769
and are interested in what's important to them and helping them be successful in whatever

667
00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:53,070
journey in life they're on. And if people think that you genuinely wish them well and

668
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:57,130
are interested in helping them, then I think that goes a long way.

669
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:00,090
And how have you gone about creating and sharing?

670
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:07,570
Well, it depends on the situation. I guess I like to talk to people about the things that

671
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:12,409
I'm seeing that are going on externally, what I'm excited about, why I'm excited about it,

672
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:17,269
and depending on the situation, then how they can contribute to that and why that will be

673
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:22,750
an exciting thing to be part of. I think I've certainly gravitated to people who want to build

674
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:27,690
things, create things, make an impact in the world. And that's certainly what motivates me.

675
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:30,170
And I find that tends to be a very important part of my life. And I think that's what I'm

676
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:33,710
trying to bring people together to want to be part of that.

677
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:38,590
Yeah, brilliantly said. And what about your approach to learning and improvement? How would

678
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,170
you describe that?

679
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:46,969
Eclectic. If there's one thing that I have learned about myself, it's that a great strength,

680
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:52,409
I suppose, that's helped drive me is I'm just inherently curious. I'm really interested.

681
00:40:52,929 --> 00:40:55,710
Ever since I've been a kid, I've always been interested in how the world works,

682
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:59,449
how things work, what the system is that's going on behind the curtain.

683
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:08,170
And so I have allowed myself to indulge my curiosity by just diving into whatever I find

684
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:13,309
interesting and not... Occasionally, I'll force myself to read something that I think is important,

685
00:41:13,309 --> 00:41:18,469
but I do a lot of reading and I don't actually try to be that disciplined about it. I just kind

686
00:41:18,469 --> 00:41:21,289
of let them follow my nose as to what's interesting to me.

687
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:28,070
We started with the fact that you graduated from Princeton with a degree in European history.

688
00:41:28,409 --> 00:41:30,150
What took you to that path?

689
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:33,210
It's not necessarily linked from there to the banking and finance world.

690
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:36,550
Well, funny enough, yeah. When I went to university, I thought I would major in economics

691
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:42,730
because I was really interested in going into banking from a pretty early age. And I went to

692
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:47,869
a couple of economics classes and just thought, this has got nothing to do with business. I found

693
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:54,949
it really, really boring. And luckily, we weren't actually allowed to pick our major until halfway

694
00:41:54,949 --> 00:41:59,570
through the second year. And so I took lots of different courses. I took some politics classes,

695
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:00,150
and I just found it really, really interesting. And I thought, well, I'm going to do this.

696
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:07,150
I found, somewhat to my surprise, that I really loved my history classes. It was the ability to

697
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:13,010
burrow into a world and really try to understand a period of time or why something had happened or

698
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:17,369
the people that were involved in something and what motivated them. And I enjoyed the process

699
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:24,150
of researching and writing. And what I ended up finding was that studying history was a fantastic

700
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:29,389
preparation for what I ended up doing in management consulting because it taught me to find sources

701
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:33,969
of information, absorb huge amounts of information, synthesize that, and try and communicate it

702
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:38,969
clearly with a point of view. And that was essentially what I ended up doing in management

703
00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:47,090
consulting in a way. And ever since then, I guess it gave me a useful skill to be able to synthesize

704
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:54,269
a lot of different bits of information and try to communicate that fairly clearly. And that has

705
00:42:54,269 --> 00:42:59,489
been immensely helpful. So I continue to read lots of history books just for fun. But I actually

706
00:42:59,489 --> 00:43:00,150
think it's interesting to me that I've been able to do that. And I think it's really, really

707
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:05,269
underappreciated as a training ground for future business leaders.

708
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:10,409
Yeah. And you mentioned the communication with clarity. How have you gone about that

709
00:43:10,409 --> 00:43:17,489
throughout your career? Well, I started out just doing writing. And the training I had in

710
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:22,409
management consulting was a lot about writing clearly and endless editing to make things simple

711
00:43:22,409 --> 00:43:29,170
and easy. And we were actually taught to write from a particular expert in that that helped me

712
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:30,150
see that it was a good thing. And I think that's what I've been able to do.

713
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:35,530
I guess communication beyond that, I've just always been interested in this question of how do

714
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:43,590
you communicate with impact? And there's a fantastic book that I came across, which has

715
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:49,550
kind of become my communication Bible, which is called Made to Stick by Chip and Dan Heath.

716
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:54,969
I highly, highly recommend it. And they essentially talk about what is it that makes some

717
00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:59,969
communication stick and others be forgotten. And they talk about the importance of communication.

718
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:04,429
The importance of stories and the importance of telling emotionally connecting stories that

719
00:44:04,429 --> 00:44:11,210
have a level of concreteness about them that can cut through. And so in my communications

720
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:16,769
in corporate life, I've tried really hard to think about using those principles about

721
00:44:16,769 --> 00:44:22,309
what's the message I want to tell and how can I tell a story that people can remember that's

722
00:44:22,309 --> 00:44:26,469
going to really bring this to life. Yeah. The art of storytelling. And you do tell a great story

723
00:44:26,469 --> 00:44:29,929
about a trip to Disneyland and the impact. You wouldn't link Disneyland necessarily back to

724
00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:34,150
customer service and banking, but by the leadership star. And I encourage you to read

725
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:39,809
that one. It was a great example of using your day-to-day life in a great storytelling way.

726
00:44:39,809 --> 00:44:44,250
You mentioned earlier about you took the 360 degree feedback not so well at the start around

727
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:50,010
collaboration and you went and did some work on yourself. And then that really unlocked your

728
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:54,849
world of collaboration. How do you do that now? How do you collaborate and what's your method?

729
00:44:55,809 --> 00:44:59,949
Well, I think because I'm now seeing myself as being

730
00:44:59,969 --> 00:45:04,349
there to help other people fundamentally. From a corporate point of view, I had the

731
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:10,269
incredible privilege of getting to lead Australia's oldest company and one of the largest companies. So

732
00:45:10,269 --> 00:45:17,670
there's nothing that's likely to top that from an external measure of leadership point of view.

733
00:45:17,769 --> 00:45:23,610
So I kind of feel like, you know, tick. I kind of did that. And so now for me, it's much more about

734
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:29,010
how can I help make an impact by helping other people? So I don't really spend a lot of time

735
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:29,690
worrying about...

736
00:45:29,969 --> 00:45:38,110
Me or what I want to achieve. My contribution, my success is helping other people be successful

737
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:43,030
and bringing to bear the experiences and the knowledge that I've gained. And so I guess

738
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:49,150
I'd like to think I'm almost 100% collaborative now because everything I'm doing is to try to

739
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:52,929
help other people be successful. Yeah, beautifully said. And it comes

740
00:45:52,929 --> 00:45:58,690
across in your words in the leadership style. A final question, Brian, I have been asking this

741
00:45:58,690 --> 00:45:59,849
regularly to...

742
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:04,409
To people who've joined me on this podcast. Who would you, if you thought about the greatest

743
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:06,550
leader in your life, is there someone that comes to mind?

744
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,969
Oh, boy. There's not one person that necessarily stands out, but there've been a few people who've

745
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:18,969
been just incredibly important in different ways. Starting with my father, who was the sort of

746
00:46:18,969 --> 00:46:23,909
person that achieved an immense amount in life coming from pretty humble background and never

747
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:29,289
forgot where he came from and always made everybody he met like him and feel special.

748
00:46:29,849 --> 00:46:36,530
And set a fantastic standard for me on how to treat people and how to be enthusiastic for other

749
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:40,989
people's success. So I think I dedicated the book at the start when I was thinking about how to

750
00:46:40,989 --> 00:46:44,309
dedicate. I realized that actually everything I've written in the book, one way or another,

751
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:51,610
my father taught me without me realizing it. And as I've reflected back, I'm just feeling

752
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:56,670
incredibly privileged from what I've learned from him. Beyond that, though, I've been really

753
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:59,829
blessed to work for some amazing leaders of different countries. I've been able to work with

754
00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:08,150
different types and also to see some incredible people who work for me, who I learned an immense

755
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:12,010
amount from about leadership. Miriam is a great example. We talked about Miriam earlier.

756
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:12,530
Yeah.

757
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:18,730
You know, the way she leads teams of people is amazing. I mean, I'll just give you an example

758
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:22,610
on that one. When I caught up with Miriam just before I published the book to make sure she was

759
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:26,110
okay with what I was going to say about her, she said, oh, she did absolutely. She said, oh,

760
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:29,829
by the way, you know, I'm still in touch with those people. And I said, what? And she said,

761
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:35,829
yeah. She said, I'd go up to Hong Kong once a year. We'd have a reunion. And everybody from

762
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:40,630
the business comes, including the guy who used to clean the office. And they invite me to their

763
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:46,389
weddings and send baby photos. And just as a reminder, these are people she fired.

764
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:56,809
And so just learning when you see someone like that and you realize how much care and love you

765
00:47:56,809 --> 00:47:59,829
can actually bring to a work environment and how that's going to affect your life. And I think that's

766
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:05,750
incredible. And I think that pays incredible dividends in your life. It really is. Well,

767
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:09,849
for me, it's been quite inspirational. Brian, it's been a great pleasure to spend some time

768
00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:14,130
with you. I encourage everyone. The Leadership Star is a fantastic practical guide to building

769
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:18,969
engagement is the full title, but it genuinely is this practical things for everyone, no matter

770
00:48:18,969 --> 00:48:23,989
where you sit in any organization or in life. It's a great achievement, Brian, to put that

771
00:48:23,989 --> 00:48:27,070
to paper. And thanks again. Really appreciate your time today.

772
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,530
Absolutely. Well, it's a real honor to get to meet you. And

773
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:31,750
I've really enjoyed the conversation. So thank you.
