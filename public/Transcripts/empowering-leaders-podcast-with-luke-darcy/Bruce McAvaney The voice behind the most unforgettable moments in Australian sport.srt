1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:09,880
It was in the middle of the Olympics, I'm fully warmed up to us, but that Monday morning

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,699
I knew it was different.

3
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:14,160
Out they walk for the women's 400 metre final, my mouth goes dry completely.

4
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,899
I feel a sense of, wow, I'm in trouble.

5
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:21,079
They'll be called to the set in just a moment.

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,820
Hello and welcome to another episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,479
At Alita, we are passionate about inspiring connections and creating a world of collaboration.

8
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,799
Our signature program, Alita Connect, curates groups of five to six leaders from diverse

9
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,960
backgrounds in sport, industry, social venture, and the arts who come together to learn, to

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,939
connect, and to collaborate.

11
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,280
Kirsten King, founder of Fluidform Pilates.

12
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,619
It's been amazing.

13
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:53,979
Here you are on this Zoom call, feeling within the first session like you intimately know

14
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:58,479
these people and care for them, and then all of a sudden realising that even though you're

15
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,460
in totally different industries, we're all going through the same thing.

16
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:08,879
Or we've been through it and we can help each other, or there's just this hurdle that

17
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:15,560
you can't see past, and then you share it with the group and there's five answers in

18
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,620
40 minutes, and you think, I have not slept for two weeks thinking about that.

19
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,299
Like, how is this possible?

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,700
Craig McRae, senior coach of the Collingwood Football Club.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,799
You're listening to stories and breadcrumbs of what makes success, and I constantly get

22
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,459
something out of these Zoom calls and catch-ups, because we're all living the same stuff,

23
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:35,739
aren't we?

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,120
Extraordinary people with extraordinary experience.

25
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:40,819
What happens there is magical.

26
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:46,680
The Empowering Leaders podcast is proudly brought to you by Victoria University, where cutting-edge

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,180

00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,120
environments mean VU is ranked seventh in the world for sports science.

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,319
VU, uniquely you.

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,760

31
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,239

33
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,479
if you have a moment, we would love you to leave a review so we can reach more listeners

34
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,960
and empower more leaders.

35
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,300
For over four decades, Bruce McIverney has been one of the world's most iconic and respected

36
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,259
sports broadcasters, a Hall of Fame broadcaster, an Australian Football Hall of Famer who has

37
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:30,740
earned a legendary reputation as the voice of some of the most iconic sporting events

38
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,340
on the planet.

39
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,900
Including a remarkable 12 Summer Olympic Games, I'm going to make sure I get my stats

40
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,039
right here as I look across at Bruce, who I'm sure will tell me if I get this wrong,

41
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,560
20 Australian Rules Grand Finals, World Athletic Championships, World Swimming Championships,

42
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:46,979
the Melbourne Cup, the Rugby World Cup, and countless more.

43
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,879
Bruce McIverney's passion and expertise has seen him become as much of Australia's sporting

44
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:57,039
culture as the games themselves, a broadcasting giant whose voice is synonymous with some

45
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,439
of the most iconic moments in the history of sport.

46
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,900
Macca, great pleasure to see you.

47
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,219
Thank you.

48
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:01,580
Thank you.

49
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,659
It's quite a build-up, Darcy.

50
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,819
Now, Darcy, I'll get one thing straight.

51
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,199
I don't keep stats on myself.

52
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,879
I've got no idea how many of these things I've done unless I ring Josh Kay and say,

53
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:13,340
Josh, help me out, who you know from Channel 7.

54
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,500
So, generically speaking, you were spot on.

55
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,919
With the detail, I'd have to check.

56
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:24,039
We'll get an email from Josh Kay if it's more than 12 Summer Olympics, I'm sure.

57
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:26,659
But I think I've probably undersold you on every…

58
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:29,520
No, I think you've made me blush, to be truthful.

59
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,439
But what…

60
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:35,360
When I hear all that, Darcy, what I think is, ooh, I've had some opportunities.

61
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,699
That's what I think.

62
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,439
How fortunate I've been.

63
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,699
When I look at you, Macca, I love this saying, you can't manufacture passion.

64
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,020
When I see you, all I think of is this extraordinary level of passion, almost more than any other

65
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,300
person I've ever met, I think.

66
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,219
You love what you do.

67
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:51,520
Where does that come from?

68
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,020
You're not the first person that sort of chatted about that to me.

69
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,699
It surprises me when people say that about me.

70
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,419
Because I know I love it.

71
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:04,060
But I don't feel like I love it any more than anyone else loves it.

72
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,139
It comes from my mother and father, right from the start.

73
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:11,159
You know, grew up as a little boy in Adelaide, and mum and dad loved their sport.

74
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:16,199
And they'd tell me stories about, you know, great horses and great cricketers and great

75
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,040
footballers.

76
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,519
And they'd make it so romantic.

77
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,620
And champions and battle against the odds.

78
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,779
So that's where it comes from.

79
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:29,779
It comes from having two parents that looked…

80
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,620
You know, they were both very passionate about their sport, probably in a similar way to

81
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,579
I do now.

82
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:38,639
And it ignited a curiosity and, I guess, that passion in me from a young age.

83
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,540
Well, mine was immediately going to my grandfather, my dad's dad, and the same storytelling of

84
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:51,740
he saw Bradman at the MCG, he saw Farlap at Flemington, he saw John Coleman was his hero.

85
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,279
He thought John Coleman was the best sportsman he'd ever seen.

86
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,660
And they're the images that sort of light up your world.

87
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:00,279
And when I got the privilege to walk into a commentary…

88
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,740
The commentary box at the MCG, I still always remind myself what a privilege it is to be

89
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,920
sitting in the best seat in the house.

90
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,980
And occasionally you bump into a cranky journalist who'd be, you know, talking the game down,

91
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,160
but never you.

92
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,540
If you saw you, you knew you were going to be filled with an anecdote or something that

93
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:16,800
was…

94
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,160
Did you do that consciously or was that just you being you?

95
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,000
I think that's who I am.

96
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,699
Because there's a couple of things here.

97
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,639
I know how hard it is to be an elite sportsperson, how difficult it is.

98
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,399
Even if you're not the best player.

99
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,060
Even if you're not the best player in the team.

100
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:36,839
Even if you're the worst player in the team, you were the best player at your club at some

101
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,120
stage when you were growing up.

102
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:42,459
I was a young kid that wanted to play league footy and I wasn't good enough, but I was

103
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:43,699
not a bad footballer.

104
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,779
So I look at it that way, Darce.

105
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,860
I say to myself, okay, not everyone's perfect.

106
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,779
They're going to make mistakes during the match and some are better than others, but

107
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:53,360
they're all good.

108
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,759
They're all good.

109
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,079
And that's the way I probably go about things.

110
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,959
That's why I always loved, and all of us loved your style.

111
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,279
Because of that, you celebrated people.

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,579
Again, I'm going off on a tangent, but it feels like in this part of the world, Australia,

113
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,160
we're now following that American style.

114
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:16,959
How do we land the heaviest blow on an athlete or go for the most hyperbole we can?

115
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:19,800
How do you relate to that style of broadcasting?

116
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,560
Look, we all do it our own way.

117
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,120
And there's no right or wrong, but I know what's right for me.

118
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,420
Yeah.

119
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:29,459
So I'm not going to judge others, Darce, but there's a lot of competition.

120
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:37,680
A lot of voices, a lot of TV shows, and executives want results, people to watch.

121
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,060
So life's changed since I started broadcasting football in a big way.

122
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,939
So look, we all do it our own way.

123
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:46,519
We do it the best way we can.

124
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,779
I think consistency is the key.

125
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,300
If you are what you are, then you stay true to it.

126
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,839
Good balanced answer, Mac.

127
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:56,939
I expect nothing less from you, you being your authentic self.

128
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:59,439
Your preparation for what you do is legendary.

129
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:02,439
A lot of us saw that as homework and hard work.

130
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,040
It seems to me that you love that as much as the event itself.

131
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:06,779
Is that true?

132
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:07,560
I do.

133
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,060
The preps is exciting for me as the performance.

134
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:12,959
You mean that really?

135
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,000
I do because I'm curious.

136
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:20,439
And the more you find out about somebody or something, then it gives you that opportunity

137
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,639
to talk about that when you're performing.

138
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:28,660
But the minute, Darce, I don't want to do the prep, I won't want to do the performance.

139
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,199
Yeah.

140
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,259
They'd go hand in hand.

141
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:32,220
Look, it was a funny thing.

142
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:33,500
I wasn't a good student.

143
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:35,579
There were a couple of subjects I wasn't bad in.

144
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,240
But I do treat my job as if it's a studious treatment.

145
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,120
And it's a build up during the week of something.

146
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:47,500
And I become more and more interested in it.

147
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,379
And by the time I get to the ground, I feel like I'm in pretty good shape to enjoy what

148
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:54,199
I've tried to learn during the week.

149
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:54,860
Yeah.

150
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,019
And you've seen that.

151
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,319
I've had the privilege of seeing that firsthand.

152
00:07:58,579 --> 00:07:59,180
And you can just see.

153
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:05,319
You can see the highlighters and the handwritten notes and the anecdotes that come to you freely.

154
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,639
And have you never had a day where you thought, wow, I just, you know what, I'm just not up

155
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,040
for this four hours of day two?

156
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,540
I do.

157
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:12,819
I have those days.

158
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,939
I had one yesterday, actually.

159
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,399
So we're talking on a Friday afternoon.

160
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:22,019
I had one yesterday where I was in a bit of a quagmire with some preparation for an athletics

161
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:22,720
meeting I'm doing.

162
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,480
So I've got little things I do that change that.

163
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,139
So I do some easy.

164
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:29,759
I do some easy stuff for an hour.

165
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,319
I'll give myself a break.

166
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,860
I'll go and have a cup of tea.

167
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,279
I'll take the dog for a walk.

168
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,320
Whatever, whatever, whatever.

169
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,240
I know there's certain things I have to do to feel right.

170
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,639
But I do get like that.

171
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:44,120
But I know how to switch off and then switch back on.

172
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,899
And when I switch back on, I'm back into it.

173
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,220
So it's a bit weird, but it's just the way it is.

174
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,480
Media can be a brutal game as well, Macca.

175
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,580
And you've been this high profile public face of networks and been on television for four

176
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,080
decades.

177
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,279
And there is some dark arts that goes on in this world.

178
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,960
And people have tried to cut you down over the journey.

179
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:11,360
And we've all seen that being in the industry and ridiculous things said behind your back

180
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,340
and rumours about you.

181
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,860
Did that take some skin off you at various stages?

182
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,840
How did you cope?

183
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,679
It does.

184
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:21,120
I mean, you're just not, I think, telling the truth if you're saying nothing bothers

185
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,799
me because everything bothers you.

186
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:27,200
Because there's two sorts of criticisms in a generic sense.

187
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,899
There's the ones that are fair.

188
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,360
And they hurt because we're all pretty good judges.

189
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,600
You'd be the same of how you're doing.

190
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
So there's one that's fair.

191
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:40,299
At the end of this interview, you're going to spend the next day thinking, how did I

192
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:40,500
go?

193
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,220
And I'm going to spend the next day thinking, how did I go?

194
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,139
So there you go.

195
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,899
So let's get that straight from the start.

196
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:47,100
So the ones that are fair hurt.

197
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:50,000
And the ones that are unfair hurt.

198
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,399
So they both hurt.

199
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,039
They hurt in different ways.

200
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,600
So you're frustrated with the ones that are unfair.

201
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,639
And you feel immediately like you want to write it all, but you can't.

202
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,259
And the ones that are spot on, then you say to yourself, well, how can I improve?

203
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,720
So look, they do hurt.

204
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,419
I absolutely 100% never look at social media.

205
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,940
A, don't really know how to.

206
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,039
And B, have no interest.

207
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:24,360
And in the end, it's a small group of people that I look to for, I guess, reassurance that

208
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,059
I'm still doing pretty well.

209
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:26,480
And one of them.

210
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,580
Yeah.

211
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,360
Obviously it's myself.

212
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:27,820
Yeah.

213
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,299
So it's hard to us.

214
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,240
You can be overwhelmed at times.

215
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:38,740
And if you're a fragile soul, then you're hanging on for dear life a lot of the times.

216
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:40,600
It's a pretty tough world.

217
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:40,899
Yeah.

218
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,200
But it's, the rewards are incredible because as I said to you earlier, when you read out

219
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,059
some of the things I've been able to do over the years and see, not just call, then, you

220
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:52,899
know, the plus side is so much greater than the negative.

221
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:53,480
Yeah.

222
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,340
And I don't want to harp on the negative at all because there's so much to celebrate,

223
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:01,539
but as an outsider, not knowing you, it felt like some of that's targeted, that there's

224
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:04,840
almost a campaign because, you know, you're valuable.

225
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,000
You make money for a network.

226
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,259
Did it ever feel like that?

227
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,039
Did you ever feel like, hey, there's a team out here having a real go to try and undermine

228
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,519
you or you just didn't know that?

229
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,000
Possibly.

230
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:19,039
There's been one or two instances over the years where it's probably been a bit targeted.

231
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,399
Yeah.

232
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:21,399
And what do you do, Luke?

233
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,559
What do you do about it?

234
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:24,799
I've got Annie, my wife.

235
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,960
You know, she knows the business back to front and she's such a good person for me in lots

236
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,379
of ways.

237
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,139
But in this area, she's really good.

238
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,740
And we'll have a chat about things.

239
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,840
I'll give you a quick example.

240
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:40,159
There was something written about me quite recently, actually, that was completely wrong.

241
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:42,159
Every line was incorrect.

242
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,259
It made me out to be mercenary, that I'd sought a job with a network at the Olympics.

243
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:50,379
I could go on.

244
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,320
It was a photo in the paper.

245
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,100
I was aligned to something.

246
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,580
I was like a drive-by.

247
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,419
Now, I had two choices there.

248
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:03,100
One was to really take them on or one was just to let them know they got it wrong and

249
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,840
it's up to them whether they want to write it.

250
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:06,059
They don't want to write it.

251
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,440
I'm not going to take them on.

252
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,100
You move on.

253
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:09,879
It's pretty cruel.

254
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:11,779
And it wasn't pleasant.

255
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:14,200
But so you just, you've got to live with it.

256
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:16,080
Not easy.

257
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:21,740
And I'm sure if I keep working in the industry for the next three to five years, there'll

258
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,080
be times where I think to myself, oh, boy.

259
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,580
What do I do about this?

260
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,360
Because it's unfair.

261
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,000
But that said, I'm far from perfect.

262
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,700
I've had a lot of things I would like to have taken back over the years as a caller.

263
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,519
And I feel like I've let myself down a few times, quite a few times.

264
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,519
But that's the business we're in, Luke.

265
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:41,840
It's life.

266
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,600
And it's reaction.

267
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,820
And none of us are foolproof.

268
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,919
So you've got to understand that.

269
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:49,320
Yeah.

270
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:54,039
I think the thing I've admired you, Macca, from afar and the occasional time of the,

271
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:58,519
you know, pleasure to sit in a commentary box with you is just the relationship you've

272
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:58,899
got everywhere.

273
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:04,139
You walk in and you've got a great relationship with wardrobe and with the makeup team and

274
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,179
the cameramen and women.

275
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,299
And again, it just, is that a conscious thing for you?

276
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,139
You've always been a great team player is how I'd describe you.

277
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,500
Did you think about that?

278
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:14,559
Or is it, again, you being you?

279
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:16,159
I think it's me being me.

280
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,879
And it gets back to mum and dad probably.

281
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,559
In this way, maybe mum more than dad in some ways.

282
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,240
Because I think everyone is equal.

283
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:23,820
Yeah.

284
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,860
We all do our job as well as we possibly can.

285
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:34,799
And I know that as a television performer, two of the most important people in my life

286
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,480
are makeup and wardrobe.

287
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,279
And then the third one is the floor manager.

288
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:40,639
Yeah.

289
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,440
How important they are.

290
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,779
You've got to feel good in your clothes.

291
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,480
You've got to think like you're looking all right.

292
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:48,940
And then you have that floor manager.

293
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,799
So those people are just as important to me as Lee Matthews and Dennis.

294
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,019
Who were so important to me amongst others.

295
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:59,700
So that's how I, that's me.

296
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,639
And I believe it wholeheartedly.

297
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:03,179
I also think we're a team.

298
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,159
Some of us are playing it somehow forward.

299
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:09,120
And some of us might be playing in the back pocket.

300
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,779
But without everybody, we can't do what we're doing.

301
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,600
So that's, I guess, in a nutshell, how I feel.

302
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:15,980
Yeah.

303
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:23,799
And the other thing I love about, you know, if you've bumped into Macca, there was a great chance that you're going to bump into Macca.

304
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,340
And you've bumped into Sean.

305
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:31,379
And Sean, he's not so young anymore, but has been a part of your life for a long, long time now.

306
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,379
Can you share that story of your great friendship?

307
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:35,740
And you've had an incredible impact on his life.

308
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,860
And where did that start?

309
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,220
I spoke to him yesterday and I'll be seeing him tomorrow.

310
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,779
He's coming to the athletics with me.

311
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:50,919
He rings me every Thursday at 11 o'clock Adelaide time, no matter where he is in the world, which is usually in the same spot, or where I am.

312
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:52,059
So Sean Gallagher.

313
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:52,899
So he's 62.

314
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,279
He'll be 63 on December the 9th this year.

315
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,659
Sean, I hope I got that right.

316
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,679
I met him in the betting ring at Flemington in 1985.

317
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,220
So we go back a fair way.

318
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,960
It's 40 years.

319
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
And yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

320
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:17,100
And then I took him up into the broadcast box after a few weeks and haven't been able to get rid of him.

321
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,360
I mean, you know, you reckon Lingy was a good run with player.

322
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,639
Sean is.

323
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:23,720
He could do.

324
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,600
Lingy inside out.

325
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,000
So he's been running with for 40 years now.

326
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:30,080
So he's a oxygen deficiency when he was born.

327
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:30,299
Yeah.

328
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,059
So incredible mother.

329
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:37,700
Suzette is in her 80s and unbelievable because she says no to nothing.

330
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:38,120
Yeah.

331
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:43,700
She surely asks a lot and she tries to do everything she possibly can.

332
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,779
Beautiful family.

333
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,299
His brother has got a very big job in Los Angeles in the media world.

334
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,799
Simon was a good runner.

335
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:53,580
Hey, sister.

336
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:58,379
Penny tragically died in the 40s and that's been unbelievably sad for everybody.

337
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,600
And she was such a great help to Suzette with Shawnee.

338
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,379
So Shawnee's special.

339
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,659
There's only one.

340
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:03,980
Yeah.

341
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,759
And, you know, I've got a lot more out of Shawnee than he's got out of me.

342
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,519
I'm not sure about that, Macca, because it's, again, it's a full on job.

343
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:21,100
There's every reason that that's a hard thing to do, to literally have someone in tow the whole time.

344
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:22,299
And have you met Shawnee?

345
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:23,299
He's just one of those great people.

346
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:24,259
You want to smile, I've seen it.

347
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,340
But there's some management too.

348
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,139
You know, Shawnee's.

349
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,620
It is.

350
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,980
It takes some work.

351
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,379
But you've changed his life in a way that no one else really could have.

352
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:37,139
And that must be something.

353
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,000
A, it sums you up to me in one story.

354
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,720
But, yeah, it's an incredible story.

355
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,600
I've had a lot of help.

356
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,679
I was solo for a while, but so many others have picked up the bat.

357
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:48,820
And, look, it's amazing.

358
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,820
You know, Gerard Healy did an incredible job with him.

359
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:52,679
Tim Watson was great with him.

360
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,279
And he's got a lot of.

361
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:54,500
He's got a lot of people that have been superb.

362
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,580
No, he's enriched my life.

363
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,220
And, look, he's so much fun.

364
00:16:58,299 --> 00:16:58,759
We all know.

365
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:01,240
And, look, he's no filter, Darce.

366
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:09,400
If you work for anyone but Channel 7 or his favourite radio racing station, you're a rat bag.

367
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:11,059
It's as simple as that.

368
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,359
And, you know, it's a funny world.

369
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,680
The Shawnee world's unique.

370
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,160
He called me fake triple M every time I saw him.

371
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,119
Not the real triple M.

372
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,680
Real triple N's in Adelaide.

373
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,279
In Adelaide.

374
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,500
Yeah, you've got to be in Adelaide.

375
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:22,880
You've got to.

376
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,460
You've got to be calling out of Adelaide.

377
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:28,200
And you and Jimmy and Billy, you're all fakes.

378
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,019
And no matter what you do, Darce, you cannot change it.

379
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:37,460
I've got to transition from that to a current story.

380
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,859
And I know this is why you're in town at the moment.

381
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,880
I saw you spend some time with Gout Gout.

382
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:45,480
Can you tell us a bit about this incredible young Australian athlete?

383
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,440
Look, what he's doing is it's hard to get your head around.

384
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:51,180
So he's running times.

385
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,859
You know, he's the fastest 16-year-old.

386
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,119
Over 200 metres.

387
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:54,960
Quicker than Bolt.

388
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,519
He's been able to get to a place quicker than anybody else in world history.

389
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,039
But we've never had a male sprinter quite like him.

390
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:10,099
Now, at the moment, we're enriched, Darce, with some great talent in sprinting for men.

391
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,700
And in track and field full stop, we're going through a golden period.

392
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,759
But this is the shining star because he's off the charts, so to speak.

393
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:22,559
So he's run 20.04.

394
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,839
Legally, for 200 metres.

395
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,559
He ran 19.98 a couple of weeks ago in Brisbane.

396
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:30,799
He's just turned 17.

397
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,579
So 29th of December is his birthday.

398
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:33,480
He turned 17.

399
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:37,779
He's well coached by old school Dye Shepherd.

400
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,160
Extremely well managed as well by James Templeton and knows his way around the tracks.

401
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:43,700
He's one of seven children.

402
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:46,460
So Gout's older brother was born in Sudan.

403
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,980
His older sister in Egypt on their way to Australia, as it turned out.

404
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,819
He was born in Ipswich.

405
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:57,000
And then there's four others, twins and etc.

406
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,799
Mum, Monica, Dad, Bonner.

407
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,279
Dad's a really hardworking.

408
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:01,960
They're battlers in many ways.

409
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,119
So that's their family.

410
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,400
He's a year 12 student.

411
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,079
He had exams this week, by the way.

412
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,640
And he's going to run Saturday and tomorrow night.

413
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:16,880
So he's highly motivated and very well managed.

414
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:18,680
It's a beautiful combination.

415
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:21,079
So I did get to spin.

416
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,759
I spent quite a bit of time with him.

417
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,680
And he looked me in the eye and he shook my hand.

418
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,140
My hand, he called me Bruce.

419
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,200
And you forget how young he is.

420
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,500
So he's got all the flair and all the pomp that good sprinters should have, the great ones.

421
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:37,640
But he's also got a lot of respect.

422
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:44,660
So I'm excited about him as a human being, what he might do with his life away from the track.

423
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,359
But I'm extremely excited about how good he might turn out to be.

424
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,299
Because none of us know.

425
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:57,640
And it's, you know, you're a child prodigy, so to speak, not child, but young prodigy.

426
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:03,559
And we know that in the world of athletics and any sport that nothing's taken for granted.

427
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,880
So we'll see how it ends up.

428
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,700
But we're on a journey with him, Dars.

429
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,720
And on a journey with a male sprinter that we haven't really seen the likes of before in Australia.

430
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:15,900
So that transition from elite 17-year-old running those times,

431
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,019
there's still hurdles to jump figuratively and literally, isn't there?

432
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,039
To get to become.

433
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,259
To get to become the champion elite male athlete, it's still a path to navigate.

434
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:29,200
If he runs 20.04, he probably makes the Olympic final at the moment.

435
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:29,460
Yeah.

436
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:30,319
And that's where he's at.

437
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:37,839
So, you know, the world record is 9.58 for 100 metres and 19.19 for 200.

438
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,839
Those world records are now 16 years old.

439
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:42,440
So they've stood for a long time.

440
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,700
They were set by a bloke who was 22 years of age when he did it, Usain Bolt.

441
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,079
22.

442
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:50,339
So you think about Bolt, great young athlete.

443
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,000
And we kept him.

444
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,660
We're comparing his times with Gow.

445
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,900
Bolt ran his fastest times when he was 22.

446
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,319
He never got any quicker, but he went on to win six more Olympic gold medals.

447
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:05,220
So what it says is that, you know, you can still be great,

448
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,460
but everyone reaches their absolute peak at a different age.

449
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:12,259
Carl Lewis's fastest 100 metre time was at the age of 30.

450
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
Bolt's was at 22.

451
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,900
Now, I'm picking those two out because they're the two best I've seen over a long period now.

452
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,400
1983.

453
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,740
84 through to 2016 with Bolt.

454
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:30,380
So they're the two best, I think, probably ever in terms of male sprinters.

455
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,599
There's an argument with Bob Hayes and a few others.

456
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,859
One did it at 30 and one did it at 22.

457
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,279
So what's Gow going to do?

458
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,599
So we've got to understand he's just not going to keep improving like he is at the moment.

459
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:50,480
So the challenge for him is that he's got to try and find another almost second.

460
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:51,400
So he's got to try and find another almost second.

461
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,579
To be the best in the world.

462
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,799
And the two people that are probably standing in front of him at the moment are both young.

463
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,380
One's 21 and one's 20.

464
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:02,400
One's from Botswana and one's from the United States.

465
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,420
And he can see those targets.

466
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,940
Let's see where he's at at the end of this year, the World Championships in Tokyo,

467
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:11,380
and then from there on going into the Los Angeles Olympics.

468
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:19,640
So it's a huge challenge, but he's getting there quicker than these blokes that I'm talking about.

469
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:19,980
So.

470
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,779
We'll see what he can do by the end of the year.

471
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:26,759
I love listening to the encyclopedic knowledge that comes out of you.

472
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,940
You haven't got a note in front of you and that stuff's just off the top of your head,

473
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,779
dates and ages and people's birthdays.

474
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:37,839
And it's part of your genius is that it just, it comes out so freely.

475
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:39,519
I'll ask you this question.

476
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,140
If we said to you, Macca, this is your last sporting event you're going to go to,

477
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:48,279
and you've got so much love for horse racing and football and athletics and the Olympic Games.

478
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:51,000
Is there one that if you could go to just one more,

479
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:51,740
what would you choose?

480
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,500
It'll be the Olympics.

481
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,380
It'll be sitting in the athletic stadium.

482
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:00,099
That's, for me, the ultimate.

483
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:04,420
And that includes Melbourne Cups and whatever's in, you know, I love racing.

484
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:06,740
You know, absolutely adore it.

485
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,160
The first five minutes of the AFL Grand Final.

486
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:11,240
Oh, God.

487
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:12,400
How good's that?

488
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,119
You just want the last five to be as good.

489
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:20,160
So, you know, the Bulldogs Sydney 2016, it doesn't get much better than that.

490
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,019
Now, I'm talking to somebody.

491
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:23,119
I'm talking to somebody who's invested in it because it was, you know,

492
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,539
Dennis Committee's last call and all that.

493
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,839
So, that sort of stuff is precious.

494
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,339
But for me, it's the Olympics.

495
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,319
Now, I say that to us without having called a World Cup final in soccer

496
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:39,140
and not calling a Boxing Day test.

497
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,700
So, you know, there are other things, but for me, it's the Olympic Games.

498
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,940
And within the Olympic Games, it's athletics.

499
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,279
It doesn't get, for me, any bigger than that.

500
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,940
And when you think about the 100 metres,

501
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,900
or the marathon, I mean, the challenge of both.

502
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,099
But the 100 metres, not everyone,

503
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,359
but nearly the whole world can put on a pair of shoes and run.

504
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,240
So, if you're the fastest woman or man in the world over 100 metres,

505
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,680
that's the heavyweight championship of the world, in my opinion.

506
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:16,319
And how do you get a tiny island like Jamaica that's just as random as that is,

507
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,400
that incredible sprinting DNA that comes out of that part of the world?

508
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,000
I mean, how does that happen?

509
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,599
That doesn't normally happen.

510
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:23,200
Well, it's genetic, it must be.

511
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:24,859
But it's also what's happened before.

512
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,140
And those that have guided, you know, Don Quarry was actually in the 1950s,

513
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,619
48s and 50s, where they had some incredible,

514
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:35,420
Herb McKinley and George Roden,

515
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:38,059
the first of the great Jamaican runners, to be honest.

516
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:45,799
And then Don Quarry in the 1970s, 1976, he won the 200 metres in Montreal.

517
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:47,839
So, they've had that to look at.

518
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:50,200
And then, of course, Shelly Ann Fraser-Price and Bolt.

519
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:50,519
Yeah.

520
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,799
You better think about Botswana.

521
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,339
So, Tabogo, let's say Tabogo's running tomorrow night.

522
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,680
So, he's the 200-metre Olympic champion at 21 years of age.

523
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,119
He's a world junior record holder at 100 metres.

524
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:05,180
Two and a half million people in Botswana.

525
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:07,180
Two and a half million people.

526
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,799
Half of New Zealand.

527
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,119
How does that happen?

528
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:17,259
And the Botswanan men's 4x400 metre team got beaten by one-tenth of a second

529
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:18,680
at the end of that race.

530
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:20,680
How does that happen?

531
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,160
Two and a half million people.

532
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,880
So, it's really interesting, isn't it?

533
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,599
There's no rules in a way.

534
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:30,359
So, Tabogo and his group are going to create a legend.

535
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:33,839
And that's what we're hoping, you know, maybe that GAL can create luck

536
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:36,339
for those to follow.

537
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,480
So, we'll see.

538
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,779
But at the moment, track and field right here in Australia

539
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:46,039
is going through one of the most exciting times.

540
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:48,220
The most exciting time I can remember in my lifetime.

541
00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:48,680
Really? Yeah.

542
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,039
Yeah.

543
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,839
And GAL could be…

544
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,920
The flag bearer.

545
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:52,819
He might be.

546
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:56,140
It's a lot to ask of a 17-year-old, but he could be.

547
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:57,579
Maggie, I want to go back.

548
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,519
You mentioned your beautiful wife, Annie, and the family life.

549
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,019
And you've got such a great, close connection.

550
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,160
You work together and I've had the pleasure of working with Sam,

551
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,819
who's doing a great job carving out his own media career.

552
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,740
And Alex is doing the same.

553
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,059
How have you been able to balance this great passion of yours to travel

554
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:18,819
and be on planes and family life?

555
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:19,700
How did you make that work?

556
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,119
I've had a wife who's been very giving.

557
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:24,940
And that's the truth.

558
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,440
Because I've been away a lot, Darcy.

559
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,839
And I lived in Adelaide for…

560
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:28,420
I went back to…

561
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,880
We went back to Adelaide at the end of 1999.

562
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,059
And that was for family reasons.

563
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,279
And so, that meant a lot of travel.

564
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,880
And it meant that Annie had to sacrifice a lot of her career.

565
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:41,779
Children were young.

566
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,380
Sacrifices had to be made.

567
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:46,440
And it's only now when I look back, Darcy,

568
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,759
and think about it even more now, how much she gave up

569
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:50,819
and how much support she's been given.

570
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:52,460
So, it's a team effort.

571
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:56,940
So, yeah, we do work closely together.

572
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,440
I rely on her so much.

573
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,779
Hopefully, I help her as well.

574
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:03,000
So, I've been fortunate.

575
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,119
And I think Annie probably also, as I said,

576
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,940
she's sacrificed a lot.

577
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,240
She realised early on how important it was for me

578
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,279
and how much of my life it is.

579
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,359
And it's who I am, to be honest.

580
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,779
You know, I wanted to be…

581
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:22,380
I wanted to call the Melbourne Cup when I was five

582
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,700
and nothing's changed.

583
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,960
So, it's weird.

584
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,819
It's a bit odd and I'm probably a bit blinkered.

585
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,359
But she gets me.

586
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,859
She understands what makes me tick, I think.

587
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:36,539
We all are born different.

588
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,779
As we grow, the experiences we have

589
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:45,319
develop into outlooks uniquely our own.

590
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:48,599
Charting our life's course.

591
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,140
No one sees an ideal.

592
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,319
No one sees a career, opinion or opportunity like you.

593
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,640
And no one sees you like VU.

594
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:00,940
Victoria University.

595
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,920
Uniquely you.

596
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,539
My name's Gabrielle.

597
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,200
I'm studying law.

598
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,220
What made me want to get into law is,

599
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,200
I guess, the reward you get after.

600
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:13,700
The feelings that you get for helping other people.

601
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,660
I'm really passionate about making sure that people have that voice,

602
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,039
especially for people that don't feel like they can be heard.

603
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,920
And that's something that's really important to me.

604
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,140
I have quite deep personal values.

605
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,299
So, it was really important to me to find a university

606
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:28,880
that aligns with those values.

607
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,440
And VU's that for me.

608
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:34,319
At Alita, our signature program, Alita Connect,

609
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,420
is something we're really passionate and proud of.

610
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:38,500
We bring together groups of five to six people

611
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,079
around the globe from diverse backgrounds.

612
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,299
Sport, industry, social venture and the arts.

613
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,099
We come together to learn, to connect and to collaborate.

614
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,500
Liz Ellis, Australian netball icon and television presenter.

615
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,140
The thing that I've loved about it is,

616
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,700
not just the meetings that we have with our group,

617
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,859
it's the thinking that you do for days and days afterwards.

618
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:00,019
Someone says something and it sparks a thought.

619
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:02,579
And within my sport and within women's sport,

620
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,640
I'm just someone who I try to lead

621
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,859
by keeping people talking about the issues.

622
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:08,339
There's times when I think,

623
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,700
the person I'm trying to convince is not listening to me.

624
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,259
It actually got me thinking about,

625
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:14,700
this is how I need to address my communication with them.

626
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,140
So, it was, I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it.

627
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:20,220
Going back to, you was a five-year-old.

628
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,059
You grew up in Adelaide.

629
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,180
You grew up in Adelaide.

630
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:21,240
You grew up in Adelaide.

631
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,299
You grew up in Adelaide.

632
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:21,559
You grew up in Adelaide.

633
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:21,619
You grew up in Adelaide.

634
00:29:21,619 --> 00:29:21,700
You grew up in Adelaide.

635
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,079
As an accountant, as I said before,

636
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,400
school wasn't necessarily easy for you.

637
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,779
And then you work at telecom for five years.

638
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,339
What advice would you,

639
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,799
young people about to start that journey,

640
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,619
it's not as though it was just all laid out for you.

641
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,480
What advice do you give young people

642
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,079
that want to follow something they love?

643
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:40,599
Keep dreaming.

644
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:41,700
Absolutely.

645
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,640
Because my dream was to be a race caller.

646
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:47,180
Stroke sports broadcaster.

647
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,259
Keep dreaming.

648
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,519
And, you know, the three things to ask I really wanted to do

649
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,099
was play league.

650
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,400
Well, call the Melbourne Cup.

651
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,259
Play league footy and test cricket.

652
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,099
You know, one out of three.

653
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,720
But, look, there were times in my middle of my teenage years

654
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,019
and late teenage years that I lost the dream.

655
00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:05,160
I thought it was impossible.

656
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,059
You know, telecom for five years.

657
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,000
You know, played a bit of footy and cricket and all those things.

658
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,559
But I absolutely thought there was no chance.

659
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,319
And, look, it's too long a story today,

660
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,200
but there was just an unbelievable chance happening

661
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,500
that gave me an opportunity.

662
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:21,380
And from that, everything's flowed.

663
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,420
But I'd prepared for it.

664
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,420
I'd practised calling as a young kid.

665
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:29,960
So I think for anyone that has a dream,

666
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:34,759
prepare for it in a way so when an opportunity arises,

667
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,960
you can actually walk through the figuratively door

668
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,920
and take advantage of that.

669
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,680
So don't give the dream up and don't give up the practising

670
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,440
and the preparation in a way.

671
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,440
It might lead to nothing,

672
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,440
but that chance happening,

673
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,740
then you can take advantage.

674
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,759
You've got to be able to supply something.

675
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,380
You've got to be able to give something

676
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,559
when you give that opportunity.

677
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,440
It's either got to be a brilliant call,

678
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,200
a great voice or some knowledge.

679
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,420
So you can't just walk in thinking that people owe you something.

680
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,039
You've got to be able to give them something in return.

681
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,319
And then you're off and running.

682
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,259
Mac, I love this opportunity to sit down

683
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:15,000
from incredible people like you.

684
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,819
And we're saying that success leaves clues.

685
00:31:16,819 --> 00:31:18,440
Your passion's so clear.

686
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,880
And you just described that you were ready

687
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,359
when the door opened.

688
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,380
And that chance meaning.

689
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:24,380
And we see these patterns

690
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,720
of what great leadership looks like.

691
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:27,799
I want to ask this idea

692
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:29,180
in the world we're in with a leader

693
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,140
that you've got to fill your own cup up first

694
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,880
before you can be any good for anyone else.

695
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,960
What do you do to fill your cup up?

696
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,400
It's tricky because you don't really think about it too much.

697
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,440
But this is what I do.

698
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,700
I make sure that I'm prepared

699
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,599
to do absolutely the best performance I can do,

700
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,059
whether it be calling a football match

701
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:51,359
or a game.

702
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,319
Talking at a production meeting or whatever.

703
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,240
Now, that doesn't mean that I'm, you know,

704
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,619
under the whip all the time.

705
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,980
But it just means that I know that

706
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,380
if I can't do a really good job,

707
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,619
then those people around me will look at that.

708
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:08,599
And maybe, look, I like to lead us.

709
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,359
So I guess I'll get to the core of it.

710
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,900
You know, you talk about going into a broadcast box

711
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,400
and things like that.

712
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:15,900
I've been in a position where I've been generally the host.

713
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,319
I've been experienced.

714
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:20,480
I've had the veteran,

715
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:21,339
whatever it might be.

716
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,859
It wasn't always that way, obviously,

717
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,680
because, you know, going through the ranks myself.

718
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,759
So when a young caller like yourself

719
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:29,200
or whoever it might be that comes in,

720
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,519
Matthew Richardson or whoever,

721
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:33,900
I've often been there when ex-footballers

722
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,099
or young broadcasters are starting.

723
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,599
So I do think to myself,

724
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,619
OK, what is it that I would like to do

725
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:43,660
to help these people?

726
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:47,640
And for me, the first most important thing

727
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,140
is that they look up to me

728
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,140
and think that I'm good.

729
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:53,920
They look up to me and think that I'm

730
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,099
a good person and a good broadcaster.

731
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:01,240
And after that, everything flows in a way.

732
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,359
And then you go about sharing the load,

733
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,079
sharing the responsibilities

734
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:09,960
and making sure that everybody has a voice

735
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,099
and that everybody is playing a role

736
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:17,019
that suits the telecast in this instance,

737
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:19,579
but also plays to their strengths.

738
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:21,079
We've all got different things

739
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:21,500
to offer.

740
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,339
So one of the things that I am consistent with

741
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:29,940
is if, let's say it's Richo,

742
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,720
young Richo, Matthew Richardson,

743
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,480
you'd say to Richo,

744
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:37,019
I want you to come here with three things

745
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:39,259
that are yours for the telecast.

746
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,859
They're not mine.

747
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,839
They're not Dennis's.

748
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,660
They're not us.

749
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
They're yours, Richo.

750
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:46,279
Come here with three authentic things

751
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:48,160
and just think about them

752
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,960
and talk about them pre-match

753
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,059
and then make sure that you're going to

754
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:52,200
make sure during the call

755
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,359
that you cover them off at some stage,

756
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,680
even if they're not as relevant

757
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,019
as they were at the start of the match.

758
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,819
So you've got a game plan

759
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:02,299
and the game plan is yours, not mine.

760
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,400
So it's empowering them.

761
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,360
When I started doing that or thinking that,

762
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:10,559
I didn't think that as being a leader.

763
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,019
I just thought that

764
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:13,539
because it was the right thing for them.

765
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:15,019
That's how I thought.

766
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,260
So that's a really simple way

767
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,599
of talking about some leadership

768
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,900
in the role as a,

769
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,260
veteran sports broadcaster.

770
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,739
And you won't remember this,

771
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,699
but you did that for me.

772
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,840
My first game on television was with you.

773
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,880
It might've been in Tassie.

774
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,820
It was a Bulldogs game

775
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,719
and they rostered me on

776
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,280
and I'd called on radio,

777
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:37,159
but you're overwhelmingly nervous

778
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,579
and you did exactly that.

779
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,480
I think you said,

780
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:40,519
take the first bounce.

781
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,119
I'm going to give you the space.

782
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,460
I'm going to let you come in.

783
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:46,019
And then at quarter time,

784
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:47,300
you came in and you said,

785
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,599
you're fine, mate.

786
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,739
You're going to be fine.

787
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:50,659
And just the reassurance

788
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:52,199
of having someone alongside you was,

789
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,099
you know,

790
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,500
the old school was sort of,

791
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,179
hey, young fella,

792
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:56,280
earn your stripes

793
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,579
and we'll make life hard for you.

794
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:59,000
So I think that's a great gift

795
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,139
that you've passed on to people.

796
00:35:01,219 --> 00:35:02,880
And I think you can see that team element

797
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,119
and it stays with people.

798
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:05,980
You know, when people help you at the start,

799
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:06,380
don't you?

800
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:08,300
You know, you remember that for life.

801
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:09,699
I've always felt that

802
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:13,199
the better the people around you,

803
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,400
the better you are.

804
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,619
I've learned from everyone, Darcy.

805
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:16,260
So that day,

806
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,480
I do remember that day.

807
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,139
You were good.

808
00:35:20,139 --> 00:35:22,000
And I reckon I would have picked

809
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,460
two or three things up from you that day

810
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,840
that probably improved me.

811
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,019
And this sounds weird

812
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:26,599
and people are saying

813
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:27,659
you're being disingenuous.

814
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,360
I've never worked on anything

815
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,039
where I haven't picked up something.

816
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,260
Now, it doesn't mean you're going to use it,

817
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,039
but it gets into your mind

818
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,500
and gives you a different way

819
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,320
of looking at things.

820
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:40,340
So you learn from everybody.

821
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,159
But as I said earlier,

822
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,300
the better people are around you,

823
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,900
the better you become as well.

824
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,519
And what you wouldn't have realised that day,

825
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:49,920
Luke,

826
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,460
was that I was not as nervous as you,

827
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,920
but I was nervous.

828
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,059
Not for you, but for me.

829
00:35:56,699 --> 00:35:58,380
So every time I do anything,

830
00:35:59,019 --> 00:35:59,920
there's an anxiety.

831
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,619
There's a fear of failing

832
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:05,280
and there's a fear of not doing well.

833
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,699
I'll have it tomorrow night with the athletics.

834
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,280
I have it every time I do anything.

835
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:11,940
So I was nervous as you were,

836
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,719
but maybe not quite.

837
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,420
Probably not that level,

838
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:18,559
but I'm fascinated at 71

839
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:19,760
and I've done it.

840
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:19,900
I've done it.

841
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,280
I've done it all.

842
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:22,820
You still feel that performance pressure.

843
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:23,539
Absolutely.

844
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,760
The most comfortable I am

845
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,860
are when the headsets are on

846
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,659
and it's started.

847
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,960
And then it's a matter of working

848
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,960
and thinking and enjoying.

849
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,579
But up until that point,

850
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,000
that first host,

851
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,539
that first voiceover,

852
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:40,480
you know what it's like.

853
00:36:41,179 --> 00:36:42,119
No matter what.

854
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:43,760
Every time I do the races on a Saturday,

855
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,559
one minute to 12,

856
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,500
I'm thinking,

857
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,300
God.

858
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,619
And so,

859
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:51,260
what I try and do to us is

860
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,139
make sense of it all.

861
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:55,400
What am I trying to achieve in the first minute?

862
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,780
Clarity is so important.

863
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,599
It is so important.

864
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:01,000
Don't get muddled.

865
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,360
Keep it simple.

866
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,719
If there's a big thing to say,

867
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:06,659
say it.

868
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,940
Don't say it twice.

869
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:08,699
Say it once.

870
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,760
Work with the pitchers.

871
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:12,619
Work with your co-hosts.

872
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,619
So just have a real understanding

873
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:18,239
of what the producer

874
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,599
is wanting to do.

875
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:20,260
What they're wanting from you

876
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,139
and what the audience

877
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,119
might be expecting.

878
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:24,440
So that calms me a bit.

879
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,340
And then off you go

880
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,639
and then you settle in.

881
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,340
And then I think to myself,

882
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,860
and this is what I say to a lot of people

883
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,699
when they start,

884
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,059
and some people come

885
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:36,719
even much rawer than you would ask

886
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,760
because you had some experience.

887
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,619
They're thrown in the deep end.

888
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,719
Really deep end.

889
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:41,860
And I'll say to them,

890
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:45,460
do you know anything about athletics?

891
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,780
Knowing that, you know,

892
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,039
Commonwealth Games gold medalist.

893
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:49,980
Yeah.

894
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,619
You'll be right.

895
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:53,360
You'll be right.

896
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,880
Because you know what you're doing.

897
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,000
Just do it.

898
00:37:56,219 --> 00:37:57,440
And that's what I have to say to myself.

899
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,860
I have to say to myself,

900
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:00,260
you've done the homework.

901
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,059
I'll give you an example.

902
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:03,360
Cathy Freeman.

903
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,340
It was in the middle of the Olympics,

904
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,059
Monday night.

905
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:09,179
I'd hosted the first week.

906
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,460
I'd called a couple of other things.

907
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,000
I'd called four nights of athletics

908
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,420
or three nights of athletics in days.

909
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,980
That's as big a week in your life

910
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,519
as you can get.

911
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,639
I'm fully warmed up to us.

912
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,019
Fully warmed up.

913
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:19,059
Yeah.

914
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:20,340
That Monday morning,

915
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,159
I knew it was different.

916
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:21,599
And anyway,

917
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,880
we get to the track.

918
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:25,039
There's four or five

919
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:26,599
unbelievable races already.

920
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:27,579
I mean, stuff that,

921
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,119
you know,

922
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:28,820
incredible.

923
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,000
Out they walk for the women's

924
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,699
400-meter final.

925
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,139
My mouth goes dry completely.

926
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,840
I feel a sense of,

927
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:37,019
wow,

928
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,400
I'm in trouble.

929
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:41,880
And I absolutely thought to myself,

930
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:43,500
you know what you're doing.

931
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:45,119
Relax.

932
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,659
Go slow.

933
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,199
Don't rush it.

934
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:51,679
Try and take away that dryness.

935
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:53,559
Use Raylene.

936
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:57,139
Just enjoy it.

937
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,440
And I actually talked myself into it.

938
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:01,099
And I,

939
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:02,260
gun goes,

940
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:02,739
relax.

941
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,880
Not a perfect call.

942
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:04,199
You know,

943
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,079
a good call.

944
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:06,440
A perfect performance.

945
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,760
And a good call to go with a perfect performance.

946
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,219
But I realized that I was a bit overwhelmed.

947
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,420
And that was,

948
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:15,719
you know,

949
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,840
someone that had been to a lot of Olympics.

950
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,820
Had called a lot of races that week.

951
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:21,639
So it's interesting,

952
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,000
isn't it?

953
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,039
But I was able to bring myself to a point

954
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:25,139
to do a reasonable job.

955
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,599
And you had that experience before?

956
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,099
No.

957
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:27,519
Yeah.

958
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:28,099
It's amazing.

959
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:28,440
That's,

960
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:28,840
that's,

961
00:39:29,219 --> 00:39:29,420
you know,

962
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:30,320
people might say,

963
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:30,539
oh,

964
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:30,780
you know,

965
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,920
you've picked the one big race.

966
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:33,519
That's the only race.

967
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,699
There've been other times,

968
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:34,880
you know,

969
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,639
men's 100 final.

970
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,280
It's funny,

971
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:36,500
you know,

972
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:37,400
women's 100 final,

973
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:38,719
it's huge.

974
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,860
But there's something about the men's 100 final

975
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,880
that's,

976
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,760
it's not being gender.

977
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:47,260
I hate to do it because the women's 100 final

978
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,019
is just as important.

979
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:48,179
Yeah.

980
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:48,260
Yeah.

981
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:50,360
But the men's 100 final does bring out

982
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,300
something else in me.

983
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:51,619
Yeah.

984
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:52,000
In,

985
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,260
in,

986
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:52,980
in the broadcaster.

987
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,420
Often it's because it's Bolt or Lewis

988
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,760
and it's historic.

989
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:01,360
But it's also tricky because it's quick.

990
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:01,920
Yeah.

991
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,760
But,

992
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,519
but Freeman's the only one that that's happened

993
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:05,900
to me.

994
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:06,940
And it's really interesting.

995
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:08,920
And I've been broadcasting now for 40 years.

996
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:11,239
One of the great moments of all time.

997
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:12,019
Macca,

998
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:13,039
the world's changing.

999
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,840
Is there one thing that's worked for you

1000
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,980
in what you've done that you will never change?

1001
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,340
About the way I go about it?

1002
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,760
A lot of things,

1003
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,019
I think,

1004
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:22,280
Luke.

1005
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:25,179
A lot of things.

1006
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:26,559
Probably,

1007
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,739
you know,

1008
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,559
we talked about the prep.

1009
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,619
It's also the respect for what you're doing

1010
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:32,639
and the privilege.

1011
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,880
You don't take it for granted.

1012
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,820
We are in a,

1013
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,739
it doesn't mean you can't be critical

1014
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:40,159
because,

1015
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:40,539
you know,

1016
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:42,579
criticism is part of what we do.

1017
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,980
But it's that whole understanding of,

1018
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:45,300
you know,

1019
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,780
I guess,

1020
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:47,679
the honour.

1021
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,559
And what we're seeing,

1022
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:52,059
people would give their eye teeth

1023
00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:53,559
to have the same seat as us

1024
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:55,219
or even be at the venue.

1025
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,059
But what hasn't changed

1026
00:40:58,059 --> 00:40:59,420
is my respect for what I'm doing.

1027
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:02,539
We're entertainers.

1028
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,099
That's what we are.

1029
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:04,920
We're not surgeons.

1030
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,559
It's not life or death.

1031
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,940
But we all do it in our own way.

1032
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,420
And what I've tried to be,

1033
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:12,739
I guess,

1034
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,980
what hasn't changed

1035
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,980
is authentic.

1036
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,539
I've tried to be the best,

1037
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:19,300
the best Bruce I can be.

1038
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:20,539
And this is the other thing

1039
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:23,199
I've spoken to young ones over the years.

1040
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,360
Don't be the second or third best dentist committee.

1041
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:29,260
You be the best ex.

1042
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,880
You be yourself.

1043
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,760
And that's what I've tried to be.

1044
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:34,840
And look,

1045
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,860
there's a bit about me,

1046
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,500
there's quite a bit.

1047
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:38,860
I wish I wasn't.

1048
00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:43,159
There's some of my things I do drive me mad.

1049
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,519
But it's me.

1050
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:45,860
And in the end,

1051
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,239
you live and die by it.

1052
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:49,019
And I'm not going to change.

1053
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,619
It's a pretty good version,

1054
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,099
Mac.

1055
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:52,199
I don't think you'd change it at all.

1056
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:52,820
But on that,

1057
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,059
has there been a visionary leader in the world

1058
00:41:56,059 --> 00:41:57,800
that you've also followed a bit?

1059
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,460
You've always been authentically you,

1060
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:00,000
clearly.

1061
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:03,139
And we did see a lot of people wanting to be you

1062
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:04,059
or wanting to be Dennis.

1063
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:05,320
That's a pretty hard act to follow.

1064
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,840
Has there been a leader that you've followed the path of?

1065
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:09,480
Well,

1066
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:10,539
in a broadcasting sense,

1067
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,440
Bill Collins.

1068
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:11,719
Now,

1069
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,679
for those that don't know,

1070
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,480
Bill Collins was a race caller in Melbourne

1071
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,119
from the late 1940s.

1072
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:16,519
And,

1073
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:17,159
and,

1074
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:17,219
and,

1075
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:19,079
and I grew up to us listening to him.

1076
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:21,119
And he was absolutely,

1077
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,239
to me,

1078
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,739
the most outstanding broadcaster of any sport I'd ever heard.

1079
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,679
As a young boy,

1080
00:42:26,739 --> 00:42:28,079
now you've heard a lot of people since.

1081
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,300
I loved his style.

1082
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,320
I loved his accuracy.

1083
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,420
And I liked the entertaining way he did it.

1084
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:35,260
So I modelled myself really on Bill.

1085
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:36,199
In the end,

1086
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:37,360
I didn't want to call the Melbourne Cup.

1087
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,260
I wanted to be Bill.

1088
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:38,940
So,

1089
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:41,119
and I wrote to him when I was 11 from Adelaide.

1090
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:42,320
Mum wrote the letter probably.

1091
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,019
I wrote the letter.

1092
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,059
Mum told me what to say.

1093
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:44,579
But,

1094
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:45,400
so there you go.

1095
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,300
And then I got to meet him,

1096
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:46,599
obviously,

1097
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:47,460
and work with him a bit.

1098
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:48,940
So through a broadcasting sense,

1099
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,139
there were people like Bill Collins,

1100
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,780
Alan McGilvray,

1101
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:53,039
John Arlott,

1102
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,199
cricket commentators,

1103
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:56,699
football commentators in Adelaide,

1104
00:42:57,059 --> 00:42:57,239
you know,

1105
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,719
Max Hall and Tom Warhurst,

1106
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,579
that your father would have known,

1107
00:43:00,699 --> 00:43:02,400
David Darcy would have known well.

1108
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:03,500
Great callers.

1109
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,400
Mike Williamson,

1110
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:06,739
you know,

1111
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:07,659
those people,

1112
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,179
Doug Haywood,

1113
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:11,539
and then more and more contemporaries,

1114
00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:12,579
people like Tim Lane,

1115
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,380
that I've looked up to over the years.

1116
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:15,380
And,

1117
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:15,800
you know,

1118
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,260
you're sort of the same age almost,

1119
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:20,340
so there's been a lot of international broadcasters

1120
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,960
like Bob Costas and Al Michaels

1121
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,420
and those people who I've sort of got to know a bit

1122
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,280
over these.

1123
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:27,400
So there's been a lot of that I've looked at

1124
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,360
and heard and feel leagued,

1125
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:28,619
you know,

1126
00:43:28,659 --> 00:43:28,800
God.

1127
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:29,800
So there's a long list.

1128
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,639
And you say,

1129
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,960
I'm not them,

1130
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:33,420
but boy,

1131
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,739
how they go about it

1132
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:35,400
and how they do it

1133
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,099
and their timing.

1134
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,039
So you do pick up things.

1135
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,659
So on-air people,

1136
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:41,699
a lot.

1137
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:42,760
And even,

1138
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,059
you know,

1139
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,159
today,

1140
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,139
the young callers,

1141
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:45,440
you know,

1142
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,239
that are so,

1143
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:47,539
so good.

1144
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:48,500
We ran into one in the,

1145
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,380
Howie coming in here today.

1146
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,079
They all do it differently,

1147
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,179
but they've all got something.

1148
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,139
And,

1149
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:55,599
you know,

1150
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:56,539
I admire it.

1151
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,280
So,

1152
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:57,619
yeah,

1153
00:43:57,659 --> 00:43:58,659
there's been a lot on-air.

1154
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,679
There's a few off-air

1155
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:03,260
that have paved a way for me

1156
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,260
in terms of,

1157
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:06,000
I guess,

1158
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,139
decision-making attitude.

1159
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:09,920
So there's been quite a few people.

1160
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,739
You mentioned your inherent curiosity earlier.

1161
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,940
How does that show up for you?

1162
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,980
And how do you overlay that

1163
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,079
into your world?

1164
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,719
But the more you know about anything,

1165
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,239
the more interesting it becomes.

1166
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:25,079
And this is work and non-work.

1167
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:26,800
So my,

1168
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:27,880
one of my

1169
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,860
fault starts,

1170
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,320
I've got a few,

1171
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,260
is obsession.

1172
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,639
So one of the problems I've got,

1173
00:44:33,699 --> 00:44:36,039
if I dip my toe in the water,

1174
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,260
I can go down rabbit holes.

1175
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:39,619
And I can't,

1176
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:41,340
and sometimes it takes a long time to get out.

1177
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,840
So I've got to be careful.

1178
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:43,940
You know,

1179
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,940
how much I obsess about James Bond movies.

1180
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,420
Or Tom Waits singing.

1181
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,119
Or,

1182
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:50,760
you know,

1183
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,039
Leonard Cohen or whatever.

1184
00:44:52,539 --> 00:44:52,840
Or,

1185
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:53,340
you know,

1186
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,199
John le Carre.

1187
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,860
So I've got to be careful

1188
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,159
that I don't become,

1189
00:44:57,519 --> 00:44:59,019
because then I won't have time for any of the others.

1190
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,139
So that's the style of person I am.

1191
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,500
So you can get lost in Leonard Cohen.

1192
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:04,980
Yeah,

1193
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:06,239
I can get lost in anything

1194
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:08,880
and have to pull myself out.

1195
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,119
and that's what I do with my job

1196
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:11,719
and my work.

1197
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:11,880
So,

1198
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:13,880
so the curiosity is,

1199
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:16,639
it comes from,

1200
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:16,960
you know,

1201
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,739
a very young age.

1202
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,340
Dylan Thomas's poetry,

1203
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:20,980
I was probably more interested in the fact

1204
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:21,980
that he died at 39

1205
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:22,940
and how he died.

1206
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:24,679
But what made him tick

1207
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:26,880
as much about the words that he wrote,

1208
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:27,199
you know,

1209
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,300
Bob Dylan,

1210
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:28,739
you know,

1211
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,239
named himself after him and all those things.

1212
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,280
So those little things as you're growing up,

1213
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:33,780
they stay with you,

1214
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:34,260
Darce.

1215
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,800
You're still being influenced,

1216
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:41,900
but early influences are forever.

1217
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,079
And they're richer and deeper.

1218
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:46,179
And they're with you for the rest of your life.

1219
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:46,960
And they're,

1220
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,219
they're part of who you become.

1221
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,800
And whether they are your parents

1222
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,760
who guided you in a certain way

1223
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,260
or somebody you listened to or read

1224
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,659
and they lifted you

1225
00:45:56,659 --> 00:45:57,940
and made you feel

1226
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,619
like you're going to a place

1227
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:00,599
that's hard to get to

1228
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:01,760
and you never want to leave,

1229
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,260
they're with you forever.

1230
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:05,420
We're a bit obsessed

1231
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,639
about this idea of collaboration

1232
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,820
and what we're trying to achieve in a leader

1233
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,659
and connecting people around the globe.

1234
00:46:10,699 --> 00:46:11,659
Have you got an example

1235
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:13,380
of a great collaboration in your life?

1236
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:14,440
Look,

1237
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:15,260
a few don't,

1238
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,860
but they can be,

1239
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,340
fleeting.

1240
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:18,139
You know,

1241
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:20,099
there are individual people

1242
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:22,639
that I might go to for advice.

1243
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,699
There's people that you won't know.

1244
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:26,639
There was one man particularly

1245
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:27,059
who,

1246
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:28,619
his name was Fred Jones,

1247
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:29,519
he's no longer with us.

1248
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:32,000
And he really helped me a lot

1249
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,880
just through his knowledge,

1250
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:35,519
but also his guidance

1251
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,599
in the right way about doing things.

1252
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:38,059
He was like,

1253
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:39,840
I had the most brilliant father,

1254
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,699
but I was lucky.

1255
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,400
He was like a bit of a second father for me.

1256
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,179
And he was later in my life.

1257
00:46:44,179 --> 00:46:45,579
I think every young man

1258
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:46,179
needs,

1259
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,739
and every young woman

1260
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:49,900
needs somebody

1261
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,800
away from their parents at times

1262
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,519
to be a strong force in their life

1263
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:55,940
when you're in your teens

1264
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,340
because you don't want to hear

1265
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,539
mum and dad sometimes.

1266
00:46:58,659 --> 00:46:59,800
It's just the way it is.

1267
00:47:00,179 --> 00:47:01,739
So Freddie did that for me.

1268
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,519
How'd you find him?

1269
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,639
Through sports broadcasting

1270
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:08,260
and through racing

1271
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,039
and just his knowledge.

1272
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:11,280
And then,

1273
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:11,539
you know,

1274
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:12,039
since then,

1275
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:14,239
in a more recent sense,

1276
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:15,099
and I'll,

1277
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,219
so I'll say a couple of names

1278
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:16,920
that you will know.

1279
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,599
Dennis had a big influence on me.

1280
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,739
He doesn't know it,

1281
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,500
but he did.

1282
00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:24,000
Lee Matthews

1283
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,880
has had a big influence on me.

1284
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,440
I always thought that Lee

1285
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,800
could get to the bottom line

1286
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,139
quicker than anyone I've ever met.

1287
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:32,699
He's the most pragmatic person

1288
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:34,239
and you're smiling

1289
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:34,920
because you know.

1290
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:35,579
You know,

1291
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,480
okay,

1292
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:37,320
here's an example.

1293
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,920
Late last year,

1294
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,480
Channel 7 came to me

1295
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:40,800
and said,

1296
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:41,340
Bruce,

1297
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,159
will you do the opener

1298
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:42,940
for the grand final?

1299
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:43,460
And I thought,

1300
00:47:43,659 --> 00:47:44,800
I'd like to.

1301
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,760
Is it the right thing to do?

1302
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,519
And I talked to Annie

1303
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:46,820
and we,

1304
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,059
so I went back to the people at 7

1305
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:50,059
and you know who they are,

1306
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:50,840
Chris Jones,

1307
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,679
because Louie had left,

1308
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,800
Chris Jones and Gary O'Keefe.

1309
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:54,519
And I said,

1310
00:47:54,579 --> 00:47:54,719
look,

1311
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,440
I will do it.

1312
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:56,619
And then Gary rang me

1313
00:47:56,619 --> 00:47:57,619
on a Monday night

1314
00:47:57,619 --> 00:47:58,000
and said,

1315
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:58,840
left a message,

1316
00:47:59,019 --> 00:47:59,039
said,

1317
00:47:59,079 --> 00:47:59,260
Mecca,

1318
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,900
I'd like you not only to do that,

1319
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,440
but be involved on grand final day,

1320
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,159
but actually host the two prelim finals.

1321
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:08,139
I didn't sleep that night.

1322
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,360
I thought,

1323
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,420
I'm not up to it.

1324
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:11,820
I haven't seen enough football.

1325
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,159
I haven't called for four years.

1326
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:13,980
Hosting's different.

1327
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,400
I don't think I can do it.

1328
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:16,440
Luckily,

1329
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:16,760
I was,

1330
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,699
people find that mind blowing.

1331
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,480
And this is a hundred percent.

1332
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:19,920
Mind blowing.

1333
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:20,860
People will not,

1334
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,079
someone that's done everything you've done,

1335
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,380
you do that with your eyes closed.

1336
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:24,559
I didn't,

1337
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:24,840
no.

1338
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:25,920
And you didn't sleep.

1339
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:26,900
Didn't sleep.

1340
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,440
So I went and I was lucky I was in Melbourne

1341
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,239
for something else

1342
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,500
and I saw Gary the next day

1343
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,360
and he sort of nearly talked me into it.

1344
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,539
So I went and spoke to two people besides Annie.

1345
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:37,480
One was Lee Matthews

1346
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:37,880
and said,

1347
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:38,159
Lee,

1348
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,000
do you think this is the right thing to do?

1349
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,320
I want you to think about it.

1350
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,019
And the other was Rob Chapman.

1351
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:43,840
Now,

1352
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,760
Rob Chapman's a former.

1353
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,000
Chamber of the Crows.

1354
00:48:46,139 --> 00:48:46,320
Hmm.

1355
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,460
And somebody who

1356
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,079
I've only got to know really well

1357
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:50,440
in the last few years

1358
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,280
and someone I admire.

1359
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,119
They were the only two people I asked.

1360
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:55,659
Rob,

1361
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,039
over a coffee,

1362
00:48:57,179 --> 00:48:57,400
said,

1363
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,219
absolutely.

1364
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:00,340
You can do it

1365
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,280
and you should

1366
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,039
be the last time they ask you.

1367
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,119
Lee came back

1368
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:05,800
and said,

1369
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:06,719
Macca,

1370
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,880
nothing wrong with you doing that.

1371
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,079
Go for it.

1372
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,840
So there's two examples

1373
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,320
of people that I respect

1374
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:15,719
and

1375
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:15,880
I,

1376
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:15,900
I,

1377
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,300
I,

1378
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:16,320
I,

1379
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,559
that's why I did it

1380
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:18,980
because they said yes

1381
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,679
and I had the support of Annie.

1382
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:21,920
It's value in your life,

1383
00:49:22,019 --> 00:49:22,280
isn't it,

1384
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,019
for people that,

1385
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:24,679
even with all your experience

1386
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:26,179
and for me,

1387
00:49:26,679 --> 00:49:27,900
I was in that broadcast,

1388
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:28,719
it was a no-brainer.

1389
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:29,320
It was,

1390
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:30,460
of course you're going to do it.

1391
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:30,940
How good

1392
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,400
for the coverage

1393
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,860
and I just saw that

1394
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:34,800
as a joyful thing

1395
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,039
and,

1396
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,119
but I wouldn't have known

1397
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:37,780
that you would have taken the time out

1398
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,519
to go to

1399
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:40,179
some sounding boards

1400
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:41,059
and thought about it.

1401
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:41,380
I'd have thought

1402
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,019
it would have been

1403
00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:42,699
pick up the phone

1404
00:49:42,699 --> 00:49:43,739
and see you.

1405
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:43,880
I,

1406
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:43,940
I,

1407
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,320
I agonized over it.

1408
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:45,860
And then,

1409
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,179
when I walked into the SCG

1410
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:48,659
for that

1411
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:49,460
Port Adelaide

1412
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,639
Sydney match,

1413
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:51,420
it was the first time

1414
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:52,059
in four years.

1415
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,019
I felt like I was home.

1416
00:49:56,139 --> 00:49:57,559
I just felt right.

1417
00:49:58,159 --> 00:49:59,000
And then the,

1418
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,559
the night,

1419
00:49:59,659 --> 00:49:59,820
you know,

1420
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,400
I was nervous

1421
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:00,960
but the night,

1422
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:01,920
it's very different

1423
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,760
not calling obviously

1424
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,280
but I,

1425
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,880
I felt like I contributed

1426
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,920
in a way that was

1427
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,519
of some value

1428
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:08,340
because,

1429
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:09,960
I didn't want to be

1430
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,900
a non-contributor.

1431
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,440
I wanted to be able

1432
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,340
to bring something.

1433
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,099
I'm proud.

1434
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,300
I'm old.

1435
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,800
You know,

1436
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,519
I've got a

1437
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:19,800
pride

1438
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,559
that's

1439
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,280
important to me

1440
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,400
and I wanted

1441
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:23,960
to be good.

1442
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:24,659
Now,

1443
00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:25,840
how good I was,

1444
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,360
I wasn't,

1445
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:26,940
I,

1446
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,440
I did my,

1447
00:50:27,539 --> 00:50:28,239
I played my role.

1448
00:50:28,579 --> 00:50:29,260
I didn't,

1449
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,579
I wasn't at centre-half forward.

1450
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,159
I chipped away

1451
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:32,960
in the forward pocket

1452
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,579
and got,

1453
00:50:33,699 --> 00:50:34,420
and got a couple

1454
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:35,079
of front and centres

1455
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:36,260
and Dennis would have

1456
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:36,980
been proud of me.

1457
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:38,079
A couple of front and centres.

1458
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:39,860
You've been centre-half forward

1459
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:40,219
for,

1460
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,559
for a number of decades.

1461
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:43,059
we're,

1462
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,659
the idea of communicating

1463
00:50:44,659 --> 00:50:45,500
clearly is something

1464
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,039
we just see

1465
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:47,099
great people have

1466
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:47,719
a really,

1467
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:49,219
and it's been your whole life,

1468
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,179
how you communicate.

1469
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:51,900
How do you break it down?

1470
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:52,139
What,

1471
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,139
what's the essence

1472
00:50:53,139 --> 00:50:53,900
of great communication

1473
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,480
for you?

1474
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:56,099
I think clarity

1475
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:56,760
in a way

1476
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,300
because you,

1477
00:50:57,619 --> 00:50:58,500
if you're going to

1478
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,340
talk to people,

1479
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,900
so let's say

1480
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:01,619
I'm giving an,

1481
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:02,739
an address to,

1482
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:03,199
you know,

1483
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,000
15 minute address

1484
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,500
to a school.

1485
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:06,780
So you think to yourself,

1486
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:09,159
what's important for them?

1487
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:09,780
What,

1488
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:10,059
what,

1489
00:51:10,059 --> 00:51:11,619
what might they take away?

1490
00:51:12,019 --> 00:51:13,599
So it's horses for courses.

1491
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,440
So you construct,

1492
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,719
I always believe in a,

1493
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:17,679
an unusual start

1494
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:18,460
and a good ending.

1495
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,360
So,

1496
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:21,199
and you don't necessarily

1497
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:22,579
do things chronologically.

1498
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:22,900
You,

1499
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:25,159
so you make it interesting.

1500
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,519
It's like writing a novel.

1501
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,780
So a 15 minute short story.

1502
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:30,000
So that's how I,

1503
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,719
I guess prepare

1504
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:31,699
for something like that.

1505
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:32,559
If it's

1506
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,400
working with

1507
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,840
three or four other broadcasters

1508
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,679
on a coverage,

1509
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:37,019
it's,

1510
00:51:37,059 --> 00:51:38,719
it's throwing down a few ideas

1511
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:39,340
at the start of the,

1512
00:51:39,539 --> 00:51:41,079
but not making sure

1513
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:41,880
that nobody

1514
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,159
says what you want them to say.

1515
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:45,719
They say what they want to say.

1516
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,019
But,

1517
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:47,099
but you know,

1518
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:48,679
and I'll do this on purpose.

1519
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:49,340
You'll go in and

1520
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,860
you might ask three or four questions

1521
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:51,800
to your co-commentator,

1522
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,039
not,

1523
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:52,840
not say Dennis,

1524
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:53,639
because he prepared

1525
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:54,619
very differently to me,

1526
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,260
but to,

1527
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,500
to your colour commentators,

1528
00:51:56,699 --> 00:51:58,300
just to prick them a bit,

1529
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,480
but also to see

1530
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,019
how switched on they are

1531
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:02,360
and make sure they're right,

1532
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,280
but also to empower them

1533
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,099
because

1534
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:06,260
everybody

1535
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,920
that starts at Cotelicus

1536
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,760
has to bring something to them.

1537
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:10,599
So that's how I,

1538
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:11,159
that's,

1539
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,639
that's the way I go about it.

1540
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,460
So clarity is really important

1541
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:15,539
to create,

1542
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:16,139
um,

1543
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,699
a speech or some words

1544
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:19,039
that are resonating

1545
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:21,239
because they're of interest,

1546
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:22,500
because they are,

1547
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:23,159
I guess,

1548
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:24,380
they're relevant

1549
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,079
to what

1550
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:26,900
the people you're talking to

1551
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,420
are about.

1552
00:52:27,639 --> 00:52:29,239
So there's a different speech

1553
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:30,260
for every group

1554
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,400
you might talk to

1555
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,579
and there's a different message,

1556
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:34,380
but there's also a message of

1557
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,440
there's no complete right way.

1558
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,780
There's your way.

1559
00:52:38,179 --> 00:52:40,019
And if you go about your way

1560
00:52:40,019 --> 00:52:41,599
in the best possible way

1561
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,300
and you're ethical

1562
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,519
and you're honest,

1563
00:52:45,539 --> 00:52:47,500
which goes with the ethics

1564
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,679
and you're doing a job

1565
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:50,860
that you're proud of,

1566
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:51,780
it's right.

1567
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:53,960
So there's no absolute

1568
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,420
that's right,

1569
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,539
that's wrong.

1570
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,739
There's bits of everything

1571
00:52:58,739 --> 00:53:00,199
that are of value.

1572
00:53:00,539 --> 00:53:00,719
And that,

1573
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,820
so that's the way I guess

1574
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,480
I've gone about my life.

1575
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:03,980
Yeah.

1576
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:04,820
Is that, you know,

1577
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:05,960
easy to judge,

1578
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,360
but everybody's got something to offer

1579
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,039
and that might be,

1580
00:53:10,219 --> 00:53:11,380
wow, didn't think of that.

1581
00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:13,099
Yeah, don't really agree with it,

1582
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:14,139
but I see where you're coming from

1583
00:53:14,139 --> 00:53:14,539
or,

1584
00:53:14,699 --> 00:53:15,519
you know,

1585
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,340
yeah, I wish I thought of that.

1586
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:19,539
Ethical and honest,

1587
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:20,980
I think if I was going to

1588
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:21,719
put a couple of words

1589
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:22,900
alongside Bruce McIverney,

1590
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:23,739
they would be right

1591
00:53:23,739 --> 00:53:24,519
at the top of the tree

1592
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:25,480
and everything that you do

1593
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,260
and everything in your life.

1594
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:28,940
Mac, who's been the greatest leader

1595
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:29,539
in your life?

1596
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,639
It's a toss up between mum and dad

1597
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:35,179
and Annie, I think.

1598
00:53:35,539 --> 00:53:36,199
And that's,

1599
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:37,099
and you might say,

1600
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:38,019
oh, you're just saying that.

1601
00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:38,400
I'm not.

1602
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,239
I had parents that were far from perfect,

1603
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:43,639
real battlers.

1604
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,199
Both left school at 13.

1605
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,400
Mum said,

1606
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:48,360
saddest day of her life

1607
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,239
was when she left school.

1608
00:53:49,739 --> 00:53:51,000
She loved education.

1609
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,579
My father went to the war,

1610
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:54,199
came back and studied.

1611
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,599
We had the tiniest little house

1612
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:56,559
and got his accountancy.

1613
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,260
He was a telegraph messenger at 13.

1614
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,639
Mum and dad,

1615
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:03,320
I've got a sister and a brother

1616
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,199
that I look up to,

1617
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,039
but Annie,

1618
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:06,420
Annie,

1619
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:10,019
because I rely on her so much

1620
00:54:10,019 --> 00:54:10,980
and I trust her judgment

1621
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,679
and she's got my back.

1622
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:14,920
So there's lots of others,

1623
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,960
but that'll do, Das.

1624
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:17,900
Great gift, Mac.

1625
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,800
I love it when people,

1626
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:20,940
had a family upbringing like yours

1627
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,039
and a partner like yours.

1628
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:24,199
It's an obvious place to go, isn't it?

1629
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,380
And you're probably pretty lucky in life,

1630
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:26,699
aren't you?

1631
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,000
Oh, absolutely.

1632
00:54:28,539 --> 00:54:29,619
Look, that's,

1633
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,000
in many ways,

1634
00:54:31,179 --> 00:54:32,500
we all know what life's about.

1635
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:34,420
You've got a beautiful family yourself

1636
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,679
and you had a wonderful father and mother.

1637
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:37,139
I know that.

1638
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,039
So I know how you think about yours.

1639
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:40,739
So that's what so much is about.

1640
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:41,840
But you know what?

1641
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,179
How lucky are we?

1642
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,380
Because not everyone has that

1643
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,039
and everyone,

1644
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,980
everyone has to find people

1645
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:48,860
that they can trust

1646
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:49,920
and look up to

1647
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,059
and share things with.

1648
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,800
Sharing's so important.

1649
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,380
I live a lot of my life, Das,

1650
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,199
in isolation,

1651
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:57,079
in my office or whatever,

1652
00:54:57,519 --> 00:54:58,239
on planes.

1653
00:54:58,699 --> 00:55:00,900
And when you get to share things,

1654
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,320
it makes it all worth it.

1655
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:04,079
Final question before I let you go.

1656
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:05,500
Again, the spirit of collaboration.

1657
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:06,300
You've worked with

1658
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,400
incredible people around the globe

1659
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,280
and you've had these

1660
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,480
boys' own annual experiences.

1661
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:12,719
Has there been one person

1662
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:14,159
in any of your passions, Mac,

1663
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:14,559
you thought,

1664
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,840
it might be your love of music

1665
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:16,480
you shared before

1666
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:16,760
or,

1667
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:18,480
God, I'd love to have collaborated

1668
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,519
with one person,

1669
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,099
a name that springs to mind?

1670
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:24,579
Gee, that's a good question.

1671
00:55:24,699 --> 00:55:25,260
I'd put it a hard way.

1672
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,559
Look, I would love to have

1673
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:31,679
been at a training session

1674
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:33,659
with Muhammad Ali

1675
00:55:33,659 --> 00:55:35,599
when he was Cassius Clay

1676
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,239
and he was dreaming the dream

1677
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,820
that he could be the best in the world

1678
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,460
and doing the hard yards

1679
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,960
quietly in the gym.

1680
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:46,099
Oh, I'd love to have seen that man.

1681
00:55:46,099 --> 00:55:48,420
That's, that'll do.

1682
00:55:49,059 --> 00:55:50,820
That is a great note to finish on

1683
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,719
and an image that,

1684
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:54,099
that'll stay with me for the day, Mac.

1685
00:55:54,099 --> 00:55:54,960
It's been a great pleasure

1686
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,860
to have been able to

1687
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:58,179
spend some time with you today

1688
00:55:58,179 --> 00:55:59,880
but to have known you in the past

1689
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,760
and it's an incredible story.

1690
00:56:02,219 --> 00:56:03,440
A lot more chapters to write out.

1691
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:04,940
You look healthy and happy

1692
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:06,079
and thanks for joining me today.

1693
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,260
It's been a pleasure, Dars.
