00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:09,199
Chloe Dalton, the founder of the Female Athlete Project, is seriously inspiring.

2
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:17,359
In this conversation, she shares how as a seven-year-old watching the great Cathy Freeman win gold at the Sydney 2000 Olympics

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,079
inspired her to win her own Olympic gold medal in Rio in 2016.

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,699
Listen to Chloe recount the powerful words that her dad and brother said to her that really shaped her success as an athlete

5
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,640
and how a British Olympic triathlete's courage to share a personal photo went viral on her platform,

6
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,920
the Female Athlete Project, and created a unique conversation.

7
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:46,840
Chloe also shares and references the storm that erupted around a clip of Perth Lord Mayor Basil Zemplis

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,520
that went viral on her platform, the Female Athlete Project,

9
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,259
and how now the added responsibility of being a publisher is a position that she takes really seriously.

10
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:59,140
A really inspiring conversation with Chloe Dalton.

11
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,219
And it is people like Chloe Dalton that really inspire the work we do at Alita.

00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,689
Chloe Dalton's impact on female.

21
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,489
Her sport is an extraordinary story.

22
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:40,730
She is one of Australia's few triple sport elite athletes.

23
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,790
After playing basketball in the WNBL with the Sydney Uni Flames,

24
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,650
Chloe transitioned to rugby, where she debuted for the Australian rugby sevens team in 2014.

25
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:55,109
At the Rio 2016 Olympics, Chloe Dalton won gold with the Australian sevens team

26
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:58,969
and was awarded an Order of Australia medal for her service to sport on the back of it.

27
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:05,510
She was also recognised as Australia's top rugby sevens player in 2017, winning the Sean McKay medal.

28
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:12,469
Chloe then cross-codes again to Aussie Rules, making her debut in 2019 for Carlton and the AFLW.

29
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:17,550
She was named runner-up in the Carlton Best and Fairest in the 2020 AFLW season.

30
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,169
Chloe currently plays AFLW for the GWS Giants.

31
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,129
She is the founder of the Female Athlete Project,

32
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,610
a brilliant platform that shines a light on the lack of attention given to women in sport.

33
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,789
Chloe, great to catch up with you.

34
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,610
Thanks for taking the time.

35
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,389
Thanks so much for having me, Luke.

36
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:34,530
You're only 30.

37
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,389
You're an Olympic gold medalist.

38
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:41,830
You've played three sports at the highest level, achieved an enormous amount in a short amount of time.

39
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,610
You must be really proud.

40
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,310
Yeah, it was interesting actually at my 30th birthday.

41
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,770
My partner organised just a really nice dinner with close family and friends

42
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,030
and I think it's one of those things like when people have the milestone birthdays

43
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,090
that they feel a little bit worried about getting older and all of those things

44
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,250
but it happened to fall on the year that we put two books out

45
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,689
and had a huge amount of growth with the Female Athlete Project.

46
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:05,750
So it was kind of a nice time.

47
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,469
It was a nice time to actually reflect on being able to tick off some big life goals

48
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:12,550
before the age of 30, which was nice.

49
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:15,370
Well, you're setting a high bar for everyone, Chloe.

50
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:18,990
You're making us all feel like serious underachievers on every level.

51
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,689
You're an author.

52
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:20,789
I missed out on that.

53
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,990
Tell us about the two books that have been released.

54
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,870
Yeah, so I don't think I'll ever write a book ever again.

55
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:29,610
It was one of the hardest processes I've been through.

56
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,530
I know lots of footy players have ghost writers that come on board.

57
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,650
I kind of regret not going ahead with that.

58
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,150
That's a good path.

59
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,949
I decided to write it on my own.

60
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,189
I was approached by Alan and I'm one and Tessa, my editor,

61
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,030
just slid into my DMs one day and she was like,

62
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,810
do you want to write a book?

63
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:48,330
And I was like, I do not want to write an autobiography

64
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,550
if that's what we're talking about here.

65
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:52,330
And she was like, no, I've been following the Female Athlete Project

66
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,789
for a long time and I think it's the perfect time

67
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:58,210
and you're the right person to write a book about women's sport.

68
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,430
And so, yeah, took on that challenge and released

69
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,750
Girls Don't Play Sport.

70
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,590
It was during the time of the FIFA Women's World Cup.

71
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,629
In 2023, which was quite amazing.

72
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,050
I think part of it was strategic from the publishers

73
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,270
because they knew there'd be a lot of conversations

74
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,330
around women's sport.

75
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:18,810
But just to kind of be in discussion at that point in time

76
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,329
about the state of women's sport as a whole but where it can actually

77
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:26,329
go in future and what needs to be done to ensure the continued success

78
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:28,410
of women's sport was really great timing with that book.

79
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:31,629
And then my favourite one is the kids' book that came

80
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:32,490
out late last year.

81
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,430
It's called The A to Z of Who I Could Be.

82
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:40,009
And it's an alphabet book of 26 incredible Aussie female

83
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:41,009
and non-binary athletes.

84
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,629
And I just want little kids to be able to sit down and read that book

85
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:47,990
with their parents before they go to bed and just see some incredible

86
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,589
athletes that we have in this country who I believe deserve

87
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:54,949
to be household names but potentially aren't because they haven't received

88
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:56,529
that same level of media coverage.

89
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:00,250
And it is an incredible impact and legacy that you've created already

90
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,149
and want to talk about that extensively.

91
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:04,490
I think I've got to jump into the FIFA Women's World Cup

92
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,610
because you brought it up.

93
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:07,529
And I did want to go there at some stage.

94
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:11,629
What an extraordinary example of what you've been championing, isn't it?

95
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:15,709
I think the numbers, 11.5 million people, 40% of the Australian population

96
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:17,889
watched that final game the Matildas played.

97
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:23,850
We were all absolutely just beside ourselves with how much we were

98
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:24,529
in their corner.

99
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:27,050
It smashed all the records for television history.

100
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,449
I think it went past Cathy Freeman at the 2000 Olympics.

101
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,709
I mean, it's sort of what you've been saying, isn't it?

102
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:33,889
Give the right coverage.

103
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:35,410
Give the right example.

104
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:36,949
And the audience is there.

105
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,490
It was brilliant.

106
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:41,209
It's also really important to note the investment that Football Australia

107
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,350
put in and the planning.

108
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:45,589
I think sometimes we see those events right on TV and it's kind of like,

109
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:46,629
well, it just worked.

110
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:49,350
But I think Football Australia were obviously really deliberate

111
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,329
in their approach knowing what a huge opportunity it was.

112
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,750
And it was so cool, like some of those records of viewership

113
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,649
that you touched on, like it was just really cool.

114
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,670
I think as someone who works in that space, but not only that,

115
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,970
like I think there were so many girls and women watching that

116
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:05,610
who...

117
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:08,870
Really would have felt seen by what the Matildas did

118
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,290
and having some really tangible numbers in a way

119
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,069
is a really validating feeling because often we end up

120
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:21,370
in comment sections and even in sport, like when I'm playing footy,

121
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,149
like sometimes it feels like we're going out trying to prove

122
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:28,529
that women deserve an opportunity to play and compete

123
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:29,370
at the highest level.

124
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,410
So I think for a lot of people across the nation,

125
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,629
I think that would have been a huge moment to be like,

126
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,589
these women are out there doing what they do best

127
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:40,569
and they're being seen and they're being valued

128
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:41,589
and they're being celebrated.

129
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,949
It was a pretty special moment.

130
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,230
And the data's always hard to argue with, isn't it?

131
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,670
When you have more than, you know, close to half

132
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,930
the Australian population behind an Australian women's team,

133
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,250
what a brilliant moment.

134
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,350
It's a culturally significant thing that's happened.

135
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,689
I want to go back to you, Chloe, and your remarkable story.

136
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,889
As a young girl, I understand basketball was the path

137
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:03,550
and your dream was to play basketball professionally

138
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,949
and you got there.

139
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,910
But it didn't quite work out for you and you've decided

140
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,329
to switch codes.

141
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,089
What was the impetus for that?

142
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:14,949
Yeah, I got to the WNBL.

143
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:19,569
I was playing for the Flames at the time and I spent a lot

144
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:22,730
of time doing a bit of Paddy Mills tower waving on the bench,

145
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,389
giving out a lot of high fives, not making much of an impact

146
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:27,009
on the court.

147
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:29,829
And I tried really hard but I just couldn't crack it.

148
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:32,490
And to be quite honest, I probably just wasn't up

149
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,089
to that standard.

150
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:34,810
Like it wasn't like I was this superstar.

151
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:37,569
I was being put on the bench and didn't get my opportunity.

152
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:41,569
I just wasn't at that level and I was trying to get my chance,

153
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:44,350
trying to get my opportunity, but it just didn't work out.

154
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:50,089
And so knowing that I had this goal from when I was seven years old,

155
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,790
watching Cathy Freeman at Sydney 2000 of winning my very own

156
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:57,689
Olympic gold medal, I went home after basketball training one day

157
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:02,610
and I typed into Google list of Olympic sports and I had a look

158
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,350
at a few different options and contrasted.

159
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:06,709
I contemplated what I could do and what I couldn't do.

160
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:11,810
And this was early in the back end of 2013 and I saw that Rugby Sevens

161
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,230
was going to be in the Olympics for the very first time.

162
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:19,329
And because I'd grown up in a rugby family, I had a great understanding

163
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:19,870
of the game.

164
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,050
Like Friday nights and weekends with my family were spent either

165
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,829
watching the Waratahs or the Wallabies or going down

166
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:28,790
to my local footy field down at Rat Park to watch my brothers play.

167
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:30,870
Like rugby was a huge part of our lives.

168
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:33,789
So I had this really inherent understanding of the game,

169
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:34,610
but I didn't know.

170
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,570
I didn't know the skills of the game.

171
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:39,330
I didn't know how to tackle or the ruck and the breakdown

172
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,029
and things like that.

173
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:43,629
So I had a fair bit to learn in about two and a half

174
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:45,289
to three years' time before the Olympics.

175
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,669
That's an ambitious thing to take on.

176
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:53,250
I've got to back up and Cathy Freeman, you're seven years of age,

177
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,909
you see that magical moment in Australian sport and was there

178
00:08:56,909 --> 00:09:00,110
a narrative going on in your head, I want to be there one day

179
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,350
and win Olympic gold?

180
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:04,929
Yeah, I just was mind blown as a kid.

181
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,950
Watching her just walk out onto the track and zip up

182
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,789
that custom-made bodysuit and pull the hood over her head

183
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:15,029
and just the way that she did it with the weight

184
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:18,129
of the whole country on her shoulders, I just was mind blown

185
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:20,389
and I was like, I want one of those for myself.

186
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,649
And mum did scrapbooking back in the day,

187
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,289
which obviously parents don't do these days

188
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:29,110
because everything's digital, but she got me to write down

189
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,110
on this piece of cardboard, my biggest dream is to go

190
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,690
to the Olympics.

191
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,889
I picture myself standing on the podium,

192
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,710
with a gold medal around my neck, smiling the biggest smile

193
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,309
I've ever made or something along those lines.

194
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:43,330
And I think I was, yeah, probably 10 years old

195
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,190
when I wrote that down.

196
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:47,070
So it was just this massive goal that throughout my whole life,

197
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,929
I just wanted to win an Olympic gold medal.

198
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,830
How incredible is the power of visualisation and actually having

199
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,110
that at such a young age and having that in your mind

200
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,990
and creating your own future.

201
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,950
And I'm jumping around a little bit, but I'm intrigued

202
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,549
because your role now with the Female Athlete Project,

203
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:04,870
you spend a lot of time.

204
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:06,789
Have you sat down with Cathy Freeman?

205
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:08,090
Have you been able to share that story?

206
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:11,250
I'm sure you've met plenty of her idols in recent times.

207
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:14,549
Yeah, I've had the chance to meet a couple of my idols,

208
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,409
two of the main ones being Anna Mears and Lauren Jackson,

209
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,370
but Cathy Freeman is still on the list.

210
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:23,049
So if you've got any connections, can you hit me up?

211
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,129
Cathy, right now, get on to the Female Athlete Project

212
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:28,750
and chat to Chloe.

213
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,570
She's what an extraordinary person she is in every sense of the word.

214
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,570
And I'm sure she'd be honoured.

215
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,809
So because of what you're doing for other female athletes

216
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:41,090
in such a profound way, I've got to go back to the changing code stuff

217
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:45,730
because that's just ridiculous what you've done from quitting basketball

218
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,769
and then going on to Olympic gold in rugby.

219
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:51,669
You broke your arm three times in the first 12 months.

220
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,929
Is that right?

221
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,250
How did mum feel about that?

222
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:55,210
I'm sure she wasn't rapt.

223
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,470
It was quite interesting.

224
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,269
Like even my first game, my first ever game of sevens,

225
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:02,830
I was playing just with my local club with the Warringah Rats

226
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,730
at a sevens tournament.

227
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,909
And I don't know.

228
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:04,929
I don't know.

229
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:05,470
I don't know how to tackle.

230
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,830
And so I'd put my head on the wrong side, came away with a black eye.

231
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:10,970
And I remember dad came over to me and he was like,

232
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,590
turn the other way, like don't let your mother see your black eye.

233
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:18,870
And I think it was probably a reflection of her getting used

234
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,830
to her daughter playing rugby.

235
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:23,730
But I think even in saying that, like my older brother who played

236
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,950
for years was this skinny, lanky, like string bean who'd play

237
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,389
on the wing.

238
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,070
And even when he'd get tackled, she'd cringe and get worried

239
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:31,990
about him getting injured.

240
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,669
But, yeah, it was a really interesting,

241
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:35,129
interesting process.

242
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,169
And I think the more I've been able to reflect throughout my career,

243
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:42,429
when you have the highs that you get to celebrate with your family

244
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:45,330
and close people, it's really special because they're the ones

245
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,610
that have to experience the three broken arms or whatever

246
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,470
those setbacks look like.

247
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:53,590
And I just remember so clearly when I fractured my arm

248
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,649
for the third time in the space of 12 months.

249
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,610
And I think at that point we were probably half a year

250
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,730
out from the Rio Olympics.

251
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,649
And mum and I went to the surgeon's office.

252
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:07,570
And me and my surgeon had a great relationship because I ended

253
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,190
up back there all too frequently, unfortunately.

254
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:14,590
But I remember sitting down in his office and I was studying

255
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,929
physiotherapy at the time.

256
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,610
And he said, like, after your rugby career,

257
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,549
you've got to use your hands for your job.

258
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:22,889
Like your bone's not in good health.

259
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:26,990
My left ulna had been shattered a couple of times and I'd obviously

260
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,409
had I think about eight or nine screws and a long plate inserted

261
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:32,929
into my arm and I just had kept fracturing it.

262
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:33,809
And he said,

263
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:36,370
you probably need to have a think about this.

264
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:39,389
Like, is this something that you want to keep doing?

265
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:43,929
And I remember going out to sit on the park bench with mum and we both

266
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,350
were pretty emotional and I just said,

267
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:48,210
I really want to win an Olympic gold medal.

268
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:50,009
I'm going to do it.

269
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,809
And I committed and got that surgery done.

270
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:55,950
I think that one I had a graft taken from my hip bone to fill some

271
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,590
of the holes in my arm and touch wood.

272
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:02,070
Three was enough fractures in my arms being good since then.

273
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:02,129
Yeah.

274
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:02,730
Yeah.

275
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:02,789
Yeah.

276
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:02,850
Yeah.

277
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:02,870
Yeah.

278
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,889
Yeah.

279
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:02,909
Yeah.

280
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:02,929
Yeah.

281
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:02,950
Yeah.

282
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:02,970
Yeah.

283
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:02,990
Yeah.

284
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,009
Yeah.

285
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:03,029
Yeah.

286
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:03,049
Yeah.

287
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:03,110
Yeah.

288
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,149
Yeah.

289
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:03,169
Yeah.

290
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:03,190
Yeah.

291
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,210
Yeah.

292
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:03,230
Yeah.

293
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:03,789
Yeah.

294
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:03,909
Yeah.

295
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:03,970
Yeah.

296
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:03,990
Yeah.

297
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,149
Yeah.

298
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:05,669
I'm going through it at the moment,

299
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:06,169
Chloe,

300
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,870
as a parent seeing our oldest son play elite sport and you,

301
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:13,110
you just see danger all of a sudden everywhere.

302
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:13,649
And,

303
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,149
and your only thought is it's bizarre,

304
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:18,490
a sport that you played yourself all your life.

305
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:19,750
Suddenly it's like,

306
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:20,210
oh,

307
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:20,929
don't run there.

308
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:22,250
Stay away from there.

309
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:24,110
He's clearly not listening at all,

310
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,009
but that,

311
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:26,789
that is just your mind.

312
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,049
It's,

313
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,309
it's,

314
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:28,929
it's agonizing to watch.

315
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,169
And so you're right.

316
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,210
Isn't it for your family to,

317
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,750
they understand the pain of what the third broken arm and

318
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:40,490
how devastating that was for you must have then been to have them over in rio on the on the gold

319
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:45,610
medal dice that must have been really special yeah it's that's like when i look back on that

320
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:51,929
moment like siren sounded and we'd beaten new zealand and and there are probably two moments

321
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:57,450
that will stay with me forever obviously standing on the podium with my teammates and like that

322
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,990
moment when we had our gold medals around our necks and you lift your arms together like

323
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:06,330
it's what i dreamt of right like it was like what i'd been working towards since i was seven years

324
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:11,970
old and it's it still feels pretty surreal that i get to have an olympic gold medal like kathy

325
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:17,889
freeman does you know but the i think the biggest one was this moment when before we went over to

326
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:23,649
put our tracksuits on before the medal presentation we all stood arm in arm my teammates and i we ran

327
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:29,870
towards the stadium and all my favorite people up in the stands mom and dad my siblings my cousins

328
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,970
my auntie and uncle some of my cousins my cousins my cousins my cousins my cousins my cousins my

329
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:36,529
closest friends and there's this awesome photo from around the time of when i wrote in that

330
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:41,590
scrapbook that dream about becoming an olympic gold medalist and all my extended family had

331
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:45,350
traveled to canberra to watch me compete in national cross country and there's this photo

332
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,190
of all of them there and then i've got this photo from rio and it's the exact same group of people

333
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:57,549
and i think it was just so amazing to have them there to celebrate that but also to be able to

334
00:14:57,549 --> 00:14:58,929
express gratitude to them

335
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,950
i always get emotional when i tell this story and no matter how many times i tell this story

336
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:10,230
all the time and no matter how many times i tell it i always get emotional like the fact that

337
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:15,289
they just backed me i think that was the biggest thing like i remember that google search i was

338
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:19,389
still living with mom and dad at that point and i just was like what about rugby why don't i try

339
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:24,669
to go to the olympics for the for rugby and dad's first the first thing dad said i reckon you'd be

340
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:30,230
great at rugby you know and just having the support of of your people in your corner is

341
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,950
such a huge thing and i think that's the biggest thing that i've ever seen in my life and i think

342
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:36,190
how incredible was that isn't it for your first reaction to your dad not you might get hurt while

343
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:41,590
you're doing that i reckon you'll be great that is an incredible you know moment isn't it to start

344
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:46,230
with and i understand you mentioned your siblings michael and bailey the two brothers they were

345
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:51,190
great supporters and continue to be of of you along the way they've had a special place for

346
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:56,490
you understand yeah for sure and i like i just look back on when i was trying to learn the game

347
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,950
just getting out in the backyard i put on every piece of protective equipment

348
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:05,230
like shoulder pads headgear mouth guard i wanted to like shove a pillow down my shirt at one point

349
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,009
when i was learning to tackle because i just got them like they're pretty big boys and i just got

350
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:14,289
them both to run at me over and over and over again until i could learn how to tackle and there

351
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:18,490
was a really clear memory that stood out i remember going down to rat park and bailey my younger

352
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,870
brother he was still playing at the time and i asked him to get down i wanted him to get down

353
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,610
early enough that he wasn't going to be tackling with his sister and his teammates would rock up

354
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,809
but but that a few of them rocked up early and they were kind of just like

355
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,230
taking the piss out of him and you know like oh your sister's gonna run over the top of you and

356
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,610
and he just turned to them and said something like she's gonna be a better rugby player

357
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:45,330
than i ever was and it was just like a cool moment i think publicly for him he didn't have to say that

358
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,690
and maybe he didn't even believe it at the time but just for him to publicly back me in that space

359
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:56,350
i think was really cool because there was a lot of that right like as a woman going into a rugby club

360
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,409
and and particularly 10 years ago that it was now like

361
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:00,850
it wasn't

362
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:06,369
wasn't the most welcoming space you're wearing oversized jerseys there's not a change room to

363
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:10,089
get change in the first grade men's team have access to the change room and we're just out the

364
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:14,309
back maybe under a tent getting ready like it's not the most welcoming environment to walk into

365
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:20,390
back then so to have the support publicly of of my little brother in that space was a pretty special

366
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:24,730
thing i can feel the hairs down the back of my neck with that isn't it what a legend again to

367
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:30,049
your mates are taking the piss out of you it's not an easy one to then say my little sister's

368
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:35,769
going to be a gun and and i'm proud to be here alongside of it you've had incredible support

369
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:42,430
haven't you close to home yeah it's it's been a huge huge part of my journey i think i'm really

370
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:48,829
fortunate as well like again reflecting like i think with sport you have to have an army of people

371
00:17:48,829 --> 00:17:52,829
to support you in that you know like as a kid you don't realize like mom and dad we were we were

372
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:57,210
chatting about this recently like mom and dad probably for 15 years straight never had a long

373
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,990
weekend we never went for a beach holiday or

374
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,029
anything like that we never went for a beach holiday or anything like that we never went for a

375
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:04,630
because they just completely committed to us and our sport and the dreams that we wanted to

376
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:10,569
achieve and it's not until you grow up that you actually appreciate what that allows you to do so

377
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:14,650
i'm i'm incredibly fortunate i think that they were willing to commit but also in a position

378
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,710
to be able to give us those opportunities as well and chloe you started the female athlete

379
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:24,869
project i understand again your brothers were in your corner back in 2020 and and the aim as i said

380
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:29,630
the intro to shine a light on female athletes not getting enough courage you've done an

381
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:35,910
incredible job for women in sport and the platform's so prolific now what's the ultimate

382
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:42,410
aim for the female athlete project for you yeah it's a question i often sit back and think about

383
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:47,630
quite frequently because it's kind of one of those things where the amount of growth we've seen

384
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:53,509
particularly in our social media channels has been awesome and we do our podcasts and as i said

385
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:57,970
through that i've been able to release these books i feel like there's lots of different avenues that

386
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,569
we could take it but i think

387
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:06,109
one of the biggest things for me is this idea of the power of sport in australian culture

388
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:13,049
and its ability to shape attitudes and behaviors more broadly and i think it's such an incredible

389
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:19,630
opportunity to be able to use this platform to show women existing in environments where they

390
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:24,309
haven't in the past and not only existing but thriving and performing and competing at the

391
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:29,549
highest level and i think that's got this incredible ability to not only trickle

392
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:34,750
down to the grassroots level for young girls to see their idols and then want to participate and

393
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:41,190
play which i think is an amazing thing but i i do genuinely believe in what we're doing being able to

394
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:48,190
show people that women deserve equal opportunity across the park not just in the sporting field

395
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,849
in in all areas of life again it's an incredible impact that you've had in in your mission to shine

396
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:58,890
that light and and as you said it's it's filtering across sport and having an impact everywhere have

397
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,549
you always felt like you were a part of the sport and you're a part of the sport and you're a part of the

398
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:04,670
like you're a leader in that sense from a young age it's it's a role that you seem to play really

399
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:10,710
well yeah it's an interesting one i think i didn't know that this is where i would end up i i think

400
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,329
there's a number of things that have probably happened to me as a female athlete which i think

401
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:20,470
would be a common experience for a lot of women in sport that started to make me understand that

402
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:26,650
we weren't playing on an even playing field but one of the key moments that really i feel like

403
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,549
changed the course of my life in a way was becoming an ambassador for

404
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:34,750
our watch which is the organization that does a lot of work in uh the promotion of gender equality

405
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:40,470
for the prevention of domestic violence and and they link up incredibly in in the sporting context

406
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,890
as well and it was when i went through the training workshop with them that they told me

407
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:53,089
about how sport could have this power and i think prior to that as an athlete i i recognize the

408
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:57,970
power of my platform in able to and being able to bring people joy when we win and heartache when

409
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,549
we lose and kind of going on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and

410
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:05,789
along for the journey in that sense right but it was a big moment for me to understand of like wow

411
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:12,730
I can actually create change I can actually create positive change in the world using the platform

412
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:17,829
that sport has given me and so I think I then had this passion where I wanted to tell everyone like

413
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:21,970
I'm really passionate about gender equality but I don't know what to do I want to like do keynotes

414
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:26,809
and panels and tell everyone why women deserve equal opportunity but I didn't know where to

415
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:32,609
funnel the energy I thought about doing a course on gender equality at university and then it was

416
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:39,289
in one of the lockdowns in 2020 that my brother said to me just start just do something just start

417
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:45,150
the podcast and so that's when we started the female athlete project as a podcast in the garage

418
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:50,690
of mum and dad's place and we kind of started experimenting just with podcast content on social

419
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:56,769
media and then we again realized these gaps like I was like where where can I find news

420
00:21:56,809 --> 00:22:00,609
about women's sport like I'd google it I'd search podcast platforms I'd search social

421
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:06,230
media and I just couldn't consistently find it anywhere and so we started to realize like okay

422
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:10,170
well let's post the top five moments from women's sport in the weekend and we started to get really

423
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:15,230
good engagement and the more different types of content we experimented with we realized there

424
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:21,930
was a real appetite and a real demand for women's sport and to me it was a really unique moment

425
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:26,769
because it allowed a whole range of different people to get involved they didn't have to

426
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:31,089
even know the rules half half the people that I chatted to couldn't explain the offside rule

427
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:36,109
right it's a hard rule to explain anyway you didn't have to know football you didn't have

428
00:22:36,109 --> 00:22:40,609
to understand the rules you didn't have to have this incredible knowledge of every single player

429
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:46,589
on the Matilda's team but it became this really welcoming environment for people to get on board

430
00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:52,750
in celebrating these incredible athletes I think it made girls and women feel like they could become

431
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,789
part of this sporting environment and I think that was a really cool thing about it and what

432
00:22:56,789 --> 00:23:02,670
we've started to notice with our work at the Female Athlete Project is when they're putting out a lot

433
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:08,930
of this content people don't necessarily have to be die-hard fans of a particular sport but they

434
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:14,069
love this idea of women breaking barriers and breaking records and being the first which is a

435
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:19,890
really cool thing to realize and then Chloe as you know when you do dial in and you want to know more

436
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:24,450
about Steph Catley and you want to find out about their backgrounds and and you hear their stories

437
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,730
of success and one thing feeds

438
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:31,609
the other doesn't it it's you might have started with little knowledge but by the end of it it had

439
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:37,710
us all completely captivated and and and same with your platform I I love it it's just you see these

440
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,990
remarkable women doing things that I've never seen before and you've got so much diversity in

441
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:47,170
that people can show up doing a range of different things there's been one story that has stood out

442
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:52,769
I mean you've you've got content everywhere of female that's inspired you of a story that maybe

443
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:56,549
we don't know so well yeah gosh that's a hard one um one of the

444
00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:03,089
posts that went absolutely viral on our page was a triathlete I think Emma Pallant-Brown's her name

445
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:08,150
over in the UK and she was running a race and she had kind of like a swimming like a bodysuit type

446
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:12,890
thing on and she got a period and in the photo it was very clear you could see that she had a period

447
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:18,589
and there was a comment from one of the coaches who said like who commented towards the organization

448
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:23,210
that had posted the photo like hey you should crop this photo like it's not appropriate or you should

449
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,769
have asked for her permission or something like that and she ended up reposting or reposting a

450
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:31,849
reply into the comment saying like this is a completely natural process for women I do not

451
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:36,549
want it to be cropped I do not want it to be hidden this is this is part of it and I think

452
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:43,049
we re-shared it and it just went absolutely viral on our page because it was one of those moments

453
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:48,130
where she could have really quite easily gone down the route of like this is pretty uncomfortable I

454
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:53,250
don't want this to be seen I don't want this to be a big deal but I think so many women were really

455
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,769
empowered by this idea of her owning it not only owning it but really being able to do it and

456
00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:01,130
really normalizing it and I think that's a big component of what we're trying to do is again

457
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:06,569
just normalizing a whole range of different barriers that impact women and girls in sport

458
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:11,470
but also celebrating what they're doing at the same time and and kind of when they're putting

459
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:15,829
their hand up and and taking courage to sometimes be the first to do things like that what an

460
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:20,589
amazing story and I'm sure you've got a catalog of so many of them and as you said it's probably

461
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:26,710
started as sport and it's filtering across to you mentioned our watch and we know the stats

462
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:26,769
on it and we know the stats on it and we know the stats on it and we know the stats on it and we

463
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:33,029
that world a horrific and it's national disgrace really but those conversations have been had but

464
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:37,269
haven't maybe had the impact you're approaching it from such a unique way it's uh again really

465
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:42,150
inspiring to hear I just quickly got to ask you some questions I want to ask you but you decided

466
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:48,190
to change to a third code you haven't got an Australian rules background or history what was

467
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:53,630
the thought there I just saw AFLW on the telly I think this was back in 2017 so we'd come home

468
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,769
from Rio I was still playing sevens and to be honest I don't know I don't know I don't know

469
00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:02,710
I was probably in like career best form in sevens but I just was not enjoying it it was a full-time

470
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:08,430
job and I just was not getting the fulfillment that I was in the past and so I contemplated

471
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:14,150
just taking some time away thinking I would return to sevens but I'd seen AFLW on the telly

472
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:19,509
and something about the storytelling approach that the league took around this idea of these

473
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:23,690
women who'd wanted to play at that level for generations and hadn't had the chance and now

474
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,710
there were these like these people who had the chance to do it and I think that's a really good

475
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:31,789
I was like I kind of want to be a part of that like that looks epic and I thought if I combined my

476
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:36,150
rugby skills and my basketball skills like I felt like the two sports could come together

477
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:41,609
to hopefully make me an okay footy player it was yeah it was a pretty ambitious goal I didn't even

478
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:45,950
know the rules of the game it just it wasn't big for me as a kid growing up on the northern beaches

479
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:51,309
in Sydney and and there's been awesome growth in Aussie rules in New South Wales but but back when

480
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:56,369
I was a kid I just didn't have any understanding of it I thought they tackled funny because I was

481
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:05,390
rugby family and I just I didn't get it and so um yeah I I was flown down by Carlton um and

482
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:11,349
invited to to play VFLW and to learn the game there um with the hopes that if it went well

483
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:17,789
that I'd be drafted as a rookie um and I ran around like a proper headless chook in those

484
00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:24,430
early days in in VFLW that's for sure but it was kind of hard because particularly being in

485
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,710
Victoria like it's

486
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:31,849
it's so I don't know so bread and butter for so many footy people that people almost couldn't

487
00:27:31,849 --> 00:27:36,950
explain it to me very well like I'd kind of say like oh I feel like I'm in the wrong spot I think

488
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:41,130
I should have done this differently but I don't I don't know and and I'd have people say like you

489
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:45,349
just gotta just gotta read read the game like just feel it I'm like I can't that's what I'm

490
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:51,470
trying to say to you anyway so I had um I had a couple of great coaches along the way um Steve

491
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:56,690
Salopec was one of them um he was a line coach at Carlton when I first got there and I just would

492
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:01,670
follow I was playing on the wing and I just would ask him to kind of like run the pattern so that I

493
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:07,490
could follow him and kind of get an understanding of where to go and I and I think it was kind of

494
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:12,529
through doing things like that and working out how to learn the game for someone who had no idea

495
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:19,289
about it and now once I learned the game I just became obsessed like it's just it's such a good

496
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:24,009
game right like it's it's a beautiful game and now I just like I love watching it I love playing it

497
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:32,089
for a lot of probably rugby league and rugby union fans who don't necessarily appreciate the

498
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:36,009
game of AFL I think it just often comes down to a lack of understanding I think once you get to

499
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:42,490
know the game it's it's slightly good fun right I concur but one of my uh favorite things to do

500
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:46,470
is to sit with someone from overseas who's never seen it before and they ask these brilliant

501
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:51,329
questions and I'm I often haven't got a good answer yeah throw that ball in can someone jump

502
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:56,690
now and you go no you can't you know but why and I go well you used to be out here but now you can't

503
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:01,589
like there is it is a strange game in some ways but you're right when you pick up the nuance and

504
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:07,230
it's so great for the co that I grew up loving to see people like you embrace it and and what that

505
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:13,190
means for young girls growing up in New South Wales and the potentials off the charts uh Chloe

506
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,990
so it's uh it's awesome to have you in that community you've obviously been able to adapt

507
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:23,289
to it incredibly well and the Giants are a great story themselves so um fantastic to see you out

508
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:26,690
there often say this term Chloe success leaves clues

509
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:31,069
and you've got such a brilliant story I love what you've done as I said in 30 years you've

510
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:35,309
packed in about three lifetimes worth of achievement self-leadership we think it's

511
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:38,849
hard to lead someone else without an idea of self-leadership what does that mean to you Chloe

512
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:49,950
yeah um I think when I look at that for me one of the big things is I have always thought like

513
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,890
when I was younger I always thought that I had to fit in this perfect box of of how to be an elite

514
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,509
athlete and I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't

515
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:02,450
know I've had battles with with anxiety throughout my career that I've now got strategies to manage

516
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:08,230
it but I what I found is like I was so hard on myself ticking all these exact boxes and doing

517
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:13,730
all of these things in the best way possible that I'd almost get more anxious when I wasn't doing it

518
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:21,710
and what I've come to understand about myself is that I don't have to be this perfect elite

519
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:26,670
athlete from a textbook and I think that allows me to be kinder to myself as an athlete

520
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:32,089
but also get the best out of my body and out of my mind and I think by understanding that about

521
00:30:32,089 --> 00:30:37,769
myself it allows me to respect and appreciate that other people that I might be teammates with or that

522
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:42,750
I might be leading that that's okay that we don't all do it in the exact same way you don't strike

523
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:49,150
me as someone that would have anxiety you've got such a calm clear presence about you I suppose

524
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:54,509
sport itself is an anxiety riddled event isn't it performance anxieties everyone's got to deal

525
00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:56,150
with an element of that I don't think it's

526
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:00,829
it's true and you struggled early but you feel like you just you deal with that better than ever

527
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:06,289
now yeah it's interesting I think my battles with it have probably been more away from the field and

528
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:11,970
and dealing with insomnia and anxiety in that respect and there was a period of time where that

529
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:17,670
did significantly impact my enjoyment with footy but I don't know I've always thrived in the high

530
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:21,710
high pressure environments like even looking at that that Rio 2016

531
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:26,690
gold medal like I was the kicker in our team like in sevens you convert from a drop kick

532
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:32,089
to get the extra two points and I was the kicker and I just absolutely thrived in that environment

533
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:38,289
so I don't think it's something that has impacted me from a performance perspective but I think it's

534
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:43,529
something that can potentially have impacted my enjoyment of the game if that makes sense but I

535
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:47,150
think it's been a huge amount of work that I've done with with psychologists over a number of

536
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:52,589
years to really implement different strategies to allow me to actually kind of switch off and

537
00:31:52,589 --> 00:31:56,230
enjoy the ride rather than it being something that feels really like a chore.

538
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:02,890
Chloe we see people who have success like yours are really conscious now how they positively

539
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:07,130
impact others in their environment on a daily basis how do you go about doing that?

540
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:14,470
I am not someone like in front of a group who's going to be like the real hype person and be like

541
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:19,970
up and about and necessarily deliver this really powerful speech I think I'm someone who

542
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:25,049
will always try and lead by my actions and by my behavior but I think

543
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:26,690
a big thing for me is that I'm not someone who's going to be like I'm not going to be like I'm not

544
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:33,430
just trying to develop really good positive relationships with people I think in a team

545
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:38,609
environment in a list of 30 or whatever sport size you're playing in it's it's hard to have a really

546
00:32:38,609 --> 00:32:44,430
great relationship with everyone but I think for me it's about just trying to commit to what is

547
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:51,150
is reasonable within your own limits as well and and not feeling like a shit person if you can't

548
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:56,190
be best friends with every single person in the team you know like I think it's it's just accepting

549
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:01,509
this is this is my strength and this is how I'm actually going to implement that within my own

550
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:07,869
capacity in a way. Yeah what a what a brilliant answer creating and sharing a vision is a

551
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:12,289
dimension of leadership I love asking you about and the female athlete project is an incredible

552
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:17,329
vision how how have you gone about creating that and then sharing it with others?

553
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:22,809
It's quite funny like we're running a business because I'm an athlete and a qualified physio

554
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:26,690
like I have no background in this area I don't have any media qualifications or anything like that

555
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:33,529
so the creation of this vision has been one that continues to evolve and one where I constantly

556
00:33:33,529 --> 00:33:38,589
feel like I have no idea what I'm doing and I feel like most days I'm thrown in the deep end

557
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:43,089
which again I love like it's the coolest thing ever just to be in these positions where every

558
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:47,390
day I'm learning something new and getting better at something that I thought I previously sucked at

559
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:53,690
yeah I've just really embraced the power of bringing other people on board who have

560
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,690
great skill sets to complement what I can do.

561
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:03,730
Um it's been an awesome process of having weirdly people around me who have the right skill sets like

562
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:09,809
with with family and close friends which in business is tricky sometimes having having

563
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:15,869
people like that around you because there are sometimes blurred lines around expectations

564
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:20,809
right of like if it's my younger brother producing my podcast and he misses the deadline

565
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:26,570
he can kind of be like well bad luck you sent your part to me later whatever right like it's it

566
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:32,170
can get complicated in that way but I think it's been a an amazing experience to bring

567
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:38,590
other people's skill sets and opinions and experience on board to create a bigger product

568
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:45,969
that we can then share with more people. Thoughts on curiosity we see a lot of people who have the

569
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:50,369
success that you've had and lead the way you do they are really curious types of people and they

570
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:55,210
constantly approach their learning and development through curiosity does that ring true for you?

571
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:56,610
Yeah.

572
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:02,050
Definitely I think um one of the biggest things for me I think across like the fact that I've

573
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:08,690
played across three different sports there was part of me that almost doubted how it would be

574
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:14,090
perceived in a way you know like my idols were Anna Mears and Lauren Jackson and athletes like

575
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:18,889
that who'd had this like great longevity across their careers and who persevered and persisted

576
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:24,369
through the hardships and so I kind of felt like oh gosh if I change sports another time

577
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:26,690
am I going to just be perceived as someone who just doesn't know how to do it.

578
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:33,130
doesn't persevere but what I came to realize is like it's actually okay to do that it's okay to

579
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:40,989
say hey I'm not enjoying this and I want to try something else and I was really curious to discover

580
00:35:40,989 --> 00:35:49,150
what I was capable of and I really felt like I backed myself in I'm I'm very stubborn in the

581
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:54,849
sense that I hate not being good at things so I just knew that I could I could back myself in

582
00:35:54,849 --> 00:35:55,829
knowing that like even if I wasn't good at things I could back myself in knowing that I could back

583
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:56,670
even if I wasn't good at things I could back myself in knowing that like even if I wasn't good

584
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:00,969
at the beginning I knew that I would hate not being good at it and that I'd keep working until

585
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:09,030
I was good at it. Which is amazing and you know the probability for changing codes is just so

586
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:13,690
to be successful at it that's why it's such an elite club that you you know Michael Jordan

587
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:19,550
went to baseball and and and hit the wall there with with quite incredible success I think that's

588
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:25,449
gets overlooked but even the all-time greats in sport who were great at so many sports growing up

589
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:26,650
and so what what you've been able to do is you know you've been able to do a lot of things

590
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:32,989
is uh isn't a remarkable story that clearly you should be incredibly proud of communicating with

591
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:38,250
clarity is another dimension of leadership we're pretty passionate about Chloe and and that is your

592
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:43,070
business isn't it you do that incredibly well with the female athlete project have you gone about

593
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:50,409
that strategy of communication? Yeah I think for us at at TFAT we again touching on that idea of

594
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:56,650
knowing that our audience aren't necessarily these sport obsessed fans some of them definitely are

595
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:02,750
for a range of different sports but we've just wanted to make sure that our messaging is about

596
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:08,769
celebrating these incredible athletes I think with the area that we work in we could probably go down

597
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:13,070
one of two avenues we could go down that that uplifting and celebrating route or we could go

598
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:18,469
down calling out inequities and and saying this is not good enough and and don't get me wrong we

599
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:24,070
definitely do that when the time is right and when it's necessary but 90 plus percent of the time

600
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,650
we've we've been really clear on the fact that what we want to do is we want to do it in a way that's

601
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:33,710
is use it to lift people up we often um Bez who I co-host our weekly podcast with we often use the

602
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:40,110
phrase a rising tide lifts all boats and this idea that we all want to be in this together and I think

603
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:44,989
it's this beautiful thing about women's sport is that it's very much a place of recognizing and

604
00:37:44,989 --> 00:37:50,190
celebrating and lifting each other up rather than tearing each other down. It's an interesting

605
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:55,469
discussion Chloe and I wanted to just divert there for a moment have you ever had a moment

606
00:37:55,469 --> 00:37:56,650
on the calling out of the women's sport? I've had a moment on the calling out of the women's sport

607
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:01,610
about inequalities and and naming something that you see is wrong have you ever had a moment we

608
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:06,349
thought geez we jumped in a bit hard there and maybe we got that wrong or have you always felt

609
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:11,489
considered enough that you've got it right? It's a really tricky one and it's always fun for the

610
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:15,389
anxiety when you're calling things out right because it's just particularly on social media

611
00:38:15,389 --> 00:38:20,170
because you never really know where it could go. The Basil Zemplis example recently was quite an

612
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:24,110
interesting one I don't know if you saw it where he was at the press conference and there was a

613
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,650
snippet taken of him talking about the tennis and he was talking about the tennis and he was talking

614
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:32,530
about the tennis and he said what was perceived was that he compared the women's final of the

615
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:40,650
Australian Open to the reserves game but it wasn't released as a broader video so we we released what

616
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:46,550
had come out just that first video that's all we saw we released it without any opinion we wanted

617
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:50,929
to make sure we're just putting the news and information up there it went out of control and

618
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:55,110
then we released his statement when it came out saying it was completely taken out of context

619
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,650
we released the statement of the

620
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:01,829
journalist but we had people messaging us saying this is incredibly poor reporting it's been taken

621
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:06,869
out of context you're not covering the full story but social media is hard right because we had

622
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:12,949
covered the full story but the algorithm if people only get fed the real they only see the real of

623
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:17,530
that short video it was very anxiety inducing we ended up taking the video down because it was

624
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:21,909
something where it was like we want to make sure that we're just putting information up there that

625
00:39:21,909 --> 00:39:26,650
doesn't potentially get us in trouble as well right because we've got to monitor comment sections and

626
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:33,449
things like that so that's probably an example of when things do go viral it's hard to keep up

627
00:39:33,449 --> 00:39:40,489
yes I did see that story and I and and worked with Basil for a number of years and and you're right

628
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:47,050
it's nuanced isn't it it's and I often you know had this conversation with someone you know as a

629
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:55,289
white male turning 49 this year growing up and and I love what AFLW's brought to our community

630
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:56,550
you know and I look back at my...

631
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:00,869
sister and i think god how ridiculous that you didn't have a pathway at that age and

632
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:07,230
how sad really for a range of different reasons but i also know i don't understand the nuance of

633
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:13,309
aflw quite and you get nervous around weighing in on something that you maybe don't get the

634
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:18,050
language right and it's an anxiety riddle thing the other way too because you feel like you could

635
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:23,949
inadvertently say something that you don't mean to and and get taken out of context do you have

636
00:40:23,949 --> 00:40:28,750
that sort of sense as well or is it a bit like grow up guys get on with it and learn better and

637
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:33,670
and get it right i mean is there some leeway there or how do you feel about that one of the lessons

638
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:39,349
that i learned during my time when i had some exposure with the hour watch work a lesson that

639
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:43,909
i learned from one of the incredible women in that space was this idea of when they go into

640
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:49,630
corporate offices and work with men in c-suite roles to work with them on gender equality if

641
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:53,929
you come in and you say this is how it is this is how it should be done and i think that's a

642
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:59,809
no questions can be asked there's no space for learning it doesn't necessarily allow them the

643
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:04,570
room to ask questions and to learn and so that's something i've always taken away from it is

644
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:09,889
as long as someone is willing to learn and have an open conversation about it then i'm

645
00:41:09,889 --> 00:41:13,869
willing to have that conversation with them to teach them like something like that

646
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:19,630
compared to some of the blokes we get in the comments who just come in with the purely with

647
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:23,909
the goal of degrading women and making sexualized comments and things like that so i think

648
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:31,429
that's at very opposite ends of the spectrum yeah i think having people weigh in on the game

649
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:36,110
is important right like i know elise perry is a cricketer and elisa healy have been really vocal

650
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:41,789
in the past about women's cricket and they want to be analyzed and they want to be scrutinized

651
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:46,849
for their performance because to them that's how the game progresses that's how it gets better

652
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:50,409
that's where for them they feel like they can be more on par with the men's cricket

653
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:53,909
and i think it's a really great point and i know

654
00:41:53,929 --> 00:42:00,710
there's been hesitation from some people around aflw making comments on it and i think the biggest

655
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:05,449
thing for me is if you're going to come along as an expert who knows what you're talking about

656
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:09,909
you can comment and you can analyze the game as long as you're commenting and analyzing the game

657
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:16,090
from a perspective that's about football and not about gender to me that's what matters if you're

658
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:21,110
coming in and you're saying oh she can't kick it far she's not good because she's a girl that's

659
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,909
very different compared to coming in and saying oh she's not good because she's a girl that's

660
00:42:23,929 --> 00:42:28,409
going insane she didn't make she didn't kick this goal because i don't know she went she swung

661
00:42:28,409 --> 00:42:33,150
around her body or her hips weren't square you know you know what i'm trying to get at yeah no

662
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:37,789
absolutely i think it's it's a good conversation to have and i think the lines are really clear i

663
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:44,369
think it's just that the cancel culture world that creates a nervousness around getting you know

664
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:49,230
someone's you know description wrong or however it might be but i think you're right on the clear

665
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:53,610
lines isn't it if you and that is the brilliance what you need because i look at the trajectory of

666
00:42:53,929 --> 00:42:58,750
and i think it's remarkable but remarkable the level it's being played at you know in its infancy

667
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:04,750
and and still girls coming through that have not had the pathway from you know six or seven years

668
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:09,590
and now you're starting to see that and i love it i'm seeing the standard and you're seeing young

669
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:14,030
girls the best thing at the junior footy club is just seeing that six-year-olds now i've got a

670
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:19,610
proper pathway that is the equivalent of any male and i think that's uh where the game is headed in

671
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:23,809
such a an elite way but it is a it is a good conversation to have with you know

672
00:43:23,929 --> 00:43:27,710
someone like you is it's that that's what you want isn't it you want to have experts come in and

673
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:33,429
and and analyze it and have their view in the most respectful of ways how important can i ask

674
00:43:33,429 --> 00:43:39,869
is has collaboration been for you chloe and all the that you've achieved yeah collaboration has

675
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:47,309
been huge and i think it comes back to that idea of putting myself consistently in situations where

676
00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:53,909
i am out of my depth and there's this this quote that i loved about

677
00:43:53,929 --> 00:44:00,969
that the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of becoming a beginner

678
00:44:00,969 --> 00:44:06,329
again and so let's say it one more time so i can get it clearly yeah the heaviness of being

679
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:12,510
successful was replaced by the lightness of becoming a beginner again and it was i really

680
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:16,809
felt that when i got to carlton like we were in sevens we were obviously gold medalists we're on

681
00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:21,690
top of the world and then i got to this brand new sport and yeah i was totally out of my depth but

682
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:23,909
it really allowed me to take a step back and i was like i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do this i'm gonna

683
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:30,809
and i had to learn a lot of humility right to be constantly putting my hand up and saying i don't

684
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:36,309
know what i'm doing i need to learn and finding the best people at what they do so that i could

685
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:41,590
get better and and to me that's what collaboration has looked like throughout my career and clearly

686
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:46,570
you're good at it to be able to grab people and teach you something and get it so quickly in a

687
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:52,170
couple of years to go from novice to olympic gold medalist is again a remarkable story chloe who's

688
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,789
been the greatest leader in your life

689
00:44:53,929 --> 00:45:02,809
uh i reckon i'm gonna say my mom she's awesome my mom i've got a really close relationship with

690
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:10,869
her and and i think she's been a real leader for me because she's changed careers to find what she

691
00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:15,750
loves doing and and i think even though it wasn't necessarily in a sporting context it was a

692
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:21,210
representation to me that it's okay to to seek out what makes you happy and what makes you fulfilled

693
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:23,289
rather than just sticking to the status quo

694
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:33,050
and my mom is also someone who is constantly trying to learn and be better at things like

695
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:38,349
having hard conversations and and doing online courses and modules and things like that like

696
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:43,969
she's just so she's always looking for ways to be better in in all aspects of life and i think

697
00:45:43,969 --> 00:45:49,010
it's something that i really admire and i really love about her and nice to be able to call that

698
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:53,809
out and you know i'm sure uh she'll appreciate that but clearly that's something that's flows

699
00:45:53,929 --> 00:45:59,250
through to you that desire to keep getting better at everything there's so many passions that you've

700
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:04,369
got talking to you and you've crossed over so many codes and areas the female athlete project but

701
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:10,269
we're a bit obsessed with collaboration is there someone that you thought god that would be a

702
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:14,989
person i'd love to collaborate with in the female athlete project or another passion in your life is

703
00:46:14,989 --> 00:46:20,889
there a name that springs to mind i think there's some some incredible platforms overseas doing

704
00:46:20,889 --> 00:46:23,849
amazing work there's there's a platform called together that's been

705
00:46:23,929 --> 00:46:30,050
started by some some huge um athletes over in the u.s like sue bird is one of them the basketballer who

706
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:36,829
i just think is awesome um so i think i think looking to to platforms like that that are doing

707
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:41,030
what we're doing on a much bigger scale and with the audience that they have access to in the u.s

708
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:45,869
