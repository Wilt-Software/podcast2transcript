1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,899
A Listener Production.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,779
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

3
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:13,679
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,439
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,399
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

6
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,100
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,260
in education, sport, industry and the arts

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,219
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

9
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:29,699
where everyone has a voice.

10
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,280
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

11
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:52,829
Well, in this special episode, I sat down with some old friends,

12
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,329
Mark Howard, Chris Judd and Nathan Brown,

13
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,950
who came together under the banner of the Friday Huddle

14
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,170
to broadcast AFL to millions of Australians

15
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,770
with a show that has often pushed the boundaries.

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,650
As we sat down, this was a different tone,

17
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,269
a reflective and meaningful conversation

18
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:11,569
touching on when we draw the line, leadership and family

19
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:14,129
and why growth as a collective is so important.

20
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,150
Well, this is going to be, I think, a unique experience

21
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,109
for the Empowering Leaders podcast

22
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:26,049
because I'm surrounded by old friends,

23
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:29,230
people I've worked with for an extended period of time

24
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,049
and I'll introduce them with a semi-serious heading to start with

25
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,969
and I'm looking at one of my old mates, Nathan Brown,

26
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:39,769
who came to the Western Bulldogs, picked 10 in 1996,

27
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,310
ended up playing 219 games, kicked 349 goals

28
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,829
with two clubs, the Bulldogs and Richmond,

29
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,250
an All-Australian twice, married to the beautiful Christina,

30
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:51,010
father of four, so thanks, Nathan, for joining us.

31
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,629
And Chris Judd's opposite me, he was picked three in 2001,

32
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,569
went on to become one of the all-time greats,

33
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,569
a six-time All-Australian, five-time best and fairer,

34
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:01,969
a premiership captain, a couple of Brownlows, Juddy,

35
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,569
a Hall of Famer on every level as well.

36
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:05,409
Good to see you, Juddy.

37
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:06,750
Thank you, Duke. Very good to be you.

38
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,610
I'm a bit nervous that Nate didn't bring his conversation wedges today,

39
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,250
that he's rocked up nude, but it's exciting nonetheless.

40
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:15,849
I think we will need to discuss the conversation wedges

41
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:17,310
and what that means around Nate.

42
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,090
Mark Howard is someone I've known for a long time.

43
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:20,830
He's been a lifetime sports journalist.

44
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:23,629
He broadcast the Howie Games,

45
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:25,449
he's the biggest podcast in the world,

46
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:28,870
and he's been an incredible success over many mediums.

47
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:29,729
So welcome to you, Howie.

48
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:30,889
Thank you, mate.

49
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:32,330
I'm not sure I know much about leadership,

50
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,250
but I'll be interested to see what Chris has,

51
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,729
and I'll be really interested to see what Nathan has to say about leadership.

52
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:40,110
So, well, over a period of time,

53
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:42,310
and some of you I've known for over 20 years,

54
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:45,389
and essentially what brought us together was broadcasting AFL football,

55
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:46,629
for those that aren't aware.

56
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,669
And the banner that we ran under was the Friday Huddle

57
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,009
for an extended period of time.

58
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:54,289
So if I can get something semi-serious out of this group,

59
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:57,449
because our style of broadcasting wasn't particularly highbrow,

60
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,110
and so if you're listening to this podcast and you think,

61
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:01,870
what was the style of broadcasting with the Friday Huddle?

62
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,150
What did it sound like?

63
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:04,310
What was the sort of vibe?

64
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:06,050
Well, this is a bit of a snapshot from 2021.

65
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,430
Jaddy wasn't with us this year,

66
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:09,770
but just have a listen to a little bit of the way

67
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,770
that we have tended to broadcast AFL football.

68
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:13,810
Even when you're a surfer, you go to the beach a lot.

69
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:16,770
I couldn't even guess how many times you've had sand kicked in your face.

70
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,849
Maybe a bit of an idea of the sort of nickname.

71
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:20,830
When I came in tonight, I thought it was Chief.

72
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:22,949
Are you unhappy about something, Piggy?

73
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,090
That was Melbourne.

74
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:26,349
What's your story?

75
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,889
You're the journalist.

76
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,509
And I know you haven't broken a story for a while,

77
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,210
but you are the journalist.

78
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:32,389
That is our man, Howie.

79
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,669
He is genuine, and he is a genuine tosser.

80
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:38,069
I'm seeing the Chief on the Greco-Roman wrestling pad.

81
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:40,289
Don't they do sumo?

82
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,449
Are you comfortable to admit that you've become a tool, Howie?

83
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,349
You're an imbecile of a man.

84
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:50,330
The depths of your stupidity have yet to be discovered.

85
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:50,969
Well, apparently.

86
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,729
Damo breaks news as well, but that hasn't happened for about three years.

87
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,650
But anyway, Damo.

88
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:55,909
I tried, though.

89
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:58,610
I've already told you I'd beat three of the four of you in a fight.

90
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,669
Me and Damo, yes.

91
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:00,889
Yeah.

92
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,189
So which of the other one?

93
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:03,370
I'm not going anywhere near Chief.

94
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:05,009
So you're beating Darce in a scrap.

95
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:05,550
Tell you what.

96
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:06,669
Darce is a vegetarian.

97
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,030
If you had your time again, would you have Darce or someone with personality?

98
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:15,349
Oh, you're warming up, are you, Chief?

99
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:15,889
He is now.

100
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:16,970
Come out of your slumber.

101
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,990
So, as I said, real highbrow stuff is the way we've tempted you.

102
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:22,670
We've tended to roll in the past.

103
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,170
And if I can set the tone for this conversation, Howie, Juddy and Nate,

104
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,009
it is around discussion around leadership.

105
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,230
And to me, that is the natural form that we revert to.

106
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,129
That is what we knew playing footy and that is the idea of it.

107
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,810
But, Juddy, when you first joined us,

108
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:41,230
we convinced you to join us out of the world of AFL football.

109
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,230
I think we did have some serious discussions around,

110
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:48,050
were you entirely comfortable with the way that we broadcast you as a player?

111
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,930
I remember you had some reservations around the style,

112
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,930
the style of what we did on Triple M.

113
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,930
If you reflect back on that, do you reckon that was well-founded?

114
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,730
As a player that generally just wanted to concentrate on footy,

115
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,430
I was probably uncomfortable with any sort of broadcasting.

116
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,050
I just wanted to play my footy and stay out of the limelight.

117
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,050
So, it's different for different personalities.

118
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,430
But, yeah, I think going back, I think it's unhealthy

119
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:18,930
how much certain elements in media sweat on mistakes.

120
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,709
And I think that's got deleterious impacts

121
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:23,649
on society because we see that happening across social media

122
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:25,410
and all sorts of different avenues at the minute.

123
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:28,129
And the net result of that is you get more people

124
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:29,310
that don't try and do something.

125
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:32,730
They sit around and become trolls in their parents' basement

126
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,430
instead of out there actually making mistakes

127
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,089
because to achieve anything, that's something that needs to happen.

128
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:40,569
I love that Juddy's introduced a word called deleterious.

129
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,189
Deleterious.

130
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:45,329
And that has blown our group away almost immediately.

131
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,670
And I said, we're going to try and keep this at a level

132
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,829
that is of interest.

133
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:50,670
So, Nate, I want to play you.

134
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:52,610
A bit of a grab that was a bit confronting, I reckon,

135
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:53,470
for all of us this year.

136
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,829
And Juddy wasn't part of this.

137
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:57,149
You probably haven't heard it.

138
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,850
But Triple M historically came up with an idea,

139
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:05,769
Sam Newman and Gary Lyon and the guys that started Triple M football

140
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:08,750
around the idea that we'll award the worst on ground

141
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,910
as well as the best on ground.

142
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:11,050
Now, I remember being a player,

143
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:12,230
how when I've spoken about this before,

144
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:14,290
you've come off the ground and you had an idea

145
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,069
that you had a shocker.

146
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,370
And you're thinking, do I turn on to Triple M

147
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,149
and see if they thought I was as bad as I was?

148
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:20,689
I found out that Triple M was the worst on ground.

149
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:21,129
I found that funny.

150
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:23,589
I remember tuning in and Spud's giving me the three worst on ground.

151
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:23,910
Same.

152
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,769
And it was that combination between I'm really shitty

153
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:29,750
how badly I played, but I can't help but see the humour in it.

154
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,709
Because to me, it was aiming up.

155
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:33,670
It wasn't aiming at first-year players.

156
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:35,329
And I found the humour in it.

157
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:37,589
But we had Fraser Geary join us this year,

158
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,649
who's an extraordinary AFL player.

159
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:42,050
He's kicked 100 goals in a season, a two-time Commonwealth medal winner.

160
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:46,889
He was very much at the front of a lot of the banter on Triple M.

161
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,569
So I was a bit stunned.

162
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:50,310
He refused to come on to Triple M.

163
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:53,149
But he came on and he expressed this in a pretty emotional way.

164
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:53,449
Have a listen.

165
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,370
Triple M, to be honest, in their heyday,

166
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,050
and I'm not being rude saying this,

167
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:00,029
but when you did your 3-2-1 worst players on ground,

168
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,550
I think it had an effect on things like depression.

169
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,290
And a lot of the guys that were doing those calls

170
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,029
have had depression in their lives, and I don't think it helped.

171
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,829
I think we've seen depression over the years get bigger and bigger,

172
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:12,029
and we've all had it.

173
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,269
Probably everyone in this room's had it.

174
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:15,410
And those sorts of things don't help.

175
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:17,529
And I haven't listened to Triple M for a long time.

176
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,290
I hope you don't do it.

177
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,569
So I've never done anything, Jodie, where you thought,

178
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:22,689
aim to harm or upset anyone.

179
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,490
That's never been humour to me.

180
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,829
That is the line crossed.

181
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,050
So you're sitting there.

182
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:27,910
I think we're all a bit stunned.

183
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:31,670
I certainly was with that being something that he'd reflected on

184
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,310
as causing a bit of harm.

185
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,990
I used to love Fraser, and I love the humour of him being the carpet python

186
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,589
and was he on today or was he not on.

187
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,009
But do you reckon that line had been crossed in the past?

188
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,829
I think so.

189
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,790
Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't have been comfortable giving someone

190
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,709
worse on ground votes.

191
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,050
Really?

192
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:46,389
Yeah.

193
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:50,230
But that doesn't mean it's wrong.

194
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,670
Yeah.

195
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:52,329
But I wouldn't have been comfortable doing it.

196
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:56,689
And in a way, I reckon it is a little bit disrespectful to the –

197
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,930
as a broadcaster, you're a second iteration of the players

198
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,649
are putting on the game.

199
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,250
They're risking their body, risking their reputations.

200
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,170
And by doing that, they provide a job for a whole heap of people

201
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,689
that are in secondary positions, if you like.

202
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,790
Not lesser positions, but there's no broadcast

203
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,829
without the players putting it on.

204
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:19,370
So I think you've got to tread a bit of a line between treating

205
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,370
those players with respect.

206
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:23,470
Because without that, there's no jobs for journos.

207
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,410
You know, there's no TV rights.

208
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:28,930
There's this huge industry that we all have benefited from.

209
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,589
So it's not something I would have been comfortable.

210
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,389
But it's not wrong.

211
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:34,649
You know, that doesn't mean I'm right and other people

212
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:35,909
that were comfortable doing it is wrong.

213
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,590
But just in my guts doing that at the end of the game,

214
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,889
I wouldn't have felt comfortable doing it.

215
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,970
So I'll be accused of hypocrisy here, Howie Browning,

216
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,710
because I've got a real issue with the way our senior coaches

217
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:49,570
in particular get smashed by our industry in an unfair way.

218
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,509
And I think it's creating –

219
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:51,789
I think it's creating a whole heap of issues.

220
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,210
But my view was that was past players in the in-joke.

221
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:59,129
I found that in the in-joke, Juddy, that when you're a part of that,

222
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,610
it was that you were part of this community and we did respect you

223
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,629
and it was done through humour, Howie.

224
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,169
But, you know, clearly that's not something that we all necessarily share.

225
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:08,730
There's a couple of things to note there.

226
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:11,570
We discussed before we get to it that Juddy was no good on TV.

227
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,669
He wasn't bad on radio.

228
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,509
He's a podcaster.

229
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:17,190
The words he is using this evening and this afternoon are quite extraordinary.

230
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:19,129
Very, very good in podcasting.

231
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:20,429
So I think we've found his space there.

232
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:26,269
The thing – because I commentate on the game or host the call,

233
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:29,450
which I'm really lucky, I don't have to make comment.

234
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:32,129
I haven't played football, so I'm never going to be in that position.

235
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,090
There's no way I could go on air and be that negative about someone.

236
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:39,049
So I can completely understand.

237
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,610
It comes back to what we were saying before.

238
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,230
If it's within our group, I think it's okay.

239
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,850
Once you start giving it to other people, then you can upset people.

240
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,409
The thing that really took me aback, and I don't know about you, Nate,

241
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,490
and I know it took the Chief back.

242
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:54,110
In the conversation was when Fraser said, you know,

243
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,529
we all suffer from depression.

244
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,529
Everyone in this room will have suffered from depression.

245
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,490
And my immediate thought was, actually, mate, that's not me.

246
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,350
I've never suffered from depression.

247
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:09,730
And in that time and space, because you're so, in the modern media,

248
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,889
careful about what you say, the immediate thought in my head was to pop up

249
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:17,590
and say, listen, I know it's a problem for a lot of people in the community,

250
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,070
but it's not everybody in the community, and I haven't suffered that way,

251
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,090
and I didn't say anything.

252
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,590
And I look back and think, was it the right thing or not the wrong thing to say?

253
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:26,970
Because if you say it and it comes out wrong,

254
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,549
then you're on the front page of the paper again for making comments

255
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:31,309
about mental health.

256
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:33,710
So it is a fine line, Nate, isn't it?

257
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,490
That's what took me back in that conversation as well.

258
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:39,149
I felt the same, Howie, and obviously Chief did,

259
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:44,470
and us three have had a conversation about it, that I haven't had depression,

260
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:50,049
but out of respect to Fraser on that night because he was airing a lot of things,

261
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,590
things that have happened in his past.

262
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:54,289
And respect to him for coming on and fronting up and saying,

263
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:58,029
I'm prepared to eyeball you guys, and so that was my experience.

264
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:01,029
Nate, coming back to you, I mean, it's interesting, you're a father of four now.

265
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,490
I want to talk about parenting with all of you.

266
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:05,450
Your responsibilities are, I've got to look after four kids.

267
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,070
You married the beautiful Christina, probably your greatest achievement ever,

268
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:10,070
Nate, as we often say.

269
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,490
But I remember you as a 17-year-old and think your development

270
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,330
and where you've come and being sincere as your own person is the greatest growth

271
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,029
I think I've seen in any of my life.

272
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:23,830
So there's a lot to lose, isn't there, Nate, by doing something that you regret?

273
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:26,929
Well, you'd want to hope that over time you do mature

274
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:30,230
and you do things a little bit different than what you did when you were 17.

275
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:35,350
But, I mean, as everybody always knows, you spend a lifetime building up

276
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,149
some sort of cachet in the business and it can be undone in a couple of seconds.

277
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:43,690
But being a father of four has made me realise that I'm not on my own anymore

278
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,889
and I've got to provide for these kids for probably well after they're 18.

279
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:49,889
And I feel like I'm a better life.

280
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:54,490
I feel like I'm a better leader of my own four kids than I ever was at a football club.

281
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,590
And I think everybody knows what their shortcomings are.

282
00:11:58,129 --> 00:11:59,629
Sometimes it's pointed out to you.

283
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:00,950
Sometimes it's not.

284
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:02,590
You let go to your own devices.

285
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,429
But I think I'm clearly a better leader and show more leadership to my kids

286
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:08,690
than what I did as a footballer.

287
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,889
Yeah, and that's an interesting conversation.

288
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:13,870
There's 14 kids between the four of us sitting in this conversation now.

289
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:14,629
Jodie's got four.

290
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:15,330
Brandon's got four.

291
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:16,429
I've got four.

292
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:17,909
So how he's got a couple.

293
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:19,929
And, Jodie, I think, you know,

294
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:22,370
you said males maybe is an evolutionary thing.

295
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:22,830
We sit around.

296
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:23,970
We love to sledge each other.

297
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:25,250
We get the banter in it.

298
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:26,649
But we don't often sit around and say,

299
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,950
hey, man, what are you doing on the home front parenting-wise?

300
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,889
And I think there's a missed opportunity in that because, to me,

301
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:34,570
it's this thing I want to be better at than anything in my life.

302
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:36,350
There's no playbook on it that works.

303
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,049
You don't tend to share information.

304
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,009
How do you approach leadership on the family front?

305
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,049
No, if you get some good things, I'll be keen to hear them.

306
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:46,529
How hard is it?

307
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:49,970
Do you find it tests you in ways that you can't?

308
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:50,750
I can't possibly imagine.

309
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,549
Is that how you find it?

310
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:52,309
Very hard, Duke.

311
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:53,070
Very hard.

312
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,389
Can I just interject for a moment?

313
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:00,350
Jodie has more trouble organising his staff that look after his children

314
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:00,710
than actual children.

315
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,549
That's what I was talking about.

316
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:02,889
You were talking about the actual kids, weren't you?

317
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:06,029
So I don't think you're asking the right bloke because he only pops in,

318
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,549
sees them an hour a day, and then he gets the cleaner, the cook,

319
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:11,950
the fitness bloke, the pool cleaner to take charge.

320
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:13,070
He's got a lot of staff, our man.

321
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,629
So it's like the Von Trapp family.

322
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:17,750
They get presented to Chris for an hour in their –

323
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,789
They wear their name tags, too, just so I don't –

324
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:22,769
Don't mix it up because that's an uncomfortable thing when you do mix it up.

325
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,730
Well, we've all spent more time with them than we could ever have possibly

326
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,830
imagined in the last couple of years.

327
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:30,230
How about you, Howie, from a leadership point with your kids?

328
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,470
Do you think about it?

329
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:35,049
Do you and Eric – again, I think the greatest thing in your life is Eric,

330
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,289
likewise for all of us.

331
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:36,570
Yes.

332
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,970
Do you guys discuss parenting?

333
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,110
Do you have a philosophy?

334
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,490
Yeah, we do.

335
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,210
We've got various philosophies.

336
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,309
I think with my son, much more than my father would have been to me,

337
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,730
is I'm constantly pushing with.

338
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:52,690
I'm constantly pushing with him respect to women because it's become such a big

339
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,570
part of our community.

340
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:59,169
So when he will say – he might say at dinner, such and such girl came up to me

341
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:01,529
and said she liked me and I just sort of walked off.

342
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,990
I said, mate, even at your age, you need to say thank you.

343
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,230
I appreciate that.

344
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:09,950
That's very kind of you and really understand that respect to women.

345
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:15,029
I think as far as parenting goes, we have – Erica and I lived quite

346
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:15,809
adventurous lives.

347
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:16,669
We've travelled a lot.

348
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,409
We're trying to bring that into our kids' lives.

349
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:23,629
The thing that I'm really trying and Erica really tries – and you've got to be

350
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:27,769
careful when you reflect on the school system, but I think at the public school

351
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:31,809
system, certainly for both our young kids, there's so many discussions about

352
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:35,669
resilience, but they never get the opportunity to learn resilience tasks

353
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:38,970
because – and we joke about it on the show – everybody gets a medal,

354
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,649
everybody does well, and the teacher never says you can do better.

355
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,169
So we've really tried to push that with our kids.

356
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:49,750
One, that it's okay to make mistakes and fail, but you can't learn.

357
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,450
You can't learn resilience until you do fail in their situation.

358
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:58,330
So that's a big one, that be prepared to fail, accept failure, learn from failure,

359
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:02,549
don't be afraid of it, and therefore build up your resilience.

360
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:06,370
Because the bit I don't understand about the modern world, all three of you as fathers,

361
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:11,529
I don't understand what happens when Sky or Mac gets to the end of school

362
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:15,870
and doesn't get the marks they want or doesn't get into the university role

363
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,870
they want or the TAFE or doesn't get the first job they go to.

364
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,809
Some way I feel we're bringing up kids that that is the first time

365
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:24,769
they experience failure.

366
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:28,169
And then I'm worried that they don't know how to deal with that situation

367
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:31,250
because for the first 18 years everyone said you came eighth, well done,

368
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,909
good effort, good job.

369
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:36,970
Yeah, it's an interesting thought, isn't it, that everyone gets a prize now

370
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,029
and what that does to a generation of kids.

371
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:42,730
I had a friend of mine who's a father of five and he shared this quote with me

372
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,070
and I think about it a lot through parenting.

373
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,429
It's Daniel Patrick Moynihan,

374
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:49,129
the richest inheritance any child can have is a stable, loving, disciplined,

375
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,909
family life and it resonated with me more than anything.

376
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:56,490
It's like trying to get that balance right between stability in your house,

377
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:59,669
clearly there's got to be some love but there's also got to be that boundaries

378
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:03,049
and discipline which to me I find the hardest part of parenting is to here's

379
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:06,710
the rules and here's the parameters which we've got to because to me

380
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,850
it doesn't work without it.

381
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:13,149
Is there a philosophy that you take, Nate, to the parenting side of your house or not?

382
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,429
There is, Duke, and it's obviously to do with Christina who it's pointed out

383
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:19,669
many, many times on a daily basis by you guys.

384
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,690
I've really landed on my tippy toes with Christina.

385
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,330
Have you ever, Nate?

386
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:31,029
But we are a tight unit and we are in love and I'm happy to say that we're in love

387
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:36,149
and we present this unified front to our kids because that's what I want my kids

388
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:39,929
to look up and see every day that we love each other, we're affectionate with each other,

389
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,730
we don't argue in front of them.

390
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:44,330
Everybody has arguments and we try and do that away from them

391
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:49,149
but just that they have two adults who they can look up to and aspire

392
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,590
to because you're not always going to get it right.

393
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:54,190
I had an argument with my 10-year-old girl yesterday who said,

394
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,289
you'll never understand and you feel anger at that point.

395
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,309
You tell me why I wouldn't understand and then you have to just bring it back

396
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:04,950
a little bit and then I go to my wife and ask her to help out with that sort of stuff.

397
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:09,730
So being a single parent, I'm not sure how hard that would be.

398
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:11,710
I'd never want to have to go through that.

399
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:16,329
My heart goes out to everybody who is a single parent but I feel like if we're stable

400
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:19,470
at the top, like any organisation, the kids are going to follow.

401
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,609
Do you know what I love is that when Nate beautifully expressed how much he loves his wife,

402
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,690
the awkwardness for the other three of us was palpable.

403
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:30,410
You could feel Juddy just recoiled in his chair and I love that about my old mate Nate

404
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:34,410
is that he's absolutely out there and proud with him and his wife.

405
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:40,549
On that, when I'm a little bit flat, I must admit I jump on Instagram, NathanBrown07

406
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:45,089
and I just look at some of the pictures of him and his wife and the fact that they discuss openly

407
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:48,029
they're in love and look at my beautiful wife and they're holding hands.

408
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:49,269
It's a beautiful thing, Nathan.

409
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:49,730
I've never had that.

410
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,750
I've never had the opportunity to tell you before when I'm a little bit flat,

411
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:56,089
I go on there and I see the love between you and Christina and it just gives me a lift, mate.

412
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,009
It just gives me a lift.

413
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,670
Now, we're drifting back to Friday Huddle territory here.

414
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:01,609
I'm going to straighten this shit back up again.

415
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,269
Hey, Juddy, I had this experience where I'm parenting for a moment where we're away at a holiday.

416
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:10,690
I grew up in a fairly humble environment.

417
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:11,890
We used to have one holiday.

418
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,210
I think we had one holiday my whole childhood.

419
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:16,390
It was down to Glenelg Beach, 10 minutes from our house.

420
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:19,109
I thought it was the best thing ever for four days.

421
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:23,289
And we've had this great luxurious lifestyle, really, to be able to go and visit places.

422
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:29,109
And down at the coast, one of the kids was trying to pause live TV on the house by the beach.

423
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:33,849
And it was an old TV that didn't – and threw the remote at the TV and was like,

424
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,849
this TV is bullshit.

425
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,509
It doesn't work.

426
00:18:36,069 --> 00:18:37,190
Now, I lost it, Juddy.

427
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,950
I was like, are you kidding?

428
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:45,309
Do you have any perspective at all of just how lucky you – and I realized then that you can't teach perspective.

429
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,230
If that's what you've grown up with and you've been fortunate enough to travel –

430
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,089
I mean, how do you find that?

431
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:49,609
How do you find that, Juddy?

432
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:54,509
Because clearly, you know, your kids have experienced stuff that, you know, is elite and great opportunities.

433
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:55,990
Is that something that you think about or not?

434
00:18:56,349 --> 00:19:00,369
It's like more of a back basket than mine, Duke, if I'm being brutally honest.

435
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,690
But you make some good points.

436
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:06,470
I mean, I try to keep it simple.

437
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:09,049
Most of parenting, I think, is rocking up, really.

438
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:11,750
If you're rocking up, you're 95% of the way there.

439
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:14,609
Each kid's different.

440
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:19,049
You know, I've got – you know, one of my kids probably needs to be more assertive.

441
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:21,869
And I worry they're going to grow up getting ripped off by people.

442
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,609
Another one of my kids, I worry they're going to grow up ripping off people because they're too assertive.

443
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,569
So you're tailoring for each kid.

444
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:32,869
But I think as long as you're rocking up there and giving them as much love as you can,

445
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:37,289
that's sort of as simple as I try and keep it.

446
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,509
And providing kids that can think for themselves.

447
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:48,509
I mean, that's the only thing I'm overtly passionate about because none of us know what the future looks like in 20 years.

448
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:52,730
But I do know that people that can't think for themselves and just swallow anything they get fed,

449
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,670
they're going to have a tough time of making it.

450
00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:00,529
So outside of that, providing with love, I won't go into my relationship status as heavily as Nate.

451
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,470
But it was beautiful how he did that and does that regularly on Instagram.

452
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,150
Do the kids have to go down to the Olympic pool to get a good stretch out?

453
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,890
Because you're the world's biggest house and the world's smallest pool.

454
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,910
It gives us great joy, Jodie, being at your house.

455
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,089
And it's been a common theme for those who listen to the Friday Huddle that Jodie's got.

456
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,349
A wonderful house, but a really, really tiny pool.

457
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:23,369
And whether that's true or not, it's provided us with a lot of joy.

458
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:28,690
I had a chat to Steve Biddulph, who's the author, best-selling author of kids' books, Raising Boys, Raising Girls.

459
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:35,029
It's interesting, almost to the word Jodie said, but if you're there and you're around, that is the key.

460
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:41,369
Because the reality is, you know, most kids experience stuff that is suboptimal, to use one of your terms, Jodie,

461
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,009
in the 70% of kids that don't get that environment.

462
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:47,009
So I think your wisdom is on the mark there.

463
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,490
Changing gears slightly, Jodie.

464
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:55,309
On this podcast, we're talking about the shift in leadership from the old hierarchy in command and control leadership

465
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:59,089
to this more collaborative and self-reflective type of leadership.

466
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:00,009
You invest for a living.

467
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,509
You invest in businesses for a living and you analyze them strategically.

468
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,190
How important to you is the leadership of a business that you're about to put your money in?

469
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,730
The most important thing by my whole.

470
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:10,210
Yeah.

471
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:10,809
Number one?

472
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:11,490
Number one.

473
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:17,450
Yeah, that's the – yeah, but even if you get a crappy business at the start,

474
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:23,490
but the guy running it or the girl running it is a star, well, they pivot and they change the business, you know?

475
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:23,750
Yeah.

476
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,109
So that's the most important thing and daylight second.

477
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:31,289
So, yeah, that's the main sort of thing.

478
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:34,890
I mean, I think there's some heuristics I'll use.

479
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:41,109
I've found that people that talk about their mistakes are generally much more competent than people that pretend that they're perfect.

480
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:41,490
Yeah.

481
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,069
You know, I'll often look at a CEO if I'm having a chat to them about their business

482
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:47,309
and they're saying, you know, I'm not going to do that.

483
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:47,329
Yeah.

484
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:47,430
Yeah.

485
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:52,589
So there's a lot of sort of cues about, you know, just the way they shift in their seat

486
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:54,170
or touch their face when they're saying something.

487
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:55,849
I think that's going to be a stretch for you to do.

488
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:56,230
Really?

489
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,509
So there's a lot of body language things that you pick up as an investor.

490
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:04,349
But the leadership, the best leaders I see are the ones that know themselves.

491
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:05,930
That's really where it starts.

492
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,289
People that really have a clear understanding of what they are, what their strengths are,

493
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:15,549
make the best leaders regardless of whether they look like the leader in a Harvard textbook or not.

494
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:17,329
That really helps.

495
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:24,289
Having a clear understanding of self, I think, is by far and away the most important step in effective leaders.

496
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:28,390
That's fascinating insight for me that you're actually, you know, looking at body language of CEOs,

497
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,789
checking out their mistakes is a really interesting insight.

498
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,450
There's a famous book, Good to Great by Jim Collins.

499
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:39,529
I know you're a voracious reader and you may or may not have read that.

500
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:45,930
But he has a category where he talks about level five leaders and that's what creates these great iconic businesses.

501
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:52,849
It's a category that he's put himself and describes them in your way that they are more often humble,

502
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:57,410
often prepared to give more credit to others in the business for stuff that's gone on,

503
00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:01,509
self-reflective, great sense of themselves, really understand who they are,

504
00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:04,250
don't need to prove and don't need to bang the desk.

505
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:05,769
And that's interesting.

506
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:09,730
So they're the sort of leaders that you're finding are the ones that you want to back in.

507
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,329
They are.

508
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:15,529
And they're leaders that they build a business or an outfit with a competitive advantage.

509
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,750
And they build a culture that's really aligned with that.

510
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,210
And when you see those three things come together,

511
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,869
it's often a good sign that you've got a pretty serious organization.

512
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:28,309
I'm really concerned that there's going to be a window of attention span that I'm going to get.

513
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,950
Nate looks like he's drifting off here.

514
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,829
And so, Howie, I've got many other things that I'd like to go.

515
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:41,289
But in the interest of time, what we have been doing is identifying a handful of qualities that we think makes up great leadership

516
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:45,029
and different categories and then trying to just cross-reference that with a range of different people,

517
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:45,829
which has been interesting.

518
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:46,910
Well, I found it interesting anyway.

519
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,970
You guys may well not.

520
00:23:48,109 --> 00:23:50,430
But there are a handful of dimensions of leadership.

521
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:51,089
So jump in.

522
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:52,849
I'm going to ask all of you.

523
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,869
And then I've got a couple of questions to finish on.

524
00:23:55,089 --> 00:23:57,549
Self-leadership to me is one category we're talking about.

525
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:58,930
What does it mean to you, Nate?

526
00:23:58,970 --> 00:23:59,549
Self-leadership.

527
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:05,549
Self-leadership is, for me, if you take it back to a football term as being a self-startup,

528
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:08,529
you don't need anybody else to help you.

529
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:10,549
You don't need anybody else to do anything for you.

530
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,109
So you're a self-leader.

531
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,710
And hopefully the people below you or next to you or even with you,

532
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,670
or even above you, see what you're doing.

533
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:19,369
Do you think about self-leadership, Danny?

534
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:20,970
Yeah, I do.

535
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:25,809
You know, if you expect people to follow, you need to make sure your own room's clean first.

536
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:32,410
But I think there's a difference between I think people like seeing leaders that make mistakes

537
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,289
and are human and have areas where they're weak.

538
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:36,230
I think they actually like that.

539
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,269
But they hate hypocrisy.

540
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:41,410
And so I think leaders don't need to try and pretend that they're perfect.

541
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:42,950
They should embrace their shortcomings.

542
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:44,670
But they can't be hypocritical.

543
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,910
And that's what that's self-leadership.

544
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,049
That's what self-leadership speaks of to me.

545
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,130
How about you, Howie?

546
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:48,789
Self-leadership.

547
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,029
Positivity.

548
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,890
I like to be led by really positive people.

549
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:58,430
So if I'm in a situation where I'm being cast as the leader, I am as positive as I can.

550
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:00,930
You understand that there are going to be issues along the way.

551
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:03,250
But just get up, dust yourself off, keep going.

552
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:08,849
But yeah, to me, it's all about positivity, putting some positivity out there.

553
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,930
I think it pretty much comes back your way tenfold.

554
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:13,430
So leadership to me is positivity.

555
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:15,150
And in fairness to you, Howie,

556
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:18,190
I can't remember seeing you ever walk into an environment and be flat.

557
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:24,890
So I think, in fact, you're always up, always in that space, just genuinely got an energy about you.

558
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,869
And that's probably the other category of talking.

559
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:33,750
Positively impacting people in the environment is something that we see as a dimension of leadership for great leaders.

560
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,130
And is that the same for you, Howie?

561
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:39,109
That's your one word, going to positivity is how you impact the environment?

562
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:40,190
Yeah, absolutely.

563
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:44,190
Because I think I was reading something the other day, a book by a guy called,

564
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,349
I don't even know how to pronounce his name.

565
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,730
It's Jesse Itzler.

566
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:52,410
Anyway, he got a seal to come and live with him for a month, like a Navy seal, and train him.

567
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:58,589
And this bloke kept saying to him, no matter how hard the workout is, keep going because you know it is going to end.

568
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,210
It always ends.

569
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,329
So I look at it like that.

570
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,970
When things are hard, there will be an end point.

571
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:10,609
So when you get to the end point, you can look at it and think, gee, I bitched and moaned the whole way through, but I got there.

572
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,970
Or I was positive the whole way through.

573
00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:14,069
And everybody said.

574
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,450
They saw me being positive, and I had a positive impact on the group.

575
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,289
And we still got there.

576
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:24,390
I want to be the one that gets to the finish line being positive rather than the one that really moaned and whinged the whole way.

577
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,619
Jody, you've been a premiership captain and a captain of two clubs.

578
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,980
Did you think about your impact positively on others in the environment?

579
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,440
Yeah, I did.

580
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,599
And certainly, modelling behaviours was something I thought a heap about.

581
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:50,859
But certainly, internally, I just had a lot more knowledge about myself that I needed to get.

582
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,000
To be the type of leader I would have liked.

583
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,279
What do you mean by that?

584
00:26:55,339 --> 00:26:57,500
You wish you had more knowledge of yourself looking back?

585
00:26:57,619 --> 00:26:58,559
Looking back, yeah.

586
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,819
I mean, I just had no idea where I sat personality-wise until after footy.

587
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:10,880
You know, I'm a real outlier in certain areas of my personality.

588
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,579
Oh, you think?

589
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:20,980
Yeah, I can be very obsessive and, you know, there's some shortcomings there and whatnot, which are good for some things.

590
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,079
But really poor for others.

591
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:29,259
And I just had no understanding of that until, I think until I was about 31, 32, which was a shame.

592
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,460
So, if you look back and, I mean, you couldn't have had a more successful AFL career.

593
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:37,420
I mean, it's full of trophies, as you used to remind us regularly.

594
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:44,460
But you think if you had a better understanding of yourself, you could have impacted others better just by knowing your personality type?

595
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:44,920
I think so.

596
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:51,019
When I look back on my career, I was just so highly strung, so obsessive around performance and maximising out.

597
00:27:51,039 --> 00:28:00,900
And I just never really understood that other people weren't wired the same way as that, you know, or not to that same level.

598
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:15,720
So, to impact people and just understanding that they were driven by different things and different emotions and a different personality type would have been something I wished I had had more knowledge around at the time.

599
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:19,039
Did that take the joy out of a little bit when you look back, you being so obsessive about performance?

600
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:20,880
Did you ever enjoy it?

601
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:20,960
Yeah.

602
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:20,980
Yeah.

603
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,000
Yeah.

604
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,019
Yeah.

605
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:21,039
Yeah.

606
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:35,140
Well, I mean, I found it really rewarding, but I'm surprised that looking back now that I'm just not nearly as stressed and uptight, just how tightly strung I was as a player, I'm really surprised now over such a long period.

607
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:38,200
I used to comment, Brownie, the war is over, I used to say.

608
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,519
Clearly didn't play at a level with Jodie.

609
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:41,180
Did very few.

610
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:41,460
Did.

611
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:43,619
But I used to feel like I don't have to be at war anymore.

612
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,500
I used to have to be as angry, Brownie, which might surprise you once I'd finished.

613
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,980
But one of the other dimensions we talk about is creating and sharing a vision.

614
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,160
You've got a business with your beautiful wife, Christina.

615
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:58,839
You've transitioned out of footy as well as just about anyone could hope for.

616
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,539
Do you think about the vision for you and your family and your life and how you create it?

617
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,460
Yeah, I do.

618
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:13,140
And where we've been, and I guess I go back to self-reflection and realizing where I was poor as a leader.

619
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:20,400
And I was poor as a leader to other people at my football club who probably weren't as talented.

620
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,500
Or who weren't as gifted.

621
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:25,759
So I sort of dropped off them a bit quick.

622
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:29,099
And I probably focused on myself as a leader far too much.

623
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,359
And if I had one regret and I could go back and play footy again, I'd bring as many people on the ride that I could.

624
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:40,779
Because I feel like I did influence people and maybe I didn't influence them enough or influence the right way.

625
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:46,819
So when I look at my kids and my business now, I've got that in mind to say, I didn't do it that well there.

626
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:47,200
I'd love it.

627
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:47,680
I shot at it.

628
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,339
It's never going to happen.

629
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:50,339
So I've got to take what I've learned.

630
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,400
And probably my shortcomings there and put it into A, my family.

631
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,299
B, my business in that order.

632
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,960
And I reckon that vision just takes care of itself if you do it in that order.

633
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:07,779
I've often described Brownie, Juddy and Howie, and we haven't had this discussion openly before,

634
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:15,759
as like a genuine freak at almost everything that he does in a way that, I mean, clearly as an AFL footballer,

635
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:18,079
and we have had a lot of fun at your expense,

636
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:22,980
it's describing yourself as the best player in the game for 10 games has amused us greatly.

637
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,619
But in all fairness, you know, that's hard to probably dispute.

638
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,759
And two-time All-Australian, it's a wonderful career.

639
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,599
But you have a game of tennis against Brownie.

640
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,480
He's elite.

641
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,359
You ask him to try and bowl a leg break.

642
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:35,819
It's extreme.

643
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:39,059
You know, you play a game of table tennis a little bit later on.

644
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:39,779
You can't get near it.

645
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,180
Throw a rock at a pole.

646
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,099
Your innate ability to do that, mate, was next level.

647
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:46,660
It is something.

648
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,039
Have you noticed that about him?

649
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,279
I mean, Juddy, that across a few disciplines, he's pretty capable.

650
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,220
I heard the stories, but I'm here to witness it.

651
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:56,119
Was it Peter Lucek he took down?

652
00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:57,160
6'3", 6'4".

653
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,180
I have heard the stories, Duke, but I take your word for it.

654
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,920
The word needs to be there.

655
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,099
What about for you, Juddy, in terms of creating a vision?

656
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:09,160
I mean, I feel like you do that for your life in such a unique way.

657
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,339
Maybe that is the outlier thinking of you.

658
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:16,700
I find it remarkable that you've got the courage to invest your own money for a living and back yourself in.

659
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:18,059
To me, that just takes extraordinary courage.

660
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,220
And then to say, you know what?

661
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,059
I don't need these other mediums.

662
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:23,059
I'm going to focus on what makes me happy.

663
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,880
That's a pretty unique vision that you've got.

664
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,000
Is it something that you and Beck share together?

665
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:27,859
It is.

666
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,420
We're different.

667
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:29,480
Like Beck's really good.

668
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,380
I'd describe bottom up, like really detail orientated, really hardworking.

669
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,960
I spend most of my time thinking top down.

670
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:39,940
So as a macro investor, you're looking at global economic events.

671
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,519
But yeah, I spend a lot of time thinking about, I don't want to just bumble through life.

672
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:47,700
Yeah.

673
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:52,559
And just spend my time doing things because someone wants me to do them.

674
00:31:52,559 --> 00:32:00,220
And, you know, I look at the way people analyze an investment decision and how they'll part with their money

675
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,920
and the amount of due diligence they'll do on that.

676
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:07,559
Knowing full well that when that same person gets to 80, they'd swap all the money in the world for more time.

677
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:07,779
Yeah.

678
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,539
Yet they're not doing much due diligence on how they spent their time when they're young and fit

679
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:15,119
and their kids are young and they're healthy.

680
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,019
And, you know, being in the finance industry,

681
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:23,799
I was just gobsmacked by the people that had more money than they could ever know what to do with,

682
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,500
but didn't spend any diligence on their time.

683
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,519
So that's the way I view the world.

684
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,599
You know, work back from what's most precious and time being number one, Bitcoin,

685
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,460
a close second, Brownie, and go from there.

686
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,599
So, yeah, I spend a lot of time thinking about those sorts of things.

687
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,400
And do you feel like money buys you time?

688
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:42,059
Is that?

689
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:42,980
Yeah, I do.

690
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:43,220
Yeah.

691
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,839
So, I mean, it's easy to say, you know,

692
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,039
I sound like a dick talking about this to someone that's working three,

693
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:50,059
three jobs and is still struggling to put food on the table.

694
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,980
So not everyone's in a position to have those thoughts.

695
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:57,440
But a lot of people are and choose not to do it.

696
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,019
And so we're in a fortunate position where we've worked our clacker off

697
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:06,440
and we can have those thoughts and buy time.

698
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,759
And more importantly, spend time on things that interest you the most.

699
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,319
And that's what we do.

700
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:16,200
But interestingly, yeah, how you listen to Jodie, I find that fascinating.

701
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,819
I've had that conversation with Jodie before.

702
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,559
And you try and get off that treadmill yourself and go,

703
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,099
and I've run around and done five different jobs.

704
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:24,980
And you're trying to balance being a father of four.

705
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,819
And what, you know, is enough?

706
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,680
You know, we're all sort of faced with school fees and that balance of life.

707
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,920
When's enough money, enough money?

708
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:33,940
But how do you work your way through that?

709
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:37,900
But to actually execute that and say, here's what I'm going to do.

710
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,680
But we've all met people that have got tens and tens and tens and hundreds

711
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,660
of millions of dollars who are still on this treadmill

712
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,759
and still pushing themselves.

713
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,960
So they're some of the most unhappy people I've met.

714
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,680
So I find this topic as interesting as you can get for me.

715
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:58,000
I want to be careful what I say here because I'm thinking we're

716
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,579
on your Serious Leadership podcast.

717
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:03,119
Whatever I could say could be replayed on the Friday Huddled

718
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,000
around one next season.

719
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,779
Let it go, mate.

720
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:05,420
Let it go.

721
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:06,660
Just be yourself, Ali.

722
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:06,940
I'm torn.

723
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,159
So it's a constant battle for me.

724
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:16,159
My beautiful, intelligent, wonderful wife is really good at structure,

725
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:16,519
structure.

726
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:23,860
Process, hard work, school fees, making sure that I'm doing what I need

727
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,719
to be doing at work and she's providing an environment where I can be doing

728
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,139
what I want to do at work.

729
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,760
And it's going well at the moment.

730
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,360
And as things go well, you get offered more and more work and you take it on

731
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,619
and you get paid more and more money.

732
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,099
So that is fantastic, that side of our relationship.

733
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:45,059
But me, personally me, I battle every day as someone that traveled a lot

734
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:45,559
as a kid.

735
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:46,659
And a lot of me.

736
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,039
I would like to get on a plane when we're allowed with the kids

737
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:52,320
and Erica, but you can't with schooling.

738
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:57,960
But to school on the road, to see two years of the world and travel

739
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,619
and not worry about Fox Cricket and Fox Footy and Triple M and the podcast,

740
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:07,719
go and see the world and have the kids learn about resilience

741
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:10,880
and get in adventures and climb volcanoes and hike through jungles

742
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,320
and learn languages and drag them along on the ride of their life.

743
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,420
And they'll go back and say,

744
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,199
geez, dad was a bit loose and mum was involved as well.

745
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,539
We had an unbelievable 12 to 14.

746
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:22,719
We saw the whole world.

747
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,079
That is what really weighs on me every day.

748
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,840
I love the people I work for.

749
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,320
I think I've got the best job in the world.

750
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,760
I'm so grateful for the way it provides an opportunity for the family

751
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,539
through the financial side of it.

752
00:35:34,659 --> 00:35:35,940
And it's the best gig going around.

753
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:40,000
But a lot of me would just love to pack it up, get on a boat or in a combi van

754
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,139
and attack the world.

755
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,159
And that's where Erica and I are lucky to be a good combination

756
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:46,340
because she keeps.

757
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,699
I managed to get some of that happening with long holidays,

758
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,719
but she also keeps us grounded so the kids are getting educated

759
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,179
and the bills are being paid.

760
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,539
One of my great mates in life, he's a great man of brownies as well,

761
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:02,039
is Craig Ellis who went on and founded Triangle and I had a chat to him

762
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:04,019
on this podcast and he went on a trip.

763
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:05,300
His parents were both schoolteachers.

764
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,900
I took the three boys, his two brothers and him,

765
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,820
and they went around Australia for about 18 months.

766
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,880
I have heard for the last 35 years still stories from that.

767
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,139
It formed him.

768
00:36:16,219 --> 00:36:16,380
It shaped him.

769
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,400
It shaped him.

770
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:16,880
It shaped him.

771
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,920
When he was what age, G?

772
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,260
He would have been, I'll have a guess, but they were about 8, 10 and 12.

773
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:21,539
Okay.

774
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,159
And it just completely changed his outlook on the world.

775
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,460
Still is to this day.

776
00:36:26,539 --> 00:36:29,219
You can't see him sit still because he's looking for the next adventure

777
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:30,920
and the thirst for knowledge.

778
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,920
He's got a curious mind on that basis.

779
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,400
But, you know, again, Steve Biddle for you saying to me as the great author

780
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,079
of kids' books, if you can, as you said, that's buying time, isn't it, Jay?

781
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,579
That's saying, you know, of course, everyone can almost do that, can't they?

782
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:46,079
But you've got to pick what you're going to regret.

783
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:46,719
Yeah.

784
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:47,679
I can't have everything.

785
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:52,440
So there's going to be a cost somewhere and you've just got to try and forecast

786
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,159
when you're 80, you're going to have missed out in some bucket.

787
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,460
Which bucket do you want it to be?

788
00:36:58,679 --> 00:36:58,920
Yeah.

789
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,639
Good point, Judge.

790
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,320
Good point.

791
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,059
That's worth a pause, Brownie.

792
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,440
I'm going to push on.

793
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,599
Yeah, that's right.

794
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:11,019
Because that is, no one on their deathbed, as that famous quote is, you know,

795
00:37:11,019 --> 00:37:13,980
thinks they wish they put more time in at work or bought more things

796
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,840
or had more possessions.

797
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:16,000
But how do we think about?

798
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,539
How do we think about that right now?

799
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,360
Curiosity is a big part of the modern leader.

800
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,980
We're establishing Brownie and then through curiosity,

801
00:37:23,179 --> 00:37:24,900
learning and continuing to grow.

802
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,219
Do you think about curiosity as part of leadership?

803
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,579
Probably not as much as I should.

804
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,900
Curiosity, I wouldn't spend a lot of time thinking about it.

805
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,840
What about learning and your approach to learning and developing yourself?

806
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,719
What do you do in that space?

807
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:42,980
Well, it's just, for me, it's research.

808
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,820
So I started looking at cryptocurrency.

809
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,860
Currency, was it four years ago now?

810
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,739
And our great mate, Craig Ellis, got me into it.

811
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,300
He took me up to Sydney and he said, I've been doing this, been doing really well.

812
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:55,280
I'd like to educate you about it.

813
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,980
And I walked away always knowing what Bitcoin was.

814
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:00,760
And I didn't understand what it did.

815
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,599
Made some mistakes, invested a lot of money into it and almost lost a whole lot.

816
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,840
But over time, I've researched it.

817
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:12,360
And it's a foreign world to some that you can lose money really quickly.

818
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,199
But if you do your research like anything,

819
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:15,800
I've found a nice way to do it.

820
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,559
I've found a nice niche in being able to protect your capital and then grow it.

821
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:22,039
Sometimes you lose a little bit here and there.

822
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:26,400
But like anything, if you're prepared to do the time, you'll be able to figure it out.

823
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:27,760
It's a good mate, isn't it, Jodie?

824
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,099
Literally flew all these mates up one by one and said, I'm passionate about this.

825
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:35,500
I see an opportunity for you guys to improve your financial situation.

826
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,219
And I know I can talk to you, but the only way to do it is to give you some.

827
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:44,079
And it gave everyone a significant chunk enough to get you interested and then learn.

828
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,780
And I bet you.

829
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,820
Yeah, most of them lost it.

830
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:50,079
Well, it'd be interesting to go back and check because, you know,

831
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:52,079
I haven't spoken as much about Brandy about it,

832
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:55,579
but I'm fascinated by the world of that now and where it's going,

833
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:57,159
digital currency and what it means.

834
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:00,960
And exactly as you said it would, now you'll listen to it.

835
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,219
Now it's your world, Jodie,

836
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:06,460
but I'm obsessed now with listening to experts talking about cryptocurrency,

837
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,719
where it's heading, different types of cryptocurrency.

838
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:11,199
So certainly, I don't know whether everyone's lost it.

839
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,699
I think a few have made some money out of it, Jodie.

840
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,619
Yeah, well, that's good.

841
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:14,079
That's good.

842
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,619
There's a big...

843
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,500
I've spoken to a lot of people and that was a significant sum.

844
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:21,820
Most people, when they give someone Bitcoin, particularly back in the day,

845
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,760
the people would just go, this is ridiculous, this thing,

846
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,679
and they'd lose it.

847
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:32,099
But, yeah, it's a great story and generous on a number of levels

848
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:35,940
because it is, A, the money, but to invest that time

849
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,139
and really go out on a limb because it could have failed

850
00:39:39,139 --> 00:39:41,260
and people could have put their own money in and it could have failed.

851
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:45,760
So he's taking a significant personal risk to do that.

852
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,260
And what a gift.

853
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,739
Howie, communicating with clarity is one of the dimensions we talk about.

854
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:53,639
And in all seriousness, mate, you've done an incredible job

855
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:56,940
creating the Howie Games and you communicate that regularly

856
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,300
and you communicate it well.

857
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:00,980
Is that something that you've thought about?

858
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:02,619
I mean, it's a great success story.

859
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:04,920
Have you got a strategy with that and how you communicate it?

860
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:08,860
Yeah, I think there's two things in the modern media

861
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,820
or anything in life I've learned about any product.

862
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,239
I knew nothing about marketing.

863
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,219
One, the product has to be good.

864
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:15,460
Right.

865
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,360
Howie Games' content needs to be good.

866
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:20,059
Now that box has been well and truly ticked.

867
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,800
Elite content.

868
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,059
The other part of it that I have learned is it doesn't matter

869
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:30,179
how good your content or your product is if people don't know about it.

870
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:34,699
So you have to quickly begin to understand the chances

871
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:38,940
and the opportunities you have to spread the word, tell the message.

872
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:40,400
And it started for me.

873
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,719
Well, people wouldn't know this story, but the boss of Channel 10 at the time,

874
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,599
David Barham, when the podcast was starting,

875
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:50,860
we were doing the Big Bash and there was 1.3 million people a night watching.

876
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,539
And I said, am I allowed to mention the podcast?

877
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,820
He said, you can't because sponsors are paying enormous amounts of money here.

878
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:00,820
But he said, and Dave wouldn't mind me saying this,

879
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,400
it was three or four times a year.

880
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,780
He said, when you have a guest that you think is relevant to the coverage,

881
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,659
get one of the boys to bring it up.

882
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:15,760
So Ricky or Punter or Gilly or Junior would make a comment saying,

883
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,139
gee, I heard you had Damien Martin on the Howie Games.

884
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:20,820
Or Gilly would say, hey, that was a great story.

885
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,800
Rick told you on the Howie Games and talk briefly about it.

886
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,780
And at that point, the podcast exploded.

887
00:41:26,539 --> 00:41:29,860
And I realized I used to get this little graph and it'd be like the Yu Yangs,

888
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,300
Yu Yangs, Yu Yangs, and then bang, it'd be on the Big Bash

889
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,260
and it'd be like Mount Everest.

890
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,000
And that's where I understood the power of the media organizations

891
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,820
that I work for that if you can bring it up or if you can get it in conversation,

892
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:45,760
it's a constant battle to bring it to people.

893
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,800
So that's why I do mention it five or six times on the Friday Huddle every week,

894
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,500
the Howie Games Australia's number one sports podcast.

895
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:54,619
But there's no point having these amazing conversations.

896
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,500
This is what I think is a fantastic product if people aren't aware of it.

897
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:01,179
So, yeah, sometimes it goes a bit over the top with the merchandise,

898
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,840
probably lost you boys a little bit there with the Howie Games T-shirts,

899
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:07,699
but it's all part of because I'm so passionate about it.

900
00:42:08,019 --> 00:42:12,320
It doesn't make, compared to the time I spend on the other parts of my job,

901
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:14,360
it's a massive loss leader.

902
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,699
It's not making you money.

903
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,139
Compared to what you're getting paid.

904
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:21,719
But I love it when people hear it and their kids hear it and say,

905
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:25,440
oh, I heard this story about Chris Judd and it made me want to do this

906
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,219
and it made me go and run 10K and it helped me with this situation in my life.

907
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,639
That fills me with joy.

908
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,179
So that's pretty much why I push it as often as I can.

909
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,539
And I love the story of collaboration in that, isn't it?

910
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:38,880
And people would understand.

911
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,440
That's your mates, you're working with the Big Bash.

912
00:42:40,579 --> 00:42:41,559
How can we help you out?

913
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:42,760
Prepare to do that, Howie.

914
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,340
And as we all are, and I think, you know,

915
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:49,019
that's a misunderstood part, I think, about the groups we're working in media.

916
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:51,780
And collaboration is the other final part of the dimensional leadership,

917
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,519
Juddy, we talk about.

918
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:56,860
And you mentioned you are a bit of an outlier because you essentially work on your own.

919
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,659
I think you might have put an assistant on in recent times.

920
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,179
But do you value collaboration as part of what you do, Juddy?

921
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,599
I do, yeah, I do.

922
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,659
I was an individual investor for a few years and I started to get really lonely.

923
00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:12,500
So I've got an employee now who works as an analyst for me.

924
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:12,960
He's great.

925
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,059
He's a young guy.

926
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:14,739
He's really smart.

927
00:43:14,739 --> 00:43:16,000
And that's helped in a number of levels.

928
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,420
But I also share an office with a fund manager who's a friend and smart as well.

929
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,420
So I really like that balance.

930
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:30,559
I don't want a heap of people in my ear giving me ideas because I don't want to think like

931
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:33,980
every other fund manager or institution on Collins Street.

932
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:38,460
I think there's an advantage in thinking differently, being non-consensus.

933
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:43,559
But having that level of collaboration and sharing idea flow, it's,

934
00:43:44,739 --> 00:43:49,900
it's really important and just a way to cover more ground because if it's just you,

935
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:52,619
you just can't cover enough, enough things well.

936
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:54,519
So I think that's a really important aspect.

937
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:58,579
But just, again, it comes back to knowing yourself and whether or not you're someone

938
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:01,440
that wants to be working with a thousand people or a small group.

939
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:04,019
And I'm in the small group category.

940
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,400
Chris, just it saddens me to hear that you were lonely and I wish you'd sort of reached

941
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,059
out about that.

942
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:13,960
Do you feel that you became lonely after you left your mates in the lurch on the Friday

943
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,300
huddle?

944
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,960
And didn't get that time to spend with them?

945
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:18,260
And basically we built you up and then you left us in the lurch.

946
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,500
Do you think if you'd stuck with us, you wouldn't have those lonely feelings, my friend?

947
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:23,360
That's not the way I'm framing it, Howard.

948
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,559
Great leaders, they build something and then they pass it on and outlast themselves.

949
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:29,679
And that's really what I saw with the Friday huddle, Howie.

950
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:34,139
I set the foundation, the foundation of blocks and seeing you go from strength to strength

951
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:35,739
makes me very proud, Howard.

952
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,119
Can I ask you a question, Howie?

953
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:41,340
Mentioned before about your leadership when you took on Daniel Andrews and it was, it

954
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,280
was articulated well.

955
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,380
It was researched well.

956
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,960
And nobody else was doing it.

957
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:52,780
You were the only one, it felt like, who had any sort of media presence going after the

958
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,440
government asking for a different theory.

959
00:44:54,579 --> 00:44:57,119
So I can't see anybody else like you.

960
00:44:57,159 --> 00:44:59,159
Did you feel like you're a lone wolf going after?

961
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:02,960
Did you feel like there was nobody else coming on for the ride with you?

962
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,739
And if you had have had other voices, could you have made a difference?

963
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:10,219
Well, it's a, look, yes, yes and no, Brownie, because I think if people would listen, you

964
00:45:10,219 --> 00:45:11,800
know, I did 11 years of Breakfast Radio.

965
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:12,800
That was the final year.

966
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:12,840
Yeah.

967
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:17,300
Last year, it was just Eddie McGuire and I, and everyone, you know, who understands

968
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,460
Melman would understand, he's got a big presence.

969
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:25,099
He's an extraordinary debater and he probably had a fairly different view of the world than

970
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:26,219
I did on those topics.

971
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:30,780
So across the course of that year, anyone who listened to the show would not have been

972
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,199
surprised in any way, shape or form by the questions I asked Daniel Andrews.

973
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:36,139
So it didn't come out of nowhere.

974
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:38,579
I'd been wanting to debate those issues.

975
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:42,420
And I think we all should, in my mind, if you lock down a population for an extended period,

976
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:42,599
it's on.

977
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:45,159
So you'd want to think there'd be great debate on all of that.

978
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:50,539
I wasn't pretending to moonlight as an expert or epidemiologist or a doctor, but I was frustrated

979
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:54,920
by some of the political journos not asking questions I think were, and I hope that I

980
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,320
presented it in a respectful way to say, hey, you're a guest on our show, I'm not trying

981
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,159
to be a smart aleck here, but what about this?

982
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:07,300
And it took off because one of the arguments has been, if you're debating lockdown in Melbourne,

983
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,480
you don't care about old people and you're prepared for old people, and I just found

984
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,480
that such an unreasonable rebuttal.

985
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,480
Yeah.

986
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,119
It's a rebuttal to a reasonable question.

987
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:18,539
And so I referenced my dad who passed away and I said, look, I actually, Premier, with

988
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:19,920
all due respect, I've been through that.

989
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,679
I've just had my father, who was probably struggling with loneliness and being in his

990
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:28,460
apartment on his own and his business being closed more than he was with the actuality

991
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,460
of what's going on.

992
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:33,340
And so that, as always, mainstream media, Luke Darcy complains about his dad.

993
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,800
It really wasn't the point at all.

994
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,800
So that became-

995
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,800
It was a cheap shot.

996
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,039
Well, it was a little bit and it became a sideline.

997
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:41,239
And for the first time, the kids then sort of had a bit of a fight.

998
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:42,239
Yeah.

999
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:45,579
They sort of had a bit of, a lot of people online, which I hadn't experienced before

1000
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:46,900
because I'd never had social media.

1001
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,079
So I don't regret it.

1002
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:54,000
I regret that we've shut down debate in this town at the most crucial time in the history

1003
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,400
of a city.

1004
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,579
As you guys would know, there's a stubbornness to me that gets me in trouble sometimes that

1005
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:05,679
I can't help but want to debate stuff without perhaps being as concerned about the consequences

1006
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:06,679
after it.

1007
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:07,679
And that's been a concern-

1008
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:08,679
So how did it finish?

1009
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:09,679
How did it finish?

1010
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:10,679
Well-

1011
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:11,880
When the interview finishes and they go to the ad break and there's Eddie, who's a, a,

1012
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,639
very much, I would say, be fair to say, is a Daniel Andrews supporter, would that be

1013
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:16,639
a fair comment?

1014
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:17,639
They're close.

1015
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:19,639
I don't think that would, and Eddie's close with everyone in leadership, so that's not

1016
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:20,639
saying-

1017
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:21,639
So how was it when you go to the ad break?

1018
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:22,639
Frosty?

1019
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:23,639
Nate and I love this stuff, the behind the scenes stuff.

1020
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:24,639
But I think we're now, we're interested.

1021
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:30,760
Well, the interesting part about that was that we were both in our respective houses.

1022
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,980
So Ed was broadcasting from his house and I was in my room.

1023
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:38,219
And that, unfortunately, I much more would have preferred that to be in person because

1024
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:40,980
I would have done the exact same thing had we all been the same.

1025
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:44,360
Then you get the chance to go and get a coffee and walk away from the screen.

1026
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,539
And so it was Frosty, I've got no doubt about it.

1027
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:49,800
I wasn't trying to grandstand and think, here's a moment for me to put myself in.

1028
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,079
I couldn't be true to myself without asking those questions.

1029
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,480
But I knew Ed was not going to be comfortable with the questions I was going to ask.

1030
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,559
But two very quick questions to ask the three of you, questions without notice.

1031
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,940
Firstly starting with you, who is the best, who is the greatest leader in your life, Nate?

1032
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:10,820
The greatest leader in my life, I don't want to make Juddy feel uncomfortable, but the

1033
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:13,059
greatest leader in my life is my wife.

1034
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:15,059
Juddy, greatest leader in your life?

1035
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:17,059
Go to Howie.

1036
00:48:17,059 --> 00:48:20,019
I like the pregnant pause, mate.

1037
00:48:20,019 --> 00:48:22,059
It is a question that needs a bit of thought.

1038
00:48:22,059 --> 00:48:23,059
Howie?

1039
00:48:23,059 --> 00:48:26,900
Erica is by far and away the greatest leader in my life, the greatest leader I've been

1040
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,440
involved with.

1041
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,639
And you blokes always give me a hard time about name dropping, but I've seen this bloke

1042
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:36,360
galvanize groups in a broadcast sense that I've never seen before, is Ricky Ponting.

1043
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,579
I remember two or three years into the Big Bash, I'll keep it short for you.

1044
00:48:40,579 --> 00:48:44,079
But it was flying and we had a pre-season dinner and Ricky got up.

1045
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,440
And when Ricky gets up, it's, well, it's Ricky Ponting.

1046
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,800
And there was a group of 20 of us on air, off air, production staff, the boss.

1047
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,199
And Ricky told us for three minutes, you can't rest on your laurels.

1048
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:58,599
If we want to get better, we need to be 20% better this season than we were last season.

1049
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:04,559
And I walked away from it energized, pumped, enthused, amazed.

1050
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:07,820
That's the best five minutes of leadership I've seen in my life.

1051
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,820
Juddy?

1052
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,099
I'll go with some of the people I read.

1053
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:17,360
So probably Jeff Booth, Jeff Booth, Luke Grohman or Kirill Sokolov, there you go.

1054
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,820
And all three of those names, I have no idea.

1055
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:21,820
Can I ask Jeff Booth?

1056
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,460
I've got to ask you, who's Jeff Booth?

1057
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,739
Jeff Booth wrote a brilliant book, The Price of Tomorrow.

1058
00:49:27,739 --> 00:49:28,739
Really about the economy.

1059
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:31,260
He does a lot of work trying to educate people.

1060
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,679
And I've learned a lot from him and I think he's brilliant.

1061
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,679
So I'll go with him.

1062
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:35,679
The other two?

1063
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:36,679
I mean, they're both...

1064
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:37,679
Luke Grohman's a macroeconomic...

1065
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:38,679
Yeah.

1066
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:43,679
...analyst that's brilliant, based out of America, and Kirill Sokolov's out of Switzerland.

1067
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:46,300
Again, a macroeconomic guy.

1068
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:51,300
And they're all brilliant and I'm lucky to have them in my life.

1069
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,300
You are an outlier.

1070
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,800
I'm not surprised that you look back and-

1071
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,800
Because you must sleep well, Judge.

1072
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,800
You can read a couple of pages of that at night.

1073
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,800
Just bang, out you go.

1074
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,800
I love it.

1075
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,800
I love it.

1076
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,179
The final question is, if you could collaborate with anyone in your life, if there was anyone

1077
00:50:04,179 --> 00:50:06,960
you could collaborate with, I'll start back with you, Howard, who would you collaborate

1078
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:07,960
with?

1079
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,719
In what sense?

1080
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:15,880
In life, in whatever you wanted to do, whether it be on the Howie Games, whether it be start

1081
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,659
a business with someone, whether it be to meet someone.

1082
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:23,980
Collaboration we see as the new face of leadership, who would you collaborate with?

1083
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:24,980
Adam Gilchrist.

1084
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,980
There you go.

1085
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,980
I'll go with Luke Grohman.

1086
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,980
Luke Grohman, the first guy that was inspired?

1087
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:30,980
He was the second guy.

1088
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:31,980
He's out of the US, yeah.

1089
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:32,980
Okay.

1090
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:33,980
Who would you collaborate with?

1091
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:37,840
I had a chance many years ago to collaborate with Craig Ellis and I let that

1092
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,840
go.

1093
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:52,239
He turned it to about 50 mils, so that ship's passed, but there's a guy who runs a fragrance

1094
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:56,320
company called Boreto and I like how he goes about it.

1095
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:00,239
If we do a collaboration between the two companies, I think him.

1096
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:01,239
What's the name?

1097
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:02,239
Soho Candles?

1098
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:03,239
SOH, yeah.

1099
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:04,239
SOH Candles.

1100
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:05,239
So check them out.

1101
00:51:05,239 --> 00:51:06,239
Where do you find SOH Candles?

1102
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:07,239
Everywhere, Jim.

1103
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:07,739
Okay.

1104
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,840
Yeah.

1105
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,840
It has been a lot of fun.

1106
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,840
Howie, Juddy, and Brownie, I feel privileged to call you all friends.

1107
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,340
I've enjoyed our time together.

1108
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:19,679
We haven't had a conversation like this, but it was unique and it has been a lot of fun,

1109
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,840
so thanks for joining us on the Empowering Leaders Podcast.

1110
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,840
I really appreciate it.

1111
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,840
Thank you, Luke.

1112
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,840
Do you think, Darce, this makes your other episodes pile into insignificance?

1113
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,840
Do you think we're the best you've had?

1114
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,840
Well, now we're going back to Friday Huddle territory.

1115
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,840
We're going to the top five.

1116
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,840
Don't we get the top five so far?

1117
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,840
I think so.

1118
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,840
Number one starts with Justin.

1119
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,840
That's right.

1120
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,840
That's right.

1121
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,840
Number one starts with Justin.

1122
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,840
This is going to come in sixth.

1123
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,559
A very unlucky sixth, I think, so far on the Empowering Leaders.

1124
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:44,559
You are idiots.

1125
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,559
There's no doubt about it, but I've enjoyed all of our time together.

1126
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:49,840
Thank you for joining us on the Empowering Leaders Podcast.

1127
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,840
Nathan Brown, Chris Judd, Mark Howard, appreciate it.

1128
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,840
Right on, Jake.

1129
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,840
Cheers.
