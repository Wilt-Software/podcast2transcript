1
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,629
This stranger took me inside and put me on her lap and said,

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,890
you've got to pray for him and get better.

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,830
So I started praying as hard as I could.

4
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:16,530
Anyway, of course, later that day, he passed away.

5
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:19,429
By the time I was 12 or 13, I developed OCD.

6
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:22,309
And it got to the point, particularly in my teenage years,

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,230
it was getting close to non-functional.

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,170
Chris Walker, one of Australia's leading television producers,

9
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:29,690
is this week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast.

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,390
You hear Chris talk about imposter syndrome,

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,229
sometimes getting a bad rap,

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,210
and how it has driven him to the success that he's had.

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,950
No, I think he gets a bad rap, imposter syndrome.

14
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:41,170
I mean, it's not great for your mental health,

15
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:43,009
but it keeps you pretty sharp.

16
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,590
The challenge of his high-profile public divorce from Carrie Bickmore

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,229
and why separating is still a nuclear event.

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,229
I think people give up far too easily.

19
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:54,170
You know, it was saying goodbye to the kids twice a week,

20
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,409
and I still find that enormously challenging.

21
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:58,409
I would never say that I'm a gun producer,

22
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:01,390
but when it comes to being a dad, I was just sort of born for it.

23
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:01,969
I love it.

24
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:03,969
And I want to be around them all the time.

25
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:06,909
And the real story behind accidentally leaving the camera on the laptop

26
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:10,150
and having him beamed back into the control room at the ABC

27
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,230
naked on his way into the shower.

28
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:15,790
It was a very interesting example of journalism

29
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,909
because they printed this article.

30
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,430
Two days later, I got a message from the journalist saying,

31
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,829
do you want to tell us what happened?

32
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:25,670
We've genuinely loved Chris Walker collaborating with us

33
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,030
in our Elita Connect program.

34
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,189
We curate groups of five to six people from around the globe

35
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:31,870
to come together to learn,

36
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:33,250
share and collaborate.

37
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,870
Chris shares openly how powerful Elita Connect has been for him

38
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,890
at a challenging stage in his life.

39
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,689
Head to elitacollective.com.

40
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:42,510
We would love to chat to you.

41
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,930
Book a discovery call today.

42
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:47,849
Big thanks as always to Jason Nicholas and his team from Temper Bedding.

43
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:49,709
The best mattress in the world.

44
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:50,650
NASA approved.

45
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:54,170
We know great leaders like Chris Walker who have successful lives,

46
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:57,290
all value sleep and investing in a mattress like Temper

47
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,849
is a decision you won't regret.

48
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,390
Chris Walker is one of the most naturally curious,

49
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:04,670
people you'll ever meet.

50
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,709
A superpower that has made him one of Australia's

51
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,389
most successful television producers.

52
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,389
He rose rapidly through the ranks on Channel 10's The Project

53
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:14,229
and led the Logie and Walkley award-winning team

54
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:15,750
as managing editor for a number of years

55
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,129
before he moved on to become the co-creator

56
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:21,330
and executive producer of The Weekly with Charlie Pickering,

57
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:23,590
Hard Quiz and Tomorrow Tonight.

58
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:26,949
Chris is an acclaimed and incredibly well-respected leader in his field.

59
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:30,310
We're very privileged to have him as part of our Elita Connect program.

60
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:31,789
Thanks for joining me today, mate.

61
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,469
Dars, thank you.

62
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:33,389
Great to see you.

63
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:34,810
Love the group, love the podcast.

64
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:35,810
Thank you, mate.

65
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:39,050
Well, to be creatively successful on a consistent basis,

66
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:40,629
I'm in awe of that.

67
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,830
As I said, the TV shows are in different areas

68
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,590
and to be able to do that as you have done,

69
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,330
what's been the key to that success?

70
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,069
Probably imposter syndrome.

71
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:49,830
Really?

72
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:50,449
Yeah.

73
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,189
No, I think it's a bad rap, imposter syndrome.

74
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,430
I mean, it's probably not great for your mental health,

75
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,229
but it keeps you pretty sharp, imposter syndrome.

76
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,210
Like, I feel like I was pretty lucky growing up.

77
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,389
You know, my dad was a doctor, mum was a nurse,

78
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:08,550
and I was sort of destined to become a lawyer or an engineer or a doctor,

79
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,629
and I decided that's just not for me.

80
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,349
And so me jumping ship into media was an interesting move

81
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:15,909
from my family's perspective.

82
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:22,189
And I just realized that in order to make something of it,

83
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,050
I just had to scrap the whole way.

84
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,490
And I feel like I started at the bottom as a runner,

85
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:31,550
working for overnights in radio and stuff,

86
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,389
and just scrapped my way and kept scrapping.

87
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:38,150
You know, I found my way, fortunately, to the project,

88
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:40,830
and that was sort of the formative job for me,

89
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,710
and then just sort of made my way up.

90
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,169
See, I've never heard anyone say that before,

91
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,590
imposter syndrome gets a bad rap.

92
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,710
We've all got it.

93
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:49,469
And let's be honest, all of us,

94
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:51,949
you step into something uncomfortable and you go,

95
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,169
am I meant to be here?

96
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,090
Am I good enough?

97
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:56,110
That happens daily.

98
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:58,830
But you think there's something good in that edge, do you?

99
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,610
Look, I don't think it's good for you.

100
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:01,669
What you said is right.

101
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:02,469
Like, we all have it.

102
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:03,289
It's interesting.

103
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,250
Like, when people ask me what I do for a living,

104
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,750
when you, like, if you, Dar, say, what are you,

105
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,110
and I say, I'm a TV producer,

106
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:11,710
I say it with, like, a certain level of embarrassment,

107
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:13,870
because I feel like it's not all that I am.

108
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,050
And I also, I don't really like talking about my job that much,

109
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,529
because I hate the idea of staying in your lane.

110
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,230
But I find, as soon as you, particularly in a creative field,

111
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:29,470
if you try and move lanes, you're quickly told by people,

112
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,350
oh, you're not good at that.

113
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,829
That's not going to be your thing.

114
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:33,389
And that happened to me.

115
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,910
And that happened to me a lot as I moved through media.

116
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:41,670
And I sort of just decided early on that I'm going to try

117
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,610
and prove everybody, every boss that I've ever had wrong.

118
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,750
And I, obviously now I am the boss,

119
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,829
and I kind of see myself as a negation of all of the bosses

120
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:54,750
that I've had before me.

121
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:01,410
And most of them, I thought, were reasonably difficult people.

122
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,329
And I've now,

123
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,670
I've set up a company with Charlie Pickering.

124
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,449
And I think our culture is one that's built around everything

125
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:12,709
that I didn't like about the media industry.

126
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:14,350
And it's something that, you know,

127
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:19,509
we try and serve our employees with like empathy and affection

128
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:21,470
and creative freedom,

129
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:26,769
which is not something that I found a lot of in the media industry growing up.

130
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,009
It's interesting, isn't it?

131
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:30,050
There's a generation of AFL coaches,

132
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,370
the world that I came from that grew up and literally, you know,

133
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,470
Paul Ruse talks about this.

134
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:39,350
He wrote down, these are the 20 insane things that coaches do.

135
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,670
And if I ever get that job, I'm going to keep it in my top drawer

136
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,990
and I'm going to open it once a month, I think he said.

137
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:48,050
I'm just going to read them and make sure I don't ever morph back into that.

138
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,589
And, you know, the old school coaches were brutal, you know,

139
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:54,670
and hierarchical and there was no connection or collaboration.

140
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,089
And you've got this generation of coaches now that are all the things

141
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:57,850
you're talking about.

142
00:05:58,329 --> 00:05:59,470
Do you think that's part of you?

143
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,370
You lead teams of up to 80 now and you get to create your own culture.

144
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:04,930
Is that what's driven you?

145
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:05,370
So, yeah.

146
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,410
So when we started our own company, that was my first thing was what's our culture?

147
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,610
What are we going to be?

148
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:11,550
What are we going to be about?

149
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:18,170
Like making TV shows is really hard and the chances of them succeeding is very low.

150
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:23,629
So I thought, okay, we'll take care of the TV show at some point.

151
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:28,129
But first of all, what we need to do is establish a culture where people want to work.

152
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,389
So I spent quite a lot of time writing documents and, and talking

153
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,350
to the staff that we're going to, we're going to come on.

154
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,149
And exactly what you just said, Paul, that's a really good example where

155
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,189
I just decided these are all the things I'm not going to do.

156
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:42,750
I'm not going to make it a fear culture.

157
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,689
I'm not going to make it a competitive culture.

158
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,310
We're going to try and give people creative freedom.

159
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,870
And I have to say, I wasn't good at it to begin with, like, because you're

160
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,910
also like, you're so anxious about like, if this show doesn't work, your income

161
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,870
goes to nought, it's reputationally problematic, you know, when the first

162
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,329
show that we did for our company was the weekly with Charlie Picker.

163
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:03,370
Yeah.

164
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,889
And the ABC, it was a big deal for him.

165
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:06,170
He'd just come off the project.

166
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,189
If that fails, it's not great for him.

167
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:12,449
So we were under the, you know, under a fair bit of scrutiny, particularly

168
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:16,050
back then when people were watching TV, but it was important to me that

169
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:21,829
the people that came on felt heard and felt like they were part of the process.

170
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,110
Before I came onto this podcast, I was talking about it with Charlie.

171
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,649
And I think the thing that we made a big deal of was not telling

172
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:31,170
people how we're doing something.

173
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:33,029
We're telling them why as well.

174
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:36,009
And I think that made a big difference.

175
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:39,889
Well, I've got so much respect for Hamish and Andy and Chris in the same way.

176
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:41,069
Maybe that's what's happening, isn't it?

177
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:45,029
And I think they sat down and I've spoken to Andy before about this around,

178
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,310
there's crazy stuff that goes on in this world.

179
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,889
How about we not be like that?

180
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,730
And how about we look after people and, and, and not ever do anything mean-spirited.

181
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:58,589
Uh, and you've never seen those guys full of humour, full of creative brilliance,

182
00:07:58,589 --> 00:07:59,730
but never at the expense of anyone else.

183
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,290
No, very gentle, good humour.

184
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:03,089
And, and always done the right thing.

185
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:05,810
And then they've spawned a generation of people that work with them.

186
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,170
They've gone on to great success.

187
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,889
One of the great stories, whereas you globally look at, uh, media, and it's a

188
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:15,149
bit of a fascination of mine as someone who played professional sport, came into

189
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:17,329
radio and TV by accident, really.

190
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:18,569
And, and just couldn't believe us.

191
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:21,689
If you go globally, you think of Roger Ailes at Fox news, one of the most

192
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:27,509
powerful, uh, media organisations in the world and a horrific, absolute animal.

193
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,769
Harvey Weinstein's in that, another absolute animal.

194
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:32,929
And I couldn't believe when I came out of team sport.

195
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,029
Yeah.

196
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,110
And, uh, into media and just the language people spoke, the way they treated each

197
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,289
other.

198
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:38,850
So this is bizarre.

199
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:42,929
Have you got a thought on why, you know, management in media has been that way?

200
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,330
Historically?

201
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,149
Yeah.

202
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:50,190
I think one of the things that historically about media has been that people want to be

203
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:50,409
in it.

204
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:51,389
People are desperate.

205
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,889
It's maybe less so now with social media, but certainly back when you and I were pups,

206
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:00,789
people were desperate for not just their 15 minutes of fame, but just to be around

207
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:01,529
entertainment.

208
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:02,929
And so I think people.

209
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:12,250
People are willing to do a lot to get, to be part of the industry, which gives very

210
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:18,169
mediocre white men often opportunity to exploit people.

211
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,169
It's probably also, I mean, this might be doing people an injustice, but I wonder whether

212
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:30,570
or not also it's an industry that, that sort of attracts various eccentricities.

213
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:32,769
I mean, you would know from your experience.

214
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:35,850
You would know from your experience as well, that when you're in, especially, you know,

215
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,610
many years ago, but still, it's obviously still going on today because it's in the papers

216
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,850
all the time, is that all the excuses that are made for people and all of the, the fawning

217
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,970
that goes around, particularly people that are on screen and stuff, they're given a lot

218
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:48,389
of latitude.

219
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,549
Like I remember there's a few, like a few stories.

220
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:56,210
Like my first job was on a show called Deal and O'Deal with Andrew O'Keefe, um, who's

221
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,610
obviously, you know, it's quite a sad story.

222
00:09:59,210 --> 00:09:59,470
Um.

223
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,250
Had some serious personal issues, which.

224
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:01,850
Yeah.

225
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,169
And they were.

226
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:02,450
Yeah.

227
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:02,610
Yeah.

228
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,350
They were pretty prevalent.

229
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:10,210
I was a kid, like I was 25 or something, 20, and he was the host and he was a freak of

230
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:10,470
nature.

231
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,070
Like he was, he was probably the, like one of the smartest people I've ever come across

232
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:20,649
and he was the most naturally, he could ad lib like no one I've ever, ever worked with

233
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:28,529
again, but clearly was very troubled and, but everyone just tiptoed around the obvious.

234
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:30,950
Everyone was tiptoeing around the drug use.

235
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,549
And so it was.

236
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,710
It was, you know, I was destined to go bad, but it was my, you know, it was my first job

237
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,789
and I was like, oh, okay, so this is how this works.

238
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:44,370
When we were doing the project, um, this is a slightly different story, but I'll, I'll

239
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,029
tell it anyway, but it does show the sort of the blind spots I think that happen in

240
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:49,289
media.

241
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:52,850
So you remember the, I mean, you'll remember the story, but just for the purpose of the

242
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:59,950
listeners, the St. Kilda school girl who was, um, a young girl who sort of got herself into

243
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,830
a bit of strife.

244
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,429
There's a video with Ricky Nixon.

245
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,490
Um, snorting cocaine and not a good story.

246
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,029
And I was working at the project at the time I was what the series producers, I was second

247
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:20,009
in charge and we got her to come in to do an interview and she came in, she did the

248
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:20,350
interview.

249
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:21,929
There was the full panel.

250
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:28,529
It was, it was prerecorded and it was, um, the panel was Steve Isaac, Charlie, Husey

251
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:28,950
and Carrie.

252
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:34,330
And Charlie had very serious misapprehensions about it.

253
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:40,289
I was young and ambitious and thought at the time it was okay.

254
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:47,909
She turned up without any adult and I didn't know that at the time cause I was in the control

255
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:53,970
room, but she then came up and did the interview, told, told the story.

256
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:58,830
We finished the interview and the cameras were still obvious.

257
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:03,990
Obviously on, but she, the interview had effectively finished and she said, everything

258
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,070
I just said there was a lie.

259
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:08,090
And Husey was like, yeah, that was pretty obvious.

260
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:16,490
So we then had this big like war game in the green room about, cause the show hadn't started

261
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:16,610
yet.

262
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:23,370
It was still a prerecord and Charlie was just like, oh, that should, we just can't

263
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:23,909
put this to air.

264
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:25,289
This is just not cool.

265
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,649
And he was in the descent.

266
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,909
As it turned out.

267
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,129
And we ended up putting the whole thing to air plus the bit where she said she lied.

268
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:38,710
And I have looked back on that now and thought that was a mistake.

269
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,029
She was 17 years old.

270
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,470
Should we should have been adults?

271
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,769
I really regret it.

272
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,370
I've learned from it.

273
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:47,590
Made sure I'd never do something like that again.

274
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,429
Yeah.

275
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:49,450
It's, it's interesting.

276
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:53,190
And as you say that the, the race is on every week, try and get a story.

277
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,549
That was a massive story.

278
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:56,549
And so you understand the medium, isn't it?

279
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:58,529
I think very few people self-reflect.

280
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,450
Very few people have a conscience in that space.

281
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,330
And, and I think that's probably the, the dark side.

282
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:05,590
I've always wrestled with that.

283
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:06,730
There's a body count, isn't it?

284
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,490
Like that for, is not a great day for a 17 year old girl, however you put it.

285
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,350
And, you know, I appreciate that you're someone that's got that ability.

286
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,610
So I really regret that.

287
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,950
Had my time again and probably the person that you are on the back of it.

288
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,570
But you said staying in your channels.

289
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,529
I think the beauty of creative people like you is that you can change channels all the

290
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:24,830
time.

291
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,750
We, on the way in, we're talking about you've back from Columbia, your great

292
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,710
mate, Chris Brown, Mick Malloy, a mate of mine that I worked with for eight years.

293
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,789
There's a lot of fun too in this game, isn't there?

294
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:36,110
To change gears slightly.

295
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,830
Now, I don't know the background of the story, but Malloy in Columbia, Chris Brown,

296
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:42,110
production crew with you.

297
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:42,929
I'm in.

298
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,370
I don't even know what the story is, but sign me up.

299
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,330
What could possibly go wrong to borrow one of Mick's lines is how I feel about that.

300
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:51,509
Tell me about what's going on over there.

301
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:51,850
Okay.

302
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:54,230
So we're making a TV show with Chris Brown.

303
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,250
I won't give the whole thing away.

304
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,549
But I mean, Mick's obviously talked about it.

305
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:06,049
But part of the premise is taking a celebrity overseas to work on animals.

306
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:11,250
And we took Mick, of all places, to Columbia because he's obsessed with the cocaine hippos,

307
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,570
which are Pablo Escobar's hippos that he brought over to Columbia in the 80s that have since

308
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:16,870
bred.

309
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,830
And anyway, we took him around Columbia.

310
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,049
That is a great story, by the way, isn't it?

311
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,669
Incredible story.

312
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:25,750
Literally, Pablo Escobar had a menagerie of African wild animals.

313
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:26,850
Including three hippos.

314
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:27,649
That bred.

315
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,669
And a ruining.

316
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:30,970
The environmental landscape of part of Columbia.

317
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:32,269
But they're also a tourist attraction.

318
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,870
So we actually, it's actually quite an incredible story.

319
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:39,250
But yeah, I mean, look, Columbia with Mick Malloy is a new experience.

320
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:42,250
It was, I'll tell you one story.

321
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:47,529
So the shoot was hard.

322
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,769
You're shooting in the Colombian jungle.

323
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,570
At nighttime, of course, we'd knock off.

324
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,909
Mick wants to have a couple of beers.

325
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,610
We know to enjoy a cold beer on a warm day.

326
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:57,049
Cold beer.

327
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,370
Yeah.

328
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,730
And so I took it upon myself.

329
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,429
I took it upon myself to be the wingman.

330
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,990
So we're going to have a few beers.

331
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:11,610
And I was also concurrently dealing with my separation, which you can imagine was both

332
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,309
emotionally and just very taxing.

333
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,289
The shoot was enormously difficult.

334
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,529
It was also the first episode.

335
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:26,669
And anyway, it got to the point where we were trying to fly home.

336
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,269
We missed our connection.

337
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,870
And I ended up, we ended up in Lima.

338
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:36,870
We managed to get a flight home for Mick, but they, but the, we couldn't get a flight

339
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,370
home for me.

340
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:41,570
So I was going to have to stay in Lima for two days, which I thought was just not going

341
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:41,850
to happen.

342
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,950
So I ended up, ended up finding a ticket.

343
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:51,830
But then when we arrived at the, at the airport after this incredibly taxing 10 days, I got

344
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,070
bitten by someone else's emotional support dog, which broke skin.

345
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:58,649
So I got Chris Brown, the vet on the phone going, am I going to have rabies?

346
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:02,029
And, but Mick just, he just thought it was the best.

347
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:07,809
Like, you know, after the week you've had, what, what, how, it could not be more emblematic

348
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:11,450
of the week you've had than being bitten by someone else's emotional support dog.

349
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:16,570
I've had the pleasure of traveling with Malloy on a number of occasions and it is never boring.

350
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:18,570
There's a, there's always something going on.

351
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:23,149
It is the beauty of the creativity that you can go and shoot that story and, and bring

352
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:23,610
it to the air.

353
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:27,570
That's, that's the genius of the medium that you guys are in and to take it into different

354
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,009
places.

355
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:32,970
As you said, you're a producer now looking after 80, 80 people at a time and in various

356
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,549
shoots and taking this to a different direction as well.

357
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:41,230
I understand losing your brother at a young age, Chris, profound effect as, as it would.

358
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,830
And that's sort of been the guiding principle for you and how you try and run your teams.

359
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:46,769
Can you share a bit of that, that story as well?

360
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:48,169
Yeah, I can.

361
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:56,610
I would argue that a good friend of mine, ABC journalist, Annabelle Crabb, actually,

362
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,190
I texted her and said, you know, we,

363
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:06,430
we did a show together and, and, and I said to her, you know, I, to, to, you know, I like

364
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,009
to get feedback.

365
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:11,549
It's part of the reason I did your, your, um, a leader group was, you know, I haven't

366
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:12,450
had a boss for so long.

367
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,410
I was like, I need feedback.

368
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:19,049
And so I said, Annabelle, you know, how do you see me as a leader or how do you see me

369
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:20,690
as, as an executive producer?

370
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:28,950
Or, and she said, um, that she, she once wrote this book and in the book they interviewed

371
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,690
30 men.

372
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:38,349
30 women CEOs and almost to a man slash woman, the men had grown up in very stable, well

373
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:44,890
to do, had, you know, I was going to say easy lives, but, but, but standardized where, you

374
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,970
know, marriages worked and they'd given all of the opportunities.

375
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:53,750
Whereas the women had all suffered almost according to this study that, that all suffered

376
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,390
fairly substantial trauma.

377
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,390
Annabelle said to me, I think it's the, I think it's the trauma.

378
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:05,190
It's the trauma in your past that has given you the attributes that she personally, that

379
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,650
she likes about working with me.

380
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:17,009
The story is that, um, when I was nine years old, um, my brother, uh, who was 13, Adam,

381
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,549
he, he was also my, my hero.

382
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:26,029
He, we were playing cricket in the back, in the driveway at our family home with my cousin

383
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:26,349
Luke.

384
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:30,390
And, um, it's difficult to fully like remember.

385
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:37,410
Cause you, your brain tends to, you know, the trauma of the incident sort of corrupts

386
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,230
the brain's memory.

387
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:43,569
But, so I can't remember exactly who bowled the ball, but my cousin hit it and the ball

388
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:49,970
rolled under the gate across the road, which we lived on a main road and Adam was the only

389
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,230
one who was allowed to cross the road.

390
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:56,990
So, and of course he went out and I followed him out cause you know, that's what I did.

391
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,589
I just was like a puppy dog.

392
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,470
Like I was whatever he did.

393
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:00,210
I wanted to be around.

394
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:07,150
And we got to the other side and, um, he sort of, he collected the ball and then he set

395
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,829
to come back across the road.

396
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:11,170
And I was like, it was, it was weird.

397
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,089
Cause I was like this split second where I thought, Oh, I'm sure he's okay.

398
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:15,170
And then bang.

399
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:19,529
And it was just like a sickening thud.

400
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:29,650
And he, you know, went sort of flying and, um, and I ran up the driveway screaming that

401
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,390
he's, you know, he's dead.

402
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:39,930
And, um, got my mom and she obviously ran and that's probably, I then went across the

403
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:47,529
road with mom, even though I wasn't supposed to and saw him and he was like in really bad

404
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:59,950
shape and mom seeing mom desperately calling for an ambulance was, was almost as bad.

405
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:00,009
Yeah.

406
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:06,869
Um, shocking as, as gruesome as the accident was, et cetera.

407
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:18,250
Um, so I sort of collapsed and then I, then a couple of things happened in a, in the next

408
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:23,289
few hours that I think had a profound effect on my psyche going forward.

409
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:29,029
One of them was that, um, they took me inside.

410
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:36,569
And this, this stranger took me inside and put me on a lap and said, um, you've got to

411
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,369
pray for him, keep praying for him.

412
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,690
And if you pray for him, he'll get better.

413
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,210
And I'm like, so of course I was nine years old and the world's, you know, God's in the

414
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,710
sky and that sort of stuff.

415
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:52,329
And so I started praying and hard as I could.

416
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:57,009
And then the police arrived and said, Oh, did anyone see it?

417
00:20:57,009 --> 00:20:59,210
And I said, and I went to them and I said, yeah.

418
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,250
And then I said, Oh, is he?

419
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:00,650
Is he getting better?

420
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:01,210
Is he getting better?

421
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:07,990
And one of the cops, I think just out of, you know, kindness, I guess said, yeah, I

422
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,630
think he's getting better.

423
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:18,269
So I thought, um, I'm having an impact on my, you know, and anyway, of course, um, later

424
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:19,869
that day he passed away.

425
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,809
Well, I'm not sure exactly what part of the day he died, but he died that day.

426
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:29,809
And then, um, anyway, and then in the, in the sort of the, the year.

427
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:38,809
This is the, that followed as a girl, I developed, um, by the time I was 12 or 13, I developed

428
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:39,369
OCD.

429
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:41,910
And.

430
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:46,450
I've always thought it was a bug, like a bug in my mind.

431
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:51,730
Um, and you've got, you know, it got really full on, um, obsessive, compulsive,

432
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,950
disordered show up for you.

433
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:59,589
It was in lots of different, different ways, but it was very religious based because

434
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,849
I think part, part of the, you know, the idea that I could have prayed him better.

435
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,670
So even though I'm not religious, my mum was sort of quasi-religious.

436
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,809
I would go to church and stuff.

437
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:17,809
And so occasionally, and so it would show up in like lots of repetition in my head,

438
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,650
lots of counting.

439
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:29,059
Um, and, uh, is anything sort of sacrilegious or blasphemous was very problematic and any

440
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:30,680
sort of negative thoughts were really problematic.

441
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,720
So you get these very intrusive thoughts and then you've got to try and, you know,

442
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,400
you've got to try and ameliorate them with compulsions.

443
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:42,460
And it got to the point, particularly my teenage years, where it was pretty, it was, it was

444
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,059
getting close to non-functional.

445
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,819
Um, and then I was lucky enough to get, I had, you know, I had, we had the means to

446
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:51,740
get help, you know, and I was very lucky.

447
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,779
I had a psychiatrist who I saw for 30 years who sadly died last year.

448
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:58,039
He was probably the person who knew me best in the world.

449
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,700
He died last year of pancreatic cancer.

450
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,140
But he.

451
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,460
He was great.

452
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:08,059
And, um, but it wasn't until the age of 35 that I really got on, on top of it.

453
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,660
And that was by doing a thing called exposure therapy, which is for anyone who's got OCD

454
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,619
will know how difficult that is.

455
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:18,400
But it was, um, yeah, it was, and it's one of those things that you live with in silence,

456
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,700
particularly back in those days, because no one really knew what it was.

457
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:25,880
I mean, I lived in a medical family and even, you know, my parents, I think would, would,

458
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,000
would agree, you know, we weren't particularly literate in, in the whole thing, but you certainly

459
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,660
didn't tell your friends.

460
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:37,059
Your friends, your teachers, you know, I remember, you know, it trying to play sport, you know,

461
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:40,900
crippled by, you know, I was, I was quite good at basketball, but you know, there'd

462
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,400
be days where, you know, you could barely get on the court cause you're tying your shoes

463
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,180
400 times and you know, like, so it was really difficult.

464
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:53,740
I'd always seen it as a bug and, but I think the truth, what the truth is, and I've discovered

465
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,900
this over in the last two years whilst going through another crisis that I think it was

466
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,579
largely around a fear of loss.

467
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:06,579
Like in a very, very severe fear of loss, like, you know, almost morbid fear of loss.

468
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:15,660
Um, and I think that's probably also, I hate the idea of, you know, how they talk about

469
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,920
like the, you know, they talk about it with Robin Williams a lot.

470
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,599
It's like the crazy genius or the, the, the unwell genius, like that there's some sort

471
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:28,359
of gift in, you know, I was reading about, I was reading about Anthony Hopkins the other

472
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:30,359
day who was talking about his, he's got asperger's.

473
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,599
And he was saying that he feels like that's a gift.

474
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,119
I've never, I've never felt that.

475
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:39,480
Like, I never felt like any condition like that is helpful or useful, but, um, I do think

476
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,099
that like fear of loss has probably driven a lot of my success.

477
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:44,839
Yeah.

478
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,380
It's a, thanks for sharing that incredibly personal story.

479
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,359
And it's like, you can almost see the video in your mind, can't you?

480
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,799
It's literally the worst nightmare and everyone who's got kids, it's, yeah, you know, I live

481
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:00,640
on a road, you know, and I still, you know, when cars sort of speed down our road, I look

482
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,960
at them, it's like, God, there's so many kids step across that road onto an oval 10

483
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,619
meters across.

484
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:08,779
And so that fear's there at a level for all of us, isn't it?

485
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:14,420
When you've had to live that with your brother, not surprising that that has taken over your

486
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:19,319
psychology and, and, um, to be able to, as you said, find a way through it without being

487
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,720
able to talk about it back in that era.

488
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,240
It's incredible really that you're able to get that.

489
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:25,940
You know, you literally had a psychologist for 30 years to.

490
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:26,319
Yes.

491
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,279
So he was a psychiatrist.

492
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,619
So they, I was going to say they make you, but they, they.

493
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,759
They give you, you know, when something as tragic as that happens, my parents went and

494
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:37,920
saw him and they, they said, oh, he could, you know, Chris could go and see him as well.

495
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,660
And so I was 10 when I started seeing him or I could have even been nine, but, and,

496
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:46,279
um, I saw him for off and on, like there were, there were periods where I didn't, but, you

497
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:53,279
know, for 30 years, you know, he even, um, saw me and Carrie occasionally together.

498
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,220
Um, he.

499
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,619
Interestingly, like I said, he died last year.

500
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,660
But two months before he died, I'd been messaging him all year.

501
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,579
I couldn't get onto him cause you know, he was sick and, but eventually he responded

502
00:26:09,579 --> 00:26:13,079
to me and he, um, we went and had a coffee.

503
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:16,799
It was a three hour coffee and he let me record it.

504
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:19,839
And it was, he was no longer my doctor.

505
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,920
He no longer, there was no patient doctor, you know, like confidentiality.

506
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,640
It was any, just the gloves were off and it's probably my most cherished bit of audio because

507
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,500
he just laid out my life for me and I listened to it now and now and again, just to, just

508
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,799
to give me a hand when it, when it's hard, but he was, he was an incredible, incredible

509
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,140
man.

510
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,319
He's one of those people in life that you feel like, I don't know if you have them,

511
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,000
but you know, there's a handful of people that you feel like almost sort of kind of

512
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,539
save you, you know, in life that, and he was one of them.

513
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,539
What a gift, isn't it?

514
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:54,980
To get someone like that and for him to have the presence to understand that this was something

515
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,779
you probably needed going forward is a, is an incredible story.

516
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:00,500
So yeah, you have referenced, um, you know,

517
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,759
recent, uh, trauma of, of separation and having seen so many close friends in recent

518
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,779
times, um, post COVID go through it.

519
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,359
I reckon it feels like you're probably times it by a hundred in the public sphere and having

520
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,240
to do that publicly.

521
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,059
I can't imagine high profile partner and carry a bit more.

522
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,640
How, how hard has that been for you?

523
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,519
Very.

524
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:28,309
Um, yeah, it was been, it was, we were together for 13 years.

525
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:31,109
Built a family together.

526
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:40,230
Um, you know, it's what I thought out, you know, life would be, and life had a different

527
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,950
plan again.

528
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:50,220
And I've always wanted to be like, I've always wanted to, I think, you know, like, not that

529
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:56,420
I want to draw everything back to my past, but I think having your family so badly disrupted

530
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:03,440
as a child meant that I really wanted to have a family, you know, and I feel like, you know,

531
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:08,339
the fact that that got broken up, I found really challenging, really difficult.

532
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:15,880
Initially, the media part of it wasn't a big deal for me.

533
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:22,099
Like it just, I just, it was so far down the list of, of, you know, it was saying goodbye

534
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:24,859
to the kids, you know, twice a week.

535
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:28,339
And still, I still find that just enormously challenging.

536
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:33,440
You know, I just, I had always assumed I'd be around them a hundred percent of the time.

537
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:39,480
And it's, it's the one thing in life that I'm happy to be super confident, borderline

538
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,420
hubristic about, about saying is that I'm a really good dad.

539
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:48,539
Like I would never, I would never say that I'm a, you know, a gun producer or, you know,

540
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:49,359
whatever.

541
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,339
I just, but when it comes to being a dad, I was just sort of born for it and I love it

542
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:57,200
and I want to be around them all the time.

543
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,480
So that, I find that really difficult.

544
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:03,220
The media scrutiny was tough because I just,

545
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:09,299
there's so much bullshit like written about and I, uh, you and I, you and I, you know,

546
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:14,839
we're sort of recent friends, but we both share a hatred of injustice.

547
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:18,619
And I think that like when you read stuff about yourself, even though I've been adjacent

548
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:23,839
to famous people for my entire career or, or high profile people, and obviously I lived

549
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:30,779
with, I lived with one, um, it's different when it's about you and it's like, but you

550
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:32,839
know, I mean that part of it has kind of.

551
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:41,420
Have said has settled down now, but like divorce is genuinely, I think underrated as

552
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,319
a difficult event.

553
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:47,079
Like I think because it's so prevalent, I think it's way too prevalent personally.

554
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:50,039
Like I think people give up far too easily.

555
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:55,099
And I think in our current culture, it's going to happen possibly more because I, you know,

556
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,819
as you would know, love's not just about a feeling.

557
00:29:57,819 --> 00:30:02,759
It's a, you know, it's obviously a commitment and it's difficult at times, but it's, it's

558
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,019
also incredible.

559
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,180
It's incredibly rewarding.

560
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:04,359
Yeah.

561
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,839
It's a, it's a, it's a nuclear thing, isn't it?

562
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:12,039
You're talking about how underrated and I can't walk in your shoes at all.

563
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,200
I wouldn't pretend to, but you know, a lot of the close people around me, as you said,

564
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:20,859
because it happens every other week, we assume it's just, but you're right.

565
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,059
The, the, it's nuclear, isn't it?

566
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:25,299
It's, as you said, it's not being around your kids every day.

567
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:27,440
It's separating your assets.

568
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,859
It's changing your finances.

569
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:31,740
It's friendship groups change immediately.

570
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,200
People take sides.

571
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:38,359
Some people invent things and, and, and then you're trying to do that and be a great parent

572
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,039
at the same time.

573
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,759
Like it's, it's massive, isn't it?

574
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:46,279
And then I, as I said, the layer of then having people from the outside publicly say things

575
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:49,720
that are untrue, I just, it's a huge event that you had, you know.

576
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:50,119
Yeah.

577
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:50,900
So exactly.

578
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:55,579
So you, because it happens so often, I think people sort of, they move on from it quickly.

579
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:00,740
And that's the other difficult thing about grief is that people only have about, I mean,

580
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,859
I've got some incredible friends that have.

581
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,759
That have helped me through, you know, the rougher times in my life.

582
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:10,920
And it's, you know, who would die for me and I'd die for them, but they, people have to

583
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,880
move on, you know, like people have to get on with their own lives.

584
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,980
But the thing is, you know, grief can last a long time.

585
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:20,839
And, and I think men struggle probably, you know, they say that 95% of like the suicide

586
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,240
risk after divorce is men.

587
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,680
Um, I think women are the strongest sex as it turns out.

588
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:34,559
And, and, you know, I think there's, it's a, it's a, you know, it is a really difficult

589
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,019
process.

590
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:35,880
It's for everyone involved.

591
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,759
It's difficult for the kids, difficult for families.

592
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:44,140
Like you said, you know, everyone who goes through divorce, I think loses friends, which

593
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,160
for someone who hates loss, um, I felt, you know, I found really difficult.

594
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,599
At the time, uh, we were really, you know, privileged and catching up with you and clearly

595
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:58,559
going through some challenges and, and you jumped headlong into this thing we call Leader

596
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:58,779
Connect.

597
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:00,079
And it's what we love.

598
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,500
We talk about inspiring connections and suddenly a random group of people are showing up and,

599
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,359
and, and you being as open and honest as you are.

600
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,599
I know the group loved you.

601
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,339
Nick Natanui is a really special, uh, person from an AFL point of view.

602
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,519
John Pigeon from doing great things in the property world.

603
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,079
Alex Baker, love out loud.

604
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:23,700
Um, Ashani's an incredible person and, uh, and Hamish, um, Happy Apple as well.

605
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,440
It's a diverse group of people.

606
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,779
Can you tell us about what was a pretty vulnerable time in your life?

607
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,059
What, what did it mean to you?

608
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:34,240
I mean, I haven't actually told you this, I don't think, but it meant more than I think

609
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,079
even the group realized.

610
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:35,839
We did this exercise.

611
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:39,119
I think you might've even been there when we did the exercise, but we, where we all

612
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:39,960
talked about each other.

613
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:44,279
And I mean, those people who I'd, I've still not met them.

614
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:48,660
I think I met Ashani in person, but I haven't met them physically in person and we would

615
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,460
meet every week or every second week.

616
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:55,980
And these people are, you know, they're incredibly successful people, but they were just like,

617
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,240
there'd be times that I'd be in the group, you know, in tears and these people were so

618
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,720
supportive.

619
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:03,960
And.

620
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,700
It helped me like, so Nick Natanui said this thing at the end, he goes, I don't know how

621
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,680
to say this without sounding like a wanker, but he, it was quite, it's quite confronting

622
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,559
particularly for an Australian, you know, Australians, we don't like, you know, they

623
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:23,579
were sort of talking about you and, and, and Nick said something like, ah, walks, he calls

624
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:26,259
me and he said, um, you know, I feel like you're just like Batman.

625
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:29,319
Like you're just sitting in the, I mean, I think he probably meant Robin, but he was

626
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:32,099
like, you know, you'd see in the background getting things done for people and, and trying

627
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:33,859
to make other people shine.

628
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,299
And, you know, produce other people and, and make other people better all the time.

629
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:41,579
And, and like, I've really hung on to it.

630
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:45,279
Like I've really hung on to the fact that Nick Natanui, who used to belt up on the tags

631
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,920
all the time, like, um, you know, someone I admired had thought to say that about me

632
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:55,200
and, and, you know, it's, yeah, I found it like, I don't know how I don't want to say

633
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,859
life-saving, but it just, it was, I found it like there was times when I didn't want

634
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:04,220
to go onto the call, but cause I was like, I don't want to be.

635
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,920
I don't want to be on the call and being, ah, shit, my life's fucked.

636
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:15,860
Like, but every time I went on it, I felt better and, you know, I can't wait to meet

637
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,139
them all in person.

638
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:23,059
I actually, and I'm incredibly grateful to you for, you know, I think it was our mate

639
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:27,500
Chris Brown that, that told me about it and I caught up with you and had I not, I would

640
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
obviously not have done it.

641
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:31,699
Um, but as soon as I met you and realized what you were about, I was like, all right,

642
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:32,960
I've got to get some of that.

643
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,219
And, um.

644
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:40,260
Um, yeah, it's been, it was a really important part of it for part of my journey.

645
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:40,860
So thank you.

646
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,219
Yeah.

647
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:41,679
Thank you.

648
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,199
I did have the pleasure of jumping in on that, on that call.

649
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:48,860
And I remember going around the group and what Nick said to you, it was really powerful

650
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,000
what the other said to you as well.

651
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:52,360
And I think he said something else, which made me laugh too.

652
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,940
He said, I can't, I've spent my life turning up on screen, sitting up and making sure I

653
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,340
look right.

654
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,639
He said, you look like an unmade bedwalk, but you don't care.

655
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,460
And he said, I love it, you know?

656
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,179
And, and he, they spoke about the honesty and how you just, it pours out of you, which

657
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:08,340
is a great credit to you.

658
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:12,579
And I, I think you can, people will hear that in this, in this conversation, but this feels

659
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:13,960
a bit like this is your life, mate.

660
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:18,539
And I, part of what I love this forum is because I spent the last few days reading as much

661
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:19,059
as I can.

662
00:35:19,139 --> 00:35:23,119
I know you're well, I know you walk, you work really well, but the things that happen in

663
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,239
life and sometimes, you know, I've always had this thing, if you're in media and something

664
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:29,159
happens to you, at some point, you're probably going to have to talk about it.

665
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:29,320
Yep.

666
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,579
There was a famous moment in lockdown.

667
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:32,860
And I think all of us probably.

668
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:37,119
We're, you know, a millimeter away from one of these, where we spent our life on Zoom

669
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,360
and did we turn the camera off and jump in the shower?

670
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:41,800
Now, I haven't heard you talk about this.

671
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,420
Are you up for telling the story?

672
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:47,800
Because this one got a bit of traction that you signed off from a Zoom, this is how I

673
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,139
read it.

674
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,840
You went in the shower, the camera's still rolling, could happen to anyone, but half

675
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,920
your work colleagues get to see the full frontal of Chris Walker.

676
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,099
How was that one?

677
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:57,860
I'm interested.

678
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,099
What do you think happened, having read the paper?

679
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:03,059
Well, just that, you know, I could picture that.

680
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:08,659
It was, we were on the, every hour, I was doing breakfast radio on Zoom and you, and

681
00:36:08,659 --> 00:36:11,559
you just think immediately afterwards, you go on to your next thing.

682
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:15,340
And often that would be to jump in the shower or the camera could be rolling or anything.

683
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,960
And I thought, shit, that could have easily been me.

684
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,780
I just saw a bit of humor in it.

685
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,980
Not that sort of, and like most people would ask you about like, well, turn your camera

686
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,360
back on.

687
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:23,579
Yeah.

688
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,780
That's how I read it.

689
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,000
Yeah.

690
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,360
Was it, was it?

691
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,039
Yeah.

692
00:36:27,139 --> 00:36:29,960
I think that's probably what it should have been.

693
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,400
I mean, like, so the story was that we were in, we were in, um,

694
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:38,639
we were on a family four month holiday, but the kids were going to school over in London.

695
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,079
It was like a big family trip that we'd always wanted to do.

696
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,780
And, but we were still working.

697
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,119
So, um, Carrie was doing radio.

698
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:51,360
Um, so she'd leave the apartment at, at like four 30 in the morning.

699
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:58,199
And on Tuesday mornings, I had to, um, produce the weekly.

700
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:03,440
And, uh, so I had to, you know, the infrastructure set up in, in our bedroom so that I could,

701
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:08,980
um, talk to the control room and as you know, like in London, that everything's tiny, like,

702
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:12,179
you know, the bathroom is basically on your, you know, in your bedroom and your bedroom

703
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:13,139
is basically in your kitchen.

704
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:20,599
And we have three children and the nanny had decided to not turn up.

705
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,380
So I had to scramble for another nanny.

706
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:25,579
She decided to have that not on the Monday.

707
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:27,219
So, and she just, that was the end of her.

708
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,119
And so we, I had to scramble for a new nanny.

709
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:33,420
And of course on this particular day, so I was up at four 30.

710
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,739
At five o'clock we did rehearsal.

711
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:37,920
And so the way they had it, they had me on a zoom just in the control room.

712
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,599
And so that I could talk to Charlie and I could talk to the, um, the guys in the control

713
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,679
room, the producers and the directors and stuff.

714
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:46,199
Amazing technology, by the way.

715
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:46,340
Yeah.

716
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:46,579
Amazing.

717
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,599
From a London hotel room, you can be in the control room and run your show.

718
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:51,039
Yeah.

719
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:54,940
And it was, it was all, and it's, you know, COVID gave us that, you know, like that opportunity.

720
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:02,920
And so anyway, so then of course this new nanny was late, um, and the kids decided to

721
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,420
wake up at five.

722
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:03,920
It was four o'clock.

723
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,380
Ollie had COVID.

724
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,800
So I was doing.

725
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,820
That's a bit going on.

726
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,519
I had rehearsed.

727
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:09,820
I had rehearsed.

728
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,719
I had the, the, the, she was three at the time, you know, she was crying and, and Evie didn't

729
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:15,500
want to go to school.

730
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,320
And, um, so.

731
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,599
I laugh because we've been there.

732
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:24,519
Everyone has, we've had kids and the scrambles on and it's, uh, and you're just under the

733
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:24,599
pump.

734
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:25,059
It was insane.

735
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:25,420
Yeah.

736
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,239
And so, you know, rehearsal finished.

737
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:32,179
So I, you know, I, and I was wearing my, you know, my Richmond jammies and, um, and I ran

738
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:33,199
out into the.

739
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:37,880
The kitchen, butter the toast and, you know, it was all a big scramble.

740
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:43,159
And then I just went back into the bedroom to have a shower, took my things off and then

741
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:45,539
realized the zoom was still up.

742
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:46,019
Ah, right.

743
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:47,119
So you realized, did you?

744
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,460
Well, I heard some, I heard, I heard someone laughing.

745
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,260
Ah, right.

746
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,820
And so I heard like on the comms, I, oh shit.

747
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,239
So I closed the.

748
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,519
So you obviously got the camera if you're going to the shower to, to turn the screen

749
00:38:58,519 --> 00:38:58,739
down.

750
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:58,940
Yeah.

751
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,019
So I closed it and I closed the thing and then thought, ah, and then I thought my immediate

752
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:03,039
reaction was what you do.

753
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:03,280
It was like.

754
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,159
Oh, like that's, it's embarrassing, but it's funny.

755
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,239
And I texted Carrie and Carrie was like, oh, you know, do you want to come on radio and

756
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,159
have a laugh about it?

757
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:11,880
And blah, blah, blah.

758
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:17,539
And I was like, oh, maybe not just cause you know, it's the ABC and like, you know, it's

759
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:18,179
a sensitive world.

760
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:18,639
Yeah.

761
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:19,300
And I'm the boss.

762
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:19,760
Yeah.

763
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,039
Yeah.

764
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:25,539
And so anyway, and so I thought nothing of it really.

765
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:32,019
Um, and we sort of continued, you know, holiday, but then someone inside the ABC leaked it

766
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:32,599
to the Herald Sun.

767
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:40,619
As is, and the Herald Sun then blew it up into a story, tried to make it sound worse than

768
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,400
it was the first line.

769
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:47,420
And it was, it was the, the ABC people had received counseling for it.

770
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,920
And I was like, God, my body must be pretty weird.

771
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:54,340
You like feedback, but that's a bit much, isn't it?

772
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:54,900
It's a bit rough.

773
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:03,420
Um, and so, um, anyway, and then it became.

774
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:07,300
And, you know, this story, and it was like really, um, incredible.

775
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:15,340
Like it was a very, uh, interesting example of journalism because they printed this article.

776
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:21,239
Two days later, I got a message from the journalist that printed the article saying, do you want

777
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:21,940
to tell us what happened?

778
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:24,320
You've just told everyone what you think happened.

779
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,300
And none of it was like the article was almost wrong in every sentence.

780
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,260
You know, like they said, it was up for two minutes.

781
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,420
And I'm like, well, if it was up for two minutes, why didn't they?

782
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,179
You should turn it off.

783
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,760
Like, like what's going on?

784
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,880
Like, it's like, it was, it was really unfortunate in the end.

785
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,760
Like it could have been, you know, it could have been, as you said, just one of those

786
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,280
things that was laughed off and it probably, you know, I wish it had been, to be honest.

787
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:45,780
Yeah.

788
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:51,980
But the people that texted me in support from back home, you know, like you mentioned

789
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:56,099
Andy Lee before, like he texted me going, mate, don't even worry about it.

790
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,480
Like it's, no one gives a fuck.

791
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:00,980
Which in the end is, is it, isn't it?

792
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
You know who your people are and the people in your corner.

793
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:03,159
Yeah.

794
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:06,559
I know you well, I know your values, but it's different when you're in the storm, isn't

795
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:06,739
it?

796
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,139
And people are inventing things and you, I think one of the things I, you, I think you,

797
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:12,619
we share that sense of, I hate injustice.

798
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,579
I hate when, if you've done the right, you know, if whatever happened has happened and

799
00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:16,179
then you own it.

800
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:16,500
Yeah.

801
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:18,199
And, and who cares really?

802
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:18,480
Yeah.

803
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,019
When people invent something else, I, I genuinely piques my interest.

804
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:25,460
And, you know, this whole generation now of kids who shared something on Snapchat and

805
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:31,099
a mate screenshots it and in the most treacherous act, you know, turns it into something that's

806
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:32,659
destroying teenagers at the moment.

807
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:37,059
And it just gets me that people have that mindset in our culture that I'm going to stitch

808
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:38,340
someone up actively.

809
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:45,300
There's a real cruelty in, I listened to the Omar Omar, Safari doctors.

810
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:45,639
Yeah.

811
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,539
Beautiful person.

812
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:52,599
And I'm just like, you know, there's that, like, there's that kind of person who's doing

813
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:53,440
what she's doing.

814
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:59,199
And then there's, there's people that are spending time trying to, you know, hurt other

815
00:41:59,199 --> 00:41:59,539
people.

816
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:01,420
And just, it just seems unnecessary.

817
00:42:01,539 --> 00:42:02,059
And what, you know, I.

818
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:04,019
Like our TV show is a comedy show, right?

819
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:08,460
So we're like, we're throwing elbows at times at people, you know, particularly politicians,

820
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:17,639
but we, we have like very strict rules about who we will satire or who we will ridicule.

821
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,260
We've made mistakes.

822
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,380
Like, absolutely.

823
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,179
We've made mistakes.

824
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:24,380
And like, I've had to ring a couple of people and personally apologize.

825
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,199
Charlie has as well.

826
00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:29,059
Like we've absolutely made, we own it when we do, you know, I think it's important to

827
00:42:29,059 --> 00:42:29,400
do that.

828
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,760
Like, I think, I think we need satire and I think we need comedy.

829
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:31,880
Yeah.

830
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:33,619
We need to be able to take the piss out of each other.

831
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:36,340
We need a sense of humor is absolutely crucial.

832
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,980
I think for all industries, but obviously if you don't have in the, in the entertainment

833
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,619
industry, then what else you might as well get out.

834
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:42,940
But.

835
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:48,139
That's the best of Australian culture to me is when your mates hang shit on you, it's

836
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:48,900
the best of footy.

837
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,980
It's the locker room of footy.

838
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,880
It's what I loved about doing footy media is trying to take some of that and really

839
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,840
aimed at each other.

840
00:42:55,099 --> 00:42:58,219
But I use this term another day, but it's actually delivered with love.

841
00:42:58,219 --> 00:43:01,940
Like having someone sitting alongside Mick Malloy for eight years and having him take the

842
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,719
piss out of some of the funniest stuff I've ever, because there's a friendship there and

843
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:07,019
you, and sometimes you push the line.

844
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:10,820
Occasionally you have to go, Hey Mick, that one might have landed a little bit far, but

845
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,320
if it's a mate, you can talk to him about it.

846
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,659
And that used to be, I reckon the way that we found balance in it all.

847
00:43:15,739 --> 00:43:19,539
And you just put your hand up if you get one wrong, if you keep doing it, then there's

848
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:20,440
a, then there's a problem.

849
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:23,760
And I've always taken that, you know, Marcus Aurelius, I think they, I think they use it

850
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,260
in gladiator, but the real Marcus Aurelius said, you know, death smiles at us all.

851
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,420
All you can do is smile back.

852
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,280
And obviously I think he's talking genuine.

853
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:31,920
I think he's literally.

854
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:37,699
talking about death, but I always metaphorically think of that as when shit's going bad and

855
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:42,059
when it's, when you're in a crisis or when it's tough or when works hard or when the

856
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:44,760
show's not working, that's when you gotta be your funniest.

857
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,039
That's when you gotta be, have the best sense of humor.

858
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:50,699
And it's like, I was talking to Charlie just last night and I said, I'm going to go and

859
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:52,679
ask this podcast.

860
00:43:53,179 --> 00:43:59,880
And I said, you know, if you ask me, you know, what is, what do you like working?

861
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,920
What is it about that you enjoy?

862
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,119
What is it about working so closely with me?

863
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:06,900
Cause we've been business partners now for nearly 15 years.

864
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,559
And he's like, it's that you're funny and fun.

865
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,699
And I think without it, we'd be off doing something else.

866
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,380
We're all in trouble.

867
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,659
If we lose that sense of humor, we're all in trouble.

868
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,880
I love the saying, and you would have heard me say it, success leaves clues.

869
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,900
And I'm going to ask you these questions because your story's amazing.

870
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,599
It's full of some hurdles, but you've overcome them in a great way.

871
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,659
And the idea of leading yourself first.

872
00:44:31,659 --> 00:44:35,159
With self-leadership before you lead others, as you do, and I know you're really passionate

873
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:39,820
about looking after the people in your care and, and with empathy and you're really considerate

874
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,000
about that, but how do you go?

875
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:41,840
How do you lead yourself?

876
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:45,039
I don't reckon I've been good at it over the journey.

877
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:48,059
Like I don't reckon looking after myself has been a priority.

878
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:50,099
I reckon I've flogged myself.

879
00:44:50,139 --> 00:44:55,059
I'm actually spending a lot of time at the moment trying to find, I did this thing recently

880
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:58,980
where I put a photo of myself as a five-year-old on my phone.

881
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:00,340
And.

882
00:45:01,659 --> 00:45:07,960
I'm 42 now and been through these various hurdles and, you know, I've, I've sort of

883
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,159
been doing the same job now for a while.

884
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:17,320
And I really, I really want to find myself again.

885
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:22,039
Like I want to, I want to learn what, what the essence of that kid was, because I've

886
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:26,280
always felt like there was a sliding doors moment in my life where I could have been

887
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:31,280
this one thing and the death of my brother meant that I.

888
00:45:31,539 --> 00:45:31,639
I.

889
00:45:31,659 --> 00:45:32,039
Wasn't.

890
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,699
And so I don't want that to define me.

891
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:44,019
And so I'm really at the moment trying to spend a lot of time finding what it is that

892
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:47,860
actually drives me, what it is that motivates me, what it is that, why is it that I like

893
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:52,579
entertaining people and why is it that I want to be the best at everything and what, what

894
00:45:52,579 --> 00:45:54,260
is it like, what's behind it?

895
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,460
And like, I'm still searching for those, for those answers.

896
00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:01,639
Some of them, I think, uh, that, you know, there are probably.

897
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:09,219
Gaps in my, in my makeup that I'm, you know, I'm trying to fill, um, with, be it with success

898
00:46:09,219 --> 00:46:16,219
or, or validation or, you know, and some of it I think is that I enjoy what I do.

899
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,420
I love the creative process.

900
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,519
I'm good at it and it's good to be good at things.

901
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:24,440
Like it makes you feel good.

902
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:24,679
Yeah.

903
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,280
So did that answer your question?

904
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:28,239
Yeah, absolutely.

905
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:31,639
I mean, I, I, it's, I've never had anyone answered in that way, but I, I can understand.

906
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:35,559
There isn't going back and having that picture of you and, you know, because every kid has

907
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:36,639
got that purity, haven't they?

908
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:36,980
Yeah.

909
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:38,059
You don't have all those layers.

910
00:46:38,139 --> 00:46:39,099
They come later, don't they?

911
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:41,679
When life throws incredible challenges.

912
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,559
And everyone talks about, like, it's sort of become part of the common vernacular now

913
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:50,019
to talk about your inner child, which wasn't a thing that I ever thought about until a

914
00:46:50,019 --> 00:46:50,480
year ago.

915
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:50,960
Yeah.

916
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,500
But looking after the inner child in you, I think is important.

917
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:59,900
And I reckon, I think I've bullied myself a lot over the journey.

918
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,460
Like I think my, whatever it is.

919
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:05,860
Your super ego or your ear door, I forget which one it is, but the one that is rough

920
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:06,260
on you.

921
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,719
And I think the ego is probably the enemy to some degree.

922
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,400
You probably need a little bit of it just to keep going.

923
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,400
But, but on the whole, it probably just creates a lot of suffering because, you know, I think

924
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,639
you suffer more in your head than you do in reality.

925
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,420
But the thing that I'm terrible at and the thing that I'm going to like work on and I've

926
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,199
been working on since doing your, your thing and talking to a few other people is self-talk.

927
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:27,699
Yeah.

928
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,739
It's a, it's a, it's a great saying, isn't it?

929
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,179
You know, you would never let someone else.

930
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,119
Speak to you the way you speak to yourself.

931
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,480
Are you good at self-talk?

932
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:35,559
I work on it.

933
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:36,139
Yeah.

934
00:47:36,139 --> 00:47:37,000
I work on it a lot.

935
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:38,400
I start the day and actually.

936
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:39,300
Have a mantra?

937
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:39,719
Yeah.

938
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,480
Well, yeah.

939
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,980
I put things in there that I want and actively do that every day.

940
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:45,599
And so, yeah, you're right.

941
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:49,880
You get the shower and the mind wanders off and yeah, we all get that frustration, imposter

942
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:55,000
syndrome, but I'm, I'm conscious around, this is who I want to be and this is how I want

943
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,579
to show up.

944
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:59,719
And so I take some time to do that and try and do that as I get older as well.

945
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,199
It was easy when you had the ambition of.

946
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,440
Football or, um, those things are really clear.

947
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:08,900
I feel I've got to work a bit harder on that now, but, um, positively impacting others

948
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,440
in your environment.

949
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:13,059
I know that's something you think about a lot and from being around you, I can see you

950
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:17,219
care a lot about the people in your environment and you get hurt when something happens as

951
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:18,039
you, as you should.

952
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:22,300
What are some of the ways you've gone about that positive impact on others in the spaces

953
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:22,820
you create?

954
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:27,400
So the, I reckon the big one is, and I've got heaps better at this lately.

955
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,760
Like when we've reasonably young, when we started our company and, and.

956
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:37,760
But when we, over the last five or six years, it's changing the mindset of like, I don't

957
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,280
need to tell people how I want it to be.

958
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:47,739
I need to create a vision for what we think the show is and get everybody on board and

959
00:48:47,739 --> 00:48:52,860
not just tell them that this is the way it's going to be, or this is how we're going to

960
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,440
do it, but this is why we're going to do it.

961
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,860
And I think everybody feels much more validated by that.

962
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,960
And when we did the Alita group, we actually do a survey of all the.

963
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:06,900
Of your staff and, and it came back, my results were good, but like in terms of leadership,

964
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,079
but that was the thing that we're confronting about it.

965
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:14,940
And, you know, I think just FaceTime with people as well, I think is so underrated now,

966
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:20,340
like because of, you know, how much time people are spending on screens or at home on their

967
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:24,099
own or whatever, but like we have a culture at our work, you know, like you said, there's

968
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:30,280
seven or 80 people when, when the shows are going full ball and I have complete faith

969
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,239
in every single one of the people.

970
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:37,900
Walks in and I tell them when I think that they're better at a job than me, um, because

971
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,239
I think, cause that's of course true.

972
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,079
They all have, you know, special skillsets, et cetera.

973
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:50,780
And, and we make sure that everybody gets to sort of feast in the success of, of the

974
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,000
show.

975
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,380
So like when we're talking about like the weekly or hard quiz, you know, you know, Tom

976
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:59,820
Gleason's the host of hard quiz and Charlie's the host of the weekly, for example, but we

977
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,260
always talk in we, it's never.

978
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,559
I like, even though they're the stars, it's everyone's success.

979
00:50:04,659 --> 00:50:06,559
It's if we win an award, it's everyone's award.

980
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:07,320
It sits in the office.

981
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,579
It's yeah.

982
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:10,199
It's about the, the team atmosphere.

983
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:14,320
I mean, Charlie always says that I run the place like a footy team cause I sort of grew

984
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:19,699
up playing sport and that's my, you know, I love sport and I, and I think that, you

985
00:50:19,699 --> 00:50:22,940
know, one of the things that sport does is why I love getting my kids involved in team

986
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,179
sport is that you rely on other people.

987
00:50:25,699 --> 00:50:26,739
You owe them something.

988
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,480
You have to be there.

989
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:28,800
You have to turn up, you have to show up.

990
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,340
If you turn up and you're not prepared.

991
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,800
Then you're letting everyone down.

992
00:50:34,059 --> 00:50:36,820
So that's kind of the culture that we have.

993
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:41,840
And, and we're very fortunate that every single person that turns up to our work is, is, is

994
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,320
there to play.

995
00:50:42,699 --> 00:50:43,099
Yeah.

996
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:44,840
It's a great, uh, analogy, isn't it?

997
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:49,880
And we see that a lot in, uh, in team environments that are clearly as consistently successful

998
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,280
as yours.

999
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:54,239
The interesting visions and they take a fair bit of work.

1000
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:58,719
You know, we mentioned earlier, and I think of pitching, you know, going to Columbia was,

1001
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:01,440
uh, was, uh, with Chris and Mick.

1002
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,079
And, and that, that that's a pretty big vision.

1003
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,480
How do you go about selling those visions to, to your team and, and getting them to work?

1004
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,880
They're all really individual, like the show, the ideas and the shows, that particular show,

1005
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,760
the one you're talking about with Mick and Chris was a brainchild of Chris and I, there

1006
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,679
was, it took us six years to get that up.

1007
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:20,119
So you've got to persevere.

1008
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:24,400
Like, you know, if you're going to get knocked over because someone says, no, you'll never

1009
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,860
get anything up because they're always saying no, particularly now in, you know, the media

1010
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:30,860
industry is shrinking.

1011
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:31,340
And.

1012
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:35,900
I mean, you know, anyone under 30 barely plugs in free to air TV.

1013
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,440
So just jump, that's a great story for people to listen to, you know, someone as bankable

1014
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:40,940
as Dr.

1015
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:44,639
Chris Brown is probably one of the most loved people in Australia.

1016
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:45,139
And if.

1017
00:51:45,139 --> 00:51:49,280
The guy's six foot five, he's 11 out of 10, he loves kittens.

1018
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,159
He's the nicest human being on top of all that.

1019
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,719
He's incredibly smart.

1020
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:55,579
It was like he was built by a computer.

1021
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:56,119
Correct.

1022
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:56,840
Exactly.

1023
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:01,000
He may be AI, he may have been the first creation that we ever worked on.

1024
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:01,260
Yeah.

1025
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:01,920
Worked out.

1026
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,659
But the fact if, and you've got all that success, the fact that you guys take six years to get

1027
00:52:05,659 --> 00:52:10,440
a show together that, that I listened to and I go, I don't watch a lot of TV, that one

1028
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,039
I want to watch.

1029
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:12,699
So, but you had to persevere.

1030
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:13,440
Absolutely.

1031
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,539
I mean, the more incredible story is it took Hugh Jackman eight years to get the greatest

1032
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:19,019
showman up.

1033
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:19,920
Hugh Jackman.

1034
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,420
Is that right?

1035
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:20,920
Yeah.

1036
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,699
I mean, if Hugh Jackman turned up, you'd just be like, mate, whatever you want to do, just

1037
00:52:24,699 --> 00:52:25,539
roll it out, son.

1038
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:31,239
But, um, yeah, like it, we were, we were more focused on the show than we were on the show.

1039
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:35,760
We were fortunate with, with say like hard quiz, for example, like we'd done the weekly

1040
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,440
for a year.

1041
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:41,920
Um, and we'd sort of got through the initial sort of like, whenever you launch a new show

1042
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,039
in Australia in particular, you, you got to expect the, oh, it's shit ass.

1043
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:48,780
Like it's, you know, you know, people hate anything new.

1044
00:52:49,019 --> 00:52:53,119
They don't really, people don't really love success much in Australia, I reckon.

1045
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:57,300
And, um, but once we got over, like everyone telling us that it's a rip off of John Oliver

1046
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,800
and, um, all the American shows.

1047
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:00,480
Um.

1048
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:06,900
Um, you know, and the, the first incarnation of the show had Kitty Flanagan, Tom Gleeson

1049
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:14,599
and Charlie and, you know, Tom was on the rise and we thought, oh, we should have a

1050
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:15,420
vehicle for Tom.

1051
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:24,559
And, uh, we constructed hard quiz, um, which is obviously being a most successful show.

1052
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:28,380
Um, and that one just came, it's just like in cricket, you know, like it just came off

1053
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:28,739
the bat.

1054
00:53:29,059 --> 00:53:30,059
Like, um.

1055
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:33,500
Um, and so it was up really quickly.

1056
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:39,820
All having said that, we ran it out in the first season for 10 episodes and they nearly

1057
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:40,760
didn't recommission it.

1058
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:45,619
And they were very, they were like, they were hung on, hung on, hung on.

1059
00:53:45,659 --> 00:53:47,679
And then they finally said, okay, we'll do another series.

1060
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:49,539
And then obviously the rest is history.

1061
00:53:49,539 --> 00:53:55,619
And, you know, Tom's gone on to win gold Logies and the show's basically on all the time now.

1062
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:58,219
But, um, yeah, you've really got to like persevere.

1063
00:53:58,219 --> 00:53:58,320
Yeah.

1064
00:53:58,739 --> 00:53:59,940
I mentioned in the intro.

1065
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:02,579
That you're one of the most curious people I think I've, I've ever met.

1066
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:07,079
It shows up every time you're around, you're constantly drilling into, to questions.

1067
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:09,940
Uh, tell us about that curiosity and how it shows up for you.

1068
00:54:11,179 --> 00:54:12,900
I don't want to make everything about my dead brother.

1069
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:20,340
I think the, I mean, the, the truth is, I think that, look, I mean, it could be obviously

1070
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,940
just personality and genetics and that sort of stuff.

1071
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:29,679
But I think I've spent a lot of energy trying to understand the world because I think when

1072
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:37,239
something happens, that's that big an event, that big an event, your brain can't fathom it.

1073
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:46,900
And, and it's so painful emotionally and so eviscerating that I think I probably just threw

1074
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:51,159
everything upstairs and go, okay, how can I, how can I make sense of this?

1075
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:52,960
How can this possibly be right?

1076
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,099
And my dad told me this, I didn't know this, but he said on the day that my brother died,

1077
00:54:57,099 --> 00:54:59,239
he said, you spent the whole night to say it was Christmas Eve.

1078
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:00,800
Christmas Eve.

1079
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,800
And so it was also the day that I found out that Santa wasn't real.

1080
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:09,840
And so my parents brought up the Christmas presents and he just said, yo, you just kept

1081
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,039
saying, why, why has this happened?

1082
00:55:12,039 --> 00:55:12,380
Why?

1083
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:22,079
And so I think that the curiosity is probably my overall attempt that if I can, if I can

1084
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,420
understand it intellectually, maybe it'll make it okay.

1085
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:26,800
It doesn't work.

1086
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:29,619
And there are some things in life as we all know.

1087
00:55:29,619 --> 00:55:29,639
Yeah.

1088
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:37,519
That you can't make sense of and that you can't solve, but I suspect that's where the

1089
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:38,639
curiosity comes from.

1090
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:39,980
You know, I did a podcast.

1091
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:41,539
I am genuinely like quite curious.

1092
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:44,699
I did a podcast where I interviewed like two series, 12 people.

1093
00:55:44,699 --> 00:55:46,659
And I just love people.

1094
00:55:46,659 --> 00:55:48,320
Like I love hearing about them.

1095
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:50,340
You know, I wish we were doing this in reverse, to be honest.

1096
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:56,119
Like, yeah, um, I have to, I mean, do mom and dad ever get over that moment?

1097
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:57,659
Not really.

1098
00:55:57,659 --> 00:55:58,579
Like not.

1099
00:55:58,579 --> 00:56:00,880
I mean, you can imagine it yourself.

1100
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,820
Like I can imagine it too, obviously.

1101
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:10,599
And I mean, they're two of the most extraordinary survivors.

1102
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:17,400
And I've only like in the last two years even learned to respect and love them more, but

1103
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,719
I don't think you ever get over.

1104
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:22,059
I don't think you would ever get over the death of a child.

1105
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:26,039
I think the idea of getting over stuff, it's actually probably most offensive.

1106
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:27,079
It's also horseshit.

1107
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:28,559
Like, I think you probably just move.

1108
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:28,800
Yeah.

1109
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,800
Through it.

1110
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:36,320
But I think you become a new person, you become a different person and I think you, you find,

1111
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,320
you find ways to cope and you find, you know, some are good, some are bad.

1112
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,320
You probably build character.

1113
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,320
You get stronger.

1114
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:46,000
It could all be things that you just tell yourself to make yourself feel better, but

1115
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,119
they have gone on to be incredible grandparents.

1116
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:54,400
They've lived remarkably because it's very rare.

1117
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,519
Um, they've stayed together, um, after a tragedy, which, you know, they've been married for

1118
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:02,079
50 years, you know, like, so.

1119
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:03,760
Stats aren't great on that, are they?

1120
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,760
You're against the odds.

1121
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:08,280
You're in the communication, uh, business and we see leaders are really conscious around

1122
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,280
how they communicate.

1123
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,280
It's, it's one of your great skills.

1124
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:16,280
How have you thought about that in, in, in your workplace and in your daily life?

1125
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,280
Communication.

1126
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,280
Yeah.

1127
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,280
Yeah.

1128
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,639
Communicating like this, like in person is, I think, something that, that everyone should

1129
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:22,639
be doing more of.

1130
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,760
I'm apparently, I'm a terrible texter.

1131
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,760
Like I just, I'm very blunt with my texts.

1132
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,280
I don't like, I don't have flowery texts.

1133
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:32,300
So I've got to learn to like be more, you know, put a bit more affection and, and, and

1134
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,840
flower to the, to, to the communication.

1135
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:40,280
But so for, for someone who, you know, I spent a lot of time obviously analyzing, like when

1136
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:46,159
we're doing a TV show, how, how are we communicating this segment or this show of entertainment?

1137
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:47,340
How we, what are we communicating?

1138
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,519
What information do people need to make the joke?

1139
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:52,300
What set up do they need to make the punchline work?

1140
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:58,079
Analyzing that communication all the time and I think, but I think the area that one

1141
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:03,079
of the things, particularly with the leader group that, that, you know, and we did, you

1142
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:09,260
know, we did this facilitation with, um, with Marley, who was awesome, where she would take

1143
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:13,679
you through how you would communicate with people in the workplace.

1144
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:18,139
And it was very eye opening because there is, there is definitely better ways to do

1145
00:58:18,139 --> 00:58:19,139
it, you know?

1146
00:58:19,139 --> 00:58:22,519
And, um, you know, I think there was a difference between coaching and mentoring.

1147
00:58:22,519 --> 00:58:27,099
So I'm trying to learn now to like communicate better, just little things like using people's

1148
00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:28,079
names.

1149
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:32,300
Um, when you give feedback, give specific feedback, like the difference between going

1150
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:39,320
good job DAS and saying DAS that, that segment that you wrote today, it's possibly the best

1151
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,300
segment we'd put all year.

1152
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:49,639
The difference in that individual, like they just, they're buzzing, they go home feeling

1153
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:50,639
great.

1154
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:53,860
They come back to work going, they feel good about themselves.

1155
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:57,079
So I think that sort of like specificity, I think is probably.

1156
00:58:57,079 --> 00:58:58,079
Yeah.

1157
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:01,800
I think it's about having the time to use someone's name and say, Hey, we really love

1158
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,800
it.

1159
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,320
If you more of that is brilliant for us.

1160
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,320
Yeah.

1161
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,320
And it's awesome.

1162
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,320
Yeah.

1163
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,840
So then when, you know, sometime later where you have to say, Hey, we, you know, we prefer

1164
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,320
a bit more, it's an easier conversation.

1165
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,119
People miss that day, because nine out of 10 times people were doing stuff really, really

1166
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,119
well.

1167
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,579
But the only time they hear from you is when you're pissed off at something.

1168
00:59:18,579 --> 00:59:19,579
Exactly.

1169
00:59:19,579 --> 00:59:21,079
It just takes the ether out of the room.

1170
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:23,199
I think you sum it up in a really important way.

1171
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:25,079
I mean, you've, you're full of great collaborations.

1172
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:26,760
Charlie Pickering's a genius.

1173
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,840
And uh, you work with.

1174
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,659
with Chris Brown and so many others.

1175
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,820
How important has that been for you, the collaboration part?

1176
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,179
The collaboration with?

1177
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:35,900
Anyone and everyone, yeah.

1178
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:40,699
I think it's the best part of work.

1179
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:46,500
Like, I think it's, I genuinely love the people that I work with,

1180
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,559
like both on screen and off screen.

1181
00:59:51,159 --> 00:59:54,539
There are some people off screen who are just as extraordinary

1182
00:59:54,539 --> 00:59:58,920
and geniuses in their own right that I admire and respect,

1183
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,739
but I don't think it's true.

1184
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:04,460
The idea of a self-made man or a self-made woman, I think, is horseshit.

1185
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:05,380
Like, I think it's bullshit.

1186
01:00:05,539 --> 01:00:09,800
Like, I reckon everybody needs, everyone needs help

1187
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:14,780
and everyone needs to collaborate and things are always better

1188
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:15,440
when you collaborate.

1189
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:18,519
Things are like, the product's always better.

1190
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:22,619
I think it's like, they talk about like, you know,

1191
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:25,059
if you go on the Instagram and you get all those, you know,

1192
01:00:25,139 --> 01:00:28,099
you go on a meme thing, it's like, you know,

1193
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:28,739
I don't.

1194
01:00:28,739 --> 01:00:30,480
Think about, you know, Kobe Bryant's always talking,

1195
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:31,719
don't think about the destination.

1196
01:00:32,059 --> 01:00:33,619
It's about the journey.

1197
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:35,099
And I was hopeless at that.

1198
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:38,179
Like, I used to always, it was like, I've got to,

1199
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,760
if I do this thing, I'll get this and then I'll be,

1200
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:43,920
I'll be then I'm a success, right?

1201
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,440
If the show gets to three series, I'm a success.

1202
01:00:46,539 --> 01:00:47,460
Everyone will know I'm a success.

1203
01:00:47,539 --> 01:00:48,239
I'll get more work.

1204
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:50,639
And it got to three series and it's like, okay,

1205
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:52,840
now I've got to get to like, and this happens to everyone.

1206
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,639
Like, it doesn't matter what mountain you climb.

1207
01:00:55,159 --> 01:00:55,900
There's a big one.

1208
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,239
Like, and so.

1209
01:00:57,239 --> 01:00:59,920
So I'm trying to do that.

1210
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,119
And I think the way through that is,

1211
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:06,059
is enjoying the people that you work with.

1212
01:01:06,179 --> 01:01:07,599
And I think you'd probably age helps.

1213
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,800
Like you get to an age and you're like, oh,

1214
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,199
it's actually the, it's actually the people.

1215
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:14,940
And it's the, and so, and then you,

1216
01:01:15,099 --> 01:01:16,500
your ego drops off.

1217
01:01:16,519 --> 01:01:17,239
Like you're, you don't,

1218
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,219
your idea doesn't have to be the best idea.

1219
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:27,179
So I would say that they're the best thing about my career to date.

1220
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:29,079
Has been the collaboration.

1221
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:29,539
Yeah.

1222
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:30,280
Beautifully said.

1223
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,039
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1224
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,380
I think the person that's taught possibly taught me the most is my son,

1225
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:36,639
Ollie.

1226
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:41,539
He's not a leader necessarily, but he,

1227
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:42,940
how old is he?

1228
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,320
He's now 16.

1229
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:46,960
He, so he's not biologically my son,

1230
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,619
but I looked after him.

1231
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:54,119
His father died of brain cancer and I took him on as my son.

1232
01:01:54,199 --> 01:01:55,760
And I see him absolutely as my son.

1233
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:56,239
And he,

1234
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:57,179
he has,

1235
01:01:57,239 --> 01:01:59,639
he has this wonderful disposition that I envy.

1236
01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:04,380
So I think he's taught me the most about how to live life.

1237
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:05,280
He's obviously,

1238
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,179
he's not a leader in the,

1239
01:02:06,219 --> 01:02:07,280
in the sense that what you're,

1240
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:08,739
you're asking me,

1241
01:02:08,739 --> 01:02:11,039
but when he was five years old,

1242
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:13,199
I was driving the car with him and I said,

1243
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:15,960
oh, I must've just been overthinking.

1244
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:16,840
And I said,

1245
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:19,650
oh, I said,

1246
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:19,889
fuck.

1247
01:02:19,889 --> 01:02:21,690
Oh, like what is it with life?

1248
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:23,090
Sometimes it can be huge.

1249
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:23,570
And he goes,

1250
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:26,710
it's just the way life is that it's just the way life is.

1251
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:27,269
And he's five.

1252
01:02:27,269 --> 01:02:27,869
And I was just like,

1253
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:28,110
now,

1254
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:30,269
so I've got this picture of him in my,

1255
01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:32,429
as a five-year-old in my office that just says,

1256
01:02:32,909 --> 01:02:33,969
it's just the way life is.

1257
01:02:33,969 --> 01:02:34,349
And,

1258
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:36,150
and whenever it's like,

1259
01:02:37,989 --> 01:02:39,449
when it's not going my way,

1260
01:02:39,449 --> 01:02:40,289
I just look at that and go,

1261
01:02:41,469 --> 01:02:42,090
it's going to be all right.

1262
01:02:42,329 --> 01:02:43,130
It's brilliant answer.

1263
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:45,429
And I think that is exactly the,

1264
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:47,610
the answer that makes sense.

1265
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:52,610
And I think the thing we like is that you don't have to be a CEO to be a leader.

1266
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:54,690
You don't have to be an adult to be a leader.

1267
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:57,849
Like you learn our own kids teach us enormous amounts that night.

1268
01:02:57,849 --> 01:02:59,030
And as you said,

1269
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:03,349
to see that just someone that had their own tragedy at a young age must be a

1270
01:03:03,349 --> 01:03:04,789
connection you both have there.

1271
01:03:04,789 --> 01:03:05,730
And yeah,

1272
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:06,070
it's a,

1273
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:06,929
it's a brilliant answer,

1274
01:03:06,929 --> 01:03:07,269
isn't it?

1275
01:03:07,269 --> 01:03:07,869
To have that,

1276
01:03:07,869 --> 01:03:08,409
um,

1277
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:09,550
understanding you learn.

1278
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:12,730
And I think that's probably in the past parents didn't did that learn from out

1279
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:13,750
four kids all the time,

1280
01:03:13,969 --> 01:03:14,469
you know,

1281
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:18,550
especially when you get it wrong or you see the way they are able to do things

1282
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:20,170
that I could never have been out to do.

1283
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:20,449
Uh,

1284
01:03:20,449 --> 01:03:21,130
it's a brilliant answer.

1285
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,590
We're obsessed with collaboration in the world of a leader.

1286
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:25,610
And it's been great pleasure as I said,

1287
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:27,730
to have you in that growing community.

1288
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:28,090
And,

1289
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:29,170
and you have,

1290
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:29,650
as I said,

1291
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:32,369
got great collaboration on your answer before meant a lot.

1292
01:03:32,369 --> 01:03:34,929
There's been someone who thought she's on that part of my life.

1293
01:03:34,929 --> 01:03:35,409
I love,

1294
01:03:35,409 --> 01:03:36,730
or that project.

1295
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:36,969
God,

1296
01:03:36,969 --> 01:03:38,829
I'd love to collaborate with anyone in particular.

1297
01:03:38,829 --> 01:03:40,170
Is there a name that springs to mind?

1298
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:42,630
One of my dear friends is Kitty Flanagan.

1299
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:43,510
She's at the moment,

1300
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:44,230
she's doing Fisk,

1301
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:45,309
which is his killing.

1302
01:03:45,309 --> 01:03:45,409
He,

1303
01:03:45,409 --> 01:03:47,590
she does that with a dear friend of mine at the director.

1304
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,469
So I'd love to do more stuff with her again,

1305
01:03:50,469 --> 01:03:51,789
because we used to work together a lot.

1306
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:53,809
I'd love to do more philanthropy,

1307
01:03:53,969 --> 01:03:56,670
like get into more of the stuff that you guys do.

1308
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:57,730
And you know,

1309
01:03:57,730 --> 01:03:59,630
I don't want to make dick jokes the rest of my life.

1310
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:01,150
Like I want to be good to,

1311
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:02,050
I don't know.

1312
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:02,170
I mean,

1313
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:03,170
that's a really good question.

1314
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:04,869
Like Ryan Reynolds would be good.

1315
01:04:04,909 --> 01:04:05,409
He's funny.

1316
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:08,010
You know,

1317
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:08,469
I think,

1318
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:09,429
um,

1319
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:10,230
I'd love to make it.

1320
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:10,909
Yeah.

1321
01:04:10,909 --> 01:04:13,489
I'd love to make a F like a narrative series or a film.

1322
01:04:13,489 --> 01:04:13,730
So,

1323
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:14,070
you know,

1324
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:15,969
if rusty Russell Crowe's listening,

1325
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:17,550
he'll be listening.

1326
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:18,110
He'd be listening.

1327
01:04:18,369 --> 01:04:18,730
He'd love it.

1328
01:04:18,909 --> 01:04:19,690
And that's the beauty of it.

1329
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:20,170
I love,

1330
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:20,769
uh,

1331
01:04:20,769 --> 01:04:21,489
again,

1332
01:04:21,489 --> 01:04:21,710
yeah,

1333
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:23,349
your answers are well thought out and,

1334
01:04:23,409 --> 01:04:26,050
and they come from a place of just genuine honesty.

1335
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:27,730
And it's refreshing to hear.

1336
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:30,309
And I appreciate you being so open and honest.

1337
01:04:30,309 --> 01:04:33,550
You had more than a fair share of hurdles to jump through,

1338
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:36,329
but to see the way you've been able to connect with people.

1339
01:04:36,329 --> 01:04:36,829
And,

1340
01:04:36,829 --> 01:04:37,110
um,

1341
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:37,989
I've really loved it.

1342
01:04:37,989 --> 01:04:38,909
Lots to learn from,

1343
01:04:38,909 --> 01:04:39,550
uh,

1344
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:40,349
our catch up today,

1345
01:04:40,349 --> 01:04:40,530
mate.

1346
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:41,610
Thanks for joining me on your desk.

1347
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:45,369
