00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:12,259
Our next guest coming up on the Empowering Leaders podcast is the legendary Christine

2
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:17,379
Corsi, the principal of Rudy Hill High for the past 25 years, an educator that has been

3
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:21,339
celebrated or needs to be celebrated more, in my opinion.

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,300
The singular focus on ATAR that happens a lot in schools is a topic that I discuss,

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,760
which I think will be of interest to many parents.

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,140
And her idea of building our kids into being meaningful contributors in society and focusing

7
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,820
on our kids in school as a whole person and not just guided towards a score at the end

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,520
of year 12.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,100
It's more than a mark.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,840
It's more than an ATAR score.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,240
It's around the skills and capabilities they can bring to the table.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,060
But it's also about their capacity to be contributing citizens, to be self-regulated in situations,

13
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,420
to manage the challenges they face.

14
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,899
And by golly, they face a few at the moment.

15
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:12,909
It's a conversation I loved.

16
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:18,049
And ties in very closely to the passion that I have for the work that we're doing at Alita.

17
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,230
If you're motivated to improve your leadership journey or start your leadership journey,

18
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:27,510
I'd love you to check out our Alita Connect signature program, which brings leaders together

19
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:34,049
from sport, industry, social venture, education, the arts, into bespoke facilitated forums

20
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,109
where leaders are coming together to connect, to learn, and to share in what we think is

21
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:39,549
a pretty life-changing way.

22
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:42,409
I hope you enjoyed this chat with Christine Corsi.

23
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:46,590
A remarkable Australian who has made a huge difference in the world of education.

24
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,819
Christine, I've been really wanting to celebrate Australian educators in a more meaningful way.

25
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,700
And I think probably to say congratulations.

26
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,760
It's a lifetime of contribution that you've made in this space.

27
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:00,599
Oh, thanks, Luke.

28
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,939
And I'm always very nervous of that term legend because one normally only hears it in sport.

29
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,139
And that's just before somebody else decides they're not.

30
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,039
I think it's a term to use with great care.

31
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,300
Well, I think it's a term to use with great care.

32
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,099
I think it's an accurate term in terms of when you look at your contribution.

33
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,099
And I wanted to set the scene a little bit around your school, Rudy Hill High, where

34
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:26,819
you've been for the last 25 years, just to give people an understanding of the setting.

35
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,900
And please correct me if this is not accurate, but some research that I found, children attending

36
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,960
Rudy Hill High School have a higher chance of having a parent experiencing unemployment

37
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,840
or facing unemployment themselves when they leave school.

38
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,960
They start school with higher rates of social and learning vulnerability and attend primary

39
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,240
schools with NAPLAN schools.

40
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,539
In fact, 80% of students start year seven below grade average for the state.

41
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,819
Rudy Hill High School has 1,100 students from year seven to 12.

42
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,199
55% are from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.

43
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,819
5% Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.

44
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,060
And 25% come from the lowest quotient of socio-educational disadvantage.

45
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,860
Now, Christine, you read that and it sounds like the recipe for the most challenging educational

46
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,180
environment you could imagine.

47
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,280
Yet Rudy Hill High is considered the most challenging educational environment in the

48
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:14,439
world.

49
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:17,960
And it's consistently the high watermark for great education in Australia.

50
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,560
How have you done it?

51
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:20,860
What's the secret to your success?

52
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:23,879
Well, first of all, I suppose it depends how you measure it.

53
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:33,300
And we are always on any measure, one to 1.5 standard deviations below the average.

54
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,039
But, you know, that's okay because it's an average.

55
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:44,099
And as we know from, you and I know from footy, there's a top eight on the table.

56
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,900
And then there's the bottom, there's the bottom lot.

57
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:49,979
So whatever's the average, some are going to be above and some are below.

58
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,439
We don't always understand that.

59
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,960
That doesn't mean that young people don't grow and thrive and make progress, which is

60
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,800
such a critical part of education and yet not well understood.

61
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,319
Parents want to know how their child's progressing.

62
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,259
We want to know about progress.

63
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:14,060
For us, the progress is in our, at the post-school destinations that our students,

64
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:20,060
take, and we track them for quite a while after they've left, but also where do our

65
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,300
alumni, those ex-students, end up going, where do they end up being?

66
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,980
And I think that's probably a pretty important part of it too.

67
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:36,220
Many of them go on to have incredibly happy and successful lives, and some don't.

68
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:43,579
And that is true of every school in the country, no matter what the socioeconomic background.

69
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:43,600
Yeah.

70
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:51,240
What our parents share in common, in my view, is something that's probably true of greater

71
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,620
Western Sydney as well.

72
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,800
And that is that the majority of parents, particularly those whose children arrive at

73
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,000
school below grade average, anywhere you like, they want their children to have better than

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,439
they had.

75
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:11,379
And when you work with aspirational communities and parents who want their children to have

76
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:13,620
better than they had, it generally happens.

77
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,660
And what some people call, you know, 55% non-English speaking background, so often presented

78
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,519
as a deficit, by golly, when they're applying for jobs and they've left school, the fact

79
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,980
that they speak two or three languages, nobody sees that as a deficit.

80
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:35,519
And particularly our big global companies, they see having multiple languages and being

81
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,660
able to live and work in global communities as a big asset indeed.

82
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,300
So I think sometimes we get stuck with the big macro picture.

83
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:44,019
Yeah.

84
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:44,079
Yeah.

85
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:44,100
Yeah.

86
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,980
Without looking, that within that picture, there's 1,100 journeys every year and there's

87
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,779
a couple of hundred students graduate every year and they've had a learning journey, which

88
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:58,360
hopefully has allowed them to make progress and do the best that they can because we gave

89
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,379
them the best opportunity they could have.

90
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,540
And Chris, I love your first answer.

91
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,959
Immediately you said, well, how are we assessing that?

92
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,120
I asked you what the key to success and reading in preparation for this, it sounds like you've

93
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,660
got an obsession with, you know, assessment for students.

94
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,180
You know, assessment for the school, assessment for the community.

95
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,620
You love to measure and research what you're doing.

96
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,540
Is that one of the keys, as you said, that you've got to constantly be understanding

97
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,920
what the improvements are and how you can get better?

98
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:27,560
Yeah.

99
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:33,079
I'm what they would call an older teacher at this stage.

100
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,279
I started teaching in the 70s and there was a very famous, well, famous in certainly in

101
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,480
Australia, Alan Luke was one of our best academics in assessment.

102
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:43,579
And I remember him.

103
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:49,720
I remember he said in the 70s, we'll be 50 years before we even begin to understand what

104
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,459
types of assessment we need to have for our students.

105
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:58,720
I think sometimes what happens is that people might think it'll be really good to have this

106
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,079
target.

107
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,600
Let's set this target, you know, a bit like your good old KPIs.

108
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:08,160
Let's set these KPIs, make the top eight, for example, make the KPIs.

109
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,560
But in reality, because we're talking about young people.

110
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:17,180
The human beings, they're not units of productivity.

111
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,459
And how we measure their work, it's more than it's more than a mark.

112
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,180
It's more than an ATAR score.

113
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,600
It's around the skills and capabilities they can bring to the table.

114
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:37,300
But it's also about their capacity to be contributing citizens, to be self-regulated

115
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,500
in situations, to manage the challenges they face.

116
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,959
And by golly, they face a few at the moment.

117
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:46,980
And so, Chris, is that I think you hear the word assessment and sometimes people have

118
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,339
the hair stand on the back of their neck because your mind immediately goes to right and wrong

119
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:52,259
and a written test.

120
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,639
And, you know, I'm going to be subjected to the potential to fail.

121
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,860
But you're saying it's in the nuance, to use the word of the times, around assessing

122
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,600
the right things.

123
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,579
And you gave a great list there, didn't you, around greater capabilities.

124
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,439
I hear the word student agency a lot in your language that I've read and students needing

125
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,000
a sense of themselves as learners.

126
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,519
Is that what we should be assessing more?

127
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:18,639
So let me ask you, come back with the question I asked our school just after our first run

128
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,100
of COVID.

129
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,240
I thought I might just ask the school some questions.

130
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:26,120
And the question I asked was, are you old enough?

131
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,420
And that's a really important question to ask because people always say, oh, those children

132
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,799
aren't old enough to do that.

133
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,399
I mean, this weekend is splendour in the grass and you have to take someone, an adult with

134
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,679
you.

135
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,559
Is an adult your 19-year-old brother or is it your 47-year-old dad?

136
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,360
I don't know the answer to that question.

137
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,940
I certainly have a view.

138
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:52,320
This notion that when you ask how old are you, are you old enough?

139
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,159
During COVID, we had year six students making their own applications for high school.

140
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:05,659
We had some of our students in years 9, 10, 11 and 12 working right through COVID because

141
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:07,039
fast food continued.

142
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:09,679
So did COVID out of all those super spreader places.

143
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,440
But fast food continued.

144
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:13,440
They were working sometimes.

145
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,399
Because their parents couldn't, because the industries they worked in closed during lockdown.

146
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,220
So are you old enough?

147
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,200
We asked to do all these kinds of things.

148
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,840
And when you come back to it, are you old enough to care for your mum who got very sick

149
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,580
with COVID?

150
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,659
And then you were put into isolation with your two brothers and sisters and your mum was

151
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:34,539
still really sick.

152
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:36,840
Were you old enough to look after your brothers and sisters?

153
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:43,399
And I think we have a rather romanticised view of the life of young people in that we assume

154
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:46,440
that they don't have these challenges.

155
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,360
And what do you mean by student agency first and foremost, for people to understand that?

156
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,639
Agency is when you own something.

157
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:59,899
So you own your own learning, you own your own progress, you know it and understand it.

158
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,919
You are the agent of the decisions that are made.

159
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,139
Now, I'm not dismissing the importance of parents.

160
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,799
One of the huge challenges in our culture and community at the moment, and this is true across a number of countries, is the fact that parents are not the only ones who are the most important part of the decision-making process.

161
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,360
And this is true across a number of countries.

162
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,000
And this is true across a number of countries.

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,320
And this is true across a number of OECD countries, is people feel the need to helicopter their children.

164
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,440
Some feel the need to black hawk them.

165
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:30,759
So, you know, so they're helping their students, their sons and daughters, correct year 11 and 12 homework.

166
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:33,919
But that's not the job of the parent.

167
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:41,960
And what we have to be able to do is have our young people take the ownership, therefore the agency, to be able to do their own work.

168
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:49,440
And part of the challenge is that for some families, very unrealistic expectations have been set.

169
00:10:49,440 --> 00:11:00,000
And I see this quite a bit when we work with other sectors that, you know, that the child has to achieve a top band or a top grade all the time.

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:09,840
And the problem is that when you're based on things on averages, only about 10% are going to achieve that top grade or that top band.

171
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,039
And what happens is that when you're based on things on averages, only about 10% are going to achieve that top grade or that top band.

172
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:10,080
And what happens is that when you're based on things on averages, only about 10% are going to achieve that top grade or that top band.

173
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,100
And what happens is that when you're based on things on averages, only about 10% are going to achieve that top grade or that top band.

174
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,120
And what happens is that when you're based on things on averages, only about 10% are going to achieve that top grade or that top band.

175
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,720
and what happens is that you then diminish all of the rest

176
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,460
of the work and the effort that that student put

177
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,779
into improving their skills.

178
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:23,799
So I often tell the story of one of our students who got what would

179
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:27,500
be described as in most places a pretty average ATAR,

180
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:32,679
somewhere in the low 70s, and popped off to university

181
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:35,919
as you do and actually studied something he was pretty

182
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,779
interested in, podiatry.

183
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:42,840
He has already now completed both his honours and his masters,

184
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,440
working with remote Aboriginal communities on his masters

185
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,220
around the particular issues of good foot care when you're

186
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,519
in remote communities and being able to do that.

187
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:56,980
And now he's commenced a PhD in public health policy.

188
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,879
And I don't actually think he ever thinks of himself as somebody

189
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,899
who only got a 70-something or other ATAR.

190
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:07,500
And I think, you know, it's a bit like getting

191
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:07,759
a driver's license.

192
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:10,200
It's really important until you've got one.

193
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,379
And if students can pursue their passions and their interests

194
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:17,799
and their talents, they don't all have to be good at everything.

195
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,860
They have to be good at those things where they're going

196
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,019
to take them and make their life happen with them,

197
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,299
and not just their employment, but also those other things

198
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:27,159
they want to do.

199
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:32,299
You know, is it wrong at 16 to want to be a top AFL player?

200
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,720
I think it's a perfectly acceptable pathway to really want,

201
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,720
but it requires...

202
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:39,379
It requires hours of work and practice.

203
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:44,360
Where do we write down when those students finish year 12?

204
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:48,399
Where do we write down, this student is going to be a top AFL player

205
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,000
because this student has this, resilience, capacity to recover

206
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,399
from injury, determination on the field, eye-hand coordination

207
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:00,299
well beyond the average.

208
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:02,500
We don't write those things down, do we?

209
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,379
But perhaps we should.

210
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,200
It's a great thought, Chris.

211
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,740
And I love it because the language is around,

212
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,059
and we always hear about this at schools, find your passion,

213
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:17,980
find your hat to put your hook on, and we'll support that.

214
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,059
And I think sometimes that's spoken a lot, it's harder to deliver on.

215
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,059
I want to come back to ATAR.

216
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:24,759
There was a quote that I saw you share,

217
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,500
training kids to succeed in knowledge tests is a very different process

218
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,440
than teaching them to understand the world and become curious

219
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,480
about learning more.

220
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,519
As a parent, I'm talking about me from a parent of four,

221
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,120
there is this sense that I've got...

222
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,360
that schools do focus singly on ATAR too much.

223
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,419
They talk a game that they don't, but you see all their advertising,

224
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:47,960
particularly the big private schools, we're in the top 1% or the top 3%,

225
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,799
and have a look at our high tier.

226
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,879
That becomes the billboards that they advertise through.

227
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:56,600
Do you see that singular focus on ATAR as a problem?

228
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,360
I don't think it's...

229
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,980
But I don't think it's the school's fault.

230
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,940
I do see that a singular focus on any one score anywhere

231
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:14,120
can be quite problematic, but what I am pleased to see is that many

232
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,899
of our universities now are looking at not alternative entry pathways,

233
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,440
but actually alternative ways of assessing the entry pathway.

234
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,440
And it seems to me that it's a bit of a challenge where the ATAR single score,

235
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,539
it's so easy, isn't it?

236
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,679
You know, just rank the school, how many ATARs above this did you get on?

237
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,039
But in reality, what does it actually do?

238
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:37,620
What does it actually mean?

239
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,580
It's very heavily statistically manipulated.

240
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,539
So we could start with the...

241
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:48,759
So I won't speak for all states, but in New South Wales and Victoria

242
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:53,440
with the BCE and HSC arrangements, you know, you sit an exam.

243
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,200
That exam is going to be marked by somebody.

244
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,399
If it's 8 o'clock at night and they've taken a break for a coffee

245
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,659
and you're feeling really tired, might they see your result as as good

246
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:05,539
or not quite so good?

247
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:07,019
So there's a bit of potential in the marking.

248
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,720
There was the question, where the question's fair.

249
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,960
There's one question got language that a lot of the kids didn't understand.

250
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:13,320
Maybe the question's not so good.

251
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,659
Blah, blah, blah.

252
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,100
And then we get the mark and then you moderate them all

253
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,539
and then it's moderated against the whatever.

254
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:22,159
Well, in Victoria, it's the bell curve, which is, of course,

255
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,379
incredibly dangerous, at least in New South Wales.

256
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:30,559
We have cut off points based on the overall performance of the cohort.

257
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,720
But then what happens from there is, and then that's all thrown

258
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
into a big software melting pot.

259
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,799
And then it's re-sorted.

260
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,559
So how did the students in physics go?

261
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:44,840
Well, they went like this.

262
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:47,139
So physics will be given this weighting.

263
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,679
And how did the students in English go?

264
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,080
They'll be given this.

265
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,220
And then we combine it all together and then we create a single score from it.

266
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:04,019
Any statistician, only a relatively smart person knows that it's a proxy

267
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,019
at the best for how students score.

268
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:09,759
And that's what maths did, because it's actually statistically

269
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,519
heavily moderated all the way through, allowing for mistakes,

270
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,980
allowing for discrepancy.

271
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,240
A student, for example, could miss out on a 90 plus ATAR,

272
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,120
making a mistake on a two-mark question in maths.

273
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,720
So these things can, and these things, if they become too important

274
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,240
in our heads, they become the purpose of going to school.

275
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:37,019
But the purpose of going to school is to do the goals of education,

276
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:42,919
to find academic improvement, and then to contribute to society,

277
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:46,220
to be an active citizen, to be well self-regulated,

278
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,519
to be able to be part of community.

279
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,320
And I think sometimes we have a lot to learn from our First Nations people.

280
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,860
Being part of community is such a critical piece.

281
00:16:58,899 --> 00:16:59,960
Beating everybody else?

282
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:02,360
Well, of course there are going to be times when we want

283
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,659
to beat everybody else.

284
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:06,039
That's part of life too.

285
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:08,599
But is the ATAR the right way to score it?

286
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,059
I think it has some purposes in triangulating other data

287
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:19,779
that we've got, but as the only score, I think it's not robust enough

288
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:21,099
for what we need in this country.

289
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,000
We keep talking about how badly our students are doing,

290
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:25,460
but it's a norm reference test.

291
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:26,700
It's got an average.

292
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,259
It's got a little bell curve.

293
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,400
We actually don't know.

294
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,180
What if our students, in fact, were amongst the top performers

295
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,799
in the world?

296
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,880
It's just we're not playing.

297
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,660
We're not playing the world in the HSC or the VCA.

298
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,500
It's a good question and an interesting thought, Christelle.

299
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:44,660
My mind was going to a story that I read a few years back

300
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:49,319
around issues that medicine entrants were having,

301
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:52,920
or in fact the medical faculty themselves were finding

302
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,480
that because the top ATAR was the score that got you into medicine,

303
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,319
that a lot of students were finding themselves in medicine,

304
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,299
not because they had a passion to want to be a doctor so much,

305
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,759
but because their family saw that as the outcome,

306
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,039
for getting the best score.

307
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:09,259
And what that was not taking into account

308
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:10,720
is some of the things you're talking about.

309
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,940
You know, medicine's got huge importance

310
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,359
on emotional intelligence and bedside manner and care

311
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:18,920
and sense of purpose for wanting to do that.

312
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,200
And so you might have been able to read the chart really well,

313
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,180
but if you haven't got the empathy to deliver it,

314
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,519
you're not maybe going to be suited to medicine.

315
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,480
So maybe that's an extreme example.

316
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,460
But I think all parents, you said before,

317
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:32,700
that's not parents' role.

318
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,859
I mean, for me, you know, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on it.

319
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,660
As a parent, I feel our role is just to give our kids as much love

320
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,059
and support to find whatever passion they can and support whatever that is

321
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:47,539
to be the best version of themselves is how I think about our role as parents.

322
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,559
What do you, as a principal, what do you want from the parent community?

323
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,859
Something that we already, I like to think we have most of the time,

324
00:18:55,059 --> 00:19:00,140
and that's a fairly high level of trust, that the experts,

325
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:05,839
and they are experts, who are teaching your sons or daughters,

326
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,599
that the experts really do know what the, and I think COVID showed that.

327
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,279
Most parents, no matter what their background,

328
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:16,119
did not want to teach their own children.

329
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:19,900
There are some parents who could, and they did, and they did a great job,

330
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,859
and they got lots of media articles about them.

331
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:26,180
But the majority of parents wanted an expert to be teaching their children,

332
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,920
particularly in secondary education.

333
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,180
So that's one thing I like to think for.

334
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:33,339
But the other thing that I think is very important,

335
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,059
and this is more across the country,

336
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,380
is the, a lot of our students actually take vocational pathways.

337
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,960
Some of them do them concurrent with university.

338
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:46,259
Some of them do them first and then do uni.

339
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:51,359
Because around about 40% of students who don't go to university initially,

340
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,160
go to university as an adult later on for some purpose.

341
00:19:56,019 --> 00:20:00,299
There's a piece of research done by the National Council for Voc Ed Research.

342
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,640
And they, that showed that a boy who was average, above average ability,

343
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:12,359
and it is gendered, who took a trade pathway would be likely

344
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:19,079
to have a higher income, better health outcomes, and better opportunities

345
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:23,579
for owning their own homes or whatever than a young man going to university.

346
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,740
And they do it without a hex debt.

347
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:32,559
The kinds of communities where I work, families can be quite risk averse and debt averse.

348
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:35,759
Because debt is a really big, you know, you can be homeless,

349
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:38,480
pretty quickly if you become, if you fall into debt.

350
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,279
So, one of the things that I think is important is to understand that there are,

351
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,980
every pathway can be valuable.

352
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,279
Sometimes in this country, we've dismissed the value.

353
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,599
The Germans have the best manufacturing sector in the world,

354
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,019
and an absolutely high-end, fine precision manufacturing.

355
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,779
We have a bit of it here, but they are the best in the world.

356
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,740
And one of the reasons that I believe that that happens is because around about 40%

357
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,559
of their students automatically choose to take a trade pathway,

358
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:14,759
to take a vocational pathway, to take a pathway that goes directly

359
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,799
into that kind of practice.

360
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:20,140
Now, many of them, of course, also then will need higher qualifications.

361
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:24,720
But I think it's a really, we made perhaps some mistakes in the 90s,

362
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:27,440
thinking everybody had to go to university.

363
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,440
Everyone had to complete year 12.

364
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,019
Everyone had to go to university.

365
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,920
I don't know that that's necessarily been a really good thing.

366
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,180
I think it's a really good thing.

367
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,500
I think it's a really good thing.

368
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:35,680
I think it's a really good thing.

369
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:35,720
I think it's a really good thing.

370
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,119
It's a really good thing for us in the long term.

371
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:41,680
Yeah, you raise another interesting question, Chris, and I'm not surprised.

372
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,000
I look at all the big private schools that don't produce any trades.

373
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:47,500
Why is that?

374
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:51,000
I think you might have given us some clues there that that's not the pathway.

375
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:55,079
Surely there was, out of the thousands of kids that attend the big private,

376
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,920
surely there was some that were passionate about pursuing a trade or born to do it.

377
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,660
It was in their DNA.

378
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,160
Why aren't we producing them is a question that I think you probably just raised

379
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,500
fairly accurately.

380
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:11,319
I want to transition to a topic that when I spoke to you on the phone in preparation for this,

381
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,740
it's the most popular TED talk I think ever.

382
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:15,359
It's had 75 million views.

383
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:20,440
You know the one I'm talking about was Sir Ken Robinson who passed away in recent times.

384
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:25,099
The title of the podcast, sorry, of the TED talk, if you haven't heard it, it's called,

385
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,920
the question is, do schools kill creativity?

386
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,400
I look at the amount of people that view that and I think we all care about education.

387
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,640
One, it's a really entertaining speech.

388
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:35,319
So it's worth.

389
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:38,960
Having a look if you haven't seen it, but it shows to me, you put education up.

390
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,140
All of us have got thoughts on it.

391
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,519
All of us care about it.

392
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,880
We've all, you know, a lot of us have got kids that we care passionately about.

393
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,319
How do you think about that?

394
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:50,660
He says in that speech that he thinks creativity is as important as literacy.

395
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,019
Do you agree with that?

396
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,400
Well, I actually do.

397
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:56,220
And I have seen it several times.

398
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,740
However, I don't agree with him that schools kill creativity.

399
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:05,279
I think, in fact, for some children, schools are the most creative places they are.

400
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:12,279
They have opportunities to do things that they would that might be outside the experience

401
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:15,519
of the adults with whom they normally spend their time.

402
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:23,579
And in fact, I commend back to you a book by Bill Lucas, who's at Winchester

403
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,279
and the Real Schools Education.

404
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:34,500
Bill's book is actually on creativity and the capability of creativity and Rooty Hill High

405
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,140
Schools.

406
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:41,200
Working creativity is actually featured on the back page in our creativity wheel because

407
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,059
we actually agree with you.

408
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:46,420
Literacy, numeracy, critical and creative thinking.

409
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,440
Pretty much you got those.

410
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:51,299
You can pretty much do everything, pretty much do everything else.

411
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:54,440
Maybe not play top AFL, but pretty much do everything else.

412
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,279
My view would be, though, that top AFL also requires a very high level of creativity.

413
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:04,079
And Bill and his colleagues.

414
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:10,839
Actually work to identify five what they call dispositions of creativity with 15

415
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:18,559
sub dispositions, and they're the ones that were used by the OECD to underpin the PISA,

416
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:24,799
which is the international testing that's done at year 9, 10 level, depending what country

417
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,200
you're in.

418
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,400
They actually designed a creativity assessment, creative and critical thinking assessment

419
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:31,900
tool.

420
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,079
And some of the.

421
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,039
Some of those tools have been used in the Victorian system.

422
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,839
But yes, it can.

423
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:47,079
I think if Croneback said that if if an item exists in any amount.

424
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,799
Then that amount can be measured.

425
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,079
And so it's just about how, again, coming back to how you choose to measure it, but I

426
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:02,599
believe I don't think schools do kill creativity, I think sometimes curriculum

427
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,039
standardisation.

428
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:09,839
And mandated policies make it a little trickier.

429
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:17,839
But the great Scottish academic, Macbeth said, principals need to be deeply subversive.

430
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:25,960
Take those mandated policies, take those documents, take those curriculum and then do what is

431
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,920
best for the students in their schools.

432
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,759
I love the way that you express that.

433
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:32,680
And I think you're right.

434
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,640
I love your glass half full.

435
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,440
And I think that's what you're thinking, too, because it's what you're clearly living.

436
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,680
And I had a look at the creativity wheel in preparation for this.

437
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:45,000
And you go and teach other teachers in other educational settings on how to achieve what

438
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,759
you're achieving.

439
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:51,119
And again, as you said, I love you see opportunity in the challenge and the diversity that you

440
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:54,720
have every day in Western Sydney and what you've been able to do with that.

441
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
I suppose setting by setting, isn't it?

442
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,400
It needs to come to life with great leadership, and that is what you've done at the helm of

443
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,839
your school for 25 years.

444
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:05,359
It can come from any point.

445
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:10,119
If you're in a big jurisdiction like ours, sometimes really creative things come from

446
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,079
the centre.

447
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,759
And sometimes they come from the school.

448
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:18,240
And sometimes they come in the middle, where a group of folk get together and share ideas.

449
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,259
And then suddenly we're doing something quite different and working quite differently because

450
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:24,019
it works.

451
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:32,240
And it's interesting because we talk a lot about evidence-informed practice in education.

452
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,720
And one of the things I think we need to say is what evidence, because it's nice to be

453
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:44,799
able to say, oh, this policy is in evidence-informed, yeah, but what evidence informed it?

454
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,359
And I do think that one of the great important things of leadership is to be able to ask

455
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,359
good questions.

456
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:56,759
You need to, don't just sit there and accept that just because somebody said it was evidence-informed

457
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:01,200
that that evidence might actually be useful at all, because it could on occasions be complete

458
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
rubbish.

459
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,259
So not all evidence is equal, Chris.

460
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:05,420
No.

461
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:06,920
Of course it's not.

462
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:07,920
Of course it's not.

463
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,440
And I think that's a great sign of our times, too.

464
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:14,359
And I'm diverging here in interesting ways.

465
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:18,839
We've come out of an interesting time where, you know, what does research mean in certain

466
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:19,140
settings?

467
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,299
What does it mean in medical settings?

468
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,559
Where is that research backed by?

469
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:24,519
Who's funding particular research?

470
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:30,500
I suppose, you know, it almost feels like a new currency is going to be truth, isn't

471
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,279
it, in some ways?

472
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,160
Because we have got...

473
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,400
We've got a lot of misinformation to deal with out there.

474
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,619
There is a sport in misinformation.

475
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,519
So how do we teach the next generation to work their way through that?

476
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:41,960
I mean, that's an interesting question as well.

477
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:43,380
I think so.

478
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:48,579
And what's really interesting is that Norway took this challenge on a couple of years ago.

479
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:58,160
And it is now reported that Norwegian young people have the best fake news meters in the

480
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,079
world because the Norwegian government thought that it was...

481
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,759
It's critical that all of their young people understood when they were working with social

482
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:14,500
media where the information came from and, indeed, what biases were included.

483
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,519
So they've done quite a bit of work on that.

484
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:22,279
I think it's an area where we're starting to dip our toes in the water, but we will

485
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,519
obviously need to do more.

486
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:29,000
And controlling Twitter or Facebook or TikTok or Instagram isn't going to be the answer.

487
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:32,059
It's actually giving students the skills to know.

488
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:36,099
So when do you decide not to upload that photo?

489
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:43,420
Because it might come back 20 years later in your portfolio when you're going for some

490
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,000
important job that you want to think you want to get.

491
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:49,960
I mean, I have to ask you that question.

492
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:53,759
I mean, it's the ultimate question I think us as parents are dealing with and you as

493
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:59,039
educators too is that that massive change in the landscape, isn't it, with access to

494
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,019
those mediums that you just mentioned, TikTok and Instagram and Twitter.

495
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:05,799
And Facebook and the next one's, you know, only around the corner.

496
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:07,160
I mean, what are the skills?

497
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:09,859
Do you think it's just education around using them appropriately?

498
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,319
You're not going to control?

499
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,920
Do you have measures that around the amount of time?

500
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:16,660
Have you seen real challenges around that?

501
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:23,319
One of the academics at Sydney University who talked about the parents buy these devices,

502
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:31,660
were they informed when they bought them for their children that about what was going to

503
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:31,920
happen?

504
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,220
Or did they do it because it seemed like a good thing at the time?

505
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:40,319
It was like the, you know, next round of children's toys.

506
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,960
Did it seem like it was going to be okay?

507
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:51,079
And I think like with any massive innovation, and this is one of them, it does take time

508
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:53,500
to learn how to manage it.

509
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,559
I have, one of the great things about working at Rudy Hill is our fantastic community.

510
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:01,180
And I can remember too.

511
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,960
Two mums bringing their year 7s up and we said something about we really wanted to limit

512
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,900
the mobile phone.

513
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:13,779
Well, did I get an education on what you do to limit mobile phone use at home at night?

514
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:18,140
My child will never be on at 2am because this is what happens in our house.

515
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:21,240
It wasn't really but it was almost like a game.

516
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,940
Everybody in the house put their, they had a lock box in the kitchen.

517
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,700
Everybody in the house put it on everybody in the house who was over the age of 12.

518
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,500
In the house that they were working in.

519
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:36,059
the age of 12 had one night a week or one or two nights a week

520
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:39,519
where their phone was on for emergency, for alarm,

521
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,059
for this sort of thing, but everybody else had theirs

522
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:44,700
and everybody modelled it.

523
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,779
Now, these were two pretty ferocious mums.

524
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:50,059
I was very admiring.

525
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:54,000
But they had already made up their mind what they wanted

526
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,079
and they didn't want their children up with their blue screens at 2am

527
00:30:57,079 --> 00:31:01,079
and then exhausted through the day because they weren't getting any sleep.

528
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:04,400
I do really think that is a parent call.

529
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,680
So I said to you, teaching students and correcting their work is our work,

530
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:13,140
but actually giving your sons and daughters a really good example

531
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,160
of how to do it and how to manage social media.

532
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:17,720
And, look, all of us have been caught.

533
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,819
I don't know any adult that's not been caught sometime following something

534
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:23,859
and then realising it was a complete scam.

535
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:30,740
And I do think that talking about the risks with our kids is really important.

536
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,220
And talking about, you know, telling kind of the stories,

537
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:36,099
but without necessarily frightening them.

538
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,380
Because some of them are incredibly skilled themselves

539
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,079
at knowing what's a scam and what's not a scam.

540
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,759
I look at my two daughters and they're now,

541
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:48,380
they had phones in the later part of high school

542
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,799
and they're now in their, one's 29 and one's in her early 30s.

543
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,839
They are so skilled compared to me.

544
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,259
I'm much more likely to make a stupid mistake.

545
00:31:58,779 --> 00:31:59,759
They don't make mistakes.

546
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:00,759
They are very...

547
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,099
They are very astute users of the platform.

548
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:08,380
But, Luke, if you wanted to talk about the one that I think is worrying parents

549
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,240
and certainly worrying educators and health professionals a lot,

550
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,339
and that's vaping.

551
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:13,759
Really?

552
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,180
Yeah.

553
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,539
You're saying that as a bigger challenge again than the social media platforms?

554
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:20,079
I don't know that it's a bigger challenge,

555
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,440
but I think it's really quite dangerous

556
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,680
and it's been sold in very particular ways.

557
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:30,680
And I think it's the next...

558
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,660
It's the next piece that we're going to have to learn to manage

559
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:38,339
because it's been sold as something that would calm your children down

560
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:43,259
and particularly adolescents who are feeling a bit anxious,

561
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:44,640
particularly after COVID.

562
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,279
You know, this will help you feel a bit calmer.

563
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,839
It's been sold in a very particular way

564
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:52,940
and it's a very...

565
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,680
They're very addictive.

566
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:57,500
And the research is horrible on the outcomes already that you're seeing.

567
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,759
Again, I love your question.

568
00:32:58,859 --> 00:32:59,519
My mind's...

569
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,480
You know, before I make a statement, I'm thinking,

570
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,619
I'm thinking about it more thoughtfully than I would

571
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:05,880
as, you know, where's the evidence from?

572
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:07,460
But I think the evidence is overwhelming

573
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,440
that that is not a great thing for your lungs and your health.

574
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:13,039
I mean, you're selling them, as you said, in bubblegum flavour

575
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,640
and, you know, clearly your target market is very young

576
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,519
given that that is the case.

577
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,500
So, as you said, there's always another emerging challenge

578
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:25,400
for parents and for educators at the same time.

579
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:27,920
I started the conversation, Chris, by saying, you know,

580
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,099
the idea of celebrating teachers more is something that I feel

581
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,500
passionate about and, you know, a story that I think of a lot.

582
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,000
I was in Switzerland many years ago with my fiancée, now wife,

583
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,960
and we were meeting my brother-in-law for the first time

584
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,079
and his partner at the time had just graduated university

585
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:47,880
and she was clearly the smartest person in the region,

586
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,339
one of the smartest people I've ever met.

587
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,019
I think she'd got first-class honours

588
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:53,859
and could have done anything in the world.

589
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,059
And the word came through.

590
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:57,259
The day we were there, I met my brother-in-law for the first time,

591
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,019
future brother-in-law, and we sat down with her family.

592
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:00,619
She was...

593
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:01,019
She was...

594
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,279
It was Swiss-German and the word came through,

595
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:06,619
she'd been accepted as a teacher.

596
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,619
The celebration for the family and the respect and the...

597
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:11,820
I was blown away by.

598
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,820
It was like that is the highest honour you could have.

599
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,440
I feel like in this part of the world,

600
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,500
we don't get that anywhere near that level.

601
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:21,119
Is that your experience?

602
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,340
And have you got a theory on why?

603
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:25,679
Well, I not only have theory, but thanks to my...

604
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,960
Thanks to academic colleague, Nicole Mockler,

605
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:31,340
we now have evidence because she has just done a piece

606
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,320
of research that's recently been published

607
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:40,300
on the way that teachers are presented in the image

608
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,960
and the brand, if you like to use that term, in the media.

609
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,079
And she looked at over nearly 150,000 media pieces

610
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:54,400
about teachers in this country and 95% of them were negative.

611
00:34:55,559 --> 00:35:01,280
So the question I often ask myself is why in Australia,

612
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,739
are teachers, and particularly women,

613
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:07,820
because 80% of the teaching workforce is women,

614
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:12,519
why are teachers and women something

615
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:15,940
that the media thinks can be attacked?

616
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:20,639
Now, when I was a much younger person,

617
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,159
the media spent a lot of time attacking teenagers.

618
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,420
You were either a victim or a perpetrator.

619
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,940
They're a lot more sensitive with that now

620
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,239
because it's blown up.

621
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,300
So many times.

622
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:34,380
But the question would be,

623
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:37,440
for what purpose would we be attacking teachers?

624
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:41,139
And I think there are some very deliberate

625
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,320
and political purposes around that.

626
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:47,940
But the long-term damage that is being done

627
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,300
is damage that can never be taken back.

628
00:35:53,579 --> 00:36:00,500
And I'm happy to say this publicly and in when...

629
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,219
I think it's 20...

630
00:36:01,219 --> 00:36:02,219
I'm happy to say this publicly and in when...

631
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:03,219
I think it's 20 years ago,

632
00:36:03,219 --> 00:36:04,119
in 2008, Rupert Murdoch gave the Boyer Lectures.

633
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,960
They're the ones that, you know,

634
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:08,039
they're pretty famous lectures given every year.

635
00:36:08,659 --> 00:36:11,460
And although none of his children went to school in Australia

636
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,539
and none of them attended public education,

637
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:20,280
he presented a thesis there about public education

638
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,539
and the rabid, you know, nature of us and what have you.

639
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,980
And that thesis has pretty much been the same thesis

640
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,380
that I've read now for...

641
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,619
in the 20 years since.

642
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,019
I mean, you know, the, you know, yeah, 15, 20 years since.

643
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,980
And one of the things that concerns me is that

644
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,840
why would you want a position that way?

645
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:48,639
What is it that you don't like?

646
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:53,219
Is there a belief that teaching like the ABC,

647
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,139
some sort of left-wing hothouse,

648
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,199
or is it that somehow or other,

649
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:07,300
professional women are to be watched closely?

650
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,519
And my colleague, Bryony Scott,

651
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,420
who I'm a great admirer of,

652
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,699
who's the principal of Winona,

653
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,599
wrote a beautiful piece this year

654
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:20,039
where she talked about her teachers and herself.

655
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:22,840
And she said, I have a number of degrees.

656
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:27,659
I have considerable expertise over 40 years in teaching.

657
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,320
I've done this, I've done this.

658
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,460
Why do you insist on treating me like a child?

659
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:40,260
And it's caused quite a storm in the Sydney Ed circles

660
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,639
because it's a very good question, isn't it?

661
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,900
Why would anybody presume she didn't know what she was doing?

662
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:52,260
You know, she's the principal of an incredibly successful school

663
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:56,860
where their theory is that their young women leaders

664
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,039
go to change the world.

665
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,039
And I...

666
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,780
I believe our young people at Rooty Hill

667
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,599
go to change their communities and then change the world.

668
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,000
Similar kind of thinking.

669
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:10,539
But why would we diminish that?

670
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,500
And again, by doing that, we also diminish our young people.

671
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,480
It's another way of attacking our young people in this country

672
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,059
because we tell them all the time they failed PISA

673
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:21,860
or they failed this.

674
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,500
There's some serious problems with PISA,

675
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,300
the international test that's done in Year 10.

676
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,099
Well, we don't do it in Year 10 here.

677
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:29,940
That's the first problem.

678
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:32,659
We do it in Year 9 when we're halfway through the course.

679
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,119
The rest of the country's doing it in Year 10 when they've finished it.

680
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:37,800
No, don't get me on the PISA soapbox.

681
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,340
But why would we continually want to tell our children

682
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,079
they were failing?

683
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,880
What sort of country does that to its young people

684
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,099
and does it to our teachers who...

685
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,300
The teachers I work with, oh, they're so smart.

686
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:55,280
Nearly all of them have master's degrees.

687
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:58,280
Some of them have multiple undergraduate

688
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,840
degrees.

689
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,159
You know, I'm just thinking about one of our teachers

690
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,440
who's quite self-effacing.

691
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:06,900
And someone said to me, so what are her quals?

692
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,360
And I said, oh, she's got...

693
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,519
It's physics, chemistry and mathematics.

694
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,139
And she got honours in all three.

695
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,500
And someone said to me, and she's a teacher?

696
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,480
So you see, that's the conversation.

697
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:21,659
But for her, this is her love, her joy, her desire.

698
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,840
And that's what teachers do.

699
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:25,719
Teachers change lives.

700
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:28,239
Nearly everyone can remember a teacher who changed

701
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:28,260
their life.

702
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,260
And if we don't go to work with a purpose to change lives

703
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,159
for young people, and it doesn't matter what their background,

704
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:38,840
to change lives for young people, then, you know,

705
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,260
it's really hardly worth going.

706
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,219
They're certainly not paying us enough.

707
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,320
We have to go and we have to have fun.

708
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:49,400
And we have to have young people who feel that they have

709
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,679
to be able to believe in themselves.

710
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,139
So I go back to where I started.

711
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:53,800
They don't need helicopters.

712
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,920
They actually need to find their own sense of resilience

713
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,219
and understanding.

714
00:39:58,219 --> 00:39:58,800
They need to find their own sense of resilience and agency.

715
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:01,780
Because these are our adults.

716
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:08,059
The ones we teach in year 12, the ones we taught last year in year 12,

717
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,780
pretty much all of them voted this year.

718
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,719
Yeah, again, so many interesting places to go with that.

719
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,500
I had a great experience this week just gone.

720
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:22,440
One of my old schoolmates from 1984, when I was in year four,

721
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,780
he's a guy called John Aloisi, went on to score the winning goal

722
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,400
to put Australia into the World Cup.

723
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:27,519
And he's a great guy.

724
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:27,539
And he's a great guy.

725
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:27,559
And he's a great guy.

726
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:27,579
And he's a great guy.

727
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:27,599
And he's a great guy.

728
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:27,619
And he's a great guy.

729
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:27,639
And he's a great guy.

730
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:27,679
And he's a great guy.

731
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:27,739
And he's a great guy.

732
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:27,760
And he's a great guy.

733
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,260
And a great person.

734
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,599
We've stayed in touch over the time.

735
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:33,639
But we both, along the journey, spoke about our year four teacher

736
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,599
as our favourite teacher who had a massive impact.

737
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:38,260
Peter Muddy Waters, his name is.

738
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,460
And we got in touch 38 years later and had dinner with him.

739
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:44,840
I'd seen him once before.

740
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,500
I think John hadn't seen him for 38 years.

741
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:51,159
And so to go back and say thank you for the impact you had on us

742
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:55,340
as eight and nine-year-olds was such a joyful experience to go back

743
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,940
and, you know, slightly.

744
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,059
I don't know.

745
00:40:57,059 --> 00:40:57,099
I don't know.

746
00:40:57,099 --> 00:40:57,119
I don't know.

747
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:57,139
I don't know.

748
00:40:57,139 --> 00:40:57,159
I don't know.

749
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:57,219
I don't know.

750
00:40:57,219 --> 00:40:57,260
I don't know.

751
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:57,280
I don't know.

752
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,300
I don't know.

753
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:57,320
I don't know.

754
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:57,340
I don't know.

755
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,960
You know, different feeling 38 years later.

756
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:01,619
But as you said, it was great.

757
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:04,139
And when we spoke before catching up, you know,

758
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:06,420
with the teacher shortage crisis as it is,

759
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,000
the numbers you told me that are being predicted in the coming years

760
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,659
is staggering here in Australia.

761
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,099
Can you share with us the crisis that's unfolding?

762
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,599
And it's happening already, you know,

763
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:20,760
that teachers are in demand and not being replaced quickly enough.

764
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,840
How bad is the problem?

765
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:24,619
Some work that was done.

766
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:30,260
And certainly by the teaching unions across the country,

767
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:33,860
but for New South Wales was that it's going to be around

768
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,599
about 15,000 shortage 2025, 26.

769
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:40,519
Because there are still people retiring.

770
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:46,300
And the one that really shocked was, you know,

771
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,260
we're talking about by 2030, 30 to 40,000.

772
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,840
Now, that's worst case scenario.

773
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,599
But the way things are going, you know,

774
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:57,679
going with the COVID impact as well,

775
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:01,980
it's worst case scenario is important to think about.

776
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,960
If we know what the worst that can happen here is,

777
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,440
we can start to plan for it.

778
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:11,579
And if we get lucky and it's not that bad, then we'll be happy.

779
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:16,900
But as I said to you, it's now become a huge issue in the United States

780
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,760
because they're predicting 325,000 by 2025.

781
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,179
That's a huge number.

782
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,440
They do everything at scale.

783
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,460
Of course, but that's a huge number.

784
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,739
So if we think we're going to recruit in the U.S.,

785
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:29,679
it's pretty unlikely.

786
00:42:30,659 --> 00:42:32,760
The Canadians also have shortages.

787
00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:36,420
So all those traditional places where we might have thought we might go

788
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,239
to recruit come to sunny Australia.

789
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,239
Although if you live on the East Coast this year, not so likely,

790
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,719
but come to sunny Australia, which we did a lot of in the 70s.

791
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:48,420
And I still have a number of friends who came to teach in Australia

792
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,280
from the U.S. in the 70s.

793
00:42:51,659 --> 00:42:53,780
That isn't probably going to happen again.

794
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:53,840
Yeah.

795
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,360
We also have the states competing with each other.

796
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,179
And I believe that as so often happens in football,

797
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:06,239
Western Australia has been very successful in recruiting across Australia

798
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:10,340
in terms of the number of teachers who've decided to move to sunny WA

799
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,079
and work in their systems.

800
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,719
So you can't say, oh, we've got this many more teachers

801
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:20,260
when you're really just redistributing the pie.

802
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,460
Yeah, it's a big issue, isn't it,

803
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,159
when you start putting those numbers together

804
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:26,119
and think what that means school by school

805
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:29,179
and in the end of the day, the outcomes for our kids

806
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:31,219
and the future, it's enormous.

807
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,559
Chris, there's so many places to take your life.

808
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:36,739
And I mentioned your contribution to the Smith family,

809
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,000
which celebrated its 100 years, an incredible organisation

810
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,760
and your passion for that and combining education and philanthropy,

811
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,639
I think it's been another great piece of your life and contribution.

812
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:51,000
I wanted to move, Christine, we've been catching up

813
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,559
with a range of leaders from different backgrounds,

814
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:53,559
whether it be sport or education.

815
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:56,579
Education or industry or the arts,

816
00:43:56,659 --> 00:43:59,400
about what we think great leadership looks like in different settings.

817
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:02,820
And so please, I'd love you to expand on these dimensions of leadership

818
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,599
as we see them in any way you like.

819
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,599
But self-leadership, we feel all leaders have an understanding

820
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,199
of what self-leadership means.

821
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,960
Does that term resonate with you?

822
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:16,920
Yes, I think one of the most useful lessons I ever learnt

823
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,119
was a very, very smart coach who said,

824
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:23,920
this is when I was doing some coaching training,

825
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:28,960
if you can't manage yourself, you can't manage others.

826
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,780
If you can't self-regulate, you can't ask others to regulate.

827
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:38,860
And I think that type of language, if you're not well,

828
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,739
you need to actually look after yourself because you can do a lot

829
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:46,099
of damage once you're in, particularly if you're a formal leader.

830
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:51,239
You can do a lot of damage as a formal leader if you're not

831
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:54,139
on top of your game when you go in.

832
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:57,039
And we've all had moments, I'm sure, like that.

833
00:44:57,219 --> 00:45:00,039
And the same applies for some of the informal leaders.

834
00:45:00,219 --> 00:45:03,119
If there's a young person in the school who's had a lot

835
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,019
of influence in particular ways, if something happens

836
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:09,139
to that person, and sometimes bad things do happen

837
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,820
to good people, and if something happens to that person,

838
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,300
there's almost like a whole collective breath taken.

839
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,599
How will we deal with this?

840
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:20,039
Because that person has given us certainty.

841
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:22,599
We don't have to give people rules.

842
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:23,400
They just...

843
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:23,599
There's a...

844
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:25,599
There's a thing about safety and certainty.

845
00:45:33,309 --> 00:45:36,630
You pick up on something I haven't discussed, you know,

846
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:39,489
for a while, which is people in formal leadership role,

847
00:45:39,949 --> 00:45:42,269
we always talk about the opportunity to do good,

848
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:44,409
but there's also that other opportunity too, isn't it?

849
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,710
If you haven't got the skills or the self-leadership,

850
00:45:47,269 --> 00:45:49,889
you know, to use your words just then, you can do damage.

851
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:52,710
And it's why, you know, one of the reasons we're so passionate

852
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,630
about sharing the example of collaborating for good

853
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,489
because it does affect people, people in formal leadership roles

854
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:00,670
without that self-awareness.

855
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:04,650
We know that the negative impact can be huge without the skills

856
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,969
or the self-reflection, positively impacting others

857
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:07,590
and their environment.

858
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:09,469
I mean, your story is all about that for me,

859
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:12,309
and you're very humble in the way that you talk about it,

860
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:16,730
but clearly, you know, in an area of Australia that, you know,

861
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:19,789
has social issues, you've made an amazing contribution.

862
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,670
How have you thought about that positively impacting people

863
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,289
in your environment every day?

864
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:30,230
It's interesting, isn't it, that it is the little things you do,

865
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:34,090
there's that great Buddhist quote, isn't it,

866
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:38,050
be careful what you think because your thoughts become your words,

867
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:41,510
be careful about your words because your words become your actions,

868
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:45,070
be careful about your actions because your actions become your life.

869
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:49,369
People don't judge us on what we were thinking,

870
00:46:49,489 --> 00:46:50,610
they judge us on what we did.

871
00:46:51,389 --> 00:46:54,969
And one of the big insights I've had in the last couple of years

872
00:46:54,969 --> 00:46:57,969
and particularly I'm very interested in the work of BJ Hogg,

873
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:00,650
The Tiny Habits That Make a Difference,

874
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:08,869
it is the, in particular, I'm sure it's true in all industries,

875
00:47:08,989 --> 00:47:10,590
but it's particularly true in education.

876
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:18,230
It is what others see you doing every day and it's what you do every day.

877
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,150
Your behaviours are what they're looking at.

878
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:26,989
So teaching does require routine repetition and all of those things,

879
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,269
but it also requires adaptability, flexibility.

880
00:47:29,269 --> 00:47:30,650
If the kid makes the best job,

881
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:31,610
if the kid makes the best joke ever,

882
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:35,190
it requires that ability to just let the class go

883
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:37,750
and just take the best joke ever, you know,

884
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:41,849
and it's what they see you do.

885
00:47:42,349 --> 00:47:43,610
You walk your values.

886
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:45,429
No one has no values.

887
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:46,530
Everyone's got values.

888
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:50,530
But you don't necessarily have to say, these are my values,

889
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:54,250
because every day, I remember a former prime minister said

890
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,730
public schools had no values.

891
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,230
I couldn't resist it.

892
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:59,989
I just had to go out on that day and say, listen,

893
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:00,610
when I rolled out,

894
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:01,489
I got out of bed this morning.

895
00:48:01,889 --> 00:48:06,690
By the time I'd got into work, everyone knew what my values were.

896
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:11,610
Everything I said and everything I did all day told the story

897
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:12,230
of what mattered.

898
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:17,650
And I do think we sometimes forget that importance of language.

899
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:21,250
We forget that importance of watching what people are doing.

900
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:23,510
How do most people learn?

901
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:30,409
They don't necessarily learn by, as someone said,

902
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:33,530
just recently this week, they don't necessarily learn

903
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:38,570
by doing teaching and learning on values.

904
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,289
You learn them because of the group that you're with.

905
00:48:41,949 --> 00:48:44,409
So when parents, for example, choose a school,

906
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,050
they want to choose where they have the ability to choose,

907
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,789
because a lot of parents, of course, aren't able to choose.

908
00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:51,969
But where parents can choose a school,

909
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:55,130
they choose the school hopefully for the values of the school

910
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:58,369
and hopefully the values align with theirs.

911
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:04,530
And that's a really big decision because once you send your son

912
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:07,909
or daughter to whatever school it is, you're having trust

913
00:49:07,909 --> 00:49:10,530
that that school is going to bring out in your sons

914
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,070
and daughters the things that you think are the most important.

915
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:17,909
And so it's important that schools are places where parents

916
00:49:17,909 --> 00:49:22,210
are also safe to say, I'm a bit concerned about the values here,

917
00:49:22,409 --> 00:49:25,849
or safe to say, I really like these school values

918
00:49:25,849 --> 00:49:27,329
and I really hope you'll push them more.

919
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:28,349
And when you look at it,

920
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:31,309
look up your school because you can see the values are there.

921
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:36,409
Persist, I think, is the acronym and it's clear.

922
00:49:36,889 --> 00:49:39,590
And I looked at it and you felt compelled to read it

923
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:44,070
and you got a sense of what it would be like as an outsider looking in.

924
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:48,429
And so clearly that is something that is at the forefront of your mind.

925
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:51,610
It's across all the things when you research about what you do.

926
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:55,650
We see leaders really conscious about creating and sharing their vision.

927
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:58,329
And part of that was just our conversation.

928
00:49:58,349 --> 00:49:58,750
Wasn't it?

929
00:49:58,769 --> 00:50:02,269
The values of what you're wanting to achieve as a principal at Rooty Hill

930
00:50:02,269 --> 00:50:05,449
and in your other areas and your other philanthropy work

931
00:50:05,449 --> 00:50:07,030
and in the Smith family and other areas.

932
00:50:07,369 --> 00:50:09,349
How have you gone about creating and sharing those visions?

933
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,630
Well, you just have to walk the talk.

934
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:17,889
One of the things I do love is when the alumni come back to Rooty Hill,

935
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:22,110
they all remember Persist.

936
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:24,710
It's quite amazing.

937
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:28,190
And we had a staff activity recently.

938
00:50:28,349 --> 00:50:32,409
We have a number of our ex-students working with us in part-time positions

939
00:50:32,409 --> 00:50:36,050
while they're starting at uni, which is fabulous

940
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:38,510
because we're getting all this amazing skill set.

941
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:45,349
But interestingly, schools pay for our admin teams quite a good rate

942
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:48,210
compared to fast food, I might say.

943
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:51,230
Not quite a good rate compared to some others, but fast food.

944
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:53,190
And these wonderful young people.

945
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:56,269
And we were having a conversation about some of the key platforms

946
00:50:56,269 --> 00:50:58,190
in the school and about the school values.

947
00:50:58,809 --> 00:51:02,170
And I asked each team, asked the whole staff to divide themselves.

948
00:51:02,369 --> 00:51:07,510
I thought it was going to be decade groups, but let's just say we had six 1995ers

949
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:08,730
and it was pretty fun.

950
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:11,630
So they all got into groups and talked about the songs of their era

951
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:14,210
and then they talked about what they understood about the school values

952
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,670
and the platforms and what have you.

953
00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:20,289
And what was really interesting in them doing that was that they were

954
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:25,269
the younger ones when they – so I put the youngest group

955
00:51:25,269 --> 00:51:28,269
with one of the middle groups and someone who was in the middle group,

956
00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:32,369
said about the younger ones, actually, they know more about this than we do

957
00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:34,949
because they grew up through it.

958
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,630
They know the school values.

959
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:40,869
They know about the things that we value and the things that we think

960
00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:44,349
are important and the things we try to do well.

961
00:51:45,449 --> 00:51:48,590
And I think you just have to – if you really believe in things

962
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:51,929
and you have a set of beliefs about what's important,

963
00:51:52,389 --> 00:51:57,750
then you walk that talk and you deal with it when things don't fit the values.

964
00:51:58,349 --> 00:52:00,849
You don't walk past it.

965
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:02,710
You don't do bystander behaviour.

966
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,090
You actually stand and be counted.

967
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:10,389
And I am most proud when I see our students and their families

968
00:52:10,389 --> 00:52:13,409
stand and be counted because sometimes difficult things do happen.

969
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:21,090
And to see them sort of walk with us to get their son or daughter

970
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:25,409
to the best journey they can, that's one of my most fulfilling times.

971
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:27,409
Christine, we see curiosity.

972
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:32,889
A key word that comes up with leaders that we talk to in this space

973
00:52:32,889 --> 00:52:36,510
and through curiosity, that's how they approach learning and development.

974
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:37,989
Does that ring true with you?

975
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:44,510
So while I said it kind of didn't matter, a lot of things don't matter,

976
00:52:44,869 --> 00:52:49,469
intellectual grunt, which is what I call it, which is what our teachers have

977
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:54,909
and a lot of our students are developing, that wanting to know more about something

978
00:52:54,909 --> 00:52:57,190
so you are better informed about it.

979
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:58,110
And –

980
00:52:58,110 --> 00:52:58,329
Yeah.

981
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:03,809
Backing yourself to try something innovative but also backing it

982
00:53:03,809 --> 00:53:07,889
by also making sure is there evidence that supports this kind of approach.

983
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,909
So, for example, one of the things that we're very proud of at Rudy Hill

984
00:53:10,909 --> 00:53:14,570
that we've tried was based on some research done by Andrew Martin

985
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:18,050
and his team at the – at Uni of New South Wales.

986
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:22,389
And this is goal setting within each individual subject.

987
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:26,190
So our students at the beginning of a semester set their goal

988
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,110
for each subject with their teachers.

989
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:29,510
You know, it's in the context.

990
00:53:30,289 --> 00:53:32,409
And then there are little checkpoints along the way.

991
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:35,230
And then at the end of the semester, they write their own report comment.

992
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:39,510
That's agency that says this is how I got on my goal.

993
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,369
This is what skills I've developed or whatever.

994
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:43,849
And we're only just trying it.

995
00:53:43,909 --> 00:53:45,769
We don't know if it'll 100% work.

996
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:49,289
We're going to give it three years to see how it goes because it normally takes

997
00:53:49,289 --> 00:53:52,690
three to four years to embed something in practice in a school.

998
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,909
So we'll give it three to four years.

999
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:57,909
The interesting thing is that Andrew Martin's research says,

1000
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:02,130
yes, that where young people set their own academic goals

1001
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:07,889
and work towards achieving them, there is a significant improvement

1002
00:54:07,889 --> 00:54:10,090
in their results, particularly in schools where there

1003
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:11,329
are disadvantaged children.

1004
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:14,309
So we're going to have a go of that.

1005
00:54:14,389 --> 00:54:16,250
We're going to have a bit of a run, a bit of a test.

1006
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:17,349
Will it work?

1007
00:54:17,429 --> 00:54:19,369
It was a bit like our creativity project.

1008
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:20,510
Will it work?

1009
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:26,489
If you don't – and I think that's part of the – it's part of the curiosity bits,

1010
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:27,329
part of –

1011
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:31,409
who we – how we have become as a school.

1012
00:54:31,949 --> 00:54:35,530
We are curious to see if we can do better because, you know,

1013
00:54:35,789 --> 00:54:39,610
everyone would forgive us because you're just a school in Western Sydney,

1014
00:54:40,469 --> 00:54:43,070
just a public comprehensive school, you know.

1015
00:54:43,449 --> 00:54:45,269
They forgive you for low expectations.

1016
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:49,909
But if you're going to travel along and you want to do something just to be more

1017
00:54:49,909 --> 00:54:55,269
than one standard deviation below average, you actually give yourself the permission,

1018
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:57,630
John McBeath, be subversive.

1019
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:05,070
Give yourself the permission to try something different because if you keep doing what you're

1020
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:09,030
always doing, you're going to – and you may not get what you always got.

1021
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:13,369
Something else might change, but you're not likely to get much different.

1022
00:55:15,449 --> 00:55:19,409
And part of our challenge for education is that some of the decision makers with whom

1023
00:55:19,409 --> 00:55:26,909
we work and at very senior levels really want school to be like it was in the 50s and 60s

1024
00:55:26,909 --> 00:55:27,690
and 70s.

1025
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:33,530
And, for example, for our One Nations kids, it wasn't a very safe place to be at all.

1026
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:37,210
Sorry, our First Nations kids, it wasn't a safe place to be.

1027
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:42,409
For our children of non-English speaking backgrounds, it wasn't always a safe

1028
00:55:42,409 --> 00:55:43,389
or happy place.

1029
00:55:44,769 --> 00:55:49,429
We are much better now than we were then, but we don't necessarily count that in our

1030
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:53,369
list of achievements of our education system in Australia.

1031
00:55:53,369 --> 00:55:54,849
Yeah, well said.

1032
00:55:54,969 --> 00:55:57,710
And I love that story of applying curiosity.

1033
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:58,650
Correctly, yeah.

1034
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:03,650
And the study, you know, if it's close to being what it sounds like, is going to be

1035
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:03,849
brilliant.

1036
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:08,349
It's setting your own goal, so you immediately take ownership of it, working towards it.

1037
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:09,949
I'll be fascinated to see.

1038
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:15,250
And that's the genius of what you've done, Chris, is take things, trial them, and then

1039
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:18,369
share them with other educators and other schools, you know.

1040
00:56:18,369 --> 00:56:22,730
And I love the fact that it's coming out of, as you said, under the radar where the

1041
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:28,090
expectation is low, but the results are consistently better than just that.

1042
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:29,250
We see leaders in it.

1043
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:31,409
And I say our expectations are not low.

1044
00:56:31,869 --> 00:56:36,369
Yeah, I can sense very clearly that they're the opposite of that.

1045
00:56:36,369 --> 00:56:39,570
That's true of nearly every school in the area where I work.

1046
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,150
Yeah.

1047
00:56:40,289 --> 00:56:44,190
Because they know they have to make – kids only get one shot.

1048
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:45,849
Teachers can come back next year.

1049
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:46,849
Yeah.

1050
00:56:48,809 --> 00:56:52,110
Communicating with clarity is a dimension of leadership we see really common across

1051
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:56,530
different industries and different backgrounds.

1052
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:57,530
Is that real?

1053
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:00,050
Is that part of the leadership that you focus on?

1054
00:57:00,329 --> 00:57:02,610
I think it is pretty critical.

1055
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:13,409
But again, when you're working with highly professional teams, you have to be really

1056
00:57:13,409 --> 00:57:15,329
quite sophisticated about that.

1057
00:57:15,789 --> 00:57:17,949
When does it become the team's team?

1058
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:23,989
When is the communication something that's part of the team's team?

1059
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:27,230
I do think communication really matters.

1060
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:30,789
I think direction needs to be treated very carefully.

1061
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:37,710
We've just come out of three years of effectively crisis management, what I call the bushfire

1062
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:43,690
scenario, where our senior people come out and they're all dressed in their beautiful

1063
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:47,829
uniforms and what have you, and they tell you exactly what to do.

1064
00:57:47,889 --> 00:57:51,949
Or in the flood that we've just had here in Western Sydney, they tell you what to do.

1065
00:57:52,389 --> 00:57:53,690
We did that during COVID.

1066
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:56,269
We got memos every single day.

1067
00:57:56,269 --> 00:57:56,789
Some days.

1068
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:57,949
I couldn't believe it.

1069
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:03,630
But I would ritually read them and I would send them back out to our staff or whomever

1070
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:06,309
or our families and I would summarise them into English.

1071
00:58:06,809 --> 00:58:08,670
Not summarise them into English.

1072
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:14,110
I'd summarise them into English that people could read because sometimes memos that come

1073
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:20,570
from government can be just a tad written by university people and can be just a tad

1074
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:25,929
above the reading age of the majority of the population and use very technical terms and

1075
00:58:25,929 --> 00:58:26,750
lots of acronyms.

1076
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:34,210
So I think that communication, it needs to have, it needs to be leveraged in a way that

1077
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:36,070
responds to what does the community need.

1078
00:58:36,329 --> 00:58:37,949
I know this is going to sound really trite.

1079
00:58:38,409 --> 00:58:42,590
I started to make these little Facebook videos and I would do one every week.

1080
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:47,030
I tried to do it in a different, either different part of my backyard or on the two days that

1081
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:52,030
I was on site at school because I live in the lockdown LGA, so I was allowed to go to

1082
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:52,289
work.

1083
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:55,070
I try to find different places to do them.

1084
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:57,070
I've now got this collection of rather bizarre.

1085
00:58:57,230 --> 00:59:03,530
Rather bizarre Facebook things talking about COVID and talking about, you know, if you

1086
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:07,469
need help with this or if you need help with that, because in the end, what our community

1087
00:59:07,469 --> 00:59:11,230
actually wanted, they wanted a face-to-face communication, but they could have it online.

1088
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:20,449
So I'm not, I do believe in strong communication, but I also think you use it judiciously.

1089
00:59:20,809 --> 00:59:25,090
Don't over bury people in our COVID situation here in New South Wales now.

1090
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:26,449
I think most people are just confused.

1091
00:59:27,769 --> 00:59:31,070
It'd be really nice just to have something straightforward that said all other policies

1092
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:32,929
go to this way, to the side.

1093
00:59:33,389 --> 00:59:37,409
And now this is the guideline for the next two weeks or the next four weeks.

1094
00:59:37,409 --> 00:59:38,289
This is what you do.

1095
00:59:38,769 --> 00:59:41,329
But we do seem to have the most enormous amount of it.

1096
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:43,250
And that's the lesson I've learned.

1097
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:46,070
Don't communicate, don't over communicate.

1098
00:59:46,269 --> 00:59:50,889
And when you do, make sure it's about the important stuff that people need to know right

1099
00:59:50,889 --> 00:59:51,329
away.

1100
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:57,010
And then when it's something that they need to work on for a longer time, the

1101
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,769
project-based approach seems to me to be the one that works best.

1102
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:01,889
Yeah, again, great examples in your environment.

1103
01:00:01,969 --> 01:00:04,449
I've seen your Facebook videos, Chris.

1104
01:00:04,449 --> 01:00:06,889
They were well articulated.

1105
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:12,590
And I love, you know, anyone who has tried to read a government document, you know, it's

1106
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:13,469
incredibly confusing.

1107
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:18,349
So, you know, again, a great living story of just how to, you know, otherwise it wouldn't

1108
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:19,690
have been read, let's be honest with you.

1109
01:00:19,789 --> 01:00:24,969
I mean, I delete as many emails and, you know, without being, I'll get in trouble here because

1110
01:00:24,969 --> 01:00:26,070
the schools my kids attend.

1111
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:26,889
But sometimes the community...

1112
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:32,050
Communication is just too much and you can't, you know, you can't put it into the item where

1113
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:34,050
you feel like you've got time to digest it.

1114
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:38,989
Collaboration is something we see leaders are really focused on now more than ever.

1115
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:41,369
How do you think about collaboration?

1116
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:47,190
I think it has worked very well for us at Rooty Hill around our strategic projects.

1117
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:51,329
But I also see it as something that works particularly well when you've got...

1118
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:54,849
It does work particularly well in education.

1119
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:56,449
When you've got people who...

1120
01:00:57,010 --> 01:01:01,449
Who not only have a shared interest in what they're doing, but also have a shared expertise.

1121
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:09,349
I think we face some real challenges of embarrassing people when we insist on having people forced

1122
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:10,010
collaboration.

1123
01:01:11,449 --> 01:01:13,230
I like to think of...

1124
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:15,889
I actually don't try not to use the word too much.

1125
01:01:15,889 --> 01:01:20,690
We did a big executive project where we tried to define collaboration at Rooty Hill High

1126
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:20,909
School.

1127
01:01:21,369 --> 01:01:23,710
And what we ended up deciding was we weren't very collaborative.

1128
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:24,969
We were just a school.

1129
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:26,590
And it was...

1130
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:28,409
It was pretty funny because we read everything.

1131
01:01:28,929 --> 01:01:33,969
We read everything and it ended up being the most hilarious discussion as we tried to put it

1132
01:01:33,969 --> 01:01:34,289
together.

1133
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:36,130
But what we...

1134
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:38,309
Those with an interest need to be able to share it.

1135
01:01:38,369 --> 01:01:39,010
That's collaborative.

1136
01:01:39,969 --> 01:01:41,349
And collaborative is...

1137
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:48,409
It's really quite critical for building your culture if you want to have a kind of shared

1138
01:01:48,409 --> 01:01:48,789
culture.

1139
01:01:49,389 --> 01:01:54,289
So one of the reasons the student agency is so important at Rooty Hill is because they're

1140
01:01:54,289 --> 01:01:55,230
part of the collaboration.

1141
01:01:56,590 --> 01:02:01,409
They're very much part of the collaboration and they're very much part of the conversation.

1142
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:08,750
So, again, we must never think that young people should be left out of it.

1143
01:02:08,829 --> 01:02:10,110
They're not there to be done to.

1144
01:02:10,989 --> 01:02:14,389
They're there to interact with us and give us feedback and help us.

1145
01:02:14,769 --> 01:02:19,329
I like to think we have a very high level of collaboration at Rooty Hill.

1146
01:02:19,409 --> 01:02:23,449
And I also work with a number of colleagues in our local area and I like to think we're

1147
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:24,590
highly collaborative too.

1148
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:26,150
But boy, COVID.

1149
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:27,489
Posts some challenges.

1150
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:28,309
Yeah.

1151
01:02:28,349 --> 01:02:31,250
And I think, again, I just hear your language around the students.

1152
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:37,030
It sounds unique because in some schools it is that the teachers see the students as part

1153
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:39,550
of the solutions and not, as you said, to be done to.

1154
01:02:39,829 --> 01:02:40,769
So I love that language.

1155
01:02:40,769 --> 01:02:41,889
Well, it's not unique at all.

1156
01:02:42,389 --> 01:02:42,849
Well...

1157
01:02:42,849 --> 01:02:45,590
Well, the colleagues that I work with...

1158
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:45,989
Yeah.

1159
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:48,889
Look, there's something about Western Sydney, you know.

1160
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:51,250
You just can't...

1161
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:54,309
Kids just don't get bossed around.

1162
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:55,550
That's the way it's played.

1163
01:02:55,949 --> 01:02:56,110
Yeah.

1164
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:56,170
Yeah.

1165
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:56,570
Yeah.

1166
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:57,289
It'll not play.

1167
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:00,789
It's brilliant.

1168
01:03:00,929 --> 01:03:05,210
Well, maybe it's not unique in your environment because you've created it, but I sense it

1169
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:05,730
is in others.

1170
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:10,030
And so it's why it's great to share these stories and hear, you know, and unpack the

1171
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:13,550
success, why it is such a great story of success.

1172
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:18,670
I've been asking these two questions, Christine, to all the leaders I've spoken to, starting

1173
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,949
with who has been the greatest leader in your life?

1174
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:24,369
There's so many of them, really.

1175
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:26,469
So I'm just going to come back.

1176
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:27,449
To my mum and dad.

1177
01:03:29,949 --> 01:03:33,269
And my mum, who never wanted me to be a teacher.

1178
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:35,969
Can I ask why?

1179
01:03:36,909 --> 01:03:38,110
She just...

1180
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,329
She had four kids.

1181
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:42,829
So she just decided...

1182
01:03:42,829 --> 01:03:43,309
She...

1183
01:03:43,309 --> 01:03:44,530
I don't think she ever really...

1184
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:46,610
I don't even know if she liked me when I was a teacher.

1185
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:52,329
But she modelled...

1186
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:55,610
She was a woman of her time.

1187
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:56,409
But also...

1188
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:58,449
She was a very adventurous woman.

1189
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:00,949
And she taught me...

1190
01:04:00,949 --> 01:04:05,030
She taught me that it was okay to try to be adventurous.

1191
01:04:06,869 --> 01:04:09,590
And she was much more adventurous, however, than I am.

1192
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:11,590
And my dad, because...

1193
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:20,130
My dad came from the background that many of his generation did.

1194
01:04:20,769 --> 01:04:23,369
He was the first in his family to go to university.

1195
01:04:24,269 --> 01:04:26,530
He was the first in his family...

1196
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:29,409
He was the first in his family to hold the particular position

1197
01:04:29,409 --> 01:04:32,789
that he ended up holding in the banking industry.

1198
01:04:33,489 --> 01:04:34,570
And I do think that...

1199
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:40,510
I do think that what he showed us, both positively and negatively,

1200
01:04:41,349 --> 01:04:44,789
was how to...

1201
01:04:44,789 --> 01:04:45,570
I think...

1202
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,929
There were three girls initially in our family.

1203
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:48,570
So to dad...

1204
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:52,489
Dad lost any chance to go all sexist.

1205
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:53,809
He used to sort of do, you know,

1206
01:04:53,809 --> 01:04:56,230
let a woman in my life and carry on all this trade.

1207
01:04:56,369 --> 01:04:56,530
But...

1208
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:58,690
But what he showed us was both the good and the bad.

1209
01:04:59,269 --> 01:05:01,150
He showed us the dangers of overworking

1210
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:04,150
because he worked such long hours.

1211
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:06,789
He'd come home and then he would have dinner

1212
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:07,809
and then he'd start again.

1213
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:12,210
As people do who work in high-paced professions.

1214
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:15,610
But he also showed us how to have a great holiday.

1215
01:05:16,369 --> 01:05:21,110
He was a very handy man and a son of a builder, as he said,

1216
01:05:21,309 --> 01:05:22,809
and a very handy guy.

1217
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:25,949
So I was very privileged to have those two people in my life.

1218
01:05:25,949 --> 01:05:28,590
There are other people in my professional life

1219
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:30,530
who have taught me so much.

1220
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:33,769
And the only thing I'd say is

1221
01:05:33,769 --> 01:05:36,429
some of them have come from the most surprising places.

1222
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:38,630
So there we are.

1223
01:05:39,409 --> 01:05:40,730
Yeah, it's a great answer.

1224
01:05:40,889 --> 01:05:44,230
And I love the people that had that influence from their parents.

1225
01:05:44,409 --> 01:05:47,570
It's where they go to almost inevitably straight away.

1226
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:49,170
And it feels like a blessing, doesn't it?

1227
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:51,869
If you had that sort of influence to start your life,

1228
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:53,750
it's a gift that keeps on...

1229
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,750
Yeah, it doesn't...

1230
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:56,570
It doesn't diminish that, does it?

1231
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:59,769
I feel exactly the same if I was asked the same question.

1232
01:06:00,409 --> 01:06:02,809
Again, the second question's around collaboration.

1233
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:06,309
If you could collaborate with anyone in the world on anything...

1234
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:08,409
Chris, we're speaking a lot about your history in education,

1235
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:10,570
but your history in charity space,

1236
01:06:10,789 --> 01:06:12,889
and clearly you love a sport as well.

1237
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:15,050
Has there been anyone you thought, you know,

1238
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:17,469
that I professionally or in any part of your life

1239
01:06:17,469 --> 01:06:18,630
that you'd love to collaborate with?

1240
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:19,690
That I haven't already?

1241
01:06:20,329 --> 01:06:22,469
Yeah, you have done extensively.

1242
01:06:22,789 --> 01:06:23,690
You absolutely have.

1243
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:24,050
Yeah.

1244
01:06:24,769 --> 01:06:25,369
Let me just...

1245
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:26,650
Take a second there.

1246
01:06:27,449 --> 01:06:29,510
I don't mean to waste your time, Luke.

1247
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:30,590
Let me just take a second.

1248
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:41,599
There's a group of academics working out of Germany

1249
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:45,719
who are part of the International Congress

1250
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:47,780
of School Effectiveness and Improvement.

1251
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:54,539
And they are doing some absolutely brilliant work

1252
01:06:54,539 --> 01:06:58,039
in the areas that I love around data and assessment,

1253
01:06:58,239 --> 01:06:58,719
but particularly...

1254
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:03,099
And there's also a Canadian that I very much admire

1255
01:07:03,099 --> 01:07:06,860
who are doing a lot of work around the ethical use of data.

1256
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,960
And if I was to take a next step,

1257
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:13,199
that's the place I'd probably like to go.

1258
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,519
And I don't know whether they'd let me collaborate,

1259
01:07:15,739 --> 01:07:18,059
but, boy golly, I'd like to learn from them a bit more.

1260
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:22,239
I'm sure that that would be a collaboration

1261
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,380
that they would love to have.

1262
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:26,599
If you listen to you and hear your passion and your expertise

1263
01:07:26,599 --> 01:07:28,260
and your history, it's extraordinary.

1264
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:28,659
So I thought...

1265
01:07:28,659 --> 01:07:32,000
The final word might go to an ex-student that I read.

1266
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:34,360
There was so much great feedback from the alumni,

1267
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:36,300
as you've called them across this conversation,

1268
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:37,639
from one of your ex-students.

1269
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,039
Rudy Hill High School instils a strong sense of belief in its students.

1270
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:43,000
It's a culture that is infectious.

1271
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:46,099
It doesn't matter where you come from or who you are,

1272
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,960
you determine your own path.

1273
01:07:48,019 --> 01:07:50,860
And I think that may sum up everything that you've created

1274
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:52,179
in your great history.

1275
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,519
And it's been a great pleasure to catch up with you today.

1276
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:56,840
I thank you for your time and well done again

1277
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,400
on all the incredible contribution.

1278
01:07:58,980 --> 01:07:59,760
Thanks, Luke.

1279
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:01,960
And thank you for inviting me to speak to you.

1280
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:06,820
