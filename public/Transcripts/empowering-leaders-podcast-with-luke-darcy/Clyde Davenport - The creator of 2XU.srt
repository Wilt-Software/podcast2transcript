1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:11,259
Clyde Davenport is a business leader with a truly unique story.

2
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:14,339
The founder of Two Times You, a brand that we all know,

3
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:17,579
a revolutionary sportswear company used by Navy SEALs

4
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:19,440
and some of the world's best athletes.

5
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,239
Two Times You is now a staple of global sportswear,

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,420
but the origins of how Clyde approached it is fascinating.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,239
He had the ambitious goal of being Australia's first ever global sportswear brand,

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,500
something which had never been done before.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,659
He tells an incredible story in this episode where LeBron James,

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,659
one of the biggest sports stars on the planet,

11
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:42,500
went against his Nike sponsorship to wear Two Times You

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,920
because the belief in the product was so strong.

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,679
I encourage you to stick around to hear the full story from Clyde,

14
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,539
a remarkable leader in a great space.

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,579
This type of ambitious business thinking is something I love to learn about

16
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:57,740
at Our Business A Leader, a place where leaders can collaborate

17
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,460
and learn from one another and have conversations

18
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,140
that they probably can't have elsewhere.

19
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,840
We've had the privilege of working with incredible people in the program.

20
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,219
Ange Postacoglu is doing remarkable things at Celtic.

21
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,180
Eddie Jones from English Rugby.

22
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:13,480
Andy Lee from Hamish & Andy, just to name a few.

23
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:15,739
Something that you can be part of as well,

24
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,420
and you don't have to be a world-leading comedian

25
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,680
or a head coach around the globe to participate.

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,040
We think whatever you do, we all bring value to the types of forums

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,920
that we have at A Leader, and you can find out more at elitacollective.com.

28
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,379
Our signature A Leader Connect program is a great place to start

29
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:31,719
and get an understanding of what's going on.

30
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,799
And get an understanding of the incredible work

31
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,620
and thinking of people like today's guest, Clyde Davenport.

32
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:50,640
Clyde Davenport left his advertising job in the late 1980s

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,500
to have a crack at starting his own business.

34
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,420
At the time, his wife Debbie was pregnant with their first child

35
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,980
and their life savings tabled $100,000.

36
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,840
Clyde saw an opportunity to create sleepwear that wasn't dull and boring.

37
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:06,920
The idea didn't really take off, and with Clyde six weeks away

38
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,000
from throwing in the towel, decided to use some fabric offcuts

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,180
to make boxer shorts.

40
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:11,439
He was a big fan of the idea, and he was a big fan of the idea

41
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,020
having seen them become popular in Europe and the US.

42
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:18,259
In 2003, Clyde went on to sell that business for more than $15 million.

43
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,500
Shortly after, Clyde was approached by former triathlete Jamie Hunt

44
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,819
and his good friend marketing and sales expert Aidan Clark

45
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:27,439
about creating a sportswear brand.

46
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,180
Two Times You was founded in 2005 and has become

47
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,719
an extraordinary business success story.

48
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,719
It is sold in more than 70 countries around the world.

49
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,439
It has become the compression garment of choice for US Navy SEALs,

50
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,360
the likes of NFL, NBA players.

51
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,719
And I'll also be posting the agreement on Twitter

52
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:46,319
to look for contact information on the topic ofeleightathletes

53
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,439
around the globe.

54
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,599
Clyde, thanks for your time.

55
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,800
I appreciate you joining me today.

56
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,680
Oh, it's my pleasure.

57
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,639
Clyde, going back to that opening there, pretty bold move.

58
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,460
Your wife's pregnant, you got a stable job in advertising.

59
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,719
Life savings of $100,000.

60
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,439
Where did the courage come from to take that plunge?

61
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,900
I probably didn't know any better is the truth on that.

62
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,300
So, look, being in advertising, I always wanted to...

63
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,319
in advertising, you work for clients, and you help them, particularly in advertising,

64
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,960
in their marketing. But ultimately, it's their choice of what they do. And I guess for once

65
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,900
in my life, I wanted to make the decisions and see if I could actually make a business

66
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,759
myself, essentially.

67
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:26,780
And so you take on the sleepwear space. I mean, did you have any retail experience at

68
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,780
all? Did you have any background in that world?

69
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:35,039
Not really. I mean, I worked for Sheridan Textiles in Sheets, but I looked around the

70
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,919
market and I thought, well, no one's doing sleepwear that well. I mean, it's pretty dull

71
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,960
and boring. There's nothing particularly contemporary. So I gave it a go. But pretty

72
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,819
soon, I found out I was no good at it. Well, not so much I was no good. It was going nowhere

73
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:56,900
and I couldn't, I was running out of money. But fortunately, at the same time, I saw this

74
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:03,340
trend in boxer shorts and we changed from doing, well, when I say we changed, we started

75
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:09,280
using some of the offcuts in our sleepwear business, made them into boxer shorts. And

76
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,759
we got a break.

77
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,919
Yeah.

78
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,460
And they took off. I mean, it was crazy.

79
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,560
In preparation for this, Clive's reading, people might understand, boxer shorts weren't

80
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,220
a thing. I remember growing up and first, it was 1% of the market, I think was, and

81
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,899
you had most of that market, but it was a pretty small market. And then when it became

82
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:33,459
more popular and was 20% of the market, you still had sort of a 70% or 80% share. Is that

83
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:34,459
accurate?

84
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:39,920
Yeah, that's pretty way the way it went. I mean, I didn't really do any consumer research.

85
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
I just thought I had nothing.

86
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,740
I didn't have an idea. Today, I'd say to people, look, if you've got an idea, first

87
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:52,279
of all, see if it's scalable. And in hindsight, it probably wasn't scalable. Although, look,

88
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:57,899
at the same time, there were three guys started business together and during that time, there

89
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,459
was myself, there was a guy called Mitch Dowd who was doing boxer shorts, and there was

90
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:08,920
Peter Alexander. And they're interesting stories. Myself, I started with sleepwear and I couldn't

91
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
make it work.

92
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so I started with sleepwear, and I couldn't make it work, but then I was

93
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,560
The latest word is pivoted.

94
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,220
I changed to doing boxer shorts almost by accident.

95
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,500
And then we did sort of fun boxer shorts and it took off.

96
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,259
Mitch Dowd started in boxer shorts and he did really well.

97
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:26,959
And Peter Alexander, I mean, he actually was in sleepwear.

98
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,959
And what helped him was that he had a big order from Meyer

99
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,800
and for whatever reason, Meyer cancelled the order.

100
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,060
And then he went into, you know, today it's e-com,

101
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,800
but then it was magazine advertising.

102
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,139
So he put a birdie in, I think it was clear.

103
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:45,199
A mail order effectively.

104
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,060
A mail order, yeah.

105
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,720
He put an order in clear and it took off.

106
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,939
Now, if he had stayed in the traditional sense,

107
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,100
he wouldn't have made it.

108
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:55,079
If I'd have stayed in sleepwear, I would have made it.

109
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,360
Mitch Dowd is a little bit different.

110
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:59,300
Maybe he's the one who actually saw that, you know,

111
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:00,420
he saw it straight away.

112
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,199
It's a fascinating story.

113
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,339
I didn't realise that history.

114
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,800
I mean, Peter Alexander swimwear has become, you know, legendary.

115
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,040
Great story.

116
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,040
Mitch Dowd still making.

117
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,800
He's still making boxed shorts and doing it with great success.

118
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,180
I mean, how stressful was it?

119
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:14,079
You're running out of money.

120
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,560
You're looking at the sleepwear business again.

121
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:17,480
I'm in trouble.

122
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,620
Can you take us back to then?

123
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:21,540
When we read the CV, everyone thinks what a great success story,

124
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,740
but clearly you had to deal with some challenges.

125
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,399
What was that like?

126
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,300
Well, look, I gave it a year.

127
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,560
When I left advertising, I left on a good note and I thought,

128
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,660
well, I'll give it a year and if I can't make it work,

129
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,600
I'll go and get a real job.

130
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:37,360
So that's sort of exactly what I did.

131
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,040
And it got pretty close.

132
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,220
I mean, you know, I was doing a bit of advertising on the side

133
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,019
to try and, you know, keep the money going.

134
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,560
You know, it was tough.

135
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,540
I mean, well, it was tough at the time, but looking back,

136
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:52,540
it's probably, you know, the best experience you've ever had.

137
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,079
I mean, I was sort of getting designs done, taking to manufacturers,

138
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,680
sitting down with them while they're sewing, bringing them back,

139
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:02,079
putting them in my suitcase, you know, selling them.

140
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,199
I never figured I went to China.

141
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,579
One time, and I didn't get a call while I was away.

142
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
It was tough.

143
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:18,939
But then, as I said, I got this break.

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,620
I got this article written in, I think it was one of the business magazines,

145
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,740
how he's a guy trying to sort of make a break or trying to get a break,

146
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,360
and it sort of took off.

147
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,100
But if I...

148
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,680
I didn't see it as a risk, to answer your question,

149
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,740
because if it didn't work, then I'd sort of go back and get a real job,

150
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,040
and, you know, I'd probably still be in advertising now.

151
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,740
Although, even in advertising, I mean, I looked around in advertising,

152
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,540
and one of the reasons to get out was, one, to run my own business,

153
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,480
but, two, I looked around, and no one seemed to get old in advertising.

154
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:58,680
I mean, I don't know where the old advertising guys go, but it's...

155
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,000
It was, you know, I thought, well, I wasn't, you know, confident enough

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,759
to think I'd be the only guy that could get old in advertising.

157
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:06,079
I thought...

158
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,720
Well, you know, what are we going to do next?

159
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,579
And I love that idea of how you compartmentalise risk,

160
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,980
and, you know, so many people...

161
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,600
On the surface, it sounds like, you know, as you said,

162
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,660
baby on the way, a huge risk, but when you look at it like that,

163
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,019
it's like, OK, I'm going to give this a year.

164
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,720
If not, I always know I can go back in advertising,

165
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,040
and I'll find a different path.

166
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,980
But you can imagine how different your life would have been

167
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,800
without that courage, and I find that interesting.

168
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,699
A lot of people stay in something they really don't love

169
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:35,820
for a long period of time because they can't maybe assess risk

170
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,059
the way they want to.

171
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,480
The way that you did, have you seen that cross your travels?

172
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,519
Yeah, and, you know, I guess the further you get on in your career,

173
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:46,580
the harder it becomes because, you know, I've got mates who are lawyers

174
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,000
who, you know, I've got mates that love lawyers,

175
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:50,480
that love being lawyers, but I've got a lot of mates

176
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,360
that hate being lawyers.

177
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,159
But once they get to a stage when they're, you know,

178
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:56,320
you've got, you know, two kids at private schools

179
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,860
and they've got bills to pay and mortgages,

180
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,759
it's pretty hard to, you know, do what I did

181
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,899
if I was in that sort of point in time.

182
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,820
You know, at that point in time, I did have

183
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,600
a young child, but it's not only a baby.

184
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,940
Debbie and I could actually work.

185
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:13,519
You know, within 12 months, we sort of knew,

186
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,360
not necessarily it was going to be a,

187
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,480
we're going to make a lot of money,

188
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,580
but we knew that whether there's potential in the future.

189
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,039
So it was sort of a, it was a calculated risk.

190
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,159
But, yeah, certainly there are a lot of people

191
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,139
who, for one reason or another, don't want to, can't.

192
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:37,220
And it's a bit sad if you're doing something

193
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,299
that you don't like, I mean.

194
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,620
It's a long life, isn't it?

195
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,240
It's a long life, yeah.

196
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,740
Without passion and purpose.

197
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,539
And I know that there are words that are really big

198
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:46,799
in your sphere as well.

199
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:50,940
Another great part to the story, Calvin Klein at the time,

200
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:53,000
people were the biggest underwear brand in the world.

201
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:54,139
And we grew up in that era.

202
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,639
Everyone had Calvin Klein.

203
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:58,600
You went several times to knock on their door

204
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,700
to get the distribution rights.

205
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:00,820
Can you tell us that story?

206
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,179
Yeah, that was an interesting one.

207
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,820
You know, I was doing, at that stage, you know,

208
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:04,960
I was doing a lot of work.

209
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,120
I was doing a lot of work.

210
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,139
I was doing a lot of work.

211
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,899
I was doing pretty well with the underwear business,

212
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,080
with the boxer short business.

213
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,159
But, and we were doing all sorts of things.

214
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:11,220
We were doing characters.

215
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,779
You know, we did, you know, Mickey Mouse

216
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,059
and Warner Brothers.

217
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:16,220
And it was all going swimmingly well.

218
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:19,980
But again, you know, I was thinking to myself,

219
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,559
well, how long is this going to last?

220
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,340
Is this a fad?

221
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,879
You know, I'd really like to get another underwear brand,

222
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,279
a global brand that, you know,

223
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:32,259
if the boxer short sort of story ran out,

224
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,799
I wouldn't be out of business.

225
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,120
Because that was a risk also.

226
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,679
So I looked around.

227
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,860
The only one that was not taken in Australia

228
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,019
was sort of Calvin Klein.

229
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:43,679
I mean, you could do the likes of, you know,

230
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,759
you could look at Ralph Lauren, not so much Ralph Lauren,

231
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,759
you could do Armani and so forth.

232
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,940
But those, their underwear was stratospheric.

233
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:52,940
Whereas Calvin Klein was expensive,

234
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:55,220
but it wasn't, you know, out of reach.

235
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,539
You know, it's 65 bucks for a pair of underpants.

236
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,799
It's expensive, but it's not out of reach of a lot of people.

237
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,100
So I got on a plane, got on a plane to New York,

238
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:07,899
I was there on, you know, to check out box shorts designs.

239
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:10,299
And I knocked on Calvin Klein's door.

240
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:14,700
And, you know, he said to me, pretty much, no.

241
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,279
Did he get to Calvin himself?

242
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,240
No, the first time I didn't get to Calvin,

243
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,539
I got to his head of international and he, they said no.

244
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,940
What I didn't realise at the time that Jockey, Pacific Brands

245
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,039
and a couple of other companies also went to New York

246
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,360
to try and get that licence.

247
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,860
The difference is,

248
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,740
the following year I went back and I got no again.

249
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:39,700
Quick no?

250
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:42,080
Was it deflating or were you...

251
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
Pretty quick no, but I was doing other stuff there.

252
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,840
So, you know, I wasn't wasting my time, but a pretty quick no.

253
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:50,559
And then the following year, the third year I went there,

254
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:53,440
and by this time everyone had left,

255
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,879
but the third time I went there, they said yes.

256
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:02,279
And it wasn't until sometime after I found out why.

257
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,379
I mean, the reasons I said yes was,

258
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,740
there was a couple of reasons.

259
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,960
One is that I heard that Calvin Klein,

260
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,039
a couple of years earlier,

261
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,179
got into this financial problem with his jeanswear business

262
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:18,240
and he had a mate called David Geffen,

263
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:19,919
who was the first billionaire in music.

264
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,600
And apparently, this is a story I heard,

265
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,860
apparently David Geffen lent Calvin Klein 64 million

266
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,799
or some crazy number.

267
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,259
Good to have mates with money.

268
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,539
But apparently it was due for repayment.

269
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,840
And I said,

270
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,820
I suspect anyone who walked through that door

271
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,879
may have got the licence.

272
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:42,899
I think it helped that I showed persistence.

273
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,019
But, you know, timing's everything.

274
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,620
So it was quite an interesting time.

275
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,980
Life's about timing.

276
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,600
But as I said, I love the persistence and perseverance, wasn't it?

277
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,559
To be able to go back and, you know,

278
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,940
you're reading your language, you know,

279
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,279
no maybe is not no forever.

280
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,059
You can come back again.

281
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,940
And my mind was going as you were talking,

282
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,460
I remember reading an article.

283
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,580
For those that don't, you know,

284
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,460
like everyone had Calvin Klein underwear

285
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,139
and all of us grew up in new Davenport boxer shorts as well.

286
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,720
I think it was Calvin Klein's daughter saying

287
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,720
how disconcerting it was, you know,

288
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,360
the age where she was going to have her first boyfriend,

289
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:22,200
you know, seeing your dad's name on your boyfriend's boxer shorts.

290
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,360
I suppose that would have been, you know,

291
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,220
not dissimilar to you in Australia, wouldn't it?

292
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,659
With the Davenport boxers, everyone had them.

293
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:29,720
Yeah, well, fortunately that time,

294
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:32,259
my kids were probably two, four and six.

295
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:33,259
So it wasn't...

296
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:38,240
Having dad's name on would have been a challenging thing.

297
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,740
I mean, that's, Kai, when you think about, you know,

298
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:44,399
small business, people will tell you that the rate of failure is enormous.

299
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:48,240
When you look back and what sort of skills

300
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,179
and what sort of leadership do you think you brought

301
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:52,460
to the table that helped you succeed?

302
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,700
Can I put it in a slightly different way?

303
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,879
I mean, if someone came to me and said,

304
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,100
what do you need to start an entrepreneurial business?

305
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,320
I'd probably say, number one, have a strong idea.

306
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,360
Somehow you can differentiate yourself from other people out there.

307
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,120
There has to be a new product, a new way of doing things.

308
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
Then you have to sit back and ask yourself,

309
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
is it really scalable?

310
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,039
Because it's no use doing something that's not scalable.

311
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:28,779
So can I delve into that for a minute?

312
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:30,779
I love where you're going with this.

313
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,000
I mean, how do you analyse something?

314
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,039
I mean, for people to drill in a bit more and say,

315
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:37,419
hey, I've got this great idea.

316
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:38,879
I think people are going to love it.

317
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,879
I mean, you know scale is super important if you are going to succeed.

318
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:45,480
How do you get to understand that?

319
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,299
How did you go about that?

320
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,080
It's mainly by, you know, like these days you can get so much.

321
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,559
So much is online.

322
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,179
So much you can dredge up.

323
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:57,460
You look at Google and you can get so much information.

324
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,659
You can look at, I'm just trying to think of an example.

325
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,259
Well, I'll tell you an example.

326
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:09,279
I mean, even today I've just angel invested in a maternity business

327
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:17,019
with two young women who it's about, it's called theory or the reason why

328
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:23,019
and they do products for prenatal and postnatal women

329
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:25,759
that actually physiologically benefits them.

330
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,100
So they do, you know, compression tights that helps blood flow,

331
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,019
helps nourishing the baby, et cetera, et cetera.

332
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,240
Now.

333
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:35,179
Now, on my hand, you think, gee, well, how scalable is that?

334
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,100
Well, you can find out.

335
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:41,919
I mean, there's 400,000 babies born in Australia each year.

336
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,340
There's 4 million born in the US each year.

337
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,659
From a marketing perspective, it should be, you should be able to sort of narrow in.

338
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,059
It should be more rifle shot than scatter gun approach.

339
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,960
So, you know, it should be.

340
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:00,259
Really clear target market there, isn't it?

341
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,240
You know, you've got to go.

342
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:10,899
Therefore, so, you know, for us, if it had been just an opportunity in Australia,

343
00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:15,559
400,000 people, you know, reasonably expensive product because it does a job,

344
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,299
you know, it's very high quality.

345
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:23,960
So we probably need the international volume to make it reasonable,

346
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,759
even two times you, two times you.

347
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:30,879
Again, you know, it did remarkably well,

348
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:31,759
but it worked.

349
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:36,039
It wouldn't have been successful if we hadn't have taken a global approach to it.

350
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,220
So there's one example of saying, well, okay, it's scalable.

351
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,639
Well, it's somewhat scalable in Australia, but to make it really work,

352
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:45,500
it's got to be a global opportunity.

353
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,480
And you saw that from the start.

354
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:51,879
I mean, the two New Zealanders, an ex-triathlete and his mate come and tap on your door.

355
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,600
And at that stage, you know, you've sold out and you're a great success.

356
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,519
I mean, what did you see in two times you straight away?

357
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,860
Sportswear brands are everywhere.

358
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:00,379
Yeah.

359
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:01,240
What was the difference?

360
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,240
What clicked in your mind?

361
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:06,900
Well, that's a good question because it's another example of where you start

362
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,259
and where you finish are two different things.

363
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:14,079
I mean, we saw a big opportunity in triathlon because triathlon, swim, bike and run.

364
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,779
So, you know, there's four sports plus a triathlon.

365
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:22,380
I always made a joke with one of my partners who's a great triathlon guy.

366
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:27,259
I said, well, triathletes are the people who can't swim, can't run and can't cycle.

367
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,460
But, you know, they can do all of it a little bit together.

368
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,240
But anyway, he didn't appreciate it.

369
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:36,259
But we saw that as a real opportunity.

370
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,319
So, was that the initial thought?

371
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,259
If we own the triathlon space, there's a good enough business in that?

372
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,480
Yeah.

373
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:44,460
But internationally, we thought there was.

374
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:47,759
We thought we could get the run and the swim and so forth.

375
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,019
But swim was tiny.

376
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:58,599
And the other thing in our business, in all my businesses, passion always takes right of way.

377
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,240
If you're passionate about something,

378
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,240
you always give it a shot.

379
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:07,259
You always give it a go because even if you fail, we'll celebrate value.

380
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:08,940
But you've just got to get things done.

381
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,640
You've got to execute.

382
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,180
And it was a situation we built up the triathlon and we were global pretty well from day one.

383
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:18,079
But we weren't getting the volume we wanted.

384
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,059
We weren't, you know, swimwear or wetsuits wasn't quite enough.

385
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,500
Cycle we weren't quite getting to.

386
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,359
And I had no, then I saw, you know, compression.

387
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:37,359
And I thought, what a great business this compression is because, you know, it's all sports.

388
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:42,039
It's essentially one fabric across not too many skews.

389
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,460
We knew we could be the best in the world at it.

390
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,420
You know, our product developers were the best people in fabrics.

391
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,920
We knew we could be best in the world.

392
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,839
And that's important.

393
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,440
You've got to be known for that.

394
00:18:55,059 --> 00:19:01,140
I approached my two young partners and said, look, I want to do, I think we should do the compression.

395
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:03,420
It just suits us for all the reasons that I just gave you.

396
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,759
And they said, oh, I don't think so, Clyde.

397
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:12,500
I mean, it's, you know, it's, you know, we'd rather just stick to our, our, our triathlon, our swim, bike and run.

398
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:13,359
You know, we've got enough to do.

399
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,940
And I said, and this is where this passion comes in.

400
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:25,539
I said, listen, guys, if you felt passionate about something, whether I greeted it, believed in it or not, I'd give it a go.

401
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:28,859
I'd believe in it and I'd make it work as best as I, best I could.

402
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,059
Now, all I'm asking you.

403
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:34,059
Is you give me that same opportunity that I'll give you.

404
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,700
Now I could have easily, cause I had 80% of the business.

405
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:39,359
I could have easily said to them, just go and.

406
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,220
Go and make it happen.

407
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:40,880
Go and do it.

408
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:42,579
But it wouldn't have worked.

409
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,599
You had to get their, you had to get to their tie and their belief.

410
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:48,599
You know, they had to, they had to want to do it.

411
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:58,559
And so, you know, that's one example of this whole thing about, you know, growing a business.

412
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,779
It's about, I mean, you know, people say.

413
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:07,619
Um, you know, people say, well, how do you, how do you have a great business?

414
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:15,980
Well, you have a great business by one, having fantastic people and providing a environment where they flourish.

415
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:17,460
Now that's easy to say.

416
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,500
Gee, that's so bloody hard to do, you know, finding the right people.

417
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,160
There's so much wisdom, God, and so many places to go in that, in that conversation.

418
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,500
And you, and you, you were starting about, you know, it was almost advice to a young entrepreneur.

419
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,140
Yeah.

420
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:41,279
And I'd like to pick up on that for a moment, you know, have, having a great product, having the idea you can scale it, you know, passion, you know, without passion, you're not going to do the extra miles, are you?

421
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:41,480
No, no.

422
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,559
It just doesn't work.

423
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,960
What else was there on your list of that, that.

424
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,900
Well, you know, keep it simple.

425
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:52,619
Um, because again, um, people think complexity breeds success.

426
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,880
Not complexity does, it makes things harder, increases overheads and nothing happens.

427
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,900
So in that two-time view example was.

428
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:00,420
Oh.

429
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:00,500
Yeah.

430
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,140
We can be world's best.

431
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:01,779
Best in compression.

432
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,119
Yeah.

433
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:04,319
That's, you know, something we can achieve.

434
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,920
That doesn't have to be more complex than that.

435
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:06,299
No.

436
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,400
You know, that's a.

437
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:08,420
It's a simple product.

438
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,039
We do it well.

439
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,319
We do it better than anyone else.

440
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:18,519
Um, we, we don't, we don't, you know, go crazy on our, on our, on our breadth of products.

441
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:20,619
We just, we just keep it basic.

442
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,420
We keep it simple.

443
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:31,039
Um, and you know, people don't meet, but so many people think it's got to be complex to be good.

444
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,700
It's quite interesting.

445
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,539
It's, it's, I used to have, even the Davenport business, I used to have little A-frames on

446
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:39,420
my, on everyone's desk saying simplify.

447
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:44,420
I had, I had pads, yellow pads, because yellow was our color back in those days.

448
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,420
And I had simplify written on everyone's pads.

449
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:50,579
Half the time I said, can't you, can't you, uh, can't you read?

450
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:54,480
I mean, cause they weren't, you know, like, but it's, I just, people want to make things

451
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,960
complicated when it just increases the complexity and it more, and it reduces your speed.

452
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,460
To accident.

453
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,579
Cause you've got to be quick.

454
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:03,079
Yeah.

455
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:03,880
You've got to be quick.

456
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:09,960
I mean, um, we had, we had instances where, you know, I'd go into a, you know, going,

457
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,579
this is, I'm jumping around here, but going back to the Davenport days, we had instances,

458
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:18,460
I'd go into, have a, have a meeting with Meyer and the buyer was there saying, oh geez, Bond's

459
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,259
just let us down.

460
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:24,539
You know, they're supposed to deliver 10,000 pairs of boxer shorts to us before Christmas

461
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:25,420
and we can't do it.

462
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,460
And I'd say, I'd be thinking to myself, I know the factory I can use.

463
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,960
I know the fabric I can use.

464
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:39,720
Um, I'd say, we can do it, you know, we'll, we'll do your 10,000, um, and some way I don't

465
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,779
know, get back to the office and I'll tell the guys and they'd say, what the hell, how

466
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:43,779
are we going to do this?

467
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,180
And I said, well, we'll make it happen.

468
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,180
We'll just do it.

469
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,900
Uh, you know, we, I knew we could, we knew, I knew we could do it if we just focused on

470
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,900
it.

471
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,900
Yeah.

472
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,900
Don't make it too, too hard.

473
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,900
Yeah.

474
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,900
They're, they're great lessons, aren't they?

475
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
In, in, in, and it's funny, isn't it?

476
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,400
Because there's simplicity in the messages too.

477
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:00,900
Yeah.

478
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,400
And clearly it's something you, you, you stuck to as well, you know, and I, and I heard your

479
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,720
talk was also in the research for this about delegation in business that you need as opposed

480
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
to abdication.

481
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
Oh yeah.

482
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
Can you explain what you mean by that?

483
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
Yeah.

484
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:20,259
Um, yeah, look, um, you know, as business grows, you're gonna have more and more people

485
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:21,259
in the organization.

486
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:22,259
There's no question.

487
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:28,420
Um, um, you create an environment where they can all flourish, um, you must delegate because

488
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,039
unless you can delegate, then your business will never grow substantially.

489
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:36,240
You can't do everything yourself, so you've got to delegate, educate.

490
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,240
Um, but too many people make the mistake is delegating something and then just abdicating

491
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,240
their position.

492
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,240
Oh, I've told such and such to do something, so my job's done.

493
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,240
Mm.

494
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,240
Uh, every, every, every time you walk past them, how's that going?

495
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
How's that project going?

496
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,240
Have you, you know, have we got that delivery yet?

497
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Um, have you spoke to, uh, have you spoke to the, you know, to the buyer?

498
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,000
Oh, he said he'd call me back.

499
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
We'll call him again.

500
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,980
Like, you know, it's, um, look, there's nothing, there's nothing complex about business.

501
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:16,859
It's just, it's just being attentive, um, understanding your customer, follow up.

502
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:20,579
I mean, it's, there's no rocket science and yet it's just frustrating to see how many

503
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:23,599
people out there don't do it.

504
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:24,599
It's quite bizarre.

505
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:27,859
Well, you said before we started, uh, you know, you, you, you didn't, you didn't, you

506
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:32,200
didn't go down the traditional path and, and, um, but the fundamentals of what you're

507
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,099
saying, I mean, as you said, it's, uh, that you're not reinventing the wheel, but clearly

508
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:40,660
you followed through on those things and, and there's so much great wisdom in, in, in

509
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,660
that.

510
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,660
I'll, I'll go back to other things that, you know, you go from Davenport, which you do

511
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,519
yourself into a partnership, you're the major shareholder, but partnerships are complex

512
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:50,519
as well, aren't they?

513
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,519
Mm.

514
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,519
And, and a lot of partnerships break down.

515
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:53,519
You gave a great example, isn't it?

516
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,619
I, I could have just dictated, hey, we're going to do compression, but you, you collaborated,

517
00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:02,220
more than dictate, it sounds like, which again, lines up with, you know, where we see

518
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,220
the world heading.

519
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,380
What, what was the secret to that partnership being successful?

520
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:12,180
Oh, look, that, that was an extraordinary partnership because you essentially had, um,

521
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:20,119
three guys with three different, um, three different, um, talents, three different, um,

522
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,119
skill sets.

523
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,119
Yeah.

524
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,119
Three different, totally, skill sets.

525
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,420
You had, uh, Aiden, uh, was, uh, he's, he's come from a sales marketing background.

526
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:34,180
He, um, I call him our, our great snake or salesman, but he was, uh, I mean, he was,

527
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,920
he was one of the best sales guys I've ever come across.

528
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,920
So what made him so good?

529
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,920
Um, he just has empathy with people.

530
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:49,660
Um, you know, he's a great communicator, he's a great networker, um, he's a great guy, um,

531
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:56,019
he loves people, he loves, he loves, uh, he's passionate about what he does, um, he follows

532
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:57,019
up.

533
00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:00,880
He does, he just does all the things well and in a, in a really, you know, with a really

534
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,519
nice nature to go with it.

535
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,519
He's an enthusiast.

536
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:04,519
He's a, he's a team leader.

537
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:10,700
He's a, he's a, um, a cheerleader, uh, and is a cheerleader for the organization.

538
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,019
So you need those people in the company.

539
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:13,019
Yeah.

540
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:19,079
So you had, you had to go like that, um, and then you had Jamie who would just love product,

541
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,099
love, love product development, love fabrics.

542
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:25,779
I mean, he'd get, uh, if he, if he had a lot of fabrics on this table, he'd just, he'd

543
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:26,779
get off on, you know.

544
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:31,059
I mean, that, that's, that's, you know, denier rating of this and the quality of this and

545
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:32,559
the feel of that and the power of it.

546
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,700
I mean, it's, you know, he just loved that.

547
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:39,859
And then I was the sort of one who, I, I get a kick out of sales, uh, product and sales

548
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:42,460
or product and marketing.

549
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:47,740
So, and I was sort of the, I sort of kept the, the thing together.

550
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,440
Like, you know, I thought, you know, if you put, you know, and I've said, I'd say this

551
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,579
to his face, like Aiden, if you put Aiden in charge of, um, of expenses and, uh, I don't,

552
00:26:56,579 --> 00:27:00,039
uh, overhead, I said to him once, it'd be like putting Dracula in charge of the blood

553
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,039
bank.

554
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,039
You know, like he just, it's not his thing.

555
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:05,880
But so he has to, you know, you just sort of support that part of the business.

556
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:13,819
And Jamie, on the other hand, um, you know, Jamie's quite risk averse, um, so, but he

557
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:16,160
is also a good salesman because he knows his product.

558
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,539
So it was a, it was a group of people who came together with very different skill sets

559
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:24,700
that complimented each other remarkably well.

560
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,460
And as you described then it's, it's.

561
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:31,460
It's people knowing their roles and doing them really well and then being able to identify

562
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,460
that.

563
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,140
It sounds like you, you, you got that right from the start.

564
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,960
I mean, it was clearly that, that story you tell about, you know, going into compression,

565
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,920
which ends up being, you know, the fundamentals of the business, of the business effectively,

566
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
isn't it?

567
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,420
But were there conflicts along the way, did you have to, you know, resolve much or did

568
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,420
it?

569
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,420
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

570
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,420
Yeah.

571
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,420
Yeah.

572
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,420
Look, um, um, I shouldn't, I shouldn't quote it.

573
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,920
I mean, we had, um, you know, we'd have stand up arguments.

574
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Um.

575
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:02,920
Um, about all sorts of different things, um, but you know, it wasn't, it was never a problem

576
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:09,480
because it was, it was everyone's, I guess because we were three owners to an extent

577
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,160
and the success of the business impacted us each financially.

578
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,700
So although we had a lot of, you know, disputes, we never, um, we always resolve them, uh,

579
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,440
because we knew that everyone was trying to achieve the same, the same thing.

580
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,920
We just had different ideas how to get there.

581
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:35,880
Um, so, and, and we never, um, we never, you know, like I always had the greater shareholding,

582
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,920
but that was never, that was never discussed in an argument.

583
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:45,420
I never said, never ever said, you know, well, this is it, uh, you know, I've got the most

584
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,420
shareholding, so therefore I win.

585
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:53,920
Um, nor did, uh, um, you know, I always had a saying that, uh, no one's, you know, everyone's

586
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
got a right to a greater deal.

587
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,920
Yeah.

588
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,880
No one's got a monopoly on good ideas.

589
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,880
I mean, um, you know, if, if we got a guy in the warehouse had an idea, we'd embrace

590
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,359
it on marketing, we'd embrace it.

591
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:10,720
Um, we might've had an argument if I thought a product, uh, wasn't good or there's a better

592
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,859
way to do it over an argument with Jamie, but ultimately, um, we'd sort it out to see

593
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:19,279
who, you know, who the best idea wins, best idea wins.

594
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,819
Um, and people say that, uh, Clyde, but you know, to foster a culture where, you know,

595
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:25,579
the best idea wins.

596
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,920
You actually have to live that too, don't you, as you said.

597
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,200
And, and I always found that interesting, isn't it?

598
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,220
Big organizations, often the guy in the warehouse knows the product, you know, as well as anyone.

599
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:41,099
If they don't feel as though there's a forum to be able to have that thought, it, it, it,

600
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:44,019
it never comes to the surface and you miss out on good ideas, don't you?

601
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,779
I mean, you must've created a culture where people felt like they could put their hand

602
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:48,980
up and, and have a go.

603
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:54,099
Well, even more than that, Luke, because, you know, what I'd say to people is that if

604
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:55,720
we're not failing, we're not trying.

605
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,240
Um, you know, we, we'd celebrate fire.

606
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,039
I mean, you know, people come, look, when we weren't silly about it, like if someone

607
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,420
came to me and had this idea, it was going to like, it was put the, uh, financial would

608
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,019
financially stress the company.

609
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,720
Well, of course we wouldn't do it.

610
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:18,599
But if someone had a good idea and, you know, it wasn't a big, uh, financial burden, then

611
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,720
of course we'd give it a go.

612
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:23,180
And, and, and if it didn't work, we'd say, well, at least you gave it a go.

613
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:25,900
I mean, the one thing, the one thing that I think is important is that if you're not

614
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,119
doing it, the one thing we could not stand in business is procrastination.

615
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,859
Just can't stand it.

616
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,500
I mean, just.

617
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,339
You're about to launch on, um, and you're canning this war and go, yeah, have an effing

618
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:38,940
go, mate, I think is where you're going.

619
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,140
And, um, and I love it.

620
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,579
I mean, it's a great thing, isn't it?

621
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:46,359
To, to foster that culture around, you know, be bold enough to have a cray.

622
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,559
I mean, the Americans talk about failing fast, don't they?

623
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:48,920
Yeah.

624
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,140
Get, get on with it.

625
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,519
Learn really quickly.

626
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:55,319
Whereas in Australia, it seems as though we have got this fear of failure mentality.

627
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:55,880
Oh, it's tough.

628
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,339
It's awful.

629
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,039
Look, I mean, I, I, I, I see people that say, um, you know, I won't mention names, but there's,

630
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:06,119
there's, you know, I've had a guy, a girl, a guy and a girl kind of been saying, look,

631
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,579
um, I've tried this and, you know, it's not working.

632
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:13,660
Um, and, but I think I failed.

633
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,559
And, uh, I say, look, you haven't failed at all.

634
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,940
Have you, have you noticed that someone who never tries something never fails?

635
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:25,859
I mean, it's been like even in, you know, in sporting days, you know, when we were young,

636
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,859
when I was young, um, you know, my sports were swimming and water polo.

637
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:35,680
And I saw so many great swimmers and water polo players that didn't apply themselves that,

638
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,859
that could have been out and out champions.

639
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:43,059
But it seemed to be okay for them to say, well, I could have been as good as that guy if I had

640
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:45,319
trained, if I had trained harder.

641
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,720
Well, I mean, so what?

642
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:50,859
So have a red hot go and fail.

643
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,660
And there's, you know, you're not failing.

644
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:54,960
You're just, you know,

645
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,900
It's like ideas.

646
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:58,759
I mean, everyone has a great idea.

647
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:04,220
Lots of people have great ideas, but great ideas are worthless until you try and execute

648
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:04,500
it.

649
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:06,200
But no one wants to execute.

650
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,619
I mean, oh, I've got a, I've got a great idea.

651
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,759
I've got a great idea there.

652
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:12,339
Well, you know, so what?

653
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:15,420
The execution is a hard thing.

654
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,619
Everyone can have a good idea.

655
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:27,259
It's like, look, um, as I said, I mean, a lot of things I do, um, I did read a book, um,

656
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,740
uh, with Steven Sinek and some of the things.

657
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,119
Simon Sinek?

658
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,700
Simon Sinek.

659
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,059
Yeah.

660
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:39,420
And I, um, I'd be no good in the corporate, in, in corporate because a lot of things I do,

661
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:45,809
um, I do because I, it, it just feels, it feels right.

662
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:50,089
And I couldn't have, and Simon Sinek would say, well, that's because your ideas come

663
00:32:50,089 --> 00:32:53,349
to the limbic part of your brain and which has no ability to communicate.

664
00:32:54,029 --> 00:32:58,690
So I think I would never have succeeded in, in,

665
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:03,170
in corporate because a lot of the stuff that I do, I don't think I could communicate an

666
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:08,109
argument well enough to get my boss to, to do it.

667
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:14,420
Um, and a lot of the things I do are quite intuitive.

668
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:19,599
Now that's not to say that, um, you know, I do things in a scattered kind of approach,

669
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,859
but unless you give people, unless you, you know, leadership, unless you give people the

670
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:29,799
opportunity to, to not only come up with an idea, but,

671
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,859
more importantly, to execute the idea and fail, then, you know,

672
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,859
your organization's never going to be successful.

673
00:33:37,339 --> 00:33:45,259
Um, um, so look, I'm a person who, you know, I thrive in probably startups.

674
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:52,019
I thrive in, in smaller business, you know, up to from zero to 150 million,

675
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,579
but I don't think I'd be any good at the next level.

676
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:57,299
Um, because I need to be close to people.

677
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,140
Um, and I love your self-awareness,

678
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,299
Colin.

679
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:04,519
You know yourself so well, and, and, and you obviously were able to do that at a young

680
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:09,519
age and pick the path that was going to work for you, uh, you know, along that, along that

681
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:09,860
journey.

682
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:14,139
And as you can see, the, the, the sort of the passion to understand that and to, you

683
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:18,179
know, every pub and bar around the country and around the world is littered with people

684
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,059
that could have been something.

685
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,079
And that was my pet, uh, hate too, to be honest with you, playing sport for a living,

686
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:26,400
Colin, in the early days, you'd always go back to where you grew up and so on and so

687
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:26,500
on.

688
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,099
So, you know, my old Billy was a much better player than you and he could have been, and

689
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:33,199
he didn't, you know, you didn't want to sort of, you know, egotistically say, well,

690
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:36,500
no, he couldn't have been because he didn't train hard enough and he didn't do any of

691
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:36,619
it.

692
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,340
He never had a go.

693
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:39,519
So, um, I did.

694
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:44,199
That was why, now, you know, there were plenty of people better at it than me, but it wasn't

695
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:48,960
through lack of having a go, putting yourself in the arena, is it, and trying and far, and

696
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,980
then you find success along the way, you know, that you launch something and you have a go.

697
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:56,340
Definition of success to me, it's always about this outcome to sit here at the end with Clyde

698
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,780
and say, he sold the business for multi-million dollars and that's success.

699
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,059
But you,

700
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:02,460
you must, the success happens along the way too, doesn't it?

701
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,000
Without getting to that point.

702
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,800
And, and success is the journey.

703
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:06,219
Yeah.

704
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,019
You know, people talk about the journey.

705
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:13,380
I mean, which, you know, some of the things, like when I say, like today, if I was speaking,

706
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,500
I'd be saying I pivoted.

707
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,320
Well, don't you hate this, this jargon stuff?

708
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:25,840
Um, uh, you know, the, the success, I mean, when I look back on my career, I mean, the

709
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,840
most enjoyable times were, were some of the early days and the hardest days.

710
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:34,400
And, you know, it's not about, you know, if you go into a business with the view of

711
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,940
ultimately making money, then you'll never do any well.

712
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You go into business because you love it, you enjoy it, you can make a difference, you're

713
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,340
passionate.

714
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,679
And, you know, if you're lucky, the by-product would be, um, financial, some financial success.

715
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:52,139
And you hear that a lot, Clyde, for, for, you know, anyone in a startup, you know, it's

716
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:56,920
that nerve wracking time and you're going for it and you're just, I just give anything

717
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,300
for sustained success at that point in time.

718
00:35:59,300 --> 00:35:59,579
Yeah.

719
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:00,079
But, but.

720
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:04,559
But the amount of people we sit back and think the happiest time for them was in that, as

721
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:08,519
you said, you're running around cutting a bit of fabric together, you're on the table,

722
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:10,280
you look back with, with.

723
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:13,820
They're the great, they're the great times you look back on.

724
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:18,039
You look back on the times when, you know, you've got to get an order out, you're, you're

725
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:23,119
in a, you're in a factory, you're, you're helping, you know, roll out the fabric and

726
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,420
cut the fabric with the, with the, the workers in the, in the factory.

727
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,860
You know, you're there till, you know, three in the morning.

728
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,679
You have quick shower, you know, jump in your car, you, you take the samples or the

729
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:35,880
product to the, to the retailer or whatever.

730
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:42,059
They're the things that you look back on, on exceptionally fondly.

731
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:49,579
I mean, at the time that they're very stressful, but, you know, they're the best times, you

732
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:50,780
know, they're the best times in hindsight.

733
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:55,559
I'm thinking of my great friend, Craig Ellis Clyde, who played with at the Bulldogs and

734
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:57,099
he, I'll never forget the call.

735
00:36:57,099 --> 00:36:59,699
I interviewed him on this podcast, but he rang me.

736
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:03,480
And he said, I'm moving to Hong Kong, starting a bikini business.

737
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,840
I've met a girl on a beach and, and, you know, we're going to try and sell online bikini.

738
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,179
I thought that's the craziest idea I've ever heard in my life.

739
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,280
But you talk to him and he'd been 10 years of prior to that and had success and failure

740
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,139
and understood manufacturing.

741
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,880
So there's a lot of experience behind that story, but the creativity of understanding,

742
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:26,099
you know, neoprene as a fabric that he was going to use, it's, it's, it's, you know,

743
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:29,300
it went next level, you know, with some really clever, you know,

744
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,139
really clever marketing and using social media, you know.

745
00:37:32,139 --> 00:37:33,639
Yeah, that was amazing.

746
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:38,599
I mean, I actually looked at that because when he came around to, this is a number of

747
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:42,679
years ago, he, he came, he was looking to sell.

748
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,000
I don't know what he's, did he sell it in the end?

749
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:45,699
No, he hasn't.

750
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,420
No, he hasn't.

751
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:51,280
So, and, and I looked at it and I thought, what a great, what a great story this guy's

752
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,440
got.

753
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,760
I mean, you know, it's phenomenal.

754
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:59,079
But the reason I didn't get in.

755
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:04,400
Well, you know, that he, he created a phenomenal business.

756
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:10,340
I had a question mark over, you know, the sustainability, just as I had a question mark

757
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,380
over when I started Boxer Short.

758
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,699
So I'm not, that's no criticism.

759
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,179
His job was to actually, and I hope he has, his job was to take that triangle, I think

760
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:19,860
it was called triangle.

761
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:28,400
Because he was, you know, he was pioneering that whole social, you know, digital, you

762
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,840
know, get it out on the right people.

763
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,579
It's fantastic.

764
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:38,219
Um, but he really, uh, you know, you really need to keep evolving.

765
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:42,079
Um, you need to find the next triangle, the next product.

766
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:42,400
Yeah.

767
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:43,920
And I don't know what he's done.

768
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:44,219
Yeah.

769
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,380
Look at, they, um, he won't mind me saying, you know, it was him and his partner at the

770
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:48,539
time.

771
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:53,619
They had two kids, they separated and then, uh, Aaron and, uh, and, uh, and Craig.

772
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:58,300
So they, you know, the business ended up going and he probably would, you know, without speaking

773
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,920
for him, Claude, would resonate with you.

774
00:38:59,920 --> 00:38:59,980
Yeah.

775
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah.

776
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,019
Yeah.

777
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:00,039
Yeah.

778
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:00,059
Yeah.

779
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:00,079
Yeah.

780
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:00,099
Yeah.

781
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:00,119
Yeah.

782
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:00,139
Yeah.

783
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:00,159
Yeah.

784
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:00,179
Yeah.

785
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:00,199
Yeah.

786
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:00,219
Yeah.

787
00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:00,260
Yeah.

788
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:00,280
Yeah.

789
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:00,300
Yeah.

790
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:01,139
Yeah.

791
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:01,159
Yeah.

792
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:01,360
Yeah.

793
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:01,380
Yeah.

794
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:01,420
Yeah.

795
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:01,539
Yeah.

796
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:01,659
Yeah.

797
00:39:01,659 --> 00:39:01,679
Yeah.

798
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:01,699
Yeah.

799
00:39:01,699 --> 00:39:01,900
Yeah.

800
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:07,440
And, uh, taking off, he's a creative genius in the sustainable going forward model.

801
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:13,099
That's a different person, but, you know, triangle's got an enormous, uh, uptake still and, and

802
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:14,500
put great people in place.

803
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,699
And then he comes back in with the creativity, uh, stuff.

804
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,159
So they have crossed that bridge that you were talking about.

805
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,260
And I think he was asking himself the same question too, you know, and for him, a bit

806
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,500
like you, is the passion there to keep doing it?

807
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,300
It sounds like when you sold Davenport was the same deal.

808
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,519
It's like the passion's run out.

809
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:34,480
But that, that's become, uh, you know, a lot of parallels, I think, to, to your world.

810
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:37,000
I heard you speak before about angel investing.

811
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,320
Does that still, do you still have, you know, things that come across your desk that you,

812
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,260
you're inspired by?

813
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:42,940
Oh yeah.

814
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,440
And I love it.

815
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:49,559
I mean, I, I quite often, um, you see lots of stuff coming across your desk and there's

816
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:54,199
nothing better to, um, to get involved with, with younger people in, in business, even,

817
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,039
even for coffee.

818
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:59,300
I mean, stacks of times I, I would, uh, if someone calls me.

819
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:06,079
I think that's another thing that young entrepreneurs should think about is that, um, people like

820
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,239
to help, you know, a lot of, a lot of young, a lot of kids sort of think, well, I can't

821
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:13,099
impose on that person, but people love to help.

822
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,239
So, you know, get all the help you can, you know, ask.

823
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,900
I mean, again, in the worst case scenario, you'd get a, a no.

824
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,039
Um, and as I said earlier, no, no is always no for now.

825
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,780
Um, but, um, I just forget where we were.

826
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,179
Well, it's funny.

827
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:29,199
It's funny.

828
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:29,239
It's funny.

829
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:29,280
It's funny.

830
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:29,780
It's funny, isn't it, Clive?

831
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,860
Because I, I, I, you know, um, reached out to you.

832
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,960
People had mentioned you many times in these conversations and podcasts.

833
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,539
It's the same story, isn't it?

834
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:41,400
I, I, I, I contacted you on LinkedIn and you told me, uh, you never, never use it.

835
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:41,579
No, no.

836
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:42,119
So it was a miracle.

837
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,940
But, uh, if it turns out we probably live five or 600 meters apart potentially, uh,

838
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,940
and so you're right.

839
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,059
You know, you're going to get no's.

840
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:50,739
Some people just aren't interested in doing it.

841
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,400
But on with you.

842
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,400
People genuinely like to help and want to, and want to pass on their wisdom.

843
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:55,539
Yeah.

844
00:40:55,659 --> 00:40:58,340
And, and particularly with young, young guys that, young guys and girls that want to have

845
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:58,679
a go.

846
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,239
I mean, you're long.

847
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:02,679
Always sort of sit down and sort of give them some time and give them some help if

848
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:03,039
you can.

849
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,260
Um, occasionally you'll invest in their business.

850
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:11,639
Um, but only if, uh, only if they need it.

851
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:14,639
I mean, most people would come to me for finance.

852
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:19,199
I'd say, well, look, you know, if you can get it from, the best place to get finance

853
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:19,980
is from your bank.

854
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:24,840
I mean, if you can get, if you can keep partners out of it, um, do it.

855
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:29,219
I mean, I say that, um, but I had two young partners, but that was a different stage.

856
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:29,280
Yeah.

857
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,239
Of my, my, um, career.

858
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:36,320
Um, I'd never have a partner in my first business, the second business.

859
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,679
Was there a, when going back to the early day, I'm asking that question because, you

860
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:42,239
know, clearly you're able to do it on your own, but you were six weeks away.

861
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,860
If I, if I read that right around, maybe going back to advertising.

862
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,159
Yeah.

863
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:49,519
I mean, how tempting was it then to try and get some money to, to keep it going?

864
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:52,940
Or were you of the opinion, I need to do this without extra partners?

865
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:58,960
No, look, I have a, I have a view that within a year, a year to 18 months, you should be

866
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,980
able to tell whether this, this idea's got legs or not.

867
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:03,300
Yeah.

868
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,920
Um, and as much as I'd say, be persistent and give it a crack.

869
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:17,159
The other thing I'd say is that if it's not working, um, and you've given it a real red

870
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,840
hot crack, know when to move on.

871
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,280
Yeah.

872
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,880
Know when to move on because you don't want to bury, make you, dig yourself a hole that's

873
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,519
so big that you can't get out of it.

874
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:27,340
And have you done that in other spaces?

875
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:28,860
Have you got to the point with something?

876
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:28,880
Yeah.

877
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,800
Somewhere you've gone, okay, look, you know, it's not going to work.

878
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,260
Oh yeah.

879
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:32,639
Yeah.

880
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,340
Yeah, definitely.

881
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:40,179
Um, you know, it, it happens and, uh, um, you've got to know when to, when to exit.

882
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:46,820
I mean, everyone will tell you the, the, the good stuff, but, um, you know, any businessman,

883
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:52,860
um, you know, throughout, throughout Davenport, throughout, uh, two times a year, we made

884
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:58,900
lots of mistakes where we lost money, um, but never enough to put us in, you know, if

885
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:58,940
I'm not mistaken.

886
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:05,579
And, and even you can, you might say to yourself, well, why did you, um, why did you in two times

887
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:08,360
you, why did you, uh, sell down?

888
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,300
Cause we sold down twice.

889
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,760
Well, almost three times, um, the third time to the last investor.

890
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:20,619
But, and the reason, um, you know, if that had been the first business, I probably wouldn't

891
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:21,320
have sold down.

892
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:28,940
But, um, we sold down in that case, uh, the first time not to, uh, you know, to, you know,

893
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,760
not that we needed more money into the business, but we wanted to de-risk the business somewhat.

894
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,460
So we wanted to take some money out, particularly the young guys who'd worked for, you know,

895
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:43,840
for about three years on, on, um, you know, not a great salary or, you know, sweat equity.

896
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:47,460
Um, they wanted to sort of take a bit of risk off the table.

897
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,099
Um, that's what they did.

898
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:56,440
Um, uh, and it worked, uh, because the, the people who got involved both, um, you know,

899
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,780
Tanara, John Wiley's group.

900
00:43:58,179 --> 00:43:58,940
Um, they, um, they, um, they, um, they, um, they, um, they, um, they, um, they, um, they,

901
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,400
they were great.

902
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:06,559
And then, uh, El Capital, um, uh, they were part of the Louis Vuitton group, um, and they

903
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:07,300
were very beneficial.

904
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:09,440
Biggest retailer in the world as a partner.

905
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:10,500
I'll give you one example.

906
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:17,679
Um, uh, we just, we're just about, we just signed a lease in, uh, Newport Beach in, in

907
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:20,420
LA for a new, uh, a new store.

908
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:25,519
And, and we were, um, uh, I think we had a cut, I can't remember the exact figures.

909
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:27,780
I think it was a two or $300,000 fit out.

910
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:28,500
Um.

911
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,320
Um, contribution from the, from the landlord or from the center.

912
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:38,380
Um, we had a guy from Louis Vuitton, uh, when they bought in on our board.

913
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:45,280
Anyway, the, the, uh, the, uh, retailer, uh, the center said, oh, well, you've changed

914
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,840
your, uh, you've changed your, um, ownership more than I think it was 15%.

915
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:54,480
So we're going to, you can continue to be in the center, but we don't have to give you

916
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,300
the, um, the fit out, the fit out contribution.

917
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,920
Um, and I said, well, why?

918
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,579
Well, you know, we've, you know, we're in the best financial position we've ever been.

919
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:03,380
You should be, you should be happy, you know?

920
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:03,619
Yeah.

921
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,860
You're saying you're not going to pay the contribution.

922
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:07,059
No, we don't have to.

923
00:45:07,659 --> 00:45:12,199
So I made a call to, uh, I made a call to, uh, one of the, the director and I said, listen,

924
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,079
we've got this trouble.

925
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:14,739
And he said, leave it with me.

926
00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:20,739
And, uh, I wasn't party to the conversation that he had, but I can imagine it went something

927
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:21,380
like this.

928
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,599
Do you want Louis Vuitton?

929
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:26,420
Uh, do you want, uh, uh, Tag Heuer?

930
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:27,280
Do you want Dior?

931
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:30,780
Um, do you want, uh, I don't know.

932
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,599
Every other brand in the shopping center.

933
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:33,340
In the shopping center.

934
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:34,159
It was fixed.

935
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:34,920
Yeah.

936
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:35,619
So.

937
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,599
The contribution was paid and so taking the right partner on, not only did.

938
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:39,780
Yeah.

939
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:40,099
Yeah.

940
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:42,500
So they were, they were sort of, they were very helpful.

941
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:43,760
Um.

942
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:45,659
Ah, brilliant story, Colm.

943
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:50,420
These questions probably will sound, uh, formal for you because I love it.

944
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,760
And that's why I love speaking to different people.

945
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,219
When you, you've, you've, you've tread your own path and you said to me at the start of

946
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:57,099
this, you didn't, you've never really had a business plan.

947
00:45:57,159 --> 00:45:57,280
It's.

948
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,460
You know, but you, the intelligence of your intuition you can see and, and how you've

949
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:04,099
been able to create that success is, is fascinating to me.

950
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:08,559
But we're fascinated about what leadership looks like from different people when, you

951
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:13,239
know, whether it's you starting out in advertising and continuing retail success or people in

952
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:13,820
social venture.

953
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,880
And we're seeing there is a pattern of different leadership and, and, and the first dimension

954
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,219
that we, we're, we're seeing is this idea of self leadership that you can have to lead

955
00:46:23,219 --> 00:46:25,719
yourself first before you can lead others.

956
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:27,159
When I say that to you.

957
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,199
What, what does that mean?

958
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:34,110
Um, look, what does it mean?

959
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:40,849
I, I think, I think there's so many different, as you say, there's so many different leadership

960
00:46:40,849 --> 00:46:41,570
styles.

961
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:45,230
There's so many ways to, to motivate staff.

962
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:49,670
Um, there's so many different cultures.

963
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:57,710
Um, I think you have to have a, a leadership style, a culture and a way of doing things

964
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:58,750
that suits you.

965
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,530
You have to have your own personality.

966
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:05,670
Like for example, my leadership style is, is collaboration.

967
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:11,070
It's trying to nurture, it's, it's support, it's help, it's, it's, um, giving permission

968
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,070
to fail.

969
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:16,989
Um, it's selling my ideas.

970
00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:24,550
Um, someone else's leadership style may be, um, well, I'm the leader, uh, I'm the general,

971
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,530
you know, this is, this is the plan.

972
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:27,429
And I want all you, you people out there to follow.

973
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:27,449
Yeah.

974
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:27,510
Yeah.

975
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:27,530
Yeah.

976
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:27,570
Yeah.

977
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:27,590
Yeah.

978
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:27,670
Yeah.

979
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:27,690
Yeah.

980
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:27,750
Yeah.

981
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:27,809
Yeah.

982
00:47:27,809 --> 00:47:27,869
Yeah.

983
00:47:27,869 --> 00:47:27,929
Yeah.

984
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:27,969
Yeah.

985
00:47:27,969 --> 00:47:27,989
Yeah.

986
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:28,050
Yeah.

987
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:28,090
Yeah.

988
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:28,130
Yeah.

989
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:28,150
Yeah.

990
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:28,170
Yeah.

991
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:28,190
Yeah.

992
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:28,210
Yeah.

993
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:28,230
Yeah.

994
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:28,250
Yeah.

995
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:28,289
Yeah.

996
00:47:28,289 --> 00:47:28,369
Yeah.

997
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:29,190
Yeah.

998
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:29,210
Yeah.

999
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:29,309
Yeah.

1000
00:47:29,309 --> 00:47:29,349
Yeah.

1001
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:29,409
Yeah.

1002
00:47:29,409 --> 00:47:29,429
Yeah.

1003
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:29,449
Yeah.

1004
00:47:29,449 --> 00:47:29,469
Yeah.

1005
00:47:29,469 --> 00:47:29,510
Yeah.

1006
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:29,769
Yeah.

1007
00:47:29,769 --> 00:47:29,909
Yeah.

1008
00:47:29,909 --> 00:47:30,309
Yeah.

1009
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:30,329
Yeah.

1010
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:30,349
Yeah.

1011
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:30,389
Yeah.

1012
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,590
Well, it's just not my personality.

1013
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:38,329
Um, it could very well work and, you know, particularly in times of crisis, I understand

1014
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:42,789
that, that, that leadership style perhaps is the right one.

1015
00:47:42,889 --> 00:47:46,570
I mean, if you're going into battle, you can't have, you know, five different people sort

1016
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:48,150
of telling you, well, what should we do now?

1017
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:58,289
Um, but also I, I take accountability as a leader and the people who, you know, in,

1018
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:03,789
in business report to me, um, I asked them to take accountability for what they do.

1019
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:12,909
Um, but I don't shirk away from, I don't abdicate that responsibility either. Um, so look, I don't

1020
00:48:12,909 --> 00:48:17,170
know if that answers your question, but, um, it does. Yeah, really clearly. I think you got such

1021
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:21,469
a clear understanding of who you are and not trying to be someone else. And I think that's

1022
00:48:21,469 --> 00:48:25,670
where a lot of us fall, fall down, isn't it? Where you go, geez, I want to be a success like

1023
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:32,329
Clyde Davenport or a success like, uh, however it is. And you're really not being true to who

1024
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:35,849
you are and your own values. And so I get that from you, that sense of your own values and then

1025
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:40,730
applying that and also, you know, collaborating with other skillsets to support you is, it sounds

1026
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:44,590
like a really, really clear. Actually, someone asked me once what motivates me. And I said,

1027
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:51,789
I thought about it for a few minutes and I said, a healthy level of insecurity, um, which I probably

1028
00:48:51,789 --> 00:48:55,369
still believe that today. Um, so I'm not a person who, um,

1029
00:48:55,670 --> 00:49:00,309
thinks I know, know it all. I mean, I think I'm a person who, um,

1030
00:49:01,849 --> 00:49:10,210
you know, has a, has a sort of a intuition about how to do things, but will ask for help and

1031
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:15,650
support where I need it and not be, um, not be egotistical enough to think that I know it all

1032
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:21,130
because I certainly don't. I love that line, a healthy level of insecurity in the current world

1033
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:25,550
of, you know, of mental health being such a, a thing we're all aware of.

1034
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:30,190
And, you know, sitting down with a number of different people on this podcast and talking

1035
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:35,690
about, well, it's mental health is a continuum for everyone. And so anxiety is really helpful

1036
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:39,769
in one level, if you've got it at a healthy level, as you described, because that's what

1037
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:43,269
motivates you, doesn't it? It gets you off the board. Can I be good enough to do this? Can I

1038
00:49:43,269 --> 00:49:47,449
create two times you? Can I, you know, I've put some money in, am I going to make that a success?

1039
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:51,650
So without any of that, you haven't got motivation at all, have you? And so.

1040
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:55,610
And one of the, one of the, you know, one of the failings I have, and I recognize it and I try,

1041
00:49:55,670 --> 00:50:02,409
and I've got many failings, but one of them that I recognize is that often when we have success,

1042
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:07,530
rather than celebrate the success straight away, I think, shit, how, how are we going to,

1043
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:11,369
how are we going to duplicate the success next year? What are we going to do to get the numbers

1044
00:50:11,369 --> 00:50:18,210
next year? So, and I guess that's sort of this sort of, you know, not being brazen enough or

1045
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:21,070
bold enough to think, oh, we can do it. I think, shit, how are we going to do this?

1046
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:21,650
How are we going to do it again?

1047
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:22,489
How are we going to do it again?

1048
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:25,570
But you're comfortable celebrating failure, where there's a real strength, isn't it?

1049
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:25,650
Mm-hmm.

1050
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:29,550
It sounds like. It's, it's fascinating. And in the sporting context, Clive, that's really

1051
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:33,989
changed. Like, there's always this, unless you win the premiership or the ultimate prize,

1052
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:38,309
you can't celebrate at all. And we know that's a really unhealthy thing. You know,

1053
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:42,349
when you win in a week, you've got to celebrate to get that feeling again. And there's been a

1054
00:50:42,349 --> 00:50:47,250
real shift now in understanding to celebrate those, those wins along the way. The next

1055
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:52,150
dimension is we see leaders who've had great success. Like, you're really conscious around

1056
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:55,309
how they positively impact others in their environment.

1057
00:50:55,309 --> 00:50:58,030
And how did you go about that in your, in your world?

1058
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:06,130
Oh, look, you've got to care for people. You know, people aren't just, people aren't just

1059
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:10,730
employees of numbers. They're, they're people. They're, they're, they're associates. They're

1060
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:20,010
friends. They're, they're, and unless you, unless you support the person, you know, you

1061
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:23,389
won't, you know, you won't have a good business. You've got to be genuine. If someone's in

1062
00:51:23,389 --> 00:51:25,230
need, you've got to support them. I mean, you talk about the

1063
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:29,150
mental health, health issue. If someone's struggling, you've got to get around them

1064
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:34,449
and support them. You just don't cast them at a drift or say, well, you know, harden

1065
00:51:34,449 --> 00:51:40,949
up, get on with it. You've got to find out, you've got to understand beyond the, beyond

1066
00:51:40,949 --> 00:51:49,510
the workplace. You know, what are the, like, does the, does the, the male or female have

1067
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:53,409
issues at home? You know, you know, they have elderly parents. So how are they going with

1068
00:51:53,409 --> 00:51:54,409
their, with their kids?

1069
00:51:55,230 --> 00:52:04,170
I mean, it's, you know, where you can, I think you've got to show empathy. I like all

1070
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:11,710
our people to be showing, to be humble. I can't stand, I can't stand people who are

1071
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:18,789
like, you know, we've had people in the organization who, you know, were more interested in, you

1072
00:52:18,789 --> 00:52:25,210
know, brand, their own brand, brand, you know, brand X, brand, their name. I won't mention,

1073
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:30,269
brand their name, brand their name, rather than the brand two times you. But we try and

1074
00:52:30,269 --> 00:52:41,090
move them on pretty quickly because, you know, you want to, you want to, you know, people

1075
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:44,809
call it culture, but if you don't create an environment where, where people are comfortable,

1076
00:52:44,989 --> 00:52:54,110
people aren't afraid to make decisions, people celebrate failure and success, then, you know,

1077
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:58,750
environments I've worked in, it, it doesn't work.

1078
00:52:59,130 --> 00:52:59,489
Yeah.

1079
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:00,769
It just doesn't work, you know.

1080
00:53:02,909 --> 00:53:06,989
And you identify people like that pretty quickly and you're not the right fit for us. You're

1081
00:53:06,989 --> 00:53:07,969
not going to be helpful.

1082
00:53:07,969 --> 00:53:11,769
Yeah. And you've got to, and they're tough. I mean, they're tough conversations because

1083
00:53:11,769 --> 00:53:17,989
if someone has to move on from the organization, I mean, generally it's, it's, they're not,

1084
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:22,829
you know, they're not working out for you. You know, they're not enjoying it. And, you

1085
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:25,170
know, the discussion, you know, where I've had to get involved with, you know, I've had

1086
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:29,309
to get involved and move people on, which is, you know, no one gets used to that. It's

1087
00:53:29,309 --> 00:53:37,070
awful. But the reality is ultimately, um, the person in that position, uh, will thrive

1088
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:40,730
somewhere else. So it's not, you know, they're not working for us, but they'll thrive somewhere

1089
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:41,090
else.

1090
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:45,010
Andrew Bassett on this podcast from Seek, you know, that's their business and, and he,

1091
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:49,889
that's exactly the language he used. It's the fit's not right here. We've done everything

1092
00:53:49,889 --> 00:53:54,650
we can to explore that. You know, we genuinely wish you well. There will be a space that,

1093
00:53:54,849 --> 00:53:54,889
um,

1094
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:59,570
and whatever we can do to support that we would like to do. But, you know, he talked

1095
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:03,050
about hiring slowly and firing quickly was the language he used.

1096
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:07,550
And it's difficult. I mean, because, I mean, to be honest with you, I mean, uh, you know,

1097
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:13,150
fortunately, uh, um, as we built up, you know, as I've been in organizations where we've

1098
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:18,369
built up at the start, you do a lot of that. Um, but fortunately then you have, uh, you

1099
00:54:18,369 --> 00:54:24,369
know, key, key people in, in places where, um, some of that gets offloaded.

1100
00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:28,349
Offloaded to others, to others, which, uh, because no one enjoys it. I mean, that is

1101
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:28,949
all good stuff.

1102
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:29,550
Nah.

1103
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:34,489
But it, it, but it, but as, uh, Andrew Bassett would say, I mean, it's, it's the best for

1104
00:54:34,489 --> 00:54:37,369
the candidate. It's the best for the company, but it's hard conversations.

1105
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:40,590
And it is just the reality of, of any business, isn't it? You're not going to be a hundred

1106
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:43,690
percent, are you? You're going to have people come through no matter how good your, your

1107
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:47,869
policy is, you, you know, but it's identifying. And as you said, it's not, when you've got

1108
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:49,769
empathy, it's not fun, is it? It's not.

1109
00:54:49,969 --> 00:54:54,349
No. And the thing is, is that, you know, interviews are so hard. I mean, um, you know, you've got

1110
00:54:54,369 --> 00:54:58,369
to, you know, there's, uh, you know, some people are very good at interviewing. Other

1111
00:54:58,369 --> 00:55:06,369
people are terrible. Um, but it's, uh, it's finding, you know, like, and, you know, um,

1112
00:55:06,909 --> 00:55:11,170
the Americans are so polished when they interview. I mean, it's quite extraordinary how they,

1113
00:55:11,309 --> 00:55:15,809
they sound fantastic. And some, you know, I'm not saying they're not, but they do it

1114
00:55:15,809 --> 00:55:17,570
better than a lot of Aussies, I think.

1115
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:29,829
Incredibly articulate, aren't they? The Americans, they, uh, can sell their messages as well

1116
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:30,250
as anyone.

1117
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:30,730
Yeah.

1118
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:30,750
Yeah.

1119
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:30,769
Yeah.

1120
00:55:30,769 --> 00:55:30,789
Yeah.

1121
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:30,849
Yeah.

1122
00:55:30,849 --> 00:55:30,869
Yeah.

1123
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:30,889
Yeah.

1124
00:55:30,889 --> 00:55:30,909
Yeah.

1125
00:55:30,909 --> 00:55:30,929
Yeah.

1126
00:55:30,929 --> 00:55:30,949
Yeah.

1127
00:55:30,949 --> 00:55:30,969
Yeah.

1128
00:55:30,969 --> 00:55:30,989
Yeah.

1129
00:55:30,989 --> 00:55:31,030
Yeah.

1130
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:31,050
Yeah.

1131
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:31,110
Yeah.

1132
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:31,190
Yeah.

1133
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:31,230
Yeah.

1134
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:31,329
Yeah.

1135
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:31,409
Yeah.

1136
00:55:31,409 --> 00:55:31,690
Yeah.

1137
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:32,349
Yeah.

1138
00:55:32,349 --> 00:55:32,670
Yeah.

1139
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:32,690
Yeah.

1140
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:33,090
Yeah.

1141
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:33,110
Yeah.

1142
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:33,610
Yeah.

1143
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:37,329
And I think, you know, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're being really aware and conscious

1144
00:55:37,329 --> 00:55:38,289
of how they create and share the vision for what they want to do. And it sounds like you've

1145
00:55:38,289 --> 00:55:42,630
been really clear on that in the spaces you've been in, and you shared a little bit of that

1146
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:46,550
before around, you know, how you've gone about stuff at two times. Is that right?

1147
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:48,909
Creating and sharing a vision. How did you go about that?

1148
00:55:50,610 --> 00:56:00,730
Um, I think, I think, um, I think like most things, uh, when you, you start with a, you

1149
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:03,989
you have a clear vision when you start a, when you start a business, you have a clear

1150
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:11,849
vision. Um, you have to bring everyone along with you. You have to, you have to continually,

1151
00:56:11,849 --> 00:56:20,469
um, remind people, educate people. Um, you know, every company has a story they've got

1152
00:56:20,469 --> 00:56:27,510
to tell, a product they've got to sell. Um, but it can change. And I think, I think the

1153
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:33,949
thing is, is that if there are changes along the way, you have to bring in the whole business

1154
00:56:33,949 --> 00:56:44,119
to understand the changes. Like, I'm just trying to think, like, um, well, uh, well

1155
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:50,960
even with, um, even with, uh, let's take two times you. We started off with, with triathlon,

1156
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:55,079
swim, bike and run. And that was going okay, but it wasn't, it didn't have the sort of

1157
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:58,360
the massive growth we were, we expected. Then along came, um,

1158
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:07,219
um, uh, compression, two times your compression. So, um, the vision had changed slightly. The

1159
00:57:07,219 --> 00:57:12,300
vision had changed from, you know, well, it hasn't changed. I mean, we wanted to be the

1160
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:17,079
first Australian global sportswear brand. You know, Australia's been known for a lot

1161
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:21,500
of things. It's, you know, from surfing, they've got great sportsmen, but they, we don't have

1162
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,820
a global, or we didn't have a global sportswear brand. So we wanted to.

1163
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:27,079
So the Rip Curls and, had done it in the surf space.

1164
00:57:27,099 --> 00:57:27,639
Surf space.

1165
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:28,500
No one had done it.

1166
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:28,900
But none had done it in the.

1167
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,940
In the, in a, um, in a sporting space. And yet we've got the best sporting teams in the

1168
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,900
world. I mean, it's, that's crazy. So that's what we.

1169
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,960
So you identified that and thought there's a, there's a, there's a gap here.

1170
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:39,260
Yeah.

1171
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:43,699
And, and how big was it, you know, Kanye West is in the news a lot, but you suddenly got

1172
00:57:43,699 --> 00:57:49,460
US Navy SEALs and you, you got international sporting team. Was that a big boost to it

1173
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,179
when they adopted the product? Was it?

1174
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:55,119
Yeah. And it, it, you know, you've got to have authenticity. You've got to have belief.

1175
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:58,639
I mean, the, the Navy SEAL was a funny one. Um, Aiden,

1176
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:06,440
um, Aiden, you know, was at our LA office and, uh, um, somehow got introduced to a guy

1177
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:13,739
called Jeff Nichols, who was a ex Navy SEAL out of SEAL Team Six. And we were, um, he

1178
00:58:13,739 --> 00:58:20,900
by chance, um, in, because he was really big into recovery. He by chance had tested all

1179
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:26,639
the different, uh, compression ranges out there. Um, and ours was best by far. I mean,

1180
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:28,739
the likes of, so you've got to understand the likes of Nike and Adidas.

1181
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,480
Adidas, they all did compression ranges, but they'll bring out a shoe range, which

1182
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:38,900
is, which is, you know, would, way bigger than, you know, the compression category,

1183
00:58:39,019 --> 00:58:43,099
let alone anything else. So we, we, we had the best. There's no question it was the best.

1184
00:58:43,139 --> 00:58:46,480
Product was, you were absolutely convinced that you were ahead of everyone.

1185
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:53,199
Yeah. And so, and so we met just Jeff Nichols, who, uh, uh, he had all these SEALs training

1186
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:57,340
in the gear. So, you know, they would sort of do their exercises. I'd jump out of planes.

1187
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:58,639
I'd, you know, jump in the water.

1188
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,480
I'd crawl across sand, you know, and he loved the stuff. And so Aiden said to me one day,

1189
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:08,239
he said, uh, um, I think we should, uh, employ this guy cause we're trying to get into, into

1190
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:14,420
the military. And he had great introductions to the military. He loved our product. And

1191
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:18,340
I said, you know, this guy, um, you know, they're, they're, you know, they're trying

1192
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:24,760
to kill us. I mean, you know, they're, this guy was a great guy. Um, and I said to Aiden,

1193
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:28,840
look, I'm happy for you to, uh, employ him, but if it doesn't work out,

1194
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,900
you're firing, you're firing him, not me.

1195
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:38,099
Smart, uh, smart thought. Uh, I mean, I, I remember, you know, exactly the same time,

1196
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:41,980
you know, playing and then this, this, you got to get hold of compression garments from

1197
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:45,960
two times. Yeah. Just the word, you know, when you're flying on a plane, we all, we

1198
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,360
all purchased it, you know, we all got onto it. So the, you're right. That's going back

1199
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:54,199
to just saying, what are your world's best at and identifying and generally hand on heart

1200
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:58,239
being able to, to know that you were. Well, interesting enough, I might, that's a bit

1201
00:59:58,239 --> 00:59:58,900
of a plug here, but.

1202
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:05,940
Yeah. The, um, this whole, this, this theory range we're doing, um, for, um, pre and post

1203
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:06,599
pregnancy.

1204
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:07,639
What's the name of it?

1205
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,099
It's called theory.

1206
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:09,380
Yeah.

1207
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:14,559
Spelled, it's called theories, the reason why. So T-H-E capital R capital Y.

1208
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:14,940
Yep.

1209
01:00:15,099 --> 01:00:20,619
So everything we do, everything we do, there's a reason why. And, uh, the girl that, uh,

1210
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:26,000
is running the business, uh, Cindy, uh, she comes, she used to work for two times you

1211
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,579
in all the product development for our compression.

1212
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:39,699
Um, so, um, she's, she's now at, uh, she's now producing garments for, um, prenatal and

1213
01:00:39,699 --> 01:00:45,440
postnatal that, that helps support physiologically, not only the woman, the women have trouble

1214
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:52,559
with, um, swelling and, you know, some varicose veins and all sorts of issues. Um, but it

1215
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:58,019
also, after, um, I'm not, you can tell I'm not the technical person here, but after,

1216
01:00:58,019 --> 01:01:06,320
uh, um, six or 12 weeks of pregnancy, the blood flow actually helps the nutrients to

1217
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:16,480
the baby. So, um, she, her experience in material science and fabrics, um, is phenomenal

1218
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,059
because there are products out there that are compression that do a job, but they're

1219
01:01:20,059 --> 01:01:27,400
so uncomfortable. So she's being able to develop a lightweight product that, um, uh, feels

1220
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:27,780
good.

1221
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:31,719
It's super comfortable that the woman can wear all day, but has these physiological

1222
01:01:31,719 --> 01:01:41,039
benefits. Now, the issue she's got is, is education because to look at it, um, one pair

1223
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:47,820
of maternity tights looks like another pair. So her challenge in business is to, is to

1224
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:56,199
educate. Um, uh, but her material science background gives her the, the authenticity,

1225
01:01:56,199 --> 01:01:58,000
uh, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

1226
01:01:58,019 --> 01:02:04,099
and the knowledge that we know it's the best on the market. So it, we've sort of taken a

1227
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:09,679
leaf out of two times you for this pregnancy business, although it's a lot sort of smaller

1228
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:10,079
niche.

1229
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:10,500
Yeah.

1230
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:18,059
And any, anything anyone does out there, you know, it's not just doing what's already out

1231
01:02:18,059 --> 01:02:23,320
there. You've got to do something better. It's got to be different. It's got to be better.

1232
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:27,739
Uh, but the challenge in today's environment that,

1233
01:02:28,019 --> 01:02:35,159
wasn't so much, you know, even 10 years ago is that, um, the media sources now to actually

1234
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:40,739
try and tell your story to get it out there is so diverse and it's very difficult to get

1235
01:02:40,739 --> 01:02:44,179
your message out. So that's the challenge these days. I mean, it used to be, you know,

1236
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:50,780
television, press, radio. Now it's, uh, you know, social, different social podcasts, blah,

1237
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,139
blah, blah.

1238
01:02:51,579 --> 01:02:56,039
Yeah. It's, um, it is, isn't it? It's, it's a great opportunity and a great challenge,

1239
01:02:56,099 --> 01:02:56,300
isn't it?

1240
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:56,519
Yeah.

1241
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:58,000
So when you, when you, when you hit it and you get it right, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

1242
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,139
as you did, you know, getting, uh, you know, the, the, the endorsement from that sort of

1243
01:03:03,139 --> 01:03:06,820
level of, um, you know, Julie Bishop, the foreign minister famously was a two times

1244
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:13,380
you wear and, uh, the product became authentically out there. And I suppose we had, uh, um, we

1245
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:19,800
had one of Nike's best athletes, uh, wearing the product. Uh, and we had, um, LeBron James,

1246
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:25,119
uh, during the playoffs, he'd go in the locker rooms and put on, uh, two times you for recovery.

1247
01:03:25,699 --> 01:03:27,900
And, uh, and there was a first,

1248
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,320
someone photographed him in the changing room, which, uh, we had to be careful how

1249
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:31,960
we, um.

1250
01:03:32,539 --> 01:03:34,559
Would have upset the Nike team, I'm assuming, that one?

1251
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:38,340
Well, we upset a few people along the way. We had another instance, which I can probably

1252
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:44,300
tell now it wasn't, um, we, uh, during one of the Olympics, uh, the triathlete wanted

1253
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:52,260
to wear, uh, two times you, um, tri suits. But Adidas had the, uh, Adidas had the rights.

1254
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,780
Adidas came to us and said, well, you know, would you make our suits with the three stripes?

1255
01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:00,320
And we said, oh, we don't want to do that. What, you know, I will pay you for it. Well,

1256
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:04,699
well, big deal. You pay us for, you know, a couple of dozen suits. I mean, it's not

1257
01:04:04,699 --> 01:04:09,739
going to be the, you know, what's it going to, it's not going to help us. But the athletes

1258
01:04:09,739 --> 01:04:16,460
came to us and said, um, uh, would you, um, would you make it for us? Because, uh, and

1259
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,780
again, it's not a criticism of Adidas because Adidas.

1260
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:20,219
It wasn't their niche.

1261
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,079
It wasn't their niche.

1262
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:21,260
Yeah.

1263
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:25,820
They don't do triathlon. So it's not a criticism of Adidas. Adidas are a great company. But

1264
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:26,679
anyway.

1265
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:31,599
So we did the suits for them with the three stripes, but Adidas made a big mistake in

1266
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:34,880
not having us sign a confidentiality agreement. So.

1267
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,760
You can tell the story.

1268
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,559
I tell the story. Well, we told the story and, uh, and we heard back, um, that they

1269
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:46,739
were going to sue us. Uh, this is all, this is all rumour and innuendo. This is not, uh,

1270
01:04:46,739 --> 01:04:51,639
I'm not sure if you should be saying this over. But, um, I said, uh, well, I hope they

1271
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:52,639
do because what, you know.

1272
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:53,300
Even better story.

1273
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,460
How much publicity would that be? It didn't happen.

1274
01:04:56,780 --> 01:05:01,739
Yeah. I love telling that opportunity, isn't it? And seeing it and clearly your mind goes

1275
01:05:01,739 --> 01:05:04,820
there, doesn't it? To say, where's the benefit? And in the end that would have, you know,

1276
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:09,119
that's authenticity, isn't it? Athletes that are sponsored by, you know, one of the biggest

1277
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:13,960
brands in the world saying, no, no, for performance, we need to wear the best product, um, which

1278
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:18,800
is brilliant. The other dimension, the next one was, was curiosity, Clive. We see leaders

1279
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:23,500
succeed. Curiosity is a word that comes up all the time and they approach their ability

1280
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,659
to learn and develop through curiosity. Does that resonate?

1281
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:37,159
Yeah. Well, curiosity and just keeping your eyes open. I mean, it's, um, it's, uh, like

1282
01:05:37,159 --> 01:05:45,019
I, it must be innate or it must be, um, I don't go out to plan these things, but everywhere

1283
01:05:45,019 --> 01:05:51,079
I look, everything, when I see a product or a service or something, I think, oh, gee,

1284
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:56,780
that's interesting. How could, uh, how could that be done better? Or what business opportunity

1285
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:07,139
is there? Um, uh, you know, whether it be a garment, whether it be color, um, you know,

1286
01:06:07,139 --> 01:06:11,260
we'd often in garments, we'd look at, well, you know, I like that part of, I like the,

1287
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:16,699
the neck line of that garment. I like the color there, that, uh, that panel and the

1288
01:06:16,699 --> 01:06:23,940
legs, yeah, that must be helping the compression there. Um, so let's, what if we took all those

1289
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:26,760
different aspects and put them together? We'd have the best product on the market.

1290
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:33,199
And even today, I mean, you, you know, I even go back to underwear and I'm thinking to

1291
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:40,900
myself, gee, you know, um, I see opportunities in that, which I didn't see, you know, 20

1292
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:50,000
years ago. Um, you see opportunities, I don't know, you just, your brain is wired to notice

1293
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,300
things and think how you could do them. I mean, you miss out on stuff. Years ago, um,

1294
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:56,739
you know, as a kid, I was a kid, I was a kid, I was a kid, I was a kid, I was a kid, I was

1295
01:06:56,739 --> 01:06:56,760
a kid, I was a kid, I was a kid, I was a kid, I was a kid, I was a kid, I was a kid, I was

1296
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:56,820
a kid, I was a kid, I was a kid, I was a kid, I was a kid, I was a kid, I was a kid,

1297
01:06:56,820 --> 01:07:03,619
I used to, you know, my footwear all summer was a pair of thongs. Um, and then for years

1298
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:11,000
later, excuse me, um, you know, there's all sorts of beautiful sandals and, um, you know,

1299
01:07:11,079 --> 01:07:15,380
Birkenstocks and blah, blah, blah. And I was thinking to myself one day, you know, I should

1300
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:19,579
bring in a couple of containers of rubber thongs because they were, you know, they're

1301
01:07:19,579 --> 01:07:24,900
the best to wear. I mean, how good are they? And then, you know, 12 months later, Havana's

1302
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,739
start. I think, gee, I've got to go.

1303
01:07:26,739 --> 01:07:30,400
I missed the, I missed the boat there. But then I noticed just the other day, there was

1304
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:35,639
another product called Archies who have just got a, a, uh, a twist on, on Havana's, which

1305
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:36,219
are fantastic.

1306
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:40,340
Funny, I saw that for the first time the other day as well. I walked into a personal training

1307
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:44,500
studio and, uh, it's funny, the studio, the guy just text me then as we speak, you know,

1308
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,300
having an arch in a thong. The, the, the ones we grew up with were brilliant, but probably

1309
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:53,480
horrific for your, for your feet. So, you know, I can just say, even as you're looking,

1310
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,559
you're looking around the room, your mind's constantly, you know,

1311
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:01,880
John Bertram was sitting in this very chair not long ago, the legendary Hall of Fame sporting,

1312
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,099
you know, John, the small world, but just, you know, the curiosity in his mind, constantly

1313
01:08:07,099 --> 01:08:12,039
asking, constantly wanting to know how something works, constantly. And as you said, it's an

1314
01:08:12,039 --> 01:08:17,560
innate thing that is a, is a pattern for sure. Communicating with clarity, uh, Clyde, you

1315
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:22,220
said at the start, you said, I wouldn't have been, uh, adept at, uh, the corporate world

1316
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:26,220
because it wouldn't have suited you and the way that you communicate. But, but you've

1317
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,760
clearly have a way of getting your message out and understanding it. How did you go about

1318
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:38,460
in your mind, sort of communicating your message? Um, look, look, I think in, in business,

1319
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:44,239
it's a tenant. I mean, you know, the communication is, is, is so important,

1320
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:50,939
you know, communicate, communicate, communicate. Um, I guess from my perspective, I'm, I have no

1321
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:56,399
real experience in informal communications. Um, you know, I don't,

1322
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:03,520
I don't give presentations or, um, but nevertheless, uh, in, in small teams, um,

1323
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:07,020
with nurturing people, you never stopped communicating. You never stopped trying to

1324
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:15,560
give your lessons. You never stopped trying to impart your wisdoms on people. Um, uh,

1325
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:24,560
you know, when, when Aidan and Jamie first came on board, um, you know, I was able to

1326
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,000
short circuit a lot of stuff, you know, with, with Aidan and marketing,

1327
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:33,600
of course. Um, you know, I had a level of experience. I had the level of, I guess,

1328
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:43,659
you know, wisdom. Um, uh, so I'm not diminishing in any way because I said I'm not a particularly,

1329
01:09:43,899 --> 01:09:48,180
I don't see myself as a particularly good communicator. I don't, I'm probably talking

1330
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:55,180
more formally, but I do see myself as, you know, as the, uh, as the number one person to be able

1331
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:58,079
to tell the company, the brand story and communicate.

1332
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:04,859
Well, and, and keep everyone informed and, um, you know, it's, it's so important, you know,

1333
01:10:04,979 --> 01:10:09,159
I tell, you know, with, with people, I say, communicate, communicate, communicate. I say

1334
01:10:09,159 --> 01:10:15,479
cost is your enemy. Um, cost is your enemy. Yeah. Um, you know, in business, I mean,

1335
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:25,319
um, you know, I think it's, I think it's fanciful how, you know, some people, you know, often,

1336
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:27,119
and I'm generalizing here, but often,

1337
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:36,680
when corporate people decide they want to start their own business, um, in whatever it is,

1338
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:43,399
they seem to dwell on, on environment. They seem to want to get an office set up in the secretary

1339
01:10:43,399 --> 01:10:50,359
and a, um, get the warehouse set up with the right, um, pick faces, et cetera, et cetera,

1340
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:58,640
and work out transport. And I'm thinking to myself, hang on, you know, if you want to give,

1341
01:10:58,800 --> 01:10:59,340
like, take that, take that, take that, take that, take that, take that, take that, take that, take that,

1342
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:02,359
a hundred thousand I started with, if I'd have done that, I would have been, I would have blown

1343
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:05,880
up in the first month. A hundred thousand dollars isn't a lot of money. If I'd have gone out and

1344
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:12,119
searched for warehouse space, got a, got a beautiful office. I, I started off, um, uh,

1345
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:17,600
we had, uh, Debbie and myself, our, our baby was in, we had a two bedroom terrace. We were in one

1346
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:23,600
room and my office warehouse was in the front room of a two bedroom terrace. And then, then,

1347
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:29,060
then the next thing we were able to do is, is, um, get a small office, um,

1348
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:38,319
you know, it was on a three level in Bouverie street. And then, you know, so, um, you know,

1349
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:44,960
it's communication's important. Cost control is important. Um, being able to tell your stories

1350
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:54,800
is important. Um, simplifying is important. Having a red hot go is important. Um, I'm not

1351
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:59,239
sure how I prioritize those things, but you've just got to do them and live them.

1352
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:06,180
Yeah. It's sort of, maybe I should some stage, sit down and write a one pages to, you know,

1353
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:11,880
number one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. I mean, maybe, maybe that's the, uh, I'd love to

1354
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:16,899
read it. Um, you know, Jeff Harris from flight center had done that exercise and he sent it to

1355
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:22,100
me before the interview, uh, client. And I loved it. He said, I just see some scribblings. He said

1356
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:28,100
of my thoughts on, you know, the flight center story world from incredible, but just, you know,

1357
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:29,319
a masterclass.

1358
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:34,500
It's a bit like your thoughts on, on trial and error, but what consistently work for them. And

1359
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:38,800
you know, worth going back if you hadn't listened to Jeff's, uh, episode, but you can sell, you've

1360
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:44,180
got those patterns come up for you all the time in passion, in scalability, cost, knowing all of,

1361
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:48,180
uh, that, that wisdom. It's a, it's a profound thing that you're sharing. You mentioned

1362
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:51,640
collaboration. That's the next dimension I want to talk to you about. We see leaders now really

1363
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:56,600
conscious that collaboration is, is a superpower. How did that work for you collaborating?

1364
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,359
Oh, it's, uh,

1365
01:12:58,359 --> 01:13:07,479
it's paramount, um, uh, in every aspect. Um, and to give two times you as the, uh, as the

1366
01:13:07,479 --> 01:13:12,800
example, um, Jamie, Aidan, ourself would collaborate on everything, even though,

1367
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:18,020
you know, Jamie was, you know, the so-called, well, not so-called, he was the product guy.

1368
01:13:18,579 --> 01:13:25,779
Aidan was the sales marketing guy. I was sort of the CEO come interest in both of those things. But,

1369
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:27,119
um,

1370
01:13:28,359 --> 01:13:32,720
you know, as I said earlier, no one's got, uh, a monopoly on a good idea. We, everything we do,

1371
01:13:32,779 --> 01:13:37,659
we'd collaborate. Every idea we, we, we talk about, we'd collaborate. Uh, we'd be brutally

1372
01:13:37,659 --> 01:13:41,659
honest with each other. I mean, the nice thing about having the three owners like that is that

1373
01:13:41,659 --> 01:13:50,859
we're not, you know, too often, um, too often people, um, don't say what they think because

1374
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:56,239
politically it's, you know, it's, they think it hurts someone's feelings or we start, we start

1375
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:58,340
off saying, listen, we're all after the same thing. We're all after the same thing. We're all after the

1376
01:13:58,359 --> 01:14:03,260
same thing. We don't, you know, um, go for it. It hurt our, hurt our feelings. We don't care

1377
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:09,760
about that. We just want, want success. Um, um, if I thought, uh, Aidan, I thought something was

1378
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:15,640
a shit idea, I'd tell him it's a shit idea. Um, he'd say, why? And I'd tell him, and then we might

1379
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:20,260
have an argument or I might say, oh yeah, you're probably right there or, or vice versa. I might

1380
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:23,699
do something and he'd say, well, you know, why on earth would you possibly do that? And I'd say,

1381
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,699
maybe you're right. Yeah. So we, we,

1382
01:14:27,479 --> 01:14:27,699
yeah.

1383
01:14:28,359 --> 01:14:33,359
You know, unless you're, uh, you know, I don't know, unless you're a, maybe Neil on Musk can do

1384
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:36,079
that cause he's, he's, he's genius, but I certainly can't.

1385
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,720
Yeah. I love it. I love the idea, isn't it? It's, um, you know, to, to create that environment where

1386
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:45,659
the ego is dropped, isn't it? The best idea is going to win. And in practice, it doesn't matter

1387
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:49,159
who's got the biggest shareholding or who's got the biggest title. It's like, if you've got the

1388
01:14:49,159 --> 01:14:54,079
same shared vision, then you're all trying to get there, aren't you? And, and it's not easy. I mean,

1389
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:57,960
you know, like the best thing a CEO can do that doesn't have, I mean, the CEO has got to,

1390
01:14:58,359 --> 01:15:07,079
what a CEO really needs to do is make sure that, that people, uh, when they make sure that people

1391
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:14,119
don't give him answers that they think he wants to hear. Um, and I think probably not enough CEOs

1392
01:15:14,119 --> 01:15:19,539
take that viewpoint because, but they've got to, because, um, we had one CEO, um,

1393
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:28,319
as a business school, we had a CEO that, uh, I got upset about, um, you know, particularly Aidan and

1394
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:35,020
Amy questioning his, some of his decisions, just as we grew, grew. And I said, mate,

1395
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:39,840
you know, you've got the, you've got the best situation of all time because you've got these

1396
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:45,220
two guys who will tell you what they think, not what they think you want to hear. And you should

1397
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:50,859
embrace that, you know, not be upset by it. But that's the difference between a corporate point

1398
01:15:50,859 --> 01:15:57,939
of view and a, and, and an entrepreneurial sort of growth point. And if these, and these, um, what,

1399
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:07,079
the corporate people have to do is engender that, that communication and that, that, uh, spirit of,

1400
01:16:07,079 --> 01:16:13,220
you know, speaking your mind, um, otherwise they'll just get what their leader is reflecting

1401
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:17,539
back at them. So, I don't know. And it's a great message, isn't it? And we're passionate about that

1402
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:23,079
and often as you, as you see leaders get to those roles and they're not surrounded at all by any of

1403
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:26,960
what you're saying, they don't set that up for that opportunity. And you're often in a, in a,

1404
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,039
in a bubble then.

1405
01:16:28,359 --> 01:16:32,600
Well, what's happening in your, you don't really know because everyone's too afraid to, to share it

1406
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:37,479
with you. And so, you know, again, I can say it's a great thing that you, that you set up. And then,

1407
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:42,060
you know, it's not always easy. No one likes being told their ideas, their shit, but, but if it helps

1408
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:46,420
you to get better, um, well, you know, it's a, it's a great pattern that we're seeing, you know,

1409
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:50,060
leaders are really, who, who have success in the, in the current climate do it really well.

1410
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:56,560
But I think all these, um, I think what also helps these days is that, um, you know, these CEO groups

1411
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,340
and so forth, like I'm in, I'm involved in, I'm involved in, I'm involved in, I'm involved in, I'm

1412
01:16:58,359 --> 01:17:05,520
involved in a, a YPO, um, group and a subset of the YPO group is a forum group. So you have,

1413
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:12,020
you have a group of eight to 10 guys and girls, um, who were either, well, three categories,

1414
01:17:12,119 --> 01:17:19,260
either entrepreneurs, professional managers, or, or, um, you know, come from family businesses to

1415
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:28,340
three. And generally, you know, you're in a subset of a forum, which, uh, the people in that group,

1416
01:17:28,359 --> 01:17:32,699
there's no conflict with what businesses they're running, obviously they can't happen,

1417
01:17:33,739 --> 01:17:37,600
but that's an interesting forum too, because you've got these guys who are largely

1418
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:43,920
there, uh, the, the, the CEO of their companies, whether, you know, they're entrepreneurs,

1419
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:49,460
professional managers, or, or family members, um, who are used to people just, you know,

1420
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:56,079
um, just telling them what they want to hear. Um, that's a great organization, you know,

1421
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:58,220
to have, uh, discussions with,

1422
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:02,199
because, you know, you, you might, you might pose a, you know, an issue you've got,

1423
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:05,600
and they, they don't puss you around, puss you around, they'll just tell you straight, well,

1424
01:18:06,619 --> 01:18:09,840
um, you know. It's uncommon for a lot of people who, you know,

1425
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:14,560
got success and are CEOs. And, you know, when we, when we caught up, I spoke to you briefly about

1426
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:19,340
that. And there, you know, as a crossover, the, the leadership space that we're in a business,

1427
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:24,840
we started seven years ago, called a leader. We started, uh, in education, still do a lot of work

1428
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:28,199
with teachers in education, but because of the range of leaders we speak to,

1429
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:32,399
we, we've created a model very similar to that, where, whether it's someone from the world of

1430
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:36,800
sport or industry or sport, getting together in those, you know, leader connect is the group that

1431
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:42,939
we talk about. And we, you don't have to be the CEO, but you can be a change maker, but that

1432
01:18:42,939 --> 01:18:48,220
accountability of coming together and having people turn up and say, I'm here to challenge

1433
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:51,479
your thinking and support your thinking in the right situation. It's a pretty powerful thing.

1434
01:18:51,539 --> 01:18:56,180
No, it is because people get, you know, it's very powerful because people aren't going to tell you

1435
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:58,079
what you want to hear. People are going to tell you what they think.

1436
01:18:58,739 --> 01:19:03,279
And it can, at times it probably can be confronting. Well, it's not, it can be confronting,

1437
01:19:03,779 --> 01:19:08,199
but it shouldn't be because, um, everyone's there for the same purpose and giving feedback, giving,

1438
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:13,340
not, it's not about giving advice. It's about questioning and questioning and questioning.

1439
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,539
And you learn that way, don't you? Yeah. You create that culture of wanting to constantly

1440
01:19:17,539 --> 01:19:20,920
learn and constantly get better. And we're really passionate about that. We think it's such a,

1441
01:19:21,399 --> 01:19:26,319
um, you know, YPO has been an incredible institution for 50 years and 30,000 members and

1442
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:28,079
people like you have, uh,

1443
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:31,199
contributed and benefited greatly. And we see there's a real opportunity to,

1444
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:35,899
to extend that out, you know, further. So, um, I appreciate you sharing that with us,

1445
01:19:35,899 --> 01:19:41,060
but asking these two final questions, God, uh, of everyone I've sat down with who's been the

1446
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:54,279
greatest leader in your life. Oh, goodness. Um, greatest leader. Um, what that in what respect

1447
01:19:54,279 --> 01:20:00,460
it could be anywhere. Some people go to a, to, to someone close to family or some people,

1448
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:00,699
um,

1449
01:20:01,359 --> 01:20:08,420
uh, might be that they studied, um, Churchill or they were obsessed with Mandela or, you know,

1450
01:20:08,579 --> 01:20:12,960
there's a range of answers, you know, so it's, it's unique to, to everyone.

1451
01:20:14,619 --> 01:20:20,020
Uh, that's a good question. Um, I hadn't really thought too much about it. So he's putting a bit

1452
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:30,399
on the spot here, but for me, I think it would be a range of, a range of people. Um, it's, it's

1453
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:31,199
people,

1454
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:38,920
um, who a lot of, some of it's come out of the YPA forum type groups. It's people that,

1455
01:20:39,399 --> 01:20:51,159
um, I respect that have different points of view. Um, uh, my, my father-in-law, he, he was in,

1456
01:20:51,220 --> 01:20:59,380
in business and I respected the way he operated and that he was able to develop a very successful

1457
01:21:00,359 --> 01:21:00,920
business.

1458
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:09,579
um not by being by being compassionate by doing the right thing by people not being an arsehole

1459
01:21:09,579 --> 01:21:16,000
um just trying to be look at look at uh always look at things from the other side other person's

1460
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:24,359
point of view um showing empathy um uh there was a guy i when i was in before i started my business

1461
01:21:24,359 --> 01:21:30,920
i was in uh in in uh i worked for an advertising agency one of our accounts was mask infectionary

1462
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:36,039
so there's a guy at mask infectionary guy called glenn barnes who i had an enormous amount of

1463
01:21:36,039 --> 01:21:42,880
respect for and um the principles in business and the way you approach things and his discipline and

1464
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:55,880
um was was phenomenal um so it's probably not one person um um you know i like to listen to

1465
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:59,479
you know this the the you know like i've read some of the books like the

1466
01:21:59,479 --> 01:22:00,880
simon senex um

1467
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:08,340
where you know i wouldn't say i mean he's just got this ability to codify what great leaders do

1468
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:15,760
and say so it's not him personally but he's able to put a complexion on on how the you know great

1469
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:20,800
leaders think you know him and along with him and you know the good to great guy i mean

1470
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:25,420
you know they're they're fascinating people they're not necessarily leaders in themselves

1471
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:30,899
but their whole life is about it's about um learning from leaders and

1472
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:36,920
codifying what the leaders have to say i mean that's really quite powerful i i'd like to listen

1473
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:46,579
to that um and you know funnily enough uh well i shouldn't say funnily enough um you know as a

1474
01:22:46,579 --> 01:22:53,079
sounding board my wife um she's not you know she's my wife my partner best friend lover but

1475
01:22:53,079 --> 01:23:00,899
she's also a smart smart woman who um you know but virtually everything i do i have a you know

1476
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:05,979
speak to her you know good just get a sounding board tells me when she thinks it's shit and not

1477
01:23:05,979 --> 01:23:16,079
um how many years married 30 38 38 you're gonna get in trouble here no 80 84 what's that uh

1478
01:23:16,079 --> 01:23:23,399
some quick 38 years yeah 38 years and i love the um you know i know you you thought about it but

1479
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:28,439
a lot of people do that as an example and say you know i i have learned from you know books like

1480
01:23:28,439 --> 01:23:30,760
good to great i've learned from people you know

1481
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:36,939
many years ago and then on the home front you see great great leadership and um no it's a it's

1482
01:23:36,939 --> 01:23:41,659
a fascinating answer final question is around we're a bit obsessed with collaboration and this

1483
01:23:41,659 --> 01:23:46,020
world of collaboration is is is what we talk about at a leader and inspiring connections

1484
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:50,239
you know you've had the you've collaborated with great people when you've got connections

1485
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:54,439
around the world have you ever thought geez if i could collaborate with one person on any project

1486
01:23:54,439 --> 01:23:59,439
there's someone that springs to mind oh good that's a good question um

1487
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:03,810
uh that's a good question um

1488
01:24:03,829 --> 01:24:06,250
that's a very good question clever on any project uh

1489
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:22,289
i can't look uh luke i i i off the top of my head i i can't think of any um i'm sure there is if i

1490
01:24:22,289 --> 01:24:26,550
go you know if i i'll probably walk out of this uh we'll walk out of this room and think oh shit

1491
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:34,989
you know of course there's such and such and such and such um uh you know there's people i mean

1492
01:24:34,989 --> 01:24:40,149
there's there's lots of people i'd certainly uh you know i'd like to sit around and talk to them

1493
01:24:40,170 --> 01:24:45,449
at a dinner table with with certain people i mean uh obviously the the ones we all know and hear

1494
01:24:45,449 --> 01:24:49,130
about the yellow must of this world i don't know you know i'd love to know how his mind sort of

1495
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:54,789
operates i'm not sure collaboration is the right word but um his name comes up a lot in this answer

1496
01:24:54,789 --> 01:25:00,989
people are fascinated by who've done what you've done and you know clearly you know people you

1497
01:25:00,989 --> 01:25:05,470
know to break through you know the electric car world against all the big car manufacturers and

1498
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:09,869
to launch right take on nasa and but you know there's clearly some you know

1499
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:15,149
part of that brain that's people are fascinated by aren't they yeah i mean it is just enormous i

1500
01:25:15,149 --> 01:25:19,829
mean obviously uh i mean it's all the big business leaders i mean i mean i'd love to sit down and

1501
01:25:19,829 --> 01:25:29,210
have a chat with um phil knight i mean he's a guy that uh you know he's he started night he founded

1506
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:55,590
he's he's uh you know for him to do that in his lifetime to create such a business i think it's

1507
01:25:55,590 --> 01:26:00,829
got a market cap of hundreds of billions anyway i mean it's just extraordinary um

1508
01:26:00,829 --> 01:26:05,930
and you know the thing about the thing about nike is i guess i guess he's one i really would like

1509
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:09,329
to sit down with because no matter how big they get

1510
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:16,149
never get complacent i mean most big companies like that like in the adidas and the pumas and

1511
01:26:16,149 --> 01:26:22,829
in the sporting area and even um in other apparel businesses when they get at some stage they seem

1512
01:26:22,829 --> 01:26:28,430
to get complacent nike never get complacent i mean even a small company like us and we were

1513
