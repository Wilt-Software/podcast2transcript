I hope you enjoy this upcoming episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast with Matt LaFleur.

2
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:11,480
Matt's record-breaking success as the coach of the Green Bay Packers is a unique story,

3
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:16,239
and we feel extremely grateful and fortunate to have Matt LaFleur as part of our Elita Connect

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,140
signature program. Matt joins other elite coaches around the world, Mikel Arteta from Arsenal,

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,960
Eddie Jones, the current coach of Australian rugby, George Carl, an NBA Hall of Fame coach,

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,119
and Mike Dunlap from the Walkie Bucks in our bespoke facilitated leadership forums.

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,619
Creating a world of collaboration is what we are really passionate about in the work we do

8
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:42,000
at Elita, a business co-founded with my great friend Matt Wadowicz, and our Elita Connect

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,060
signature program, as I said, brings together diverse groups of people to learn, to connect,

10
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:51,560
and to collaborate. You don't have to be the coach of the Green Bay Packers, Matt LaFleur,

11
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,840
to enjoy this experience. If you want to book a discovery call and find out more about it,

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,780

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,380
elitacollective.com. The Empowering Leaders podcast is proudly presented by our great friends

15
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:08,359
at Temper, a mattress like no other. It is a joy in life to sleep on a Temper mattress,

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,079
and very fortunate to do that as well. If you want to find out more about it, head to Temper and

17
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,319
check out the world's best mattress. And if you don't trust me, that Temper is simply the best

18
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:22,340
mattress in the world. Have a listen to Australian basketball legend, Andrew Gaze.

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,780
Probably two or three years ago, I was having some back problems. So I went about and I

20
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:33,819
sought out some different alternatives, and then the Temper came along. And you know when you just

21
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:37,620
you sit in something, you go, hang on, there's something a little bit different about this.

22
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:44,760
It seems to just fit me a little bit better. It was that tension level, it seemed right. And I

23
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,739
thought, I need to look a little bit further in this. So got to learn a little bit more about

24
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:55,760
the Temper and the mattress and all the science that goes into it. Eventually got one, and it's

25
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,500
been fantastic.

26
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,500
But I can look you in the eye, and anyone out there and say, well, my back problems are not

27
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,200
what they were.

28
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:09,020
Matt LaFleur is the head coach of the Green Bay Packers in the NFL. His 2019 rookie year saw Matt

29
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:15,159
achieve a 13-win, three-loss record, make the playoffs, and win the NFC North division, a record

30
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:21,259
for a rookie Green Bay coach. 26 wins, six loss achievement after two completed seasons is the

31
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:26,419
second best start ever for a coach in NFL history. Matt's team, the Green Bay Packers,

32
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,139
hold a unique place in the psyche of Americans as the only publicly owned, non-profit professional

33
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:37,500
team in the United States. They are also the most successful franchise in National Football League

34
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,819
history, with 13 NFL championship wins. It is without question one of the most high-profile,

35
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,159
publicly scrutinized, demanding positions in world sport. And at just 43 years of age,

36
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,379
Matt LaFleur is building a reputation as an outstanding leader in every sense of the word.

37
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,759
Matt, can I start with the history of the Green Bay Packers?

38
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,680
And what they mean to your community?

39
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,719
Well, people's Sundays are determined by Green Bay winning or losing.

40
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,259
And Matt, I mentioned in the intro that it's the only not-for-profit, member-owned

41
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:44,680
franchise in U.S. sport. There's 500,000-plus shareholders, I understand, of Green Bay. And

42
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,800
you mentioned your stadium. North Wisconsin has got a population around about 100,000 people,

43
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,800
and that's the seat of the stadium. If you want to get on the wait list, it might be 150 years

44
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,800
to actually get a seat, but people still join the wait list. It's an incredible working-class

45
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,340
background of a city. It's sort of defied logic in lots of ways, hasn't it, to be as successful

46
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:17,220
as it is. Is that a fair call? Yeah, it's really a fascinating story, just from the foundation of

47
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:24,160
it and surviving some tough times and getting bailed out by the Chicago Bears twice. Ironically

48
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,480
enough, one of our rivals.

49
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:36,180
No, it's an unbelievable franchise. Certainly an honor to work for the Green Bay Packers. And

50
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,939
everywhere I go, I always meet an owner. Somebody always wants to tell me that they're an owner of

51
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:46,500
the team. And so I had to buy my own share so I could become an owner as well. I got tired of

52
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,500
hearing it. That's a brilliant story. And you read about Green Bay and the team you coach being

53
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,399
that reflection of the community and that sense of respect Green Bay

54
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:01,620
has for the game, but also respect for history. And when you're coaching the team, when clearly

55
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,660
winning is a huge part of it, but do you have that community in mind when you are the head

56
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:14,300
coach of the Green Bay Packers? Oh, absolutely. You can't go anywhere around here and you

57
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:21,459
constantly get reminded. So everybody is all in every year. They expect a Super Bowl. And

58
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:26,680
you know, quite honestly, it's great to work for a franchise. It's great to work for a franchise.

59
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:26,759
It's great to work for a franchise. It's great to work for a franchise. It's great to work for a

60
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:32,100
franchise where that is the expectation. And with that, I mean, obviously comes a lot of hard

61
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,000
work and got to have great people around you, not only our players, but our coaches and really

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,339
everybody involved in our football operation. But no, it truly is a blessing to be part of

63
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:51,120
this organization. I want to ask you about your own history at a really successful college football

64
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,399
career. Initially started as a wide receiver, Western Michigan, then you transfer as a

65
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:01,420
quarterback to Signal Valley State. And you finished with record numbers in the quarterback

66
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,439
role in every area. And you end up, I think recently you were inducted into the Cardinal

67
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:11,800
Athletic Hall of Fame. You don't go on and play professionally, but do you ever have a sense that

68
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:18,040
you've got a better understanding of the challenges of athletic sport coming through as a player?

69
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:24,000
Did that shape you as a coach? Oh, absolutely. I think every experience that you go through and

70
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,379
kind of molds the person.

71
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:31,959
You are. So both my parents were coaches. My mom was probably the best coach. I always joke with

72
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:37,800
everybody. She was probably the best coach in our family. She was a cheerleading coach and a track

73
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,699
coach for the high school, for our local high school. My dad coached college football at Central

74
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:50,040
Michigan for his entire career and then our entire collegiate career. Then he got out and

75
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,319
led our high school program. And my brother's a coach.

76
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:02,720
Now, and he's, he's with the LA Rams. My grandfather was a high school football coach. So we come from a

77
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:10,180
long line of coaches. And, um, but yeah, I would say that your playing career, who you've worked

78
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,319
with, who you've been around, a lot of us are a product of our environment. And there's a lot of

79
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:24,379
great lessons every step along the way, both good and bad. And, um, but I've been really lucky to

80
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:25,379
have been around some of them. And I think that's, I think that's, I think that's, I think that's

81
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:32,660
amazing coaches. And I do give my parents the most credit for just instilling, I would say the

82
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:41,000
values that we try to live by within the Green Bay Packer organization as well. And so, um, yeah,

83
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,879
it's just, it is all about the quality of people. And that's one thing I do value is, is just,

84
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:53,720
you try to get the best people along the way. And, you know, our game is just filled with adversity

85
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,860
each and every week.

86
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:03,879
and every day and we battled through quite quite a bit of adversity for us this last year um with

87
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,680
the fact that our first three years we were pretty successful in the regular season we didn't quite

88
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:15,639
get it done um and then this year we i mean shoot we were we finished with a losing record and uh

89
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,519
quite honestly it was it was they could have gone really south and we were able to battle back and

90
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:26,360
and put ourself in position to make the playoffs in the final week of the season and

91
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:32,120
unfortunately didn't get it done but if we don't have those people within our organization from

92
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,440
the coaches to the players just everybody pushing in the same direction we wouldn't even gotten to

93
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,759
that point i don't want to go back a little bit on the on the family uh history of of coaching and uh

94
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:47,000
i have heard you say before i think your mom coached cheerleading and athletics as well and

95
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,240
right throughout the histories you said your younger brother

96
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,360
uh

97
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:56,440
coaching offense at a at the nfl level um was that you know always in your mind that

98
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:02,840
that you were going to to follow that family path you know i played sport with guys that

99
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,519
even when they're playing they always felt like they were going to be

100
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,480
a great coach was that was that in your mind yeah i think from uh the time i started playing

101
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,879
at you know whether it was football or basketball or running track um you know i've got an education

102
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:27,960
background and i didn't know quite which path i was going to take i think for a little while i

103
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:33,480
thought i was going to be a high school teacher and coach and um fortunately i didn't go down that

104
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:40,600
road and uh got lucky along the way met some great people and i think that's kind of where it it all

105
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,480
starts with the people that i've been associated with and have been again fortunate enough to be

106
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,559
able to learn from and you know this world of football ant basketball i believe it's always the

107
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:56,659
world you a lot of it is based on your relationships and um in terms of the opportunities that you may

108
00:09:56,659 --> 00:10:02,980
may get and now it's up to you when you get in those positions uh you got to live up to it so

109
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:10,320
um i've met one of my best friends robert sala one of them we were and he's the head coach of

110
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,840
the new york jets we were gas together at central michigan university and um we he went on and was

111
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,860
able to get his foot in the door in the nfl level and i kept on uh or he kept on calling me and

112
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,120
telling me hey you got to go to the nfl combine you got to go to the nfl combine so finally i

113
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:34,860
i took him up on that offer i was in the meantime i was a coach at the division two level

114
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:41,379
which is where i played i played d2 ball uh you mentioned at saginaw valley state university and

115
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:47,820
um but was able to meet some people at the combine and sure enough a job

116
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:55,460
opened up and robert went and pounded the table for me to to gary kubiak and you know fortunately

117
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:02,220
i i got an opportunity to meet kube at the nfl combine and they gave me an opportunity and i'll

118
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:09,080
never forget um packing up my car and like literally one day and driving by myself to

119
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:15,399
houston texas and uh it was about a 16 hour car ride i slept about halfway in the car

120
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,860
we were just married for one year at the time and uh she she stayed back she had a job and

121
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:29,340
um eventually she moved with me but um you know it's just it's been a it's been an incredible

122
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:35,820
adventure uh incredible journey and um like i said just met a lot of great people along the way

123
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,360
about you and uh and robert were roommates at college when you literally you know shared a

124
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,120
bedroom yeah that's it's you know i'd have two nfl head coaches you know currently uh applying

125
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,559
at the at the top level do you look back and think wow you know who would have thought that

126
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,679
that path and and it's a great story isn't it friendship you know people see something in you

127
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,720
and as you said you know bang the table for you that must be something as you said you never forget

128
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,000
yeah absolutely and we're we are as close today as we were then and got a lot of good stories

129
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,360
together some that are probably not suitable for this podcast but um you know it was no he's been

130
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,659
one of the guys that

131
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,360
i've leaned on and you got to have those type of people in your life because you're going to

132
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,360
surely encounter some things that uh you've never encountered before especially sitting in this

133
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,059
seat i would say and it's important to have people that you can kind of bounce ideas with that

134
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:40,360
know what you're going through um and so he's he's one of those guys for me and uh he's he's

135
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:47,019
like a brother to me i talk to him almost every day and uh just you know he's been a great friend

136
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:47,659
and uh

137
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,340
you know a great role model for myself

138
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,059
matt you put you talk about packing up the car it's a 16 hour drive you have a sleep on the way

139
00:12:55,059 --> 00:13:01,000
and that that starts a 16 year apprenticeship effectively to get to to the green bay packers

140
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,860
and you know looking at the history that was tennessee you went to la you went to

141
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,360
atlanta noted dame washington you you traveled all around the u.s to to better yourself and

142
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,820
i'm sure as those experiences unfolded as you mentioned at the start that's where

143
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,460
you know life is uh is

144
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,480
in play for all of us isn't it's where you learn and the people you associate with but

145
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,000
you get into the head job can you talk about you know how that had shaped you and what those values

146
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,440
and uh were like when you stepped into the role as a senior head coach at green bay from all that

147
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:38,200
16 years of experience yeah i think um like i said it was an interesting journey and a lot of

148
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:44,700
sacrifices made along the way and thank god for my wife um the matter of fact when i when i met her

149
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,379
we kind of joke about this now but i always tell

150
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:53,500
young coaches i said just remember there's two kinds of wives coaches wives and ex-wives so

151
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:59,100
um and i told her that and you know luckily she stuck with me all along the way and i mean there

152
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:05,580
was a period of time where we were moving almost every year um and it wasn't by design it wasn't

153
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:11,340
like i was trying to chase that next opportunity it's just it just kind of happened and i think

154
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:17,580
when you set yourself up and you're around successful people and you have success where

155
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:26,340
wherever you are those naturally will happen um i had an opportunity again another one of my

156
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:32,179
great friends who i spent four years with in with the washington now they're the washington

157
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:38,220
commanders um sean mcveigh we worked together for four years he gets the head job in la

158
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:45,139
i was in atlanta at the time we had a lot of success went to the super bowl obviously the

159
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:51,159
We had a colossal collapse in the Super Bowl, being up 28-3 on the New England Patriots,

160
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,419
and they came back and beat us.

161
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:59,259
It's something that still haunts me to this day, but it is what it is, and you just got to move on.

162
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:03,820
But he provided me with an opportunity in L.A. to come as the offensive coordinator.

163
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:06,879
And, again, we had success in that first year.

164
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:12,159
And after the season, the Tennessee Titans called up,

165
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,100
and they wanted to interview me for their head job.

166
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,559
And, man, I was not ready for that by any stretch.

167
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:26,460
And I spent a couple days, got all my material together, and went and interviewed for the job.

168
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:29,879
And I knew about after five minutes, I was like, there's no way I'm getting this job.

169
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:37,139
But it was an unbelievable learning experience, just took so much away from it.

170
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,600
And I must have done a good enough job that they called back,

171
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:42,039
and they wanted.

172
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,159
They wanted to hire me as the offensive coordinator, which was my job in L.A.

173
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,879
However, I wasn't the play caller.

174
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,340
And I called Sean up.

175
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:55,820
And the way our league works is if you're under contract with a club,

176
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,679
they don't have to let you out to go somewhere else.

177
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:05,179
But I called Sean up, and I just told Sean, I was like, I really don't want to leave,

178
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,759
but I feel like I have to take this opportunity to grow.

179
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:11,399
I knew.

180
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,740
Like I said, we were successful in L.A.

181
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:19,159
It was one of the biggest turnarounds in the NFL that year, going from,

182
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:24,639
I don't even know how many wins the previous season to 11-win team.

183
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:25,700
We went to the playoffs.

184
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,080
Unfortunately, got knocked out in the first round.

185
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:35,980
But I knew we were going to be really good again with the Rams.

186
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,940
And ironically enough, they went to the Super Bowl the next year.

187
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,259
But I knew.

188
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:47,179
With that, there was going to be more opportunity to potentially interview for head jobs.

189
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:52,019
And just felt like it was one of those necessary steps that I had to take,

190
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,360
going into a situation where I didn't know Mike Vrabel,

191
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:00,960
didn't have a whole lot of say-so on all the people we hired.

192
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:03,440
But, you know, I took a chance.

193
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,720
And luckily for me, although we didn't have as much success in Tennessee,

194
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,180
when Green Bay called, they said,

195
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,380
they saw something in me.

196
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,299
And I think that that was a big reason why I got the job,

197
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,599
is because I took a risk.

198
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,720
And, you know, it was with mixed results, I would say.

199
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,500
But it certainly was an unbelievable learning experience for myself.

200
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,940
We have a saying around here,

201
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:33,000
you better get comfortable being uncomfortable.

202
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,380
And that's the only way to really grow.

203
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,700
And that's something that I've always tried to challenge myself with.

204
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:41,279
Put myself out there.

205
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:41,380
Put myself out there.

206
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,660
Put myself in those situations to get a little uncomfortable.

207
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:52,500
And I think it's been a great process along the way

208
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,319
and certainly did me well in that situation.

209
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,680
Matt, I read something yesterday.

210
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:00,700
It was a quote that said,

211
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:03,720
on the other side of fear is everything you've ever wanted.

212
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,559
And it sounds like you've stepped into that uncomfortable space

213
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,400
and you ask your players to do that regularly.

214
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,880
I want to ask you something about Sean.

215
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,799
But I did want to come back to the family part for a moment.

216
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,640
I love asking this of leaders who achieve great things like you have.

217
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,099
And, you know, you spoke about there's a coach's wife or an ex-wife.

218
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,819
There's two options.

219
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:23,660
That's a joke.

220
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:24,500
That is a joke.

221
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,880
I just wanted to be clear.

222
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,059
The humor translated here into Australia, man.

223
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:29,960
I got it.

224
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,680
But, you know, I still think, you know, as a leader on the home front,

225
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:36,720
you know, you lead a big organization every day.

226
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,700
And clearly the love for your wife and your two boys.

227
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,700
And, you know, it's family time tonight that I'm encroaching on.

228
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:45,559
How do you lead on the home front?

229
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,259
And does it, you know, your day job cross over in that sense as well?

230
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,160
Well, I try to stay out of the way.

231
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:54,599
Let my wife lead at home.

232
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:59,599
Now, I think that is one of the challenges that we all have as coaches.

233
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,799
You know, you're used to being in charge at work.

234
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:05,319
And it just doesn't work that way when you come home.

235
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:08,240
You got co-head coaches.

236
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,779
But ultimately, my wife is the head coach.

237
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:13,859
Of this household and not ashamed to say it.

238
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:19,599
And, you know, she, she really there's so many sacrifices that families make

239
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:25,240
and that, that we have to make because I don't think that people truly

240
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,579
understand how demanding our job is our day to day, especially in season.

241
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:35,579
It gets better in the off season where you feel like a regular person, you know,

242
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:40,299
it's more of the eight to five, even though we, we, most of us go in there

243
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:40,759
about six.

244
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:45,940
I am, and we might stay later than that, but the sacrifices that are made during the

245
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:52,920
season are, are unbelievable because I could go from really Monday to about Saturday without

246
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,019
even seeing my kids.

247
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:59,799
Now we do a lot of things to try to incorporate family within our, our Packer organization.

248
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:05,559
We always set up a, a Tuesday evening that is meant for family dinners to, to make sure

249
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,519
that we stay connected with our kids.

250
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,160
You know, I was, my wife and I were talking about it today.

251
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,440
My oldest is 11 years old.

252
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,180
He'll be 12 this, this summer.

253
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,440
My youngest is nine.

254
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:22,640
Um, you know, it's, it's just crazy how fast these 12 years have gone.

255
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,000
And to think about it, he's going to be out of the house in six years.

256
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:34,819
So you've got to try to do and make every opportunity to, to have your family be a part of this business, this lifestyle.

257
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:39,920
Um, you know, when I first moved to green Bay, I want to say my kids.

258
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,819
It's in a six year time had lived in seven different houses.

259
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:46,500
So wrap your mind around that.

260
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:53,200
It's it's crazy, but the sacrifices are many and plentiful, but, um, with that comes some

261
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
unbelievable opportunities.

262
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:00,640
I know, like I told you earlier, my dad was a, was a football coach and, um, you know,

263
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,859
there were a lot of times I wouldn't see my dad either.

264
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:07,859
And, uh, especially during the season, but my mom would make a great effort to get me

265
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:08,839
up to practice.

266
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:09,839
So I could.

267
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:17,119
And man, I thought that was the coolest experience in the world to, to watch these guys that

268
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,119
I idolized.

269
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:23,440
And there are so many great lessons in terms of when you, when you go to these practices

270
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,059
and you watch how people work and how much effort they give.

271
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:33,980
And that's something that I always constantly, uh, pound my in the heads of my kids and although

272
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,660
they never want to hear it, um, so you gotta, but there is truly a balancing act, I would

273
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:47,940
say from being a coach, uh, and then being a dad or being a husband and, you know, sometimes,

274
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,480
although you might want to say something that you think you, you, you have a coaching point

275
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,180
that maybe your kids, uh, could benefit from.

276
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,220
Sometimes I got to bite my tongue and I've learned it the hard way.

277
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,940
And I know I was a, a stubborn kid growing up and my dad would try to coach me up all

278
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,940
the time.

279
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,940
And I would always kind of, all right, dad, whatever, and kind of shoo them away.

280
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,940
But I, I, you know, I, you know, I, you know, I, you know, I, you know, I, you know, I, you,

281
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,940
you're a stubborn one, you know?

282
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,940
But, you know, um, and so, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, you know.

283
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:26,440
It's, it's such a, it's just, um, it sounds like, you know, a very

284
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,559
sounds like, you know, a very raw, uh, lesson but, you know, it's, if you, you're going

285
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:37,859
to be anyone to talk to and look up to, like the other kids, you know, most of the time

286
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:38,859
they don't talk, they would be their one-on-one.

287
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:38,920
Speaker 1.

288
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:44,519
extraordinary opportunity to experience things that very few would at the same time. The title

289
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:49,460
of this podcast is about empowering leadership, Matt, and we've seen a huge shift in our mind

290
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:55,180
away from that hierarchy, command and control coaching that we grew up here in Australia with.

291
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,880
It was very much dictatorial. You knew your place. You didn't have any say at all in the

292
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,119
environment. I understand you're really passionate about player-driven environments in what you do.

293
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:10,420
Can you explain why that's so important? Well, I think if the players are the ones

294
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,299
that are setting the standards and upholding the standards, you've got a lot better chance

295
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:20,599
for them to reach their personal best. And I think the buy-in is greater. The accountability

296
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:29,940
is greater. And the way that I like to lead personally is it is a collective effort. And

297
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,099
that's why it's so important to surround yourself with people that might be

298
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:39,779
experts in a different area that can complement you. I tell a lot of people all the time is

299
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:45,619
when you assemble a coaching staff, it's putting a puzzle together. And how does each piece

300
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:55,339
complement the other? And how do we all fit? And that's why for me, number one is

301
00:23:55,339 --> 00:24:00,680
the men that work here for the Green Bay Packers have got to be men of character.

302
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,039
That's a non-negotiable. And I've

303
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:05,079
always said that.

304
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:10,420
I've always said, give me the man first, the coach second, and we'll figure it out

305
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:18,380
and collectively find ways to get it done. But we have a very, you know, I would say

306
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:24,180
collaborative approach that we take, whether it's from other coaches, whether it's from

307
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:30,500
the players. And we always joke with the players, you know, I'll always listen to you. I can't

308
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,019
guarantee that that's the decision we'll make, but we're always trying to do what's best

309
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:40,680
for us. And it's not about who's right. It's about what's right and what's right for us. And

310
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:48,480
again, whether that's our lowest assistant or myself or whoever, I try to look at all of us

311
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,059
as equals. And Matt, I love, you know, your language around, you know, give me the man

312
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:59,079
first, the person first and character, you know, trumps, you know, skill, you know,

313
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:04,700
anytime. And can you tell us how that plays out in your decision making? Does that flow through to,

314
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,019
you know, recruiting as well? And how do you measure that? A lot of people want to get good

315
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:13,539
people on their team. How do you make a science of getting good people into your organization?

316
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:21,779
Gosh, that is the magic question. I would say, I know personally, so when I first got hired

317
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:28,119
here, we have 23 coaches on our coaching staff, which I think blows a lot of people's minds

318
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:34,539
that there's so many of us. And then in the off season, our players will have a 90 man roster

319
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:41,519
that gets cut down to about, to really 69 players. Cause we've got a 53 plus another 16 on the P

320
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:48,960
squad. But the coaches is ultimately what I would say that I've got more control over.

321
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:57,319
And, you know, it was such an interesting process going through interviewing a lot of people.

322
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:02,380
Certainly you're, you're taking recommendations on people that you know, and you trust.

323
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,440
Um, ironically enough,

324
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:10,460
when I first got hired here, I had worked with two guys from our original staff and both for work

325
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:17,720
for one year. Um, so it didn't take the approach of, I'm going to hire my friends. It was more

326
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:26,180
the approach of, we got to find who's right for the green Bay Packers. And, um, you know, going

327
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:33,380
through the interview process, there was some coaches that had great experience and, um, you

328
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,640
know, that were quite frankly,

329
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,359
probably a little bit further along than others, but for myself, it was more of a gut feel in terms

330
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:49,960
of who we hired. And, um, ultimately I was, I try to lead with my gut, um, a little bit, and

331
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:56,119
sometimes it's good, sometimes not so good, but I do think we, we had a unbelievable staff. I think

332
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:02,960
we, and it's evolved. People have gotten up other opportunities and moved on. And, um, I'm so

333
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,579
thankful for everybody that's come.

334
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,140
Yeah.

335
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:11,539
Working with us and, um, you know, together, and, um, it's always, it's a little bittersweet. I would

336
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:17,119
say when guys get, get up other opportunities, you're so fired up for them. Ultimately, you know,

337
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:23,000
that it's, it could potentially hurt your organization and, uh, maybe your day to day a

338
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,539
little bit. Now we had a big transition, uh, not, not after this past season, after the previous

339
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:33,859
season where our offensive coordinator, Nathaniel Hackett gets hired in Denver.

340
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,140
Um, he brought along with him, Justin Alton is the offensive coordinator. Then Luke gets, he gets

341
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:46,700
a coordinator job in Chicago. So there was a lot of, um, you know, pieces, valuable pieces that you

342
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:53,119
have to replace. So every year there's going to be some turnover on your staff. And, um, ultimately

343
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:57,740
you're, you're always trying to get it right. And again, you lean on the people you trust guys that

344
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:03,680
maybe have worked with others in our profession that can, can vouch for their work ethic, can

345
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,579
vouch for their character.

346
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:04,619
Yeah.

347
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,119
But I do think it's, it's very important for us to, to get to know each individual as best we can.

348
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:16,319
And, um, you know, some you're going to be more familiar with than others and went through it,

349
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:22,240
uh, this year had to hire a, uh, a defensive back coach that I've never even talked to before, but

350
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,759
again, reached out to a couple of people that he had worked with that swore by the character.

351
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,599
He ironically worked with three of our coaches that were already in staff. And

352
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:34,579
man, I'm so fired up about, uh, this guy, Greg Williams,

353
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:40,019
and what he brings and just the energy he brings. But, um, you know, it's,

354
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:44,819
it's definitely not a perfect science along the way you try to do your best to,

355
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:50,339
to get a good feel for some of the guys within the interview process, but the interview process

356
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:57,299
can definitely be a very challenging because, um, I know that two of the guys that we originally

357
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:04,519
hired on the first staff didn't have the best of interviews, but again, trusted something in my,

358
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:09,400
my gut. I knew they were great people and, and the people that they had worked with

359
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,920
swore by them. And I'm so thankful that I trusted those people and we, we brought them on board and

360
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,400
they've been, uh, some of our better coaches. That's fascinating to me. You, you hear your

361
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,319
reference, your gut instinct, uh, a couple of times there in that answer around and around

362
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:27,240
people and, and the privilege of sitting down in this podcast with different people from different

363
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,960
backgrounds, that is a common thing that comes up almost every time. It's like when I've trusted my

364
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,500
instinct and really listened to myself, I've been able to, I've been able to, I've been able to, I've

365
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,240
almost always have a good outcome when I've gone away from that. And I want someone to be good

366
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,859
because I need them to be good. That's where, you know, we've, we've got into some, uh, some

367
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:47,799
trouble and I'm, I'm not surprised. That's a huge part of the intuition that you've got in,

368
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:52,359
in building your team. And Matt, we've been really grateful and excited that, uh, you've

369
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:56,759
been part of something that I really care about. Matt Waterwitz, uh, him and I were great mates

370
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:01,339
from under 12s. We played football together and, uh, Alita Connect, you probably know it as the

371
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:04,480
World Coach Symposium of bringing together extraordinary, extraordinary, extraordinary

372
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,720
coaches like yourself to, to connect and to learn and to share in non-competing

373
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:15,180
environments. And your Alita Connect group is, as we refer to it as, uh, Mikel Arteta,

374
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,279
who's having an extraordinary season with, uh, with Arsenal, uh, George Carl, an NBA Hall of Fame,

375
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:25,839
uh, coach, Eddie Jones, who started as the head coach of English rugby now, uh, back here in

376
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:30,559
Australia coaching, um, Australian rugby. Mike Dunlap is at the, uh, Milwaukee Bucks. Can you

377
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,460
tell us about that, that experience for you, Matt, taking the time out to reflect,

378
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,579
and connect with different coaches around the globe? Oh, it's invaluable. Um, I've never been

379
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:47,059
a part of something like this before, and it is one of the coolest experiences that I've been able

380
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:53,880
to partake in. I'm so thankful for, for Mike Dunlap for getting me in touch with Matt and Matt

381
00:30:53,880 --> 00:31:01,119
and all the work he puts in, um, and just to, uh, gain perspective from these other guys. And

382
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:04,460
I swear, every time I go in that group, I was like, man, these guys,

383
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:12,259
must think I'm a dope because, uh, they are some intelligent dudes and they've always got great

384
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:19,339
insight, uh, great ideas, just great perspective. And it's, it's interesting. You know, I, I want

385
00:31:19,339 --> 00:31:26,380
to say that, um, I may be the youngest of the group on that, um, you, you know, you know,

386
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:32,380
in that group, but, uh, just the perspective and wisdom these guys have is amazing. And,

387
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,460
you know, going through,

388
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,839
uh, during our season, we're hit some tough times, you know, prior to this year,

389
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:45,880
we hadn't lost two games in a row. And then we go on a stretch where we lose like seven of eight.

390
00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:52,480
And so it was, it was great to be able to lean on those guys and gain some perspective in terms of

391
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:59,059
how they try to get their teams maybe out of a slump. Um, and it's also been so much fun to not

392
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:04,220
only get to know these guys, but to get to watch them, um, McKellar Teta, uh, what,

393
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:04,460
and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

394
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:10,680
unbelievable coach, unbelievable leader. I watched the all or nothing on, um, on Amazon

395
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:16,839
prime and I was, I just was glued to it. And every, every time, you know, they have a match,

396
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm, you know, always keeping up same with, with coach Dunlap with the bucks. Uh, I can't wait to

397
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,400
see what Eddie brings to the Australian rugby team. Cause I think he has got an, I mean,

398
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,680
he's unbelievable coach as well. And, uh, great perspective, like I've said, and then, you know,

399
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:34,440
coach Carl,

400
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:40,859
always has just, uh, you know, unbelievable experiences and a wealth of knowledge to draw

401
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:46,680
on. And Matt, for, for the mechanics of it, for you to slot in an hour and a quarter meeting,

402
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:52,200
which is what it is. And, and, um, you know, uh, maybe once a month, or can you tell us about,

403
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:58,180
you know, most people would think, uh, your role it's, uh, it's surrounded by lots of pressure,

404
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:02,140
but I suspect it's a bit of a lonely thing at times, isn't it? That leadership and

405
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,079
to be able to share that with other people,

406
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,640
who know exactly what you're, you're feeling, they know what it's like to sit in that chair.

407
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,480
They know the pressures. It's, uh, it seems like a pretty valuable thing, as you said,

408
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,799
to be able to get that perspective. Is that, is that how it feels?

409
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:23,339
Oh, absolutely. Uh, every, every time, you know, we have a chat, you take about four or five things

410
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:29,079
from that at a minimum. I mean, Matt used to, he, he, he would kind of make fun of me because the

411
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:33,799
first time I'm on there, I'm just taking notes the whole time. And just, I referenced those notes all

412
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,440
the time though.

413
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:40,640
And it's, it's pretty cool when you get an inside look at, like I mentioned the, uh, all or nothing

414
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,660
with Arsenal and watching the Cal work. And you can see just some of the things that we talk about

415
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:52,940
come to life. And, um, you know, I've been fortunate. I traveled with the Milwaukee bucks

416
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:58,640
a year ago and, uh, went on like a, uh, a road trip with them for a couple of games and just

417
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,440
to watch how coach Boone holes are, um, you know, runs his squad. And it's so different.

418
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:11,360
Our worlds are completely different in terms of just the day-to-day, um, you know, time commitment

419
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:19,039
that is placed upon the job and what you got to get done. But, um, it, there, there were so many

420
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:24,239
lessons from going with those guys, watching how they work. And that's quite frankly, how I met

421
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:29,280
coach Dunlap and, um, that I swear he might be the smartest person I've ever met in my life.

422
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,139
Uh, but it's just, it's great to be able to pick those guys brains and develop

423
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,159
a relationship with them and try to learn from them.

424
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:42,320
And we really love, I had such a great pleasure to sit down and do this with, with Mike, as you said,

425
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,840
the, the wisdom that pours out of, uh, of, uh, Mike Dunlap is extraordinary and, and not dissimilar

426
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:53,960
to this, uh, conversation, but we think that there's something special in sharing great leaders

427
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,119
and, and just their life hacks and, and getting together. And I know this sounds a bit altruistic,

428
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,039
Matt, but from a world where, you know, sometimes leadership has been challenging in a global sense,

429
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:04,440
the more people that you're talking to, the more people that you're talking to, the more people

430
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,380
that, uh, share their wisdom and, and, and their influence in a, in a positive way.

431
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:14,360
And you've been incredibly generous, uh, in referring, um, the program I lead to connect

432
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:19,119
on Darrell Franklin's the chief of staff at Green Bay. He was, uh, in a really fascinating group

433
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,699
with an Australian legend, uh, John Bertrand, who, who knocked off the Americans in the

434
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:30,480
America's Cup. He's a, uh, a hall of fame, uh, uh, icon, uh, John, and one of our great coaches,

435
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,900
Justin Leppich. And that group is fascinating with different people as well. And,

436
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:38,559
and you've also, um, recommended to Sean McVay. As you said, you've got a great history with Sean,

437
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:43,239
who's a competing coach at the LA Rams. I mean, it's a, it's a generous thing for you to,

438
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:47,559
to share it on. Do you feel like it has got purpose? You don't necessarily have to be a

439
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:51,559
head coach of an NFL to get benefit out of coming together in this, this forum?

440
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:57,320
Oh, we could all learn from one another and whether you're a head coach or you're an assistant coach,

441
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:03,320
Darrell's our chief of staff. Uh, he's the guy that I lean on regularly every day. And what I

442
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:09,539
love about Darrell, and this is what you find out about leadership is sometimes people are afraid

443
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:15,159
to really tell you the truth. Well, Darrell is not one of those guys. He always, he always comes at

444
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:20,980
me and he'll hit me with it and he's not afraid. And sometimes I might get upset and angry. Uh,

445
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,880
but it's stuff that you always need to hear. You need to hear the truth, whether you want to hear

446
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:32,880
it or not. And I think that's one thing that we are, are, you know, we're always coaching our

447
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:39,219
coaches, but if I, if I'm not coachable as well, then, you know, I think there's a problem with

448
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:45,739
that. So always learning, willing to learn, got to be able to take the tough criticism to just

449
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:51,519
try to do our best. All we ask everybody is to be their best, the best version of them,

450
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:58,019
whatever that, that may be. Um, you know, I, I, I've been doing a lot of reading. Uh, it's,

451
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:02,860
it's interesting to, you know, go back and read books by like coach Wooden,

452
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:08,659
and how he defines success and success is just being at your best. And it might not be

453
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:14,179
holding the Superbowl trophy, but if we can lead everybody to their potential,

454
00:37:14,179 --> 00:37:17,300
then we have a chance at achieving that ultimate goal.

455
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:24,380
And we love the, the, uh, the leadership in people who've got a full on schedule,

456
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,960
still take the time out, as you said, to be the best version of themselves, constantly learning.

457
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,719
And we think that's a great example. It's been brilliant to have you. And I said,

458
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:33,300
I just wanted to ask you a question.

459
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,900
About Sean McVay and it's slightly off topic, but someone was telling me he's got a savant

460
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:44,000
like ability to remember, you know, you two are coaching six years ago. It could be rounds free

461
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:51,000
play six. He knows exactly the play. What happened in that call? Is that an urban myth or am I,

462
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:57,940
um, I'm on the money. He's going to try to downplay it, but it is, uh, a memory like

463
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,880
nobody I've ever been around. I mean, it is, he, he will,

464
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,300
when we were working on the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh,

465
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:09,860
working together, he'd be like, Hey, uh, pull up that game from Denver in Chicago from two years

466
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:16,539
ago. I think it was in the second quarter. I mean, it is unbelievable, but the guy, he loves football.

467
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:24,400
He studies, um, you know, he, he fully invests in, in the game, in the people. I can't tell you

468
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,780
how much I learned from him. And he was the youngest head coach in NFL history. I want to

469
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,780
say he was 29 when he got the Rams job. And, uh,

470
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:41,420
here I am about seven years older than him. And I'm looking at him in all, uh, just unbelievable

471
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:49,119
person, a great leader. He was, I was for Sean, what Daryl is for me. I was the guy that always

472
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,360
was going to tell him the truth. And sometimes he didn't want to hear it. And man, we would have

473
00:38:54,360 --> 00:39:00,360
some battles back and forth. The best beam, uh, I'll never forget this. So we were on the practice

474
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,960
field and, um, you know, coaches,

475
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:09,960
we're competitive and we might have our own idea or way of seeing something. And I got into a little

476
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:16,840
bit of a disagreement with another coach and Sean kind of jumped in. And, um, I was, I was the

477
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:22,619
coordinator, uh, at the time and he jumps in and kind of took the other guy's side and I'll never

478
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:28,179
forget. And this is one of my best friends. I went into his office. I said, Hey, Sean,

479
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,159
with all due respect, because when you say with all due respect, anything's your free

480
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:40,739
name. I said, why don't you just fire me right now? And, uh, he, he flipped the script on me

481
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:46,139
though. He's like, you know what? I'm miserable, man. I can't, I can't take this job right now.

482
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:51,079
And I was like, you can't say that you're the head coach. And it ended up being a, you know,

483
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:56,000
we hugged it out and got through it. But those are the stories that you always remember. And

484
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,079
in, in the time it was, you know, there was some tension, but now we sit, we sit back and we

485
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,960
laugh about it. And it's a great story. It's like the beauty of when you've got an environment

486
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,820
where that trust is there, you can, you can be hard on your sleeve and, and, and call it it as

487
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:18,280
you see it. Um, I want to ask you a topical question and, um, you know, I'm sure you'll

488
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,579
answer this however, however you feel, but you're one of your players, Aaron Rogers in all time,

489
00:40:22,699 --> 00:40:28,300
he's an all-time great of American football, Superbowl winner, four-time NFL MVP, 39 years

490
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:33,300
of age and, and been at Green Bay his whole career. No one plays forever, do they? That's

491
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:38,340
just the reality of it. I mean, how do you handle those leadership conversations, man? How do you

492
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:44,159
apply the values when, you know, anyone gets to the end of their career, it's always a nuanced

493
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:50,699
conversation. How have you been able to handle those conversations? I think with, with just

494
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:58,260
being honest, um, about the situation and, you know, Aaron's a guy that I have so much respect

495
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:03,300
for just what he's done, not only for the organization, but

496
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:10,239
I can speak personally. I've learned so much from him, uh, many times as coaches, uh, you know,

497
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:14,440
it's, it's a pretty good idea to learn from the best players you've been around. And I've learned

498
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:21,139
so much from him and he's got an unbelievable perspective of how he sees the game. And that's

499
00:41:21,139 --> 00:41:25,119
one of the challenges you're always trying to get on the same page, especially with that position.

500
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:31,739
I would argue that that position is, is, is valuable as any and all sports. Uh, when you

501
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,300
have a guy like that, you know,

502
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:38,079
you have an opportunity to go out and win and compete at the highest level each and every

503
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:45,039
week. And he's, he's another guy that his memory might be right up there with Sean's, um, maybe

504
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:52,659
better, but he, oh, he is, he is incredible. I've never met somebody that can multitask the way he

505
00:41:52,659 --> 00:42:01,440
can. And what I mean by that is we'll be in a game. Um, you know, he is so observant, so aware of

506
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,739
everything that's going on.

507
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:09,679
And he can sit there and he can be watching the defense in between the play, the way we call plays

508
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:14,760
in, you know, he hears it through his headset. I could be telling him to play. He could be having a

509
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:22,280
conversation with, with somebody else, see what the defense is doing. Um, it is unique. I've never

510
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:29,639
been around anybody like that. And now when you have a guy that talented, because the guy can

511
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:33,280
still play at a really high level, I mean, shoot two years ago.

512
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:41,579
You know, back to back MVPs. Um, and he, he's been a great leader for us. And, um, you know, I, I know

513
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:49,260
that again, it's, it's a highly criticized league, a highly criticized position. Um, and that, that

514
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:54,559
kind of comes with the territory. And, you know, personally, I believe that a lot of times

515
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:58,480
quarterbacks get too much credit when you win and too much blame when you lose. And that's just

516
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,300
comes with the position, but, um, you know, he's, he's done a lot for us.

517
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:09,579
A lot of people. And he does so much stuff that, that people don't even see. I can't tell you

518
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:15,179
the time he takes. And we have a pretty cool thing here. Every week we have a make a wish

519
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:21,900
kid or two come in when we have home games. And, you know, this is, they'll come in on Saturday.

520
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:27,260
They'll watch our Saturday. We have a walkthrough on Saturdays. And then after, after practice,

521
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:33,260
we'll go back in the lunchroom and have lunch. And he will sit with that kid and the families

522
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:41,079
for an hour. And I don't know too many superstars in with, with our busy schedule that devote that

523
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:47,480
type of time and attention. And when, when he is there, he is present and he does an unbelievable

524
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:53,380
job with that. And, you know, like you said, it's, it's always tough when you get into a

525
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:59,940
situation. Um, certainly I always want what's best for him and, and at the end and for what's

526
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:03,239
best for, for all of us, for the Packers. And,

527
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:09,980
um, but he's a guy that I will always be grateful for, um, whether he's playing for

528
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,980
the Green Bay Packers or if he chooses to retire or play somewhere else.

529
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:19,320
And when you look at it, um, Matt, um, the history is fascinating, isn't it? For the

530
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,960
Green Bay to have, you know, he's going to be a hall of fame, uh, quarterback. There's

531
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,659
no question about that. His predecessor, Brett Favre is a hall of fame, you know, Green Bay

532
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:33,199
quarterback. And so for your organization to have that back to back, and there's probably

533
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:38,019
a similar pattern, isn't it? Really, you know, Brett gets to the end and, and it's,

534
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:42,139
it's, it's challenging, isn't it? So loved and so respected and so successful Superbowl

535
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:46,800
winning, uh, quarterbacks. It's a, it's a little bit of history, um, repeating itself

536
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,619
in some ways, but, uh, but I suppose a great story for, for Green Bay all around at the

537
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:51,099
same time.

538
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:57,639
Yeah, I was, I was joking. Our fans have been very spoiled by two unbelievable quarterbacks.

539
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:01,699
And like I said, they just, they give you a chance to win each and every week. And I

540
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,239
know we've, we've been close.

541
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:07,500
We've been close a few times, but, but didn't get it done. And that's just, that's part

542
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,380
of this game. And, and, um, you know, there's a little bit of luck, I would say along the

543
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:19,760
way that the competitive balance in the NFL is, is it's unbelievable because truly you

544
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,199
could any given Sunday, I'm sure you, you've heard that, that term before, and they, they

545
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:31,679
had a movie about it, you know, and, uh, but it's the truth because if we don't go out

546
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:32,900
and perform at our best.

547
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,260
Whether you're the best team or the worst team in the league, you, you might get beat

548
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,000
and you always got to put it out there.

549
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:45,480
Man, I feel, um, talking Green Bay Packers and you as the head coach that, uh, that Vince

550
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:51,619
Lombardi legacy as, you know, maybe the most revered sports coach in world sport ever,

551
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:56,480
and there've been more books written about Lombardi and more quotes attributed to him

552
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,440
than maybe ever coached. Can you feel, you know, five-time, uh, Green Bay Superbowl winner,

553
00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:03,239
including Superbowl winner?

554
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:07,980
One and two Vince Lombardi. Can you sort of feel that, that, that presence in the, in

555
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,679
the part of the history when you walk through the, the corridors?

556
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:17,000
Oh, you can see, you see it all over. So, yeah. And I mean, not to mention that the

557
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,900
Superbowl trophy is the Lombardi trophy. So, um, no, that's one of the beauties of the

558
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:29,119
Green Bay Packers. It's, it's like got the history and legacy of, of teams like the New

559
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,119
York Yankees.

560
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:31,119
And, um, it's just, it's one of those franchises, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

561
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:36,760
it's just, it's one of those franchises and it's extremely special. Like I said, the expectations

562
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:42,159
here are extremely high. And I embrace that. I love that. I wouldn't want it any other

563
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:48,760
way. And, um, you know, I think that allows us to really work, to be our best each and

564
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:54,619
every day. And we got to utilize each and every day to give ourselves a chance to put

565
00:46:54,619 --> 00:47:00,099
ourselves in a position to potentially hoist that Lombardi trophy. That one thing I like

566
00:47:00,099 --> 00:47:01,099
to always talk to.

567
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:07,260
to our guys about is we will respect the history of the green bay packers but it's our job to make

568
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:12,320
new history and it just it's not going to fall in your lap you've got to work for it each and every

569
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:20,380
day and uh matt um you're changing sort of tax slightly i look at you know your day-to-day and i

570
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:27,099
i see a strong healthy fit uh looking you know 43 rolled in front in front of me what what sort of

571
00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:32,800
things do you do daily is there any sort of hacks and daily routines that you do that keep you

572
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:39,579
healthy in this job yeah uh well first of all i got my shirt on so i look better with my shirt on

573
00:47:39,579 --> 00:47:46,980
than my shirt off but um no i i would say it is important for us especially this time of year

574
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:52,739
where we get out and get some exercise um you know one of my assistants put me through a great

575
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:56,239
little workout routine this afternoon and i'm

576
00:47:57,099 --> 00:48:03,820
but i'm gonna fight through it but no i try to work out each and every day um at least a little

577
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:10,000
bit of movement whether it's 20 minutes whether it's 40 minutes you know time is at a premium and

578
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,179
and you got to try to balance that and manage your time the best you can and be efficient

579
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:21,380
when we're at work um you know like i said during the season it gets much more challenging though

580
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:27,079
because just there's there's going to be some days where you're going to get four hours of sleep or

581
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:33,579
five hours of sleep and you know that starts to pile up the longer the season goes and our season

582
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:42,179
tends to be pretty long although not as long as um you know soccer or football as is as the rest

583
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:49,900
of the world knows it um you know but i just i do think it's important to just you know

584
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:57,059
clear your mind and and blow off some steam in that regard um and so i i try to get something

585
00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:02,460
in each and every day and then we have an unbelievable setup here with with our nutrition

586
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:10,679
plan we've got our uh head nutritionist adam corzine does an unbelievable job for us and

587
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:17,739
you know he'll make up a meal plan for us so we're not eating too bad um but it does it does

588
00:49:17,739 --> 00:49:22,239
get a little bit challenging during the season of of staying in shape especially when you're

589
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:24,840
working there late and uh you want a little snack

590
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:31,260
seems like you got a good hand on that uh matt we've been identifying these dimensions of

591
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:36,559
leadership uh uh matt waterwoods and i through talking to incredible leaders like yourself and

592
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,539
seeing these these patterns and we think that you're really hard to lead others without a sense

593
00:49:41,539 --> 00:49:48,920
of self-leadership when i ask that back to you what does self-leadership mean well i i think

594
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:55,320
first of all when you're talking about leadership you've got to be true to who you are and know who

595
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,059
you are and know where you're weak and you've got to be true to who you are and know where you're

596
00:49:57,079 --> 00:50:05,460
strong and we we got a lot of uh like i said we got a collaborative effort around us so i try to

597
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:09,920
surround myself with people that are smarter than me and better in a lot of different areas and then

598
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:16,900
you know lean on one each other or lean on each other but i think a lot of it is just you know

599
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:22,960
developing those relationships and and trying to be disciplined in your own life and and knowing

600
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,059
what your true core values are um because that helps you to be more disciplined in your own life

601
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:32,099
helps set your vision if you know what you want to be about then i think you can articulate that

602
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:38,559
better and get more buy-in from everybody else yeah brilliant uh brilliant answer and that

603
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:45,199
authentic uh nature of who you are is very um you know something you can see in all of your answers

604
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:50,480
positively impacting others in the environment we see people in leadership positions now really

605
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:56,000
who do it well really conscious day-to-day how they impact people positively in your day-to-day

606
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,059
life is that something you think about in your day-to-day life is that something you think about

607
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:08,079
think of absolutely i think uh you know what's what's what's remarkable to me is and if people

608
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:14,420
really knew me i i don't think they'd be as uh in awe and you know you go out in the in the public

609
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:19,340
and everybody wants to meet you and shake your hand and get a picture and all this and i was

610
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:24,659
like man they'd be disappointed if they were at home with me on a daily basis but i i do think

611
00:51:24,659 --> 00:51:27,059
it's important that when you're in a situation where you're in a situation where you're in a

612
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:32,760
you have conversations with people especially with people in your building to be present because

613
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:38,659
that 30-second conversation or that five-minute conversation however long it may be that might

614
00:51:38,659 --> 00:51:43,820
be the most important conversation for them throughout the course of the day and i think

615
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:50,639
that can really impact their work and what they bring to the table and just the buy-in you get

616
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:57,019
from them the effort that they're going to give each and every day um so i think that for me is

617
00:51:57,059 --> 00:52:02,179
just making sure i'm as present as possible and don't get me wrong the wheels are always kind of

618
00:52:02,179 --> 00:52:08,159
turning um because it is at times it can be challenging when when there's stuff going on

619
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:13,699
obviously there's a lot going on with our team right now and you you constantly have certain

620
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:20,219
things in your head but to the best of your ability you've got to try to just shut that off

621
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:26,619
and and totally be invested in and and be present and be where your feet are and um

622
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:35,179
give that person just the respect uh to to fully invest in that conversation and matt you sort of

623
00:52:35,179 --> 00:52:40,559
say with a smile you know uh be careful we'll be in awe of of matt lefleur you're as human as

624
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:45,380
everyone else and and everyone he is i mean what do you mean that on the home front you're you're

625
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:51,940
making mistakes and yeah you know we do tend to um you know uh idolize you know particularly in

626
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:57,039
such a high profile role like yours um you're saying reality is there's there's there's

627
00:52:57,059 --> 00:53:01,639
bumps and and along the way that people don't see is that is that what you're saying oh yeah i'm far

628
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:06,860
from perfect and i'll be the first to admit that and again i but i think that's part of the journey

629
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:12,079
you're going to make mistakes hopefully you don't make the same mistake twice you try to learn from

630
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:17,800
whatever it is that where your shortcomings are and you're you're constantly trying to get better

631
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:24,920
and i i think you can't do that if you don't have some semblance of humility and you know

632
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,940
luckily for me i've got guys like daryl

633
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:33,300
franklin that help keep me humble and uh people like my wife that will will bring me down quite a

634
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:41,420
bit at times and but i need it and uh no i'm kidding she's unbelievable supportive but uh no

635
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:46,619
but that's part of this is just surrounding yourself with people that they're going to keep

636
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:51,699
it real with you and you know tell you the hard truth sometimes yeah there's great comfort for me

637
00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:55,920
and that isn't it constantly trying to be better not not ever you know expecting to be perfect but

638
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,039
constantly learning and learning and learning and learning and learning and learning and learning

639
00:53:57,059 --> 00:54:02,920
as uh as you're you know very uh passionate about creating and sharing a vision leaders uh you know

640
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:07,460
positions like yours and in other areas as well they're really clear on how they share that vision

641
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:12,699
i'm assuming the packers vision is pretty clear how do you go about getting the buy-in and sharing

642
00:54:12,699 --> 00:54:21,000
that vision well i i think by establishing what what's important your values and then um i always

643
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,519
think it's you know we have so many people involved in our our process or our organization

644
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:32,840
um and it's important to hear them too and what's important to each individual and you know

645
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:38,679
i've said it a million times but it's it's about that collective vision ultimately somebody's got

646
00:54:38,679 --> 00:54:45,980
to you know set it but i i think it is important along the the way to you know hear everybody out

647
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:51,699
and then you know you got to go with whatever whatever you think is best to get the most out

648
00:54:51,699 --> 00:54:57,039
of your team and matt uh curiosity is a word that we associate a lot with when we're talking about

649
00:54:57,059 --> 00:55:02,619
our leaders really focus on curiosity or are curious and that's how they think about learning

650
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:08,920
and and improving themselves does that resonate with you curiosity absolutely i would uh be in

651
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:15,019
the world coaches symposium if i wasn't curious on how these other guys lead and to take ideas

652
00:55:15,019 --> 00:55:22,119
from them and you know that's why i do like to read or uh do a lot of audiobooks every morning

653
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:27,039
i drive to work it's about a 15 minute drive uh always have something on

654
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:34,400
and it it does mess me up at times when you want to take a note on something but um you got to be

655
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:43,519
careful and just try to clip it real fast but um no i think that's you just if you're not curious

656
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:51,340
it's hard to truly learn it's hard to truly grow um and so yeah i'm absolutely curious on a daily

657
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:57,019
basis can you share with us what what you're reading what what sort of uh books are in uh

658
00:55:57,059 --> 00:56:03,699
your audio uh cassette at the moment i've got a lot of them but uh the one i'm on right now is

659
00:56:03,699 --> 00:56:10,960
getting to neutral it's about the you know just that that neutral state not high not low um just

660
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:18,940
essentially getting to the truth um and uh so but i've i've done a lot of books and and that

661
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:25,500
was something that was foreign to me prior to getting the head job i've just dove into the

662
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,039
football side of things i would say and i've done a lot of books and i've done a lot of books

663
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:34,420
the x's and o's you know evaluating players um and then in in my free time spending my time with

664
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:40,500
my family so it's just it's been a great way to to maximize our time and i talked about just

665
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:48,940
being efficient so when you're when you got 15 minutes in the car or if i like to um listen well

666
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:55,179
while i'm working out and um it's it's a little bit harder when you're you're exhausted to really

667
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:56,980
lock in at times but it

668
00:56:57,059 --> 00:57:03,340
also takes your mind off of the pain of of some of the workouts uh but just always try to maximize

669
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:10,280
those opportunities and the time to to try to learn a little something communicating with uh

670
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:15,800
with clarity something you you clearly do well are you conscious of of how you go about

671
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:22,440
communicating as as a leader of the green bay packers yeah i think it's it's all about being

672
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,760
clear and concise and um you know i read a great quote from

673
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:33,300
from the wooden book that i had recently read and a lot of times i think coaches we have a

674
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:40,940
tendency to over talk and it's important that the quote was don't take 30 minutes to say something

675
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:47,340
that might take 30 seconds so i try to do that with our team with our team meetings you know 15

676
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:53,519
20 minutes you know it's it's a very interesting um world right now i think people's attention

677
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:56,900
spans are are getting shorter and shorter and shorter and

678
00:57:57,059 --> 00:58:03,619
where their guys are constantly i see with my kids on their ipads or guys are on their phones and

679
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:12,579
um the stimulus changes quite frequently for people in today's world um so i try to

680
00:58:12,579 --> 00:58:21,699
get guys to dial in for for those short increments um and you know just change it up as much as we

681
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:27,039
need to um just to try to keep their attention reading a good book for you

682
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:32,460
at the moment matt's uh stolen focus johan hurry's book about exactly how the world's changed so much

683
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:38,940
and our capacity to have focus for extended periods of time has changed and so it's i'm not

684
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:44,760
surprised that people like you're adapting that message to a team that you know you're just really

685
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:49,119
wasting time aren't you if you overdo it you're going to lose that um ability for it to be

686
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:53,860
effective and it's interesting to hear that you're uh shortening me i sat in a lot of long team

687
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:57,039
meetings uh as a as a as a player and i think it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's

688
00:58:57,059 --> 00:59:01,900
i go for an hour and a half weird player i remember teammates i mean we're professional

689
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:06,000
here in australia matt is a he's a loose term when you consider the scale of america but

690
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,400
played professional sport but i remember guys literally asleep and snoring in some of our team

691
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:16,900
meetings because they were you know 25 minutes and even back then uh you'd lost the attention

692
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:23,460
span for sure how important is this collaboration i've seen that too now somewhere i've had to keep

693
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:26,840
guys out of meetings so uh falling asleep in one of your meetings

694
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:35,480
oh that that is i've seen it happen um thankfully for us it hasn't happened many times but yeah you

695
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:41,599
you will uh i certainly won't stand for that if i see somebody starting to doze off hey stand up

696
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:47,320
do whatever you got to do to stay up yeah and fair enough isn't it to at least be awake

697
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:51,780
in a professional sporting meeting makes sense how important is collaboration to you

698
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:59,420
well i think that's everything we do on a daily basis um like i said we've got 23 coaches so

699
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:06,659
there's a lot of ideas getting thrown out there all the time um we have you know 11 guys on

700
01:00:06,659 --> 01:00:12,139
offense nine guys on defense and three special teams coaches so everybody's got their own

701
01:00:12,139 --> 01:00:20,139
little area of expertise and so you have to filter through these ideas um and and somebody's got to

702
01:00:20,139 --> 01:00:21,760
make a decision but i think that's everything we do on a daily basis um i think that's everything

703
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,519
I do think it's an important part of just the buy-in process.

704
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:28,820
If people know that you're willing to listen,

705
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,679
I think you're going to get just better ideas.

706
01:00:35,179 --> 01:00:37,199
They're going to be more invested in the process.

707
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:43,119
And ultimately, they're going to be better coaches, be more loyal.

708
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:47,219
And hopefully, that leads to a better product.

709
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,320
And all the research suggests that, isn't it?

710
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,079
If you feel like you've got a voice in your environment,

711
01:00:52,139 --> 01:00:54,139
you feel like you're contributing in a meaningful way,

712
01:00:54,179 --> 01:00:56,880
you're being listened to, you don't always get your way,

713
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,460
but it's the most effective leadership style.

714
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:01,079
We know that.

715
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:04,719
And very clear purpose and passion of yours.

716
01:01:05,179 --> 01:01:06,980
Matt, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

717
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,159
The greatest leader in my life?

718
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:15,579
Man, that's a very tough question, Luke,

719
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,860
because I've been around so many great leaders.

720
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:19,880
And...

721
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:24,139
I would say my parents, first and foremost,

722
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:29,440
just modeling the right behaviors and instilling levels of discipline

723
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,679
that I would like to think that I possess.

724
01:01:33,699 --> 01:01:38,460
And just a work ethic, knowing that there are no shortcuts to success.

725
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:40,539
And that doesn't even guarantee it.

726
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:44,300
You know, just always trying to strive to be your best.

727
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:47,380
But I've been fortunate to be around so many great coaches,

728
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:49,619
from guys like Gary Kubiak.

729
01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:51,679
Gary Kubiak gave me my first opportunity in this league.

730
01:01:52,139 --> 01:01:55,440
We've talked about guys like Robert Sala with the Jets

731
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,559
and Sean McVay and worked with Kyle Shanahan

732
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,940
and his father, Mike Shanahan,

733
01:02:01,139 --> 01:02:03,860
who won two Super Bowls with the Denver Broncos.

734
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:08,780
Dan Quinn, who is now the defense coordinator for the Dallas Cowboys.

735
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,519
He was our head coach in Atlanta.

736
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:14,199
And quite frankly, a lot of what we do here

737
01:02:14,199 --> 01:02:17,940
is from my experiences in Atlanta

738
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,440
and just how we train.

739
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,000
We try to create an environment

740
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,099
where guys enjoy coming to work on a daily basis

741
01:02:24,099 --> 01:02:26,380
because it is a grind.

742
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:31,059
These men are under a lot of scrutiny each and every day,

743
01:02:31,179 --> 01:02:33,900
both within the building and outside.

744
01:02:34,599 --> 01:02:37,539
And, you know, all these guys, they read social media.

745
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,119
And, you know, unfortunately,

746
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:44,000
there's probably more hate in this world than guys.

747
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:46,380
And people are trying to tear you down at times.

748
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,300
And that's why it's so important that,

749
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,500
if I had my way,

750
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:51,900
I'd tell these guys,

751
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:53,820
your diet isn't just what you eat.

752
01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:55,500
It's everything you consume.

753
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,260
So, cut that out.

754
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,239
Don't look at it.

755
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:00,900
And I know it's tough to do

756
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,940
because these guys have grown up with that.

757
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:07,119
But, you know, just being around a guy like Dan Quinn

758
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:10,900
and just having these guys come to work

759
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:14,119
excited about coming to a team meeting,

760
01:03:14,219 --> 01:03:15,679
not knowing what to expect,

761
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:17,820
you know, and still in competition,

762
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:21,119
and everything we do from the meeting setting

763
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:22,519
out on the practice field

764
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:26,960
with the thought of trying to, again,

765
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,519
have everybody reach their potential,

766
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:30,980
just be the best version of them.

767
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:33,059
I love that line.

768
01:03:33,139 --> 01:03:35,420
Your diet's not what you eat.

769
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:37,280
It's everything you consume.

770
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:39,280
And I'm fascinated, isn't it?

771
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,159
Even at a professional level,

772
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:44,420
you guys are having to address that balance, isn't it?

773
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:47,800
Around, you know, there's as human as a kid goes,

774
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,659
going to school, aren't they?

775
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:50,800
And that level of direct contact now

776
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,739
that you can get through your phone

777
01:03:52,739 --> 01:03:54,360
and it's right to the parenting puzzle

778
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,659
and the coaching puzzle, isn't it?

779
01:03:55,679 --> 01:03:57,840
How do you, you can't exist without it,

780
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,059
but it can be pretty damaging, can't it?

781
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:01,880
For even professional athletes.

782
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:02,619
And I love your answers.

783
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,719
It's starting with mum and dad

784
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:05,619
and their profound influence on you,

785
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:08,340
but the range of influences being, you know,

786
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,099
the leadership that's shaped Matt LeFleur into who he is.

787
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:13,139
We are a bit obsessed with collaboration

788
01:04:13,139 --> 01:04:14,760
in what we're trying to do at Alita,

789
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,780
a world of collaboration, inspiring connections,

790
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:17,780
trying to, as you said,

791
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:19,840
there's a bit of hate out there in the world,

792
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,139
but there's also a lot of joy

793
01:04:21,139 --> 01:04:23,000
when great people like you share

794
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,239
why you're successful and get together with other people.

795
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:28,719
If you could collaborate with anyone, Matt, on anything,

796
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:31,039
is there a name that springs to mind?

797
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:35,420
Well, you know, just probably

798
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:37,440
because I just read his book,

799
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:38,539
but I would love,

800
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,940
I would have loved to have met and sat down

801
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:45,239
and listened to John Wooden and his philosophies

802
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:49,039
because, man, there's so many gold nuggets

803
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,139
that he possessed.

804
01:04:52,519 --> 01:04:55,599
And he had, I think he was quite, quite frankly,

805
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:58,780
ahead of his time and just the pyramid of success,

806
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:02,340
just his way that he developed that.

807
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:04,559
And I think it all goes back to his values

808
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,019
and what was important to him.

809
01:05:06,019 --> 01:05:09,320
And that gave him the vision for which he led by.

810
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,500
The wizard of Westwood, John Wooden.

811
01:05:12,699 --> 01:05:14,019
It's extraordinary.

812
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:15,780
I know, that's an easy one.

813
01:05:16,019 --> 01:05:16,460
That's an easy one.

814
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,719
Everybody probably feels that.

815
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,019
But you generally feel like,

816
01:05:19,159 --> 01:05:19,739
you know, you've taken,

817
01:05:20,179 --> 01:05:21,099
you read that book

818
01:05:21,099 --> 01:05:22,460
and there's practical things

819
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,860
that you can absorb into your daily role.

820
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:26,360
Absolutely.

821
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,440
I don't think it's overly complex.

822
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,480
I think it's, you know,

823
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,440
it's very simple,

824
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:38,219
but yet relatable things that he did

825
01:05:38,219 --> 01:05:40,300
and that he inspired his team by.

826
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,039
And I think it started with who he was as a man.

827
01:05:43,159 --> 01:05:44,639
He was a man of high integrity.

828
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:48,420
And I think his players absolutely could see that.

829
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,960
And it got their buy-in.

830
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,679
Matt, I think I can feel the same values and integrity

831
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:56,800
just come out in our conversation today.

832
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,780
I know you've got an incredibly hectic time.

833
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:02,300
I really appreciate you taking the time to join me today

834
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:03,280

835
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:07,280
and equally grateful to have you join the World Coach Symposium

as part of Leader Connect

837
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,440
and to refer that to people that you trust in your sphere.

838
01:06:12,579 --> 01:06:13,920
Thanks so much, Matt, for taking the time.

839
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:14,559
Really appreciate it.

840
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:16,559
I appreciate it all, Luke.

841
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:18,139
I've had a blast.

842
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,440
Like I said, I've learned a lot from the World Coaches Symposium

843
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,780
and I want to thank you and Matt

844
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:27,039
for allowing me to be a part of that group.

845
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:28,980
