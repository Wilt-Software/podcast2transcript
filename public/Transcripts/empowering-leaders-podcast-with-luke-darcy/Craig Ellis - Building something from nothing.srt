1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:11,039
How important is it to learn from your experiences

2
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:13,019
and how do you find the drive for happiness

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,279
after you've had everything taken away from you?

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,250
G'day, it's Luke Darcy.

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,710
The idea of self-improvement and leadership

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,109
both on and off the field

7
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:24,870
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,510
With one of my oldest friends,

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:27,789
we created a leader collective

10
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:29,390
and have had the privilege of working

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,510
with thousands of leaders in education,

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,689
sport, industry and the arts

13
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:35,609
that have helped shift to what we see

14
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:37,670
as the 21st century style of leadership

15
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,130
where everyone has a voice.

16
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,710
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

17
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,909
I was joined by one of my closest mates, Craig Ellis.

18
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:04,150
Before founding one of the world's most successful

19
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,409
bikini brands, Triangle,

20
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,189
he was an AFL player but with a uniquely creative mind.

21
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,489
We discussed finding and following your passion,

22
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:14,069
taking risks like selling everything you own

23
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:15,150
and moving to Hong Kong

24
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,489
and how the best thing his parents had given him

25
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:18,510
was curiosity.

26
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,730
Well, mate, this is an out-of-body experience

27
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,469
for me and someone else.

28
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:25,030
I appreciate you joining me

29
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,790
as one of my oldest mates,

30
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,090
someone I've spent a lot of time with.

31
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:29,670
Thanks for joining us on the podcast.

32
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:30,530
Pleasure, mate.

33
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,329
Definitely a different side that I don't normally see,

34
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:34,409
I don't normally hear you,

35
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,489
but so this will be interesting.

36
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,069
Can I go back a little bit,

37
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:39,549
your early life and what shape,

38
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,950
you want to get to the Triangle story

39
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,930
and your sporting story

40
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,689
and many other stories, mate,

41
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,489
but your mum and dad were both school teachers.

42
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:47,849
How many schools did you attend

43
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:49,269
across your schooling journey?

44
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,150
Off the top of my head,

45
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,450
I don't actually,

46
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,150
but I know it was a lot.

47
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,750
We were probably moving every year or two

48
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,670
growing up,

49
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,310
little country towns

50
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,390
and it's interesting.

51
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:02,090
I think that part of moving around as a kid,

52
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,450
definitely don't mind jumping on an airplane now

53
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,549
and changing scenery.

54
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,569
So that definitely had an impact.

55
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,150
Every second year or every year at some point,

56
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,389
you were changing schools.

57
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:12,689
That's got to make you pretty resilient.

58
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,689
Yeah, yeah, a little bit.

59
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,949
There was a few trips to the principal's office

60
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:19,949
on the way through that journey,

61
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:21,370
but yeah, definitely change.

62
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,550
Learn to embrace change.

63
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,210
I think it was probably the key message out of all of that.

64
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,689
And yeah, I think that part of moving around

65
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:31,150
when you were young was really enjoyable.

66
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:32,169
Now I'm going to get in early

67
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:33,590
because you often accuse me of adding

68
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,669
a bit of GST to a few stories.

69
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,069
So I'm going to give myself 10% here

70
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:39,530
and you can correct me on any of them,

71
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,889
but fashion's been a huge part of your life.

72
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:43,949
And one of my favourite stories for me

73
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:45,949
is that with grade three or grade four,

74
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,689
and you can pull me back if I'm wrong.

75
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,870
I know where you're going with this already.

76
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:49,590
You decided that.

77
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,370
And it's not correct.

78
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,889
You did, 100% it's correct.

79
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,409
You decided.

80
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:53,810
You decided that you're at Stool Primary.

81
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:56,069
For those listening, Stool's country, Victoria,

82
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:58,889
it's farmland, salt of the earth type of people.

83
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:01,490
Your dad's a principal at the school.

84
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:03,669
And for your birthday in grade three or four,

85
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:05,849
you wanted a pink polo top, true?

86
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:07,430
Not entirely true.

87
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,650
I think mum wanted a daughter

88
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,389
and she's brought the pink T-shirt

89
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:13,330
and said, son, that's your birthday present.

90
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:14,930
I'm not buying that for a second, mate,

91
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:16,870
because I know exactly how you operate

92
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,770
and you would have seen that that was a look

93
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,789
that you wanted to go with.

94
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:21,590
Now tell me what it was like

95
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,610
walking through the gates of primary school

96
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,610
wearing a pink polo

97
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,629
and did you get in a fight literally

98
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,150
as you walked through the gate?

99
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,530
Not at all, not at all.

100
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:31,590
No flack at all.

101
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,210
It was embraced.

102
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,289
A week later, most people were in a pink T-shirt

103
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:35,409
was the outcome.

104
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,889
You're not going to tell the truth here, mate.

105
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:37,949
I will tell some stories.

106
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:41,370
But jettisoning forward, mate, that has been you.

107
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:42,750
I remember when I first met you,

108
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,789
we'd be going out and you'd turn up in this kit

109
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:47,469
and we'd go, oh my God, mate,

110
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,710
what are you looking at?

111
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,789
Leather pants or something.

112
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:53,469
But sure enough, it was about a three-year lag.

113
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:55,430
We'd be buying those clothes three years.

114
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,729
Where did that come from, mate?

115
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:01,169
That sense of style for a kid growing up in country schools

116
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:02,729
and all around regional Victoria.

117
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,370
How did you get that sense?

118
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,409
Well, I think first, let's be fair

119
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:08,669
and paint the story on both sides of the ledger here.

120
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:11,689
I mean, you were getting around a pair of tweed pants there

121
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:15,310
that looked like Arnold Palmer off the golf course.

122
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,149
They were a regular Saturday night.

123
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,829
I'd be curious to know where they came from.

124
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:20,769
Well, hence why.

125
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,110
I haven't gone on and created

126
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,029
one of the great fashion businesses in the world.

127
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:25,750
I knew exactly where my skill set was

128
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,730
and it wasn't in that space.

129
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:30,230
But let's move then into the footy part of your life.

130
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,870
As a young kid, mate,

131
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:35,550
you're a bottom age under 12 state player for Victoria.

132
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:38,230
Now, for those listening, that takes a bit.

133
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,410
You've got to be a gun junior to play under 12 state twice.

134
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,449
How much of a passion was it for you at that age?

135
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:46,290
Yeah, definitely growing up,

136
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,110
footy was absolute as a country kid.

137
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,329
You probably got tennis,

138
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:50,949
tennis in the summer,

139
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,310
a bit of yabbing and footy.

140
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,589
So the choices are pretty limited,

141
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,529
but I particularly love,

142
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:00,009
you know, the old man played country footy a lot

143
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,170
and with two brothers,

144
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,709
that was always the after school thing

145
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:04,670
that we did in the backyard

146
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,649
or up at the local footy ground.

147
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,430
And so, yeah, I was pretty passionate about it

148
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,629
from a young age onwards.

149
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,709
And our friendship started at the Bulldogs

150
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:15,949
and you went on to play over 100 games

151
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,509
and played 20 odd at Melbourne as well.

152
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:19,529
Now, it's fascinating.

153
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:20,209
I look at you,

154
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:23,089
and you are as far removed from being an AFL player

155
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,629
as anyone I know.

156
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:26,329
And it just seems like, you know,

157
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:28,089
it seems like a lifetime ago for me.

158
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:28,709
But when I look at you,

159
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,610
I think it's hard to even remember you out in the football field.

160
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:32,709
And that's not to downplay,

161
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:34,790
less than 5% of people get to play.

162
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,269
It might even be less than that.

163
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,550
So to get to that level was enormous.

164
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:40,029
But how would you describe,

165
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:41,209
because you're incredibly athletic,

166
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,589
you could run and jump and do all those things,

167
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,069
but you weren't someone really invested in football,

168
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:47,930
even when you were playing.

169
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:48,850
Is that fair to say?

170
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:49,649
Look,

171
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:52,670
the game for the game,

172
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,189
but all the stuff around the fringes

173
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,649
didn't excite me too much at all.

174
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,930
And I've never been much of a couch potato

175
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,670
in terms of watching the game on TV,

176
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,529
even since retiring.

177
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,329
I probably count on one hand

178
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:08,069
the number of times I've been to a football match.

179
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:09,350
So, but, you know,

180
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:11,990
generally that career was fantastic.

181
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,449
And obviously our friendship spawned out of that.

182
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:17,389
But when you're a young sort of fit guy

183
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:19,509
and playing and turning up to a work environment

184
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,050
with 50 of your best mates every day

185
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,310
is, you know,

186
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,069
something which I think is a brilliant experience

187
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:25,509
for any young guy.

188
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,850
And what you could do,

189
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:28,550
which was remarkable,

190
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,470
and I'm going to have to share this story here,

191
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:31,350
which I know is true

192
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,350
because I was sitting next to you

193
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,269
when this one happened.

194
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:34,910
But if you said to you,

195
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,050
go and play Matthew Richardson,

196
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:37,910
who was one of the great athletes of our time

197
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,370
and a remarkable player,

198
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:41,329
you could just go and do that.

199
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,089
Very few could.

200
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,089
Athletically, you could play

201
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:44,189
and you had some great battles with him

202
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:45,949
over the journey and other players.

203
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:47,389
But when you got too many instructions

204
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:49,370
or a coach just tried

205
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,009
to drill down,

206
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:52,589
your head tended to spin off a little bit.

207
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:53,310
I'll never forget,

208
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:55,389
we were playing the Fremantle Dockers.

209
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,470
They'd just been brought into the competition.

210
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,850
Terry Wallace is our coach

211
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,550
who was obsessed with football,

212
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,490
more than any person I think I've ever met in my life.

213
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,310
And he was so pissed off

214
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,110
that the players went doing their research

215
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,389
and he sat us in the room,

216
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:09,329
gave a blank piece of paper,

217
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,189
and he said,

218
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,449
unless you can name the vast majority

219
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:13,269
of the Fremantle side,

220
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:14,350
and no one knew in the competition

221
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,470
and even the guys that loved their footy

222
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,709
were a bit stressed.

223
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:19,089
But I remember looking at your bit

224
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:19,350
of paper and I was like,

225
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,110
and I'm sure there was only one name

226
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,750
on that bit of paper.

227
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:23,209
Is that true?

228
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,350
Yeah, I thought that test

229
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,329
was a little bit unfair.

230
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,689
It sort of came out of the blue.

231
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,850
We were ambushed a little bit.

232
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:30,709
Normally in that environment,

233
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:32,250
you're given a week or two

234
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:32,930
to do your homework

235
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,550
and a little preparation for the test.

236
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:37,370
But that one was sprung on us.

237
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,310
Yeah, I must admit,

238
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,110
I wasn't very well prepared for that one.

239
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,470
The thing you didn't add there

240
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,990
is that the name that you wrote down

241
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,189
was Jason Akamanis,

242
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,810
who was Brisbane Lions

243
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,449
Brownlow medalist at that stage.

244
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,829
So not only did you write one name down,

245
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:50,449
he actually played for another club.

246
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:51,470
So I think that was where

247
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,610
your transition was sort of going.

248
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,329
Maybe footy's heading out

249
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:55,649
and you're heading into a different path,

250
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:56,709
which around that time,

251
00:07:57,129 --> 00:07:57,889
around 1997,

252
00:07:58,389 --> 00:07:59,910
and you had an amazing year that year

253
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,350
and we get to a prelim final.

254
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:02,649
I think around then you started

255
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,670
your first clothing label,

256
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:04,889
which, you know,

257
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:06,350
again, you carved a path here

258
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,750
because there weren't players

259
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,269
or AFL players doing that.

260
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:10,550
It was called St. Lenny.

261
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,269
I've still got some of your T-shirts

262
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:13,689
made from back in 1997.

263
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,269
Yeah, where did the idea come for that?

264
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,490
And it was an incredible success.

265
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,790
In the first 12 months,

266
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:20,269
you turned over, you know,

267
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,129
a huge amount of money

268
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:22,370
in a startup business.

269
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,170
Tell us about that story.

270
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,870
Yeah, I think, look,

271
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,850
I don't know if apparel

272
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,149
was necessarily something

273
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:29,990
that was the focus more

274
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,569
than the business side of things,

275
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:33,429
but I just had met some people

276
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,470
at the time that were in apparel

277
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,730
and was curious about

278
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,570
what they were doing

279
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,009
and decided to give it a go,

280
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,169
actually, with a teammate, Nathan Brown.

281
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,590
And it was a really enjoyable experience.

282
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,230
Just, you know, I think

283
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,809
I just love the business side of it.

284
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,110
Probably more than anything.

285
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,169
And that was a great way

286
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:52,210
to cut your teeth, basically.

287
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:53,889
People mightn't understand

288
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:55,850
your sense of creativity.

289
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,629
And I always found this remarkable, mate,

290
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:58,809
is spending a lot of time with you

291
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:01,409
for a very vast part of my life.

292
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,450
There's things that you think of

293
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,409
that I just aren't even anywhere near

294
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:06,529
the world that I operate.

295
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,169
You had that scent that the T-shirts were washed in.

296
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,929
It was, and I remember picking it up

297
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:12,570
the first time and you wanted to, you know,

298
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,629
to wear it was like a lemon center, you know,

299
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:16,009
and it was a really, you know,

300
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,929
successful start, wasn't it?

301
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,809
For a young guy,

302
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:20,009
who knows nothing about business,

303
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:21,250
never been in a clothing label.

304
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:22,870
Now, the end wasn't so good.

305
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:24,210
You borrowed a bit of money

306
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,950
and probably overstretched yourself a little bit.

307
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:28,629
So, a bit of a life lesson

308
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:29,669
in your first attempt?

309
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,190
Yeah, a really strong feedback loop,

310
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:33,409
as I tend to call them.

311
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,409
Yeah, I think that, you know,

312
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,490
those feedback loops are a critical part

313
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,129
of personal growth.

314
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:41,370
And, you know, I actually really enjoy

315
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,049
the experience.

316
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:44,250
And I think, you know, at the time,

317
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:45,950
sometimes you can't see those

318
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,529
kicks in the balls that happen.

319
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,590
But then when you look back and you reflect

320
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,809
and you go into the next chapter,

321
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:54,730
how critical it was to have that experience.

322
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,509
And if you're open to the learning

323
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:58,450
of that experience, then, you know,

324
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,730
it was actually incredibly helpful

325
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,549
for the next chapter.

326
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,289
So, people think of an overnight success,

327
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,429
but that, from my experience,

328
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:05,610
is an overnight success

329
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,289
is often take 15 years of learning.

330
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,389
You saw me fall on my face

331
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:09,529
for 20 years prior to that.

332
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:11,330
So, you know exactly that wasn't the truth.

333
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:13,289
But in credit to you, I saw you,

334
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:15,129
you know, you never dwell on that.

335
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:17,590
You take 100% ownership of any mistake.

336
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,190
You're incredible.

337
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,309
It's saying, hey, I look straight in the mirror.

338
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:23,529
This is what I contributed to that mistake.

339
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:24,789
So, what sort of things did you learn?

340
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,710
Because you're manufacturing

341
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,730
in overseas parts of the world

342
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,230
and you had a crack at, I think,

343
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:30,990
New York Fashion Week and a few.

344
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,309
What sort of lessons did you learn

345
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:33,110
from that first attempt?

346
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:35,269
I think the most important one

347
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:36,190
is the business model.

348
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,789
And, you know, I think at that time,

349
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:40,690
wholesale in the apparel industry

350
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,190
was pretty much how you got distribution

351
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,990
aside from retail,

352
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,610
which requires an enormous outlay.

353
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,370
And if capital would get up

354
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,350
and running in retail.

355
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,090
So, the obvious sort of distribution model

356
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,950
is wholesale back then.

357
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,730
And since now we have e-commerce.

358
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,809
But that wholesale business model,

359
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,409
I, you know, as I went on

360
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:04,330
and started Triangle,

361
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:06,190
I found out that that was probably

362
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,029
a flawed model.

363
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,649
And maybe to say it's flawed

364
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:09,789
is probably not the right thing,

365
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:11,889
but I wasn't running it the right way.

366
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:13,909
And I took on, you know, production,

367
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,350
which I was running in Australia

368
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,190
and running comfortably.

369
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,909
I tried to move that to China.

370
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,990
And dealing with the Chinese

371
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,429
and manufacturing,

372
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:22,830
you're dealing with another language

373
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,929
in another country,

374
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:26,269
trying to get products shipped to Australia.

375
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:28,149
That was just a steep learning curve

376
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:31,350
that, you know, I guess combination of events

377
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,370
was the undoing of that business.

378
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,909
But a really important lesson

379
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:36,690
to understand that that model,

380
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,750
as I started the next business,

381
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,110
wasn't the right model

382
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,110
for that time period anymore.

383
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,149
For me, you're the person

384
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:45,929
that thinks that something is a good idea

385
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:47,509
and a minute later you do it.

386
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,169
And, you know,

387
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:49,549
and a lot of people procrastinate

388
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:51,590
and maybe never get to doing things

389
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,929
and find it really hard.

390
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,009
I'll probably in that latter bracket,

391
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,250
I think a long time before

392
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,049
you have a crack at doing something.

393
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:58,929
But, you know, to go one step back,

394
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,870
for example,

395
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,129
and I could give a hundred examples.

396
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,629
I remember sitting next to you one day at a cafe

397
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:04,509
and I always thought it'd be good to fly a plane.

398
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,850
Fast forward 24 hours,

399
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,470
you're flying over my head,

400
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,029
sending a message or close enough to it.

401
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,590
Then you go and do a commercial pilot's license

402
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,210
in the shortest possible time,

403
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:17,470
which I think exhausted all of your funds

404
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,149
that you had in life.

405
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:18,990
At that stage,

406
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,929
you get to the end of that six months and go,

407
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,029
geez, I don't think being a pilot's for me.

408
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,950
You like to learn from experience, don't you?

409
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,990
You like to actually go down the full path.

410
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,990
I actually really enjoyed the pilot scene

411
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,149
and it was a great,

412
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,529
and I think as when you're young in life,

413
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,649
you don't exactly know where you're going to end up.

414
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,889
And it's only, to me,

415
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,990
it was more of a process of elimination

416
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,970
to finally discover the things

417
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,350
that you're genuinely passionate and interested in.

418
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,350
And I think I'm sort of fortunate now

419
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,950
that what I do is everything I absolutely love.

420
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,330
There's no, you know,

421
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,730
I'm not waking up each day going,

422
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,090
God, this really sucks.

423
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,870
And, you know, how do I get out of this scenario?

424
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:57,870
So trying things, I think,

425
00:12:57,909 --> 00:12:59,769
is an important part of that process

426
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:01,870
of throwing yourself into it and giving it a go.

427
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,350
And it's either a yay or an ay

428
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,750
and pivot or persevere.

429
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:06,470
Yeah.

430
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:08,110
And I suppose then, as you said,

431
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:10,009
the end of Lenny, it's bankruptcy

432
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:11,529
and you go through that.

433
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,610
And I remember that time of living in Elwood,

434
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:15,070
living on your own,

435
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,470
Scooby the dog and you.

436
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,470
And, you know,

437
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,929
you had a pretty challenging couple of years there

438
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:21,809
and, you know, we're a bit concerned about you

439
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:23,610
as your mates and you're going to, you know,

440
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:25,190
you're capped at what you can earn

441
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,669
and you sort of had your push bike

442
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:27,809
and public transport.

443
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,029
I mean, you're in great form in that time as well.

444
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,570
It was always great fun to catch up with you.

445
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,149
But how challenging was that time

446
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:36,029
when you look back before you then launch into Triangle?

447
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,610
Yeah, like, you know,

448
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:40,389
I think you fight that stuff in your head a lot

449
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:41,409
when it first happens.

450
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,509
But then when you finally make peace with it,

451
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,149
to be honest, it wasn't that bad at all.

452
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:45,990
And in fact, you,

453
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:47,929
the great lessons of those experiences,

454
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,509
you know, when you think happiness is connected

455
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:54,450
to all these material things and this image and whatever,

456
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:57,289
it actually, the great learning of that was,

457
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,350
I was equally as happy, you know,

458
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:01,789
with no money as I have been with all the money in the world.

459
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,009
And so, you know, you get a great perspective

460
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,110
from those experiences.

461
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,529
And I think that, you know, again,

462
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,809
actually I wouldn't recommend it to anyone,

463
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:11,049
but it was probably one of the best experiences I've had

464
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:12,529
in terms of learning and growth.

465
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,250
Because you actually got to the point where you went,

466
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,129
even with the barest of minimum,

467
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:17,309
you know,

468
00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:17,350
you're not going to be able to do that.

469
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,409
You're not going to be able to do that.

470
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:17,490
You're not going to be able to do that.

471
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:17,929
You're not going to be able to do that.

472
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:19,870
And you still feel that now.

473
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,669
Your life's changed.

474
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:23,169
Well, I think it also prioritizes in your head what's,

475
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:25,570
you know, what are the things that are,

476
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:27,929
when it boils down to it and everything's taken away from you,

477
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,730
fundamentally how do you get through a day

478
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,909
and what are the things that are critical

479
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:32,789
to your happiness during that day?

480
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,649
And you realize that a lot of the economic

481
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:38,710
and financial things are actually far from the things

482
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,929
that are actually driving your happiness.

483
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,070
So for me, that was a brilliant experience to have

484
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:43,990
because I think, you know,

485
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,830
that was a great lesson to become aware of.

486
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,710
From that time,

487
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,429
your earnings are about $30,000 a year.

488
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:51,629
You're, you know,

489
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:53,529
having to find a way to get through.

490
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,009
And as you said,

491
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,830
you look back on that as a great experience.

492
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,789
And this is the phone call I'll never forget.

493
00:14:58,289 --> 00:14:59,129
Hey, man, I met a girl.

494
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,289
I'm moving to Hong Kong.

495
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,629
I've sold all my entire possessions.

496
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:04,169
And again, I'll add my 10%,

497
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,289
but I think that might've been less than $40,000,

498
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:07,350
everything you owned.

499
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,450
It was about 12, actually.

500
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,289
It was $12,000, everything you owned.

501
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,529
I'm moving to Hong Kong

502
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:13,690
and I'm starting a bikini business.

503
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,210
A few of your mates were even more concerned

504
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,169
about you at that stage.

505
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:17,690
I don't know.

506
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,210
I don't understand what part of that story

507
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:19,809
is not compelling.

508
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:23,250
I mean, I think it sounds pretty rock solid to me.

509
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:28,710
No, it doesn't pass the sniff test at all, that one.

510
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:31,850
But again, it was, there was no plan B.

511
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,490
It was that that was the clearest thing in my head

512
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,629
and just go for it.

513
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:37,490
And you and Aaron,

514
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,830
and you've got two beautiful kids,

515
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:39,289
Oscar and Ollie,

516
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:40,409
on the back of that relationship

517
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:42,230
and you moved to Hong Kong.

518
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,070
But I can remember, you know,

519
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,049
it was canned soup for the early days over there

520
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:47,470
and you might have a cocktail happy hour,

521
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,070
occasionally.

522
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:50,309
So what was your theory?

523
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:52,090
How were you planning to get through that one?

524
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:55,470
I can't, I think it started basically,

525
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,669
you know, just dialing into in your own head

526
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:00,509
of what interests you the most,

527
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:01,470
what are you passionate about?

528
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,649
And absolutely, I knew if I was to get out of bed every day

529
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:07,090
and put my heart and soul into something,

530
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:09,110
that was the number one thing I wanted to do.

531
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,529
And just went and tackled it

532
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:12,409
and approached it that way.

533
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,710
So every day was just, you know,

534
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:16,269
and I guess those little eating canned soup

535
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:17,049
is, you know,

536
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:18,029
it actually wasn't too bad.

537
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,309
And so you just get through those things

538
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:24,809
because it's not the big ticket items, you know.

539
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:28,230
I guess being passionate about something for me

540
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,909
was at the top of my list

541
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:32,110
far more than the bed I slept in

542
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,809
or under what roof it was

543
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:35,690
or what was being served up for dinner.

544
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,470
And so, yeah, there was definitely a lot of challenges

545
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,909
and a lot of growth and a lot of feedback loops.

546
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:47,029
But the whole experience was incredibly enjoyable.

547
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:50,230
You know, to move from Melbourne

548
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,409
where I was riding a fixie round for three years

549
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:53,590
through my bankruptcy,

550
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:54,769
scratching my head going,

551
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,289
what did I stuff up?

552
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,929
And good chance to reflect and think about it.

553
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,149
Then to moving across to Hong Kong

554
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:04,190
and, you know, there were so many experiences in Hong Kong

555
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,970
with, you know, I was traveling up to China every day

556
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,089
trying to get this business off the ground,

557
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,809
working with a factory, staying in a hotel,

558
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,230
15 bucks a night or some of the meals I ate in,

559
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,029
you know, just going and putting,

560
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:18,190
putting myself in a restaurant

561
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,450
that there's no people that spoke English

562
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,470
and pointing to a dish,

563
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,690
two tables across and saying, I'll have that.

564
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:27,589
And there was just lots of colorful experiences

565
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,650
that sort of made that journey enjoyable.

566
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:32,890
And particularly when the brand started to get traction

567
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,930
and you sort of reflect on what you had to do

568
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,109
to get to that point,

569
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,130
definitely wasn't a straight line.

570
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,930
I know you're humble and you're not,

571
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:43,029
you're giving me nothing on the pink polo shirt,

572
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:44,130
which is a hundred percent true.

573
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,109
And you're downplaying the success of Lenny

574
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:46,789
and your creativity.

575
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:48,049
So I know what you're like,

576
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:49,809
you're not going to take creative credit

577
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:51,789
for a lot of these things,

578
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:54,650
but how did you have in your mind

579
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,650
that a neoprene wetsuit material bikini

580
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,250
was a gap in the market?

581
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,289
Now explain that one for us, can you?

582
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:05,430
It's, well, I guess to rewind a little bit

583
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,009
before we left for Hong Kong,

584
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,710
it was actually our first day with Erin

585
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,309
and she went round that morning,

586
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,049
decided to choose the beach as a first date location.

587
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,569
That's right.

588
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:18,089
Good litmus test.

589
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,630
But when she finally arrived,

590
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,490
she said, you wouldn't believe how difficult it is.

591
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,289
She wanted to impress and buy a new bikini.

592
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:27,430
And she says, it's actually really difficult

593
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,349
to find a new bikini.

594
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,470
You have a couple of brands,

595
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:31,609
which are, you know, sort of more premium end.

596
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,730
And then it was the surf brands at the other end

597
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,049
and her interest was more in the fashion part in the middle.

598
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:39,690
And so, you know, a lot of the conversation on that day

599
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,670
was about why don't we give this a crack

600
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,329
and see if we can create a product

601
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:45,470
for potentially a gap in the market.

602
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,650
It was more looking at the Australian market.

603
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:53,230
And so, I guess once we had sort of set that as a goal

604
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,569
to start a brand was, you know, getting across to Hong Kong.

605
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,809
The reason, you know, Hong Kong was because

606
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:00,789
being close to the supply chain was really important,

607
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,269
being close to the factory, being able to ensure.

608
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,309
I'd had some experiences working with another company

609
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:07,069
where you're FedExing stuff back and forth.

610
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,569
And so, for me, it made sense to be in Hong Kong

611
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:11,789
so you could really control

612
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,630
that initial development of the product.

613
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,150
And then, you know,

614
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,769
the first bit of it was, you know,

615
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:17,549
the first bit is just a test.

616
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:20,130
At some point, you've got to take the step forward,

617
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,049
set up a website and find out if anyone actually can,

618
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,970
you can get a person to the website firstly.

619
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,730
And then secondly, if anyone will buy anything.

620
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,549
So, the neoprene thing was just, again,

621
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,630
we were experimenting with so many different materials

622
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,430
and fabrics and that was next on the list to try.

623
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,190
And it worked.

624
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,079
This is where the story is extraordinary.

625
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,000
I remember, you know, you saying, you know,

626
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:50,940
if I could sell one bikini a day,

627
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,180
I can live in Hong Kong and survive and get through

628
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,500
or whatever your numbers were.

629
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,400
And suddenly, you're selling two a day.

630
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,299
And I remember the phone call.

631
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,319
I remember you, I've just done my 15th trip down the stairs

632
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:02,640
carrying boxes to get to the post office.

633
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,339
And tell us the explosion moment

634
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:08,140
because there's a story around the Kardashians

635
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,440
and you strategically,

636
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:11,480
and Erin had some real sophistication

637
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,059
on the online e-commerce part of it too.

638
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,740
But when was the moment you went,

639
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,140
oh, this has gone out of control here?

640
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,339
Yeah, like you said, that was the number

641
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:22,539
was to try and get to selling one a day,

642
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,319
you know,

643
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:25,960
which was going to give us around 30,000 a year revenue

644
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,960
and replace my previous salary.

645
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,980
And I decided that for me, that was happiness.

646
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:32,859
And I'd be happy as a pig and shit

647
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:34,140
if I could get to that number.

648
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,039
And yeah, it was funny just by focusing on that.

649
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:38,799
And then Erin sort of brought to the table

650
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,559
the social media side

651
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,720
and she was heavily an Instagram user at the time

652
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,440
and really understood that platform.

653
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:47,759
So as we started to grow,

654
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,819
and again, this was just born out of

655
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:51,920
having no funds to do anything, basically.

656
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,279
You know, we've got to,

657
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:54,920
invent this stuff ourself

658
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,539
because there is no PR agency.

659
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,160
There is, you know,

660
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,920
we don't have the luxury of being able

661
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,440
to pay for those services.

662
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,319
And because Instagram in its infancy

663
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,940
and the gifting side of things,

664
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,539
and Erin had sort of explained that,

665
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,799
you know, some brands are doing this gifting.

666
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:12,299
And so we just started

667
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,299
in a like for like kind of fashion

668
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:15,960
where we didn't have a very big following.

669
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:19,059
So we'd target people on a similar level to us

670
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:20,359
rather than sort of approaching

671
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:23,259
the sort of more high profile people.

672
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,559
But then one day, you know,

673
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:26,619
Erin and I having conversation,

674
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:27,720
I said, who's, you know,

675
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:29,180
would represent our demographic?

676
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:30,940
You know, if we could pipe through

677
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,359
and pick the best girl in the world

678
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,160
that would represent the product and the brand.

679
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,980
And then at the time, Erin said, you know,

680
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,420
by far it's Kendall Jenner.

681
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:38,740
She's got the, you know,

682
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,980
she's similar demographic to our customer,

683
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,700
has incredible following.

684
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,680
And so we decided that Kendall

685
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,259
was far too big to go after personally.

686
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,740
So we started with a friendship network

687
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,160
and just started gifting to all her friends.

688
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,680
And then miraculously, a month later,

689
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,240
we got an email from Kendall saying, you know,

690
00:21:58,299 --> 00:21:59,579
all my friends are wearing your product.

691
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,819
Can I get some basically?

692
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,039
And so we sent, you know,

693
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:06,079
all six products that we had online out to her.

694
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,619
She tweeted to 5 million people.

695
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,380
And that sort of for us was a pivotal moment

696
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,700
in, I guess, engaging the US audience

697
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,519
and things just went sort of parabolic after that.

698
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,440
Yeah, it was great.

699
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:17,920
Fantastic.

700
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:20,559
Your life changes is fair to say,

701
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,819
you know, from canned soup to this,

702
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:24,000
this incredible model,

703
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,539
this incredible e-commerce model

704
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:28,299
and your circumstances change.

705
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:30,519
And as your mate watching that close hand,

706
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,619
it was just an extraordinary thing to happen.

707
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:34,660
You know, you've been through that cycle now.

708
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,259
That's, you know, several years ago.

709
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,940
I remember speaking at one stage and you, you know,

710
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:41,119
you're going, there is no growth in my life at the moment

711
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:43,140
because I've got all these things

712
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,579
I can experience now freely.

713
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,799
But is that joyful or did you look back and think,

714
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,059
God, there's a few landmines coming my way

715
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:50,680
that I didn't see?

716
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,759
Like, I think there's always,

717
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:53,700
there's room for growth

718
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,500
and I probably was referring probably on the business side

719
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,980
then with sort of where everything seemed to be working

720
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,079
for a period of time.

721
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,980
But those moments are always short-lived

722
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,799
and if you're talking about regrets,

723
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:08,079
I do have one regret and that was, you know,

724
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:11,279
we went to a company in Atlanta for some marketing advice.

725
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,920
We felt like the brand had grown so much

726
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,740
and reached a level that way beyond our expectations

727
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,619
that we felt perhaps some outside consulting

728
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:21,799
would be appropriate just from people

729
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:22,680
who perhaps experienced,

730
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:23,799
growth in those areas.

731
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,279
And they recommended from a marketing perspective

732
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:28,940
that we tell the brand story,

733
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:30,759
that we tell financially, you know,

734
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,980
sort of it's hard for people to understand growth

735
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,200
if you don't put numbers and figures to that growth.

736
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,579
But I felt, you know, it wasn't really us

737
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:43,200
in terms of going out and being quite public about that.

738
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,200
But we did it based on their advice

739
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,380
and trusting their advice.

740
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,920
But I think at the time,

741
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,380
it probably put a target on our back

742
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,680
in a number of different areas.

743
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,680
And we got copped.

744
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:55,019
After that, you know, we got quite a bit of publicity.

745
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,160
We were in, you know, all the Australian newspapers,

746
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,740
we were on Bloomberg TV and bits and pieces like that,

747
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:01,799
which was a great experience.

748
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,460
But then, you know, we had everyone from Walmart

749
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,579
to Kmart, Target, bras and things,

750
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,480
Victoria's Secret with their 1500 stores

751
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,579
just blatantly copying all our products.

752
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,960
So in terms of growth, that was another growth chapter

753
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,240
when it didn't feel,

754
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:18,779
it felt like everything was going backwards

755
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:20,619
and you've just been copied everywhere

756
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:22,759
and you had this, I guess,

757
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:24,819
intellectual property lesson

758
00:24:24,819 --> 00:24:27,039
that I didn't necessarily choose,

759
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:28,160
but was forced upon us.

760
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,099
And, but again, I think the outcome of that

761
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:33,299
was a really good business lesson

762
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:36,460
about growing a brand, building a brand,

763
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,559
intellectual property.

764
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,039
And I guess the long and the short of it,

765
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:42,180
where I've sort of concluded, you know,

766
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,000
that that sits today is that, you know,

767
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,420
the best form of intellectual property protection

768
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,700
is innovation.

769
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:51,279
And, you know, so that tipped us into another,

770
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:52,799
you know, I think in our brand,

771
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:55,299
now the innovation cycle

772
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:56,839
and that we've ramped up greatly.

773
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,180
And, you know, I think it's very difficult now

774
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,559
for a brand to copy us because of that experience.

775
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,799
So, yeah, it's incredible, isn't it?

776
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:05,859
I mean, even firsthand as your mate,

777
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,140
I could just see,

778
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,920
there was a point in time where two people a week

779
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,640
are ringing me to try and get your number

780
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,880
because that article and the wealth

781
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,960
and you're, you know, appearing in BRW Rich List

782
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,400
and it just, and, you know,

783
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,599
you can hear talking to you now,

784
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,799
it's very hard to get you to take credit for anything, mate.

785
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:22,799
But, yeah.

786
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:24,539
That put you out there in a way,

787
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,059
you know, I could tell you're uncomfortable with

788
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:30,000
and I can tell you the reasons why you were doing it

789
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,920
were pretty clear because it was, you know,

790
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,980
the growth strategy.

791
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,960
But, yeah, again, for you to be able to find a solution to that,

792
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,700
that seems to me sums you up.

793
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,019
Here's a challenge.

794
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,460
I've got two ways to front.

795
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,279
I can either get really upset about it

796
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,180
or I'll just find a solution.

797
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:45,680
Is that how your mind works when these things come up?

798
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,819
Yeah, I think the more times you get kicked in the balls,

799
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,240
you end up with a big set of rubber balls

800
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,319
at some point.

801
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,359
But pretty much, you know,

802
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,059
I think you either drop the bottom lip

803
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:57,359
and it consumes you for a long period

804
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,519
or you just get into solution mode.

805
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:02,880
I think, you know, you and I share a story of a guy

806
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,539
that we used to, you know, a life coach

807
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:06,619
that we used to speak to a little bit

808
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:08,700
and I loved his phrase about talking about people

809
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,619
being in the growers club

810
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:10,480
and I think the quickie,

811
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,799
you can flick your brain into that mode

812
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,539
in those moments of being in the growers club

813
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:16,480
and look for the lesson,

814
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,420
look for the, what's the,

815
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:20,640
how can I personally grow out of this

816
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,039
and what's the lesson I can learn?

817
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:22,140
Yeah.

818
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,180
Yeah.

819
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:22,240
Yeah.

820
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:22,259
Yeah.

821
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:22,279
Yeah.

822
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:22,299
Yeah.

823
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,019
And as you move into that mode quickly,

824
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,059
I think it just helps moving on.

825
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,539
Growers club is a term you and I speak about a lot,

826
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:30,839
mate,

827
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:32,720
and it's part of what we're trying to talk about

828
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,019
in this podcast as well,

829
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:36,039
is sort of leadership and lifelong learning.

830
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,279
And my great old friend, Matt Waterwitz,

831
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,619
and I have this passion for Alita,

832
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,940
this business we've started and created

833
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,599
and identifying that we think there's a big shift

834
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:49,299
going on in leadership now from the old hierarchy,

835
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,039
which we experienced in footy.

836
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:51,900
The coach was the coach.

837
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,259
He had no sense of leadership.

838
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:53,400
He had no say or no feedback,

839
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,339
no involvement at all in that environment at all

840
00:26:57,339 --> 00:26:59,200
and working in corporate environments

841
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,799
where the boss has got the corner office,

842
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,400
you take your instructions,

843
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,420
here's your to-do list and you have no voice.

844
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,940
And so now this sort of empowered model

845
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,900
where really leaders are wanting to sort of connect

846
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,019
with their staff and hear from them

847
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:15,380
and see their staff as assets and collaborative

848
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,900
and the new sporting coaches we've dealt with

849
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,920
are very much in this space.

850
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:20,980
But by having spent a bit of time with you

851
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,200
and got to know your team at Triforce,

852
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,440
you are at the absolute upper echelon

853
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,640
of empowering your staff.

854
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,799
Tell us how that works for you

855
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,759
because it's quite remarkable to see

856
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:32,940
how much autonomy you give to people that work for you.

857
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,059
I think it's just born out of laziness,

858
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,539
to be honest.

859
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:38,940
No, look, to be honest,

860
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,200
I think early days, you know,

861
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:42,160
and trying to get a business model right,

862
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,680
there was a book I read called Maverick.

863
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,579
Ricardo Semler.

864
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,720
Ricardo Semler's book.

865
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,539
And I found that a very interesting,

866
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,240
I guess, approach

867
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,740
to me.

868
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,900
Managing a business,

869
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:55,859
he was given his father's business at a young age

870
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:58,059
and there was a lot of hierarchy in that business

871
00:27:58,059 --> 00:27:59,079
and, you know,

872
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,160
it became his responsibility to look after it

873
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,480
and sort of split the business

874
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,839
into small democratic groups

875
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:09,359
and really empowered people within those groups.

876
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:11,500
And I tried some iterations of that

877
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,599
unsuccessfully early days at Triangle.

878
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,240
And, you know, just through, I guess,

879
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:20,259
trying to curate and learn from those experiences,

880
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:21,779
we've probably ended up now

881
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:22,180
where there is,

882
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,759
there's a fair bit of autonomy within the group.

883
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,400
We're in a unique situation with geographically

884
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,079
where we're in all corners of the world.

885
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:32,119
And I think this COVID environment's made it

886
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,720
a little bit where we would see each other more frequently.

887
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,019
We see each other far less frequently now.

888
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,319
So you've got people in Monaco,

889
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,599
in Philippines,

890
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:41,460
in Hong Kong,

891
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:42,039
in Jersey,

892
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:42,779
in WA,

893
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:43,640
in Sydney.

894
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:44,660
It's unique.

895
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,920
And you're all over the place.

896
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,759
Yeah, that's interesting, you know,

897
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:50,279
to have that.

898
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,160
But how does it work for you?

899
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,920
You know, how do you allow that sort of autonomy

900
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,380
in a business that's at the level you've created?

901
00:28:58,099 --> 00:29:00,539
Yeah, it was like, I mean, when you look at it now,

902
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:03,579
there's definitely, you know, a lot of, you know,

903
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,200
geographically we're quite diverse.

904
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,339
But most of those places were set up sort of step by,

905
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,920
like Hong Kong was where we first lived.

906
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:13,660
So an office was set up there for the supply chain.

907
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,779
Then as the company grew and economically things

908
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:19,339
shifted a little bit, we were looking for tax efficiencies.

909
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:21,339
And that's where I guess Jersey

910
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:23,660
and Monaco came into it.

911
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,640
And then later on looking to our first step into retail.

912
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,200
And so Australia and our store in Bondi sort of evolved a bit.

913
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,559
And then I guess just as we looked and added personnel along the way,

914
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,019
because we're e-commerce,

915
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:42,759
it became far less important to have everyone turning up to an office every day.

916
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:45,759
You know, we also travel a lot for our photo shoots.

917
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:50,440
And I guess also a lot of reading early on that as I was setting up the business,

918
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:51,319
it just made sense.

919
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:52,299
It made sense to have,

920
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,759
there's some countries around the world where it makes sense to have,

921
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,220
there's a certain skill set,

922
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:58,339
like the Philippines are incredibly,

923
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,059
is an incredibly good place to,

924
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:04,079
from a customer service perspective,

925
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,339
Hong Kong for supply chain,

926
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:09,539
Jersey for finances.

927
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,460
And so that was sort of more going,

928
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,559
well, we're e-commerce.

929
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,099
We don't need to all assemble in an office every day.

930
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,779
And so why not make it as lean and as efficient as we can

931
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:24,500
with the best people in the best countries appropriate to that skill set?

932
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:26,880
And I think one of the saddest things,

933
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,700
and I know this is the antithesis of what you stand for,

934
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,640
is people end up in a job or environment,

935
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,359
they're too scared to change because the wage, you know,

936
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,940
supports them personally or their family,

937
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,539
but you don't have a voice.

938
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,940
And, you know, we spend, you know,

939
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,180
I think it's a third of our life in our working environments.

940
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,720
And if they're not, you know,

941
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:47,079
fulfilled or you're not in an environment that's positive for you,

942
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:50,019
that's a lot of pain that's caused maybe by,

943
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:54,440
by leaders who just don't really understand their impact on those underneath.

944
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,039
So my huge passion for, for, for trying to,

945
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:00,680
but what you're saying, once you get to that level,

946
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,700
having met your staff, they're incredibly, you know,

947
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,460
the young, smart, they love their environment.

948
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:07,440
They're so passionate about your product, what they do.

949
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,900
They love the people they work with.

950
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,500
They're incredible people.

951
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,220
And you're saying it just creates balance in your life as well.

952
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,400
So you get the efficiencies and the life balance yourself.

953
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,900
Is that the end result?

954
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,440
Yeah, absolutely.

955
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,000
And, you know,

956
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:23,740
I guess we're fortunate in the company now that, you know,

957
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:27,799
we've been through a few cycles of growth and then, you know,

958
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:32,259
things came back a little bit when we got copied and we've had a small bit of

959
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:35,980
personnel change along the way, but because we're pretty lean,

960
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:38,119
I think that the group that's there now,

961
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,039
they are quite a harmonious group because I think, you know,

962
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,779
just over the years we've kept persisting and seeing how that we can evolve it

963
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:46,579
and change it so that, you know,

964
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:49,759
people are satisfied within their job and enjoying what they do.

965
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:50,299
And, you know,

966
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:53,079
in some cases that didn't work out with some of the staff that came through,

967
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,099
but, and perhaps, you know,

968
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,319
from a management perspective we've shifted how we treat each staff member a

969
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,059
little bit, which I think has been, it's been really good as well.

970
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:07,200
And, and so now, you know, performance wise, things are going really well.

971
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,140
What would you say to someone who's sitting in a work environment that

972
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,539
they're not satisfied with and they're frustrated with,

973
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,599
or to someone who's a leader in an environment that maybe hasn't got the

974
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:18,119
self-reflection that you have, which is,

975
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,740
which is take total responsibility,

976
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:22,940
and continue to improve what, what, what's the, what's the message?

977
00:32:23,019 --> 00:32:23,720
How do you change it?

978
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,099
Well,

979
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:26,839
it definitely wouldn't be sell everything that you've got and buy a one-way

980
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:27,819
ticket to Hong Kong.

981
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,539
That's, but no,

982
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:36,059
I think it's important just to dial into what's driving you and,

983
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:39,339
and understand, you know, what, what, what puts fire in your belly.

984
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,539
Cause, cause if you're just waking up and, and, you know,

985
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,799
sort of walking out the door as a zombie and just clocking in and following a

986
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,740
checklist and then going home and then numbing yourself with,

987
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,319
with the TV and a few beers on the weekend, it's,

988
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:56,279
I think connecting to your passion is, is probably the most critical bit.

989
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,940
Now, before I mentioned, you know,

990
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:01,759
pick up the phone and ringing you and you could be in the Alps with Wim Hof.

991
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,599
What are you talking about, mate? You're in your board shorts,

992
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,920
you're walking through the Alps and you're with some crazy Dutch extreme

993
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,859
Iceman. How did that come about?

994
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:12,819
I hated the cold and, and, you know,

995
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:15,420
throughout 40 days never carry much body fat.

996
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,799
And so when we used to do the sessions down the ocean, I just,

997
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,900
it was just the absolute worst thing I felt like doing at the time and

998
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:27,299
stumbled across him on a YouTube ad one day and thought, how does it,

999
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:30,819
this guy was swimming in Antarctica in a pair of shorts and I'm talking about

1000
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:33,200
how most people would go into the water and have cardiac arrest.

1001
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,920
And Wim was just in there like he's on a tropical Island.

1002
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:40,819
And I was going, you must have some secret sauce about what he's doing.

1003
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,240
And so again,

1004
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,559
this is the curiosity kicked in and went on a journey to find out what his

1005
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,359
secret sauce was, but which,

1006
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:48,500
which ended up, you know,

1007
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,039
which ended up on a four day retreat in Poland,

1008
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:57,359
walking up Mount Schnezka in a pair of board shorts in minus 15 degrees and a

1009
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:59,160
blizzard for, for six hours.

1010
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:02,160
So that definitely throwing yourself in the deep end,

1011
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:05,940
you find out what, what makes you tick in those moments.

1012
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,679
But that was a bucket list thing for me is how to solve this fear of the cold.

1013
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,960
And I got the great privilege only a couple of years later to spend about

1014
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,820
three hours with him and interviewing one day.

1015
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,280
And he was saying to me that day, it's like the cold's there,

1016
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,480
just to be able to, you know,

1017
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,500
just to remind you, if you're not present, you're going to feel the pain.

1018
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:21,860
Yeah.

1019
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,840
If you're present and you, and you breathe properly, you don't,

1020
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,860
you don't feel the cold.

1021
00:34:26,019 --> 00:34:26,380
It's a.

1022
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,920
Can definitely vouch for that after six hours on Mount Schnezka at minus 15,

1023
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:33,719
that presence is a big part of it.

1024
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,099
Now, as I said,

1025
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:38,179
this conversation is sort of born out of this passion for,

1026
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,559
for a change in leadership that we're working through with our business

1027
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:42,099
called a leader.

1028
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,579
And you've got to know Matt over the time and we're sort of trying to get

1029
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:48,320
some, some consistent questions to all the people.

1030
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,920
We speak to them and early days to see your empowering leadership model

1031
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,800
mate is, is inspiring to us trying to share that with other people as well.

1032
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,840
But there's a handful of dimensions of learning and leadership that we're

1033
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,820
keen to ask you some standard questions of all our leaders.

1034
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,900
So I'm going to run these by you.

1035
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,420
They might seem a bit dry for you, mate,

1036
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,880
but see what you can come up with the first one.

1037
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,780
What does self-leadership mean to you?

1038
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:13,579
Self-leadership would be setting an example, you know,

1039
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:15,940
just trying to extract the best out of yourself and,

1040
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,699
and being an example for other people.

1041
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,260
How do you go about positively impacting others in your environment?

1042
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,840
I think it's just getting to know them on a,

1043
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,659
on a personal level and genuinely being interested in them and caring about

1044
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:29,800
them and caring about, you know,

1045
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,840
I guess I don't ever look at triangle as being the final destination for them

1046
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,800
that it's understand that we're a stepping stone in their career and,

1047
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,400
you know, you want to develop them as people.

1048
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:43,940
That is a fascinating line that you've just got there is that you've never

1049
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,500
really wanted to put people and see if I can keep them for 10 or 15 years.

1050
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:51,360
You're really comfortable in how do I make you as happy in that environment as

1051
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:51,900
I can.

1052
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:52,599
And yeah,

1053
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:54,880
I understand that that may be a stepping stone to somewhere else.

1054
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,260
That's,

1055
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,300
that's truly what you,

1056
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,340
you are all about,

1057
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:58,679
isn't it?

1058
00:35:59,199 --> 00:35:59,380
Yeah.

1059
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,179
And that's just based on personal experience too,

1060
00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:01,500
because,

1061
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:01,699
you know,

1062
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:03,199
as you go through your career and,

1063
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,619
you know,

1064
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:04,480
I mean,

1065
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:09,320
we have different generations from young and our brands predominantly focused

1066
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,980
on younger people,

1067
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,659
but it shouldn't be the final destination.

1068
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:15,900
You want those people to go on to bigger and better things.

1069
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,619
And if we can sort of,

1070
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:17,679
you know,

1071
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:22,820
mutually work together and they can grow and learn from working with us and

1072
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,860
they can add some value.

1073
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,400
Yeah.

1074
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,280
I think that's the,

1075
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,039
you know,

1076
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:29,679
you want to sort of encourage them to move on to bigger and better things is

1077
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,639
been my approach.

1078
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,059
Yeah.

1079
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:31,940
And meeting those people,

1080
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,239
they're extraordinary people because of the way that you collaborate with

1081
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:35,360
them.

1082
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,980
How do you go about creating and sharing your vision?

1083
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:38,699
Yeah.

1084
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:39,280
I think it's,

1085
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,219
it's over the journey that that's shifted,

1086
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:42,780
you know,

1087
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,599
and the models change,

1088
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,340
but as I think it's just remaining flexible as well because,

1089
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:46,800
you know,

1090
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,380
life throws,

1091
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,380
curve balls sometimes frequently,

1092
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:51,119
sometimes less frequently.

1093
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,840
And so the business has had to adapt many times,

1094
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:55,639
you know,

1095
00:36:55,659 --> 00:36:56,300
even over,

1096
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:56,880
you know,

1097
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,599
we've sort of been going since 2012.

1098
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,340
So it's not,

1099
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,440
hasn't been around that long,

1100
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:01,519
but there's,

1101
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:06,300
there's been many times that we've need to pivot and change direction on,

1102
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,679
on a number of things.

1103
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:14,699
And just having a culture that I guess shares that mindset is enabled us to,

1104
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:15,420
you know,

1105
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,300
continue to grow and thrive in,

1106
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,099
in a lot of environments.

1107
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:21,559
And what's your approach to learning and improvement?

1108
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:26,300
I think just asking a lot of questions and being open-minded and,

1109
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,699
and curious and,

1110
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:29,000
and generally interested.

1111
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,940
How do you communicate with clarity?

1112
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:33,739
Communicate with clarity.

1113
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:39,400
Probably I find my best way of communicating is typically by phone or Zoom or

1114
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,719
face-to-face would be number one preferred way.

1115
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:41,980
I'm,

1116
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,739
I'm absolutely terrible on email.

1117
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,420
So,

1118
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:47,280
and my staff,

1119
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,219
my staff could verify that,

1120
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:49,400
that yeah,

1121
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,559
face-to-face is always.

1122
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:51,980
And final one,

1123
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,519
how important is collaboration to you and how do you go about doing it?

1124
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:57,320
Collaboration's super important.

1125
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,260
I think it's difficult to go through this world doing it all on your own.

1126
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,219
And it's important to find like-minded people.

1127
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:03,860
And,

1128
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,059
you know,

1129
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,739
I think passion is probably,

1130
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,199
you know,

1131
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:08,639
fairly high on the list there,

1132
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,059
you know,

1133
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,840
finding people who are passionate about what they do.

1134
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,579
And if you can collaborate around a passion and a purpose,

1135
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,579
that that's probably where I'd start.

1136
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:16,440
Well,

1137
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:16,619
mate,

1138
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:17,199
I've,

1139
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,679
I've got another couple of hours in me,

1140
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,780
but in the interest of,

1141
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,739
of time and we might have to do it again some stage,

1142
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,820
but it is always a learning experience being around you.

1143
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,079
But I have to go back the first time,

1144
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,539
and I don't know what your experience is,

1145
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:29,440
but the first time I,

1146
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,039
we met,

1147
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:30,820
you'd been at the club,

1148
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:31,420
you know,

1149
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,719
at least a year before me or six months before me.

1150
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,840
And I remember looking around and going,

1151
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:39,500
that bloke is the one guy I don't want to have anything to do with.

1152
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,440
And about two weeks later,

1153
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:41,639
I think.

1154
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,460
It's a little judgmental.

1155
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:43,260
It was a little bit.

1156
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,039
You were,

1157
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:45,800
you were bouncing off the walls and,

1158
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,719
and maybe not.

1159
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:47,840
That was probably a bit extreme,

1160
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,300
but we didn't get on those first two weeks.

1161
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,420
Do you remember that?

1162
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:51,340
Mate,

1163
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,420
I don't have the same grudge that you obviously had from back then.

1164
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,280
It's turned on into one of life's great friendships,

1165
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:57,559
mate.

1166
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:58,139
It has,

1167
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:58,619
absolutely.

1168
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,119
Forever appreciative of it.

1169
00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:02,679
And I love chatting to you because I learn something every day.

1170
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:04,340
Thanks for sharing some of it today,

1171
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:04,539
mate.

1172
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:05,619
It's inspirational,

1173
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:05,960
always.

1174
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:06,440
Mate,

1175
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,639

1176
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,500
and great to have worked with you guys as well.
