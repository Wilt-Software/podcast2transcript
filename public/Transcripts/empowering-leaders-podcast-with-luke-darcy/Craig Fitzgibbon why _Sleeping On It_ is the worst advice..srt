1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
it's such an enjoyable role so many uplifting moments can come out through a day through a week

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,800
and all the while when the pressure hits and it does hit it's generally external it's that whole

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,820
debate on reputation versus character right like if you're going to be a head coach you need to

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,660
understand your reputation is going to get a hiding at some point your reputation is what

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,899
other people think of you but your character and what you're doing the people know you at some

6
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:28,500
point in time you have to be able to front absorb pressure on behalf of your organization your

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,520
players and as uncomfortable as that may be you still have to sit in that space for sometimes

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,700
extended periods and and stay the course represent your club understand the direction you're heading

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,179
don't flinch and sit in that space now is it uncomfortable yeah sure it is but it's also

10
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:49,679
possible when you think about how how much you do have going in your favor craig fitzgibbon is the

11
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:55,320
current coach of the canala sharks he's humble he's self-aware and constantly acquiring knowledge

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,600
to continue mastering the art of coaching

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,479
what i

14
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,780
really enjoyed this conversation as i'm sure you're going to as well

15
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,859
he talks a lot about his philosophy of staying the course and having discipline when you've got a

16
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:13,099
vision you might alter it slightly but really the success in life comes down to being able to have

17
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:17,819
discipline and stay the course he explains why he's never followed the advice to sleep on it

18
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:22,420
when trying to solve a problem you want to listen in and hear exactly why that's important to him

19
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:28,459
he's also acutely aware of the power of slowing down reflecting on what he's grateful for and

20
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,480
the excellent relationships that he's part of

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,739
when life gets stressful that's his go-to to make sure he keeps himself on track you also hear craig

22
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:41,019
fitzgibbon talk about the creative activities that he surprises his players with as he strives to find

23
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:46,299
that balance of keeping hard happy and that you need to have a fun environment if you want people

24
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:51,159
to be successful he also breaks down the three really basic principles of how he wants his

25
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,019
players to act how they prepare each week and then ultimately the style in which they play it's

26
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:57,579
really clear and you can understand

27
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:00,079
why Craig Fitzgibbon has been so successful

28
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,099
in everything that he set his mind to.

29
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:04,260
We are really grateful and privileged

30
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,060
to have Craig Fitzgibbon

31
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,560
as part of our Elita Connect program.

32
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,180
Love you to check it out as well.

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,300
Head to elitacollective.com.

34
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,740
We collaborate with groups of five or six people

35
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,360
to come together from different backgrounds

36
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,560
to learn, to share, and to connect.

37
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,419
You don't have to be an NRL legend

38
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:20,639
or a sporting coach to be part of this program.

39
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,819
We love the diversity,

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,740
people from the arts or from industry

41
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,020
or social venture coming together

42
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,539
to collaborate and connect in a unique way.

43
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,699
Huge thanks as always to Jason Nicholas

44
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:31,879
and his team from Temper.

45
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:34,659
We know that great athletes like Craig Fitzgibbon

46
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:37,280
understand that sleep is such an important part

47
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,879
of having a successful and healthy life.

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,319
So having a look at a mattress like Temper,

49
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:42,560
it's a mattress like no other.

50
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,759
A third of your life is spent in bed.

51
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,580
So getting a good night's sleep

52
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,740
is really fundamental to a great life.

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,639
Check out Temper.

54
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,539
It'll be a decision that will change your life.

55
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,780
Craig Fitzgibbon is an Australian rugby league legend.

56
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,259
His decorated playing career

57
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:59,460
spanned more than 300 first grade games.

58
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,860
A Clive Churchill medalist for best on ground

59
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,159
in the Sydney Roosters Premiership in 2002.

60
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,699
Represented New South Wales in state of origin

61
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:07,599
on 11 occasions

62
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,860
and played 19 tests for Australia.

63
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,699
He holds the record as the highest point scoring forward

64
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:13,740
in NRL history.

65
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,259
His coaching record is equally brilliant

66
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:17,879
and integral part of the Sydney Roosters

67
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,919
three premierships in 2013, 18 and 19

68
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,520
as assistant to Trent Robinson

69
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,900
before in April 2021 being announced

70
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,680
as the head coach

71
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,780
of the Cronulla Sharks.

72
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:28,939
In his first full year as head coach,

73
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,879
he guided the Sharks to a second place finish

74
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,439
on the ladder

75
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,000
with the Sharks quickly extending his contract

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,939
by five years.

77
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,960
Fitz, it's great to see you've had

78
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,300
a remarkable history of success

79
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,340
in one of the most competitive sports in the world.

80
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,900
Can I start with asking you,

81
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,219
what are the traits that you've found within yourself

82
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:45,599
to achieve that success?

83
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,280
Thanks for the intro too.

84
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:48,639
It's uncomfortable to listen to,

85
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,360
but always nice to hear it again.

86
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,180
But I think really simple values of hard work

87
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:55,659
and, you know,

88
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,840
and being fortunate I've been in the game

89
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,060
most of my life.

90
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,340
My father was a coach as well.

91
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,280
So love the game,

92
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,319
understanding and being part of rugby league cultures

93
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:08,379
and clubs for, again, most of my life.

94
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,800
I think it's, you know,

95
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:11,560
it's not a really complicated formula.

96
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:12,639
All the while, as you know,

97
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,639
coaching can get extremely complicated,

98
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,980
but keeping it really simple with hard work values

99
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,240
and I think translating, you know,

100
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,000
the heart of your work in our sport

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,379
and the heart of your work as a player,

102
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:25,279
it's sort of the value shift into coaching as well.

103
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,459
All the while working hard in different ways

104
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:30,180
and trying to use similar values and lessons

105
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,279
you pick up as a player

106
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,519
and apply them to your coaching.

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,660
Fitz, you mentioned your dad, Alan,

108
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,680
who coached the Cronulla Sharks as well.

109
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,699
I understand you were a ball boy as a kid

110
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:42,379
running around in the Sharks' change rooms.

111
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,800
Is it surreal to you that you're now

112
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,360
the head coach of that organisation?

113
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,759
And do you think you absorbed a little bit

114
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,379
even as a kid about how your dad coached

115
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:53,120
and do you see some of those traits in you?

116
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,279
Obviously with...

117
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,240
Yeah, I've been an assistant...

118
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,519
I had 20 years at the Roosters,

119
00:04:58,699 --> 00:04:59,879
so I was a long-term assistant,

120
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,300
10 years as an assistant coach

121
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,779
and I was figuring if I was going to head coach

122
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,779
that club or an organisation,

123
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,399
you kind of have to fit and spending...

124
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,519
I sort of had seven years there as a child

125
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,399
and I'd lived in the area for 10 years

126
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,500
while I was playing with the Roosters,

127
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,899
so I was familiar with the demographics,

128
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,879
the area, what the club was about, etc.

129
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,360
But as a young fella,

130
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:21,720
growing up in and around rugby league,

131
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,660
all my heroes were Sharks players,

132
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,720
so, you know, all those...

133
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,939
you know, stories of their greatness.

134
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,500
They had a successful period for a run there,

135
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,540
all the while falling short of a premiership.

136
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:34,439
But it wasn't overly nostalgic, the decision,

137
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,740
but it definitely played a part

138
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,620
in the familiarity of the club,

139
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,040
the area and its history more so.

140
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:42,500
So I think...

141
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,839
And as for my father's traits,

142
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,000
yeah, I think that he's...

143
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,899
Yeah, so many lessons as leaders now

144
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,579
that you look back on how you were brought up.

145
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:53,680
Super quiet, very humble.

146
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,079
He's the ultimate observer.

147
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,000
My father, he's frustrating to a point

148
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,319
where so standoffish

149
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,980
and one of the biggest decisions in my life

150
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,920
where I'd seek sort of any kind of advice

151
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,180
or recommendations

152
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,180
and he'd just be observing

153
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,019
and just watching

154
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:10,839
and making you make your own decisions.

155
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,720
And I can only speak from the players that he did coach

156
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,259
that they hold him in high regard.

157
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,600
So you'd like to think that

158
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,259
some of those attributes have rubbed off,

159
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,100
but all the while,

160
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,980
I've got to keep earning that as well.

161
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,879
Yeah, I'm fascinated by that, Fitzy.

162
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:25,240
I had a dad that played for the same club,

163
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,079
that I ended up playing for in the AFL

164
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,399
and he sounds eerily similar to your dad

165
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,920
where he was there,

166
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,279
he observed everything,

167
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,079
but he never ever once,

168
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:37,899
not even once offered an opinion

169
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,660
or got into my space.

170
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,540
And I would ring him,

171
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
but it would only be a sounding board.

172
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,180
He would never say,

173
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,199
hey, you should do this.

174
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,920
And I look back and I'm with you,

175
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,540
I thought there's a missed opportunity there.

176
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:49,939
And I think he had lots of things

177
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:50,740
he could have passed on,

178
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:51,720
but I now look at it and I think,

179
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:52,279
what a gift.

180
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,259
He just allowed me to tread my own path.

181
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,500
Do you see it the same way?

182
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:57,639
Do you see that's a bit of a gift?

183
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,040
Your dad's just giving you the space

184
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,439
to be what you are?

185
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:01,379
Yeah, I think so.

186
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,399
I think it was a conscious decision on his part.

187
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:04,920
And ultimately,

188
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,819
at the time,

189
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:08,420
you would know this,

190
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:09,500
obviously you're understanding,

191
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,439
you want that feedback,

192
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,620
you want to make sure

193
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,060
that you're heading in the right direction.

194
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,300
And all it offers was,

195
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,839
am I observing it like he is?

196
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,100
Like, are you looking at this as,

197
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:18,500
you know,

198
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,620
a bit more observant recommendations

199
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,439
rather than push you in a direction.

200
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,699
But I think,

201
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,839
you're very conscious on his part

202
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,740
for me to grow up

203
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,279
and make decisions for myself

204
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,879
and live and die by those decisions

205
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,779
and also ultimately take responsibility

206
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:34,560
for whatever decision you make as well.

207
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:35,500
So, you know,

208
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:37,399
and super quiet, super humble.

209
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,500
So when I'd see him

210
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,000
and we'd have might have a social gathering

211
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,139
where someone else would be there

212
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:42,519
and I'd walk up to them and say,

213
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:44,600
mate, you've just spoken more to my father

214
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,680
in five minutes

215
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,819
than I've managed to get out of him

216
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:47,519
my whole life.

217
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:50,279
So I love spending time with him now.

218
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:52,680
And again, just sitting back,

219
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:53,740
big picture approach.

220
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,079
It's,

221
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:55,240
yeah, I think,

222
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,339
I think it was very conscious on his part

223
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:58,800
and he sort of knew what he was doing there.

224
00:07:59,220 --> 00:07:59,660
And Fitz,

225
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,540
it leads to me into the parenting discussion

226
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,180
a little bit.

227
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:05,360
I spend a lot of time at junior sport

228
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,259
watching my kids

229
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,540
and I see a complete opposite parent

230
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,439
to the one that I had

231
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,920
where they are sitting on the sidelines

232
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,379
screaming at their kids,

233
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,680
desperate for them to succeed.

234
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,439
It feels like it's probably coming from a good place,

235
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,699
but it creates this intensity and this chaos

236
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,600
that just over the top,

237
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,740
you know, in junior sport.

238
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:24,180
I mean,

239
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:24,680
do you see,

240
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:26,699
do you see that yourself now in this era

241
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,180
that perhaps we've got a generation of parents

242
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,259
that go too hard

243
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:30,920
when you've had a dad

244
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,960
that's really just been at the other end of the scale?

245
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,360
Yeah, it's an interesting debate,

246
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,059
that one, right?

247
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,080
Like there's probably many successful athletes

248
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,080
or players in multiple sports

249
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,779
that have had overbearing parents

250
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:46,759
and still been managing to succeed

251
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,059
or have high level careers.

252
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,519
And then there's the other end of the spectrum

253
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,860
where maybe the standoffish parents

254
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,519
where they've allowed

255
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,740
their kids to grow

256
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,200
their own decision-making processes

257
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,299
and flourish in that sort of environment as well.

258
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,919
But yeah, you're kind of,

259
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,779
the generational swing too, right?

260
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,399
Like the way our parents probably raised us

261
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,460
and the way parents are raising

262
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,740
and we're raising our kids now

263
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,919
are probably entirely different.

264
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,220
You kind of wonder what's the best avenue there,

265
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,080
but there's definitely a level of intensity

266
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,779
with parenting

267
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,740
and I think probably at a junior level

268
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,659
more so than by the time we get up.

269
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,259
All the while,

270
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,059
I think parents at any level

271
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:23,600
want their kids to succeed, right?

272
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,759
And I think sometimes

273
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:27,220
that they're only ever trying to do the best thing

274
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,639
for their kids

275
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,240
to get the best out of them,

276
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:31,220
but how they go about it,

277
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:32,000
sometimes it can,

278
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,840
it's an interesting debate, that one,

279
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,679
but you think that there's a balance

280
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,059
on how much they need

281
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:39,379
and how much they receive

282
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,259
and how much is beneficial, I think.

283
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:44,039
There's a great book called Range that I read

284
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:46,340
and it sort of debunks the 10,000 hour rule.

285
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,659
When Tiger Woods started

286
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:49,039
becoming a billionaire athlete,

287
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:51,379
it felt like everyone was going to be

288
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:52,480
like Tiger's dad

289
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,580
and try and put a golf club

290
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,279
in their kid's hand

291
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,279
when they were six months old

292
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,080
and that was the way to have success with your kids

293
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,360
and this author debunks the theory

294
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,080
and said Roger Federer's mum was a tennis coach

295
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,159
but wouldn't let him play until he was 12

296
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,340
because he was such a bad sport.

297
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,100
He'd throw his racket.

298
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:09,039
She said, well, until you learn to grow up,

299
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,399
I'm not hitting the ball back to you

300
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,139
and he went and played all these other sports,

301
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:13,779
badminton and table tennis and soccer

302
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,960
and then when he came back,

303
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:15,980
everyone was like,

304
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,139
oh, you're way too late to you

305
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:18,080
to be any good at tennis,

306
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,519
but maybe in the long term,

307
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,779
he was a bit healthier,

308
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,519
but it's an interesting conversation

309
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,840
that didn't plan to go there.

310
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,340
I saw in your first answer, Fitzy,

311
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:27,980
the humbleness and the humility around

312
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,720
if you work hard,

313
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,200
you're going to be successful.

314
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,860
In sport, you are aligned on a united board

315
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,919
and a strong CEO

316
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,460
and a capable group of assistant coaches

317
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,259
and a strong captain.

318
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:40,460
Are you a subscriber to that,

319
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,059
to achieve team success, Fitzy,

320
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:43,179
along with the hard work?

321
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,620
You need all those pieces of the jigsaw puzzle as well?

322
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:46,580
Yeah, I think so.

323
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,980
I think, look, there's no shortcuts to success

324
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,220
and I think a collaboration,

325
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,500
if that's the word you want to use,

326
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,120
but a united front on,

327
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,679
we're all heading in the same direction

328
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,779
and we're all given the best account of ourselves

329
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:58,480
to head that way.

330
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,340
All the while, there's times to refresh,

331
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:03,960
times to have time off to freshen up.

332
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:04,679
Sometimes the best,

333
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:07,059
the moments of clarity come in having a rest

334
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:08,379
and having a freshen up

335
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:10,720
or doing something outside the realms of just work.

336
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,879
I think fundamentally,

337
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:13,299
if everyone in the organisation

338
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:14,799
is heading in the same direction

339
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,039
and they're all, again, working hard at whatever their role,

340
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:21,940
roles, responsibilities may be in achieving that,

341
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,320
I think it's like a common thread there.

342
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,139
It makes the environment, I think, happier to go to.

343
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,879
Each day you walk in, you look,

344
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:31,019
I know, how do you term success?

345
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:33,299
I don't think we've achieved it ultimately yet.

346
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,120
Obviously, premierships seem to be

347
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,000
and are always the marker for the ultimate success,

348
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,120
but you're filled with pride when you walk in

349
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,759
watching your staff, you know,

350
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,940
not only just fill in their roles and responsibilities,

351
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,840
like everyone has a job title where, you know,

352
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:47,940
assistant coach, for example,

353
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,539
you've got X, Y, Z that they've got to tick off during the day,

354
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:53,399
but if they're only ever walking in the door

355
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,320
thinking about just being an assistant coach,

356
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:56,159
well, where's the growth?

357
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,059
Where are they going to learn to, you know,

358
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,179
take a chance and grow their own coaching in a separate way?

359
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:04,580
And when you walk into, you know, a building each day

360
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,639
and there's a whole host of staff doing the same thing

361
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,759
and thinking about not just having a job title

362
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,080
but shifting what that job title may be

363
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,700
by trying to grow, get better,

364
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,840
it's challenging to you

365
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,460
because you know that you can't just sit in a comfortable space

366
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,620
and just be routine-like.

367
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,740
We're all pushing each other

368
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,399
and I feel like it makes them enjoyable

369
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:21,980
in a normal environment

370
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,980
and, yeah, ultimately you'd love the success of a premiership

371
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,100
to be able to say, hey, that worked,

372
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,659
but it's still a stimulating environment

373
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:32,039
and a positive one to go and work to.

374
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,440
Fitzy, champion players like you,

375
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,139
and I know the humility is going to be hard for you to listen to that,

376
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,259
but your career, you know,

377
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,919
puts you in the all-time greats of your sport.

378
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,059
Don't always make great coaches

379
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:45,539
because, you know, you probably found the game easier

380
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:47,139
than a lot of others.

381
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,139
Do you find that you've got to work harder with those players

382
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:51,379
that maybe have to work a lot harder

383
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,720
to be as good as you were as a coach?

384
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,179
Well, I think back about that now, Luke,

385
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,460
and, you know, I don't think I was a great player.

386
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,299
I was potentially just in great teams.

387
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,120
So as probably a perfect example of how a great team

388
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,100
will, you know, beat a team of great players

389
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,500
and I think I would have been incredibly frustrating

390
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,799
for my coaches, I think,

391
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:14,960
because I always felt like I had the ability before a game

392
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,500
to sit back and analyse what the coaches wanted us to do

393
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,679
and understand the game

394
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,100
and understand the players

395
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,340
and the plan, the strategy,

396
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,679
the element of putting it all together.

397
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,960
But once I took the field,

398
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:27,759
I'd totally lose myself to the contest

399
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,279
and just want to just keep going

400
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,879
and get out there and work as hard as I could.

401
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,259
So I'm sure I frustrated some of my coaches in that regard,

402
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,320
but ultimately I still have a good relationship,

403
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,179
so it mustn't have been too difficult for them.

404
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:43,000
But I think, now, I do understand what you're saying there.

405
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,200
I think that's the really elite, elite guys of our sport

406
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,299
or in particular sports where I think,

407
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:52,480
and I've had to adjust to this a little bit,

408
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:55,500
but as a coach, you need to understand as quickly as possible

409
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,779
not everyone thinks like you.

410
00:13:57,259 --> 00:13:59,500
All the while, you want to impart some values,

411
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:02,159
some behaviours, some characteristics in your team.

412
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,340
At the end of the day, they think different to you.

413
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,379
So potentially some of the greatest players you've ever seen

414
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:11,139
might struggle to understand their team or their players

415
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:12,740
or what they're trying to put across.

416
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
They can't keep up with them because they're seeing it quicker.

417
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,519
They're seeing it ahead of time.

418
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,460
They might be looking at it through a different lens.

419
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,279
So I think it's about,

420
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,340
trying to get a communal thought process

421
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,779
and putting it all together out there

422
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,419
as opposed to trying to keep up with someone.

423
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,000
I see a lot of people listening to this podcast

424
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,539
will be maybe running their own business

425
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:31,139
or wanting to improve their own teams

426
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,539
or just create a better environment in their day-to-day.

427
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,620
What do you think people can learn from elite sport

428
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,059
and the discipline that is required in your job?

429
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:41,799
Probably reverse engineering the question

430
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,899
to say the discipline part of whatever you're doing

431
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:46,059
would be first and foremost, I would have thought.

432
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:49,220
Irrespective of job or employment,

433
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:52,860
or whatever it is you're trying to achieve,

434
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,159
I think the discipline to have a plan first and foremost,

435
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,200
but to execute and honour the plan.

436
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:00,679
I think it's the most successful people

437
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,279
in whatever industry you're talking about.

438
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,740
I think once they have a vision or a plan

439
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,440
and then go about that with,

440
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,600
whether it's day-to-day or week-to-week

441
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,080
or long-term, short-term strategies, goals,

442
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:14,779
but the discipline to stick at it, go after it.

443
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,100
I think that's the most important part to it.

444
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,100
And yeah, that wavers from time to time.

445
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,000
And particularly, you get in the grind

446
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,799
and you've got to find ways to stimulate, freshen up,

447
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,620
keep finding new ways, but all the while stay the course.

448
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,799
It's not about jumping from one thing to another to another.

449
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,320
It's not necessarily discipline heading in the right direction,

450
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,519
but probably having a philosophy ultimately

451
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,740
that guides you towards it

452
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,519
and then the discipline to see it through, I think.

453
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,000
It's a brilliant answer, isn't it?

454
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:44,360
That often self-doubt creeps in even for the most successful people

455
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,139
and you're not human if at times you don't feel as though

456
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:49,019
maybe you haven't got it all.

457
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,340
Right.

458
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:50,860
Is that something you can relate to?

459
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,919
I mean, I read out the CV at the start.

460
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:56,159
You played in grand finals almost immediately you debuted

461
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,639
and every time you've been in a coaching environment,

462
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:01,019
you've had instant success and consistent success,

463
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,559
but is the self-doubt always something you've got to deal with?

464
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:07,379
I actually listened to one of your podcasts with George Carl

465
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:11,159
and his son, Kobe, was actually on my Leader Connect group.

466
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:14,340
But one thing I thought he nailed was as a coach,

467
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,360
you've got to put your black hat on from time to time

468
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,139
and almost rehearse adversity.

469
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,019
And I think...

470
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,500
You know the advice where someone might recommend,

471
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,759
I think you should sleep on it?

472
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,139
I think that's the worst piece of advice of all time

473
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:26,720
because right in the middle of the night,

474
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,419
when you're in the middle of the night sleeping or thinking about,

475
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,159
that's where all the fears and anxieties hit.

476
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,139
And then once you actually get up and approach the day,

477
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,000
it's never as bad as you think it's going to be.

478
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:38,700
You can actually walk through it a little bit easier.

479
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,379
But you do have to rehearse adversity from time to time.

480
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:46,379
But ultimately, having that philosophy or a vision and a plan

481
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:48,700
and absolute belief that you...

482
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,120
You want to follow it through.

483
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:51,279
You want to see it through.

484
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,539
And it's going to get challenged.

485
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,100
You're going to have to debate it, possibly change it,

486
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,220
possibly adjust it.

487
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,320
But sticking at it's the key, I think, in the face of adversity

488
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,399
more so than when things are going well.

489
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:04,519
You mentioned a Leader Connect and George Carl,

490
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,240
his son Kobe and your group from the Philadelphia 76ers

491
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,259
along with Dean Cox, an AFL legend,

492
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,619
one of the best ruckman the game's ever seen,

493
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,859
now a coach at the Sydney Swans.

494
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,299
Dean Vickerman's had enormous success as an NBL coach

495
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:18,440
with the Melbourne United.

496
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,559
Linda Stowell's an Olympic gold medal winner

497
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,700
who also has got an amazing reputation at the Institute of Sport

498
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,759
for her work coaching a number of different teams

499
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:28,599
in that environment.

500
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,420
Fitz, it's been a great privilege to have you in that world.

501
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,160
I know that the group have learned an enormous amount from you.

502
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,220
What have you taken from the Leader Connect program?

503
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,960
Yeah, I think you initially, when we first talked about joining,

504
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:45,299
the first thing that comes to your mind is how am I going to fit this in?

505
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,339
How's this going to work?

506
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,059
What's it going to be?

507
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:49,059
There's more curiosity of how this is going to go.

508
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:53,539
I know Trent Robinson and Matty King were on one for a long period of time

509
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:58,019
and when the opportunity came up, I went head first into it

510
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:00,059
and it's been more beneficial than I would have thought.

511
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,180
I think they're all different lenses that you're looking through,

512
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,380
similar issues, similar coaching challenges,

513
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,380
but to hear it from a different lens and little,

514
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,500
you get a nugget, something of gold every time we have a chat

515
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,160
and sometimes not long enough, sometimes you just want to keep talking

516
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,980
and sometimes you just want to keep talking.

517
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,059
Sometimes you just want to keep talking.

518
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:19,079
Sometimes you just want to keep talking.

519
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,839
But I've got to say they're all individually been terrific

520
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:26,779
and I'm really looking forward to extending it and growing that more.

521
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,420
And Fitz, we find that you mentioned an hour and 15 a session

522
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,559
and keep that discipline because everyone's got these super chaotically busy worlds

523
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,759
and you're trying to condense that learning.

524
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,200
But a lot of people reflect that it's a rare time to be able

525
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,880
to just have a group of people who haven't got a bias either way.

526
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:46,539
They're not on your board or they're not in your coaching group

527
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:49,059
and that chance to even reflect your own thoughts

528
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:51,420
and thoughts back sometimes, Fitzy, is valuable.

529
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:52,319
Have you found a bit of that?

530
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,440
Yeah, you're right.

531
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,480
Because they're all from different walks, everyone drops the guard.

532
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,119
Like there's no – you're not trying to protect IP.

533
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,140
You're not worried about what might get out or what.

534
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,359
It's like it's such an open forum of different opinions

535
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:08,940
and a different way of looking at things.

536
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,339
And I think that's the safety of that environment makes you share,

537
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,500
share at a deeper level.

538
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,839
And, you know, I'd like to think that, you know, I'm sure every other leader,

539
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:21,400
big connect group has the same experience where it is.

540
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,700
It's the one opportunity you do get where you're not bound by who's listening

541
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,519
or what I should or shouldn't say.

542
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:30,559
It's just such an open forum that I think it's a great sharing platform.

543
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,299
Yeah, it's brilliant to have your reflections on it.

544
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,740
We really appreciate it.

545
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,740
It's a high-pressure, highly scrutinised environment being a head coach

546
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,240
of an NRL team or an Australian sporting coach at an elite level.

547
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,420
And we've seen that have a big negative effect on a lot of people

548
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,539
that the stress of that.

549
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:52,140
That has caused – it's probably an untold story for me in lots of ways.

550
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,740
It's a well-paid job, but it comes with a lot of layers.

551
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:56,579
How do you cope with that, Fitzy?

552
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,839
What do you do day-to-day to keep you well and deal with that level of intensity?

553
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,039
Oh, you've got to have – we've got a couple of outlets,

554
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,500
a couple of active hobbies which, you know, you can get into

555
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,619
and get a mind off things, going surfing or it's time with family,

556
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:16,720
whatever you may see as the release for you to get away from that constant thought

557
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,660
because it is constant.

558
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:22,240
We're not going to lie and suggest that you can easily turn it off or on,

559
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:28,460
but if I really slow down and understand how grateful I am to be in the position,

560
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,420
first and foremost, slow down, take time to reflect on, you know,

561
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,279
how things are going.

562
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,579
Are they trending in a direction you want them to head?

563
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,700
And the relationship building of everyone you work with, the players, the staff,

564
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,539
the board, like we're – it's such an enjoyable role and so much –

565
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:47,640
so many uplifting moments.

566
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,000
It can come out through a day, through a week,

567
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,559
and all the while when the pressure hits and it does hit, it's generally external.

568
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:59,940
It's generally – it's that whole debate on reputation versus character, right?

569
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,519
Like if you're going to be a head coach, you need to understand your reputation

570
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,119
is going to get a holding at some point.

571
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:08,220
Now, if you can handle – your reputation is what other people think of you,

572
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,019
but your character and what you're doing, the people know you.

573
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:14,619
They're spending time with you, so just trying to focus on the internal,

574
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:16,140
on the most important people.

575
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,519
I think it's – it's –

576
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,660
It's definitely manageable, but there's times where you do have to pay attention

577
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,579
to the external.

578
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,559
You're a representation of your club, so at some point in time,

579
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,160
you have to be able to front, absorb pressure on behalf of your organisation,

580
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,099
your players, and as uncomfortable as that may be,

581
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,579
you still have to sit in that space for sometimes extended periods

582
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:38,500
and stay the course.

583
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:41,279
Represent your club, understand the direction you're heading,

584
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,619
don't flinch, and sit in that space.

585
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:45,079
Now, is it uncomfortable?

586
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah, sure it is, but it's also possible when you think about

587
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,099
how much you do have going in your favour.

588
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:51,700
It's a brilliant way to describe it, isn't it?

589
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,180
Reputation versus character, and you can control the character part

590
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,839
and how you react and how the internal world understands you,

591
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,579
and they're the really key people in your life, aren't you?

592
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:04,099
But if you buy into some of the crazy narratives that goes on,

593
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,000
we want to sack coaches every other week depending on a win or a loss,

594
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,319
but it's a brilliant way to compartmentalise it,

595
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,299
and I appreciate you sharing that.

596
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,240
We feel like we're in the golden chair, Fitzy,

597
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,259
in the world of a leader and what these dimensions

598
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:19,500
of great leadership looks like, and I'm looking forward

599
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,160
to getting your thoughts on this.

600
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,380
And starting with self-leadership, you don't achieve what you've achieved

601
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,680
in your life without really understanding yourself

602
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,079
and your own self-leadership.

603
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:28,839
What does that mean to you?

604
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah, absolutely.

605
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:32,599
It probably goes back to the discipline point there, Luke.

606
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:37,380
I think I've had to ultimately to be successful in sport, again,

607
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,680
the discipline, but it's leaders go first, right?

608
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,980
So an understanding that your staff, your players,

609
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,200
are going to be looking at what, how you carry yourself,

610
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:52,000
are you disciplined in either role, life, consistency of behaviours.

611
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,339
I think the simplest way to self-lead is fundamentally for me,

612
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,440
I hate letting people down.

613
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:00,940
So, you know, if I have that in the back of my mind,

614
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:03,900
it always drives me to make sure I'm staying the course

615
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,319
and doing the right things yourself.

616
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,099
And discipline's hard work, but it's also incredibly rewarding.

617
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:13,960
Like, you know, if you just, you set yourself a plan and you're following it,

618
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,819
there's a self-reward and a self-leadership that kind of keeps you going.

619
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,940
It's a bit like the simplest analogy would be jumping in the ice bath, right?

620
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,819
No one wants to get in the water.

621
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,180
No one wants to get in the ice bath.

622
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,579
No one really wants to get through in there.

623
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:27,460
I'll tell you what, you feel better after doing it

624
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,119
because you had the discipline to get into doing it.

625
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,559
So it's probably the quickest snapshot I can say of consistency

626
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,460
of being disciplined in the way you are as a person,

627
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,240
but the way you're actioning, you know, those things.

628
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,480
It's funny you say that, Fitz.

629
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,519
I had the great privilege of spending a few hours one-on-one

630
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,940
with the Iceman Wim Hof.

631
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,720
Four or five years ago and created this ice bath.

632
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,819
And as we're getting in, he said, you know, I love the warm.

633
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,400
You know, I don't like the cold.

634
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:55,380
He said, the cold's just here as a reminder to stay present,

635
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:56,980
but I'd rather be down the beach.

636
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,380
It's a warm day today and it's hot.

637
00:23:58,539 --> 00:23:59,740
Get me into the warm any day.

638
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,940
But I just feel the power was what he was saying

639
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,279
from being present in the cold.

640
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,160
And yeah, it was a fascinating experience to see him close up.

641
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,960
He had a presence about him that's hard to describe.

642
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,680
You know, he's put the ice baths on the map, that man.

643
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,880
Impacting people positively.

644
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,000
Positively every day.

645
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:18,720
I suppose you turn up in an environment where you are the temperature

646
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,660
of the room effectively for everyone in your organisation,

647
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:22,940
the players, your staff.

648
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,680
How do you go about positively impacting them every day?

649
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:30,819
Yeah, I think generational coaching sort of from ultimately

650
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:35,839
when I started playing to where I'm now, like the shift in energy,

651
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:38,359
you know, like it used to be a one-size-fits-all,

652
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:41,279
like players always spoke a certain way, behaved a certain way,

653
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,119
acted a certain way.

654
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,779
And if you weren't like that, you kind of didn't fit in

655
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:43,960
almost.

656
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,740
You know, so to where we are now and players are learning

657
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,160
to communicate via 20-second and 30-second clips on a phone

658
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,460
and that's sort of more stimulating for them.

659
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:57,700
So I think to have a positive impact, you've got to understand

660
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,880
that their environment's different to the one we come up in.

661
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,339
So we're trying to have a lot of fun, to be honest.

662
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,299
We're always coming up with, you know, we have little different

663
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:08,180
presentations and video clips and ping-pong tournaments, basketball,

664
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:10,220
whatever we can get going and have a little bit of fun

665
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,119
to set the intention of the day and get everyone looking forward

666
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:13,779
to walking in.

667
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,599
Sometimes we surprise them with things.

668
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,700
Other times we keep it pretty routine-like.

669
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:20,940
But the balance of making hard happy as well because we want

670
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,539
to train hard.

671
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:25,799
Our sport requires that level of intensity in our preparation

672
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,079
that you need to be ready for.

673
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,160
And I feel like if the environment's too heavy and it's not positive

674
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,819
and it's not impacting the people in it, it's really hard to ask them

675
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:36,759
to work hard and get the best out of themselves.

676
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,420
So if they can get in there and feel so comfortable in their own skin

677
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,220
that under pressure and out there, they're happy to work as hard

678
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:43,720
as possible.

679
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,140
You can get the best out of them out there.

680
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,720
So we try and have a positive impact by having fun as well as understanding

681
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,799
that it's time to work, it's time to work.

682
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,700
It's a great message.

683
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:55,000
If you can make hard happy and have your fun along the way,

684
00:25:55,099 --> 00:25:57,539
then naturally you're going to perform better, isn't it?

685
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:02,980
I think the earnest environments where it was just full of criticism

686
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,960
all the time, no wonder a lot of people didn't cope with it, as you said.

687
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,720
And there wasn't any room outside of that in previous generations.

688
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,220
It's sophisticated the way you're thinking about that.

689
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,720
You mentioned a lot about having a vision.

690
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,519
And the discipline to stick to it.

691
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:18,339
Can you tell us a bit about how you go about creating that vision

692
00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:19,480
and sharing it with your team?

693
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:23,640
It's probably on reflection, probably the best bit of coaching I do.

694
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,480
Just before walking in there, you want to have a high-performing environment.

695
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,799
You want to have a winning culture.

696
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:31,519
I didn't want to wait until we won a few games to go, right,

697
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,279
we've got a culture, we've got a way about us now.

698
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,859
So we sort of just developed, along with the help of some others,

699
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:41,319
we sort of set up a philosophy of how we wanted to act,

700
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:43,700
how we wanted to prepare, and then how we wanted to play.

701
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,240
Like really simple in essence.

702
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,660
And it's kind of been a little bit of a North Star for us,

703
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,599
where we don't vary, win, lose, or draw.

704
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,339
We just want the best account of ourselves.

705
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:55,259
So it's not like we're jumping week to week and trying to fix things.

706
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,980
It's almost like a really guiding principle.

707
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,559
And I think that having that in the background really helped, Luke,

708
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:03,039
to be honest.

709
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,579
I didn't probably underestimate it at the time.

710
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:09,700
But the vision of, okay, I can see what we want to say,

711
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:10,460
how we want to act.

712
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:11,819
We represent the Sharks.

713
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,440
We represent the community of the Sharks.

714
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,579
We represent the NRL as a game.

715
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,839
Like poor behavior doesn't wash anymore.

716
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:19,259
So you want good people.

717
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,480
That's the first and foremost.

718
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,519
And then you want to have a way you prepare.

719
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,339
You can't play a certain way unless you prepare a certain way.

720
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,000
So, okay, how do we want to prepare?

721
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,299
Well, you've got to share that.

722
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,259
This is the way we're going to go about things now.

723
00:27:30,339 --> 00:27:32,960
This is the way we're going to be meticulous in the way we get ready

724
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,000
for a game of footy, the way we get ready for a session,

725
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:37,180
and then how do we want to play, lay it underneath.

726
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:40,220
But I think the first two are almost you've got to get them right first

727
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,859
before you're asking them to get the footy right.

728
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:43,420
Yeah, kind of on reflection.

729
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,359
Give us a consistency in that of the way we're trying to behave.

730
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,259
And listen, there's going to be moments there where you do get challenged

731
00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:52,500
on the behavior and the preparation of players.

732
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:55,880
I can assure you it's not a well-oiled machine just yet,

733
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:59,079
but for the most part it's been pretty smooth, yeah.

734
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,980
I love the clarity of that, Fitz.

735
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:04,900
Without knowing your organization or I can feel walking in, okay,

736
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,420
here's how I need to represent myself as a person in the community.

737
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:09,299
This is the preparation.

738
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,619
Yeah, I might not always get it right, but at least I know the expectation

739
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:13,420
and this is our game.

740
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,420
It's our game style and you've always got that to reflect back to.

741
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,220
It's brilliant in its simplicity and I think often the most brilliant things

742
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,960
are simple because you can understand them as easily as you describe.

743
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,000
I hear that you are an incredibly curious person and the feedback is

744
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,079
that you're just always seeking a better way and knowledge,

745
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,019
and we see that a lot with the people I've been lucky enough to speak

746
00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:34,140
to on this podcast, that curiosity is a big thing

747
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,519
and people approach their learning and development through that.

748
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:37,880
Is that true of you, mate?

749
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,559
Yeah, I reckon it might have cost me from time to time too, Luke.

750
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:43,339
I think so.

751
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,799
You know, 10 years I was working at the Roosters, I was like at a minimum

752
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,819
on a good day of travel, it was an hour and a quarter one way,

753
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,079
most times an hour and a half, so I'm like spending close to three hours

754
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:56,759
in the car every day and I was going, I just want to live where I wanted to live

755
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:57,900
and that's where I wanted to work.

756
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:01,680
So I figured if I had so much time, that much time a day,

757
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,440
how can I be productive and curious by nature?

758
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:09,700
So I just had so much time in my car to listen to podcasts, audio books

759
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,720
and I just loved doing that.

760
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,180
Yeah.

761
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,059
What's happened is as a coach, as a senior, a head coach now,

762
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,579
I'm like, I just feel like I'm letting the boys down

763
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:21,859
if I'm not learning something, if I'm not getting better myself,

764
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:25,579
if I'm not sharing and sometimes with curiosity though,

765
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,839
it's got to stay in a direction of where you're heading

766
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:30,299
because you can get stimulated by something.

767
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,859
I start sharing stuff with the staff and I can see them going,

768
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,859
what's he read here?

769
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,799
What's he listen to here?

770
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,960
We're off on a tangent.

771
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,839
So you kind of got to make sure what I am listening to or reading

772
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:43,359
comes back to the direction.

773
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,920
The direction we're heading in because I'd be guilty.

774
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:47,039
It lures me away for sure.

775
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:47,940
But I love it.

776
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,319
It just is stimulating for me.

777
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,339
I feel like I'm getting better.

778
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:54,119
I feel like it gives me a sense of, yeah, that's productive work

779
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:57,220
and sometimes it's just sharing spills out a bit too much, I reckon.

780
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:00,559
You've got a great way of passing on your message.

781
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:04,440
Have you thought a lot about your communication in the role that you're in?

782
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,059
Yeah, I think that's the most important part.

783
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:09,599
To a point, by the time the players get to us,

784
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,859
they'll know the game at a level of understanding that the X's and O's

785
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:13,200
are there.

786
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,160
You do have to have your style, your way of X's and O's

787
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,099
and how you want to play.

788
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,200
But how you deliver messages and how you get points across

789
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,740
is the most important thing for me.

790
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,640
I mean, that's your coaching opportunity.

791
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,400
If you're going to stand in front of a team and a video board

792
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,519
and video clips and let the clips do the talking for you

793
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:35,660
without being able to tell a story and have a sharing

794
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,359
and have something behind those clips that's going to make it

795
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:41,740
have more purpose and income, it's almost like the ultimate time

796
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,259
to communicate with your team, right?

797
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,119
Individually, you would speak to your players slightly different

798
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,299
because you kind of get to a point where your profile

799
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:51,000
and each of your team members, they need to hear information

800
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,880
slightly different.

801
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,039
But in a communal room and language room or the team room,

802
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,579
working hard on communicating clearly, storytelling,

803
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:03,180
but all the while focusing on how you're going to do your job.

804
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:09,240
So I think that's the art of coaching and sometimes you kind of feel it

805
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,880
when you haven't nailed it and you feel it when it's gone well too.

806
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,799
And how important has collaboration been for you in your role?

807
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:17,940
Huge.

808
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:22,220
You're foolish to think it's – you do feel like it's very lonely.

809
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:25,259
At the end of the day, the decision rests with you.

810
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,579
You've got to make a call for a whole host of things on what you want

811
00:31:28,579 --> 00:31:32,519
to do that day, training, selections, contractual agreement.

812
00:31:32,779 --> 00:31:34,980
There's a lot of decision-making where at the end of the day

813
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,680
you've got to make a call.

814
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,920
So what collaboration does for you is empowering the staff

815
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,779
and I'm still – I'm learning.

816
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,859
From the assistant coaches, from the rest of the staff,

817
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:51,279
like having a collaborative approach I think is – it keeps the mind open

818
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:51,839
for you.

819
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,240
It also empowers them to share more, empowers you to grow more

820
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,059
and they're challenging.

821
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:59,400
You know, it's really – and the collaboration of the crew

822
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,220
we've got at Alita.

823
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,440
Some of the stuff we've brought out of some Alita sessions

824
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,339
and being able to implement has been really important as well.

825
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:08,619
Some parts resonate exactly with where you're at

826
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:10,160
and what situation you're in.

827
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,000
So, yeah, I think it's huge.

828
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:12,859
It's a team sport.

829
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,519
It's a team sport too, right?

830
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:16,299
So not collaborating doesn't make sense either.

831
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,599
And, Fitz, I love the language that you use is that, you know,

832
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:21,660
you're learning from your assistants as much as they're learning from you

833
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,359
and learning from your playing group and that opportunity.

834
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:26,240
But that doesn't happen if you don't create an environment

835
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,000
where people feel like it is collaborative.

836
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,359
So it's obviously a great credit to how you approach your coaching.

837
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,579
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

838
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,259
It'd be hard to not say my parents.

839
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:41,680
It's an environment I grew up in.

840
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,759
And basic, simple, like, values, right?

841
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:50,519
Like behavioural traits, values, consistency of life and life into employment, et cetera.

842
00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:54,940
But I couldn't ignore the influence that they've had on my life, I don't think.

843
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:59,380
And, you know, leaders sort of feel a little bit differently about that.

844
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,039
Like, I had 10 years with Trent Robinson, obviously.

845
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:05,480
So as far as a leader goes in the role that I'm in right now,

846
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,519
he's been probably the most important.

847
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,019
And he allowed me to, like, I'm talking about how the staff,

848
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:11,599
he allowed me.

849
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,579
We share a lot of things.

850
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:18,279
And we used to talk at a deeper level about what it might or might not take to be a head coach.

851
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,559
So I'd have to thank him for that.

852
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,599
But our staff are leaders in their own right.

853
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:24,140
So I'm constantly picking up from leaders everywhere.

854
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:26,599
And you like stuff resonates with you.

855
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,720
But at the end of the day, you've got to lead your way as well.

856
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:32,259
So I think leadership needs to come back to what do you want to do as a leader?

857
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:35,119
But you can learn from so many people.

858
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:35,420
Yeah.

859
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,160
And just got to pick up on mum and dad.

860
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,359
Your immediate thought is to go there.

861
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,619
And you can see those.

862
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:45,359
Just the traits you talk about, are they the sort of cornerstone you think

863
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,299
when you reflect on who you are, the environment you grew up in?

864
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,440
Yeah, I think so.

865
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:54,220
I think obviously a stable environment to grow up in, background,

866
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:58,180
like home filled with love, consistency.

867
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:00,480
Like life was pretty straightforward.

868
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:05,099
Like I don't recall a whole heap of obstacles growing up and a simple grounding

869
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:06,180
and just being a good person.

870
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:09,519
And a lot of consistency of the people in their lives as well.

871
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,519
You know, like generally you surround yourself.

872
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,400
You're with the same sort of people in your life and just grew up in a happy environment.

873
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,699
So I think I'd have to thank you for that.

874
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,780
It's a great gift, isn't it?

875
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:24,539
When you actually look back and think I'd had that stable, loving home environment.

876
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:27,019
It's about as good as you can hope for.

877
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,719
It's nice to hear that.

878
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,500
As you know, in the leader space, we're a bit obsessed with this world of collaboration.

879
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,300
And you played over in England.

880
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:36,440
You've had depths of experience everywhere.

881
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,360
Is there a name of someone you thought, I'd love to collaborate and learn from that person

882
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,539
with all of your curiosity?

883
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,079
Is there a name that jumps out in any area of passion in your life?

884
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:47,179
Yeah, because you live in England, actually.

885
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,460
I was sort of a fan of the Premier League prior to, you know, even going over there and playing.

886
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:58,920
But I marvel at how hard it must be to have a culture of like all a selfless environment

887
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,719
or a team-first culture over there with like the amount of money, the status,

888
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,920
the profile of those players that they must manage, the egos.

889
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,440
Like how they pull all that together.

890
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,619
So, you know, like the Guardiola's or Ange Postacoglu now,

891
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:17,559
like what he's doing is, that's pretty impressive to have an influence so quickly on Tottenham

892
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,340
the way he has.

893
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,219
Something like that would be amazing to watch how they have all those personality types.

894
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,219
And you're not only talking, as I said before, rugby league used to be a one-size-fits-all.

895
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,480
Now we've got all these different sort of ethnicities, backgrounds, cultures, et cetera.

896
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:31,159
Imagine this.

897
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:36,260
Like they're getting people from, some can't even speak a common language, you know.

898
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,619
They're getting them from South America and all around Europe.

899
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:40,219
And then they've got English-born people.

900
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:40,840
And yeah.

901
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,239
And different levels of like the money's astronomical.

902
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,119
How they manage and balance all that, that'd be, I'd love to be a flaw on the wall

903
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:49,219
and see how that goes down.

904
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:51,780
Fitz, it's been a great pleasure spending some time with you.

905
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:57,559
I know mid-season there's a lot going on and your reputation as a player is off the charts

906
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:00,639
and your reputation as a person is the equivalent of that.

907
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,420
And as I said, we're really privileged to be able to connect with you in the leader world

908
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,219
and wish you all the best of success.

909
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:09,360
I'm sure there's plenty more to come.

910
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,360
And thanks again for sharing some of your wisdom today.

911
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,019
We appreciate it.

912
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:13,559
No worries.

913
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:14,420
Thanks for having me, mate.

914
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:15,179
Appreciate it.

915
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,920
