1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,939
How do you make the decision to save a life,

2
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:14,460
knowing you'll potentially put your family and reputation at risk?

3
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:19,109
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

4
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,629
The idea of self-improvement and leadership,

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,769
both on and off the field, has been a lifelong passion of mine.

6
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:27,690
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,429
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

8
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:33,609
in education, sport, industry and the arts

9
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:37,570
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,030
where everyone has a voice.

11
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:43,609
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

12
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:03,929
I sat down with Craig Foster to discuss using sport as a platform for good

13
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:06,349
and ensuring it not only plays a role,

14
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,489
but is an active participant in the fight for what's right.

15
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:17,060
Well, Craig Foster has had a remarkable life story,

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,099
born in Lismore, northern New South Wales, of British and Irish descent,

17
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:22,340
going on to become a legend of the round ball game.

18
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,620
Post-professional sporting life has seen him excel in the media

19
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,159
as a multi-logy award winner.

20
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,379
He's a winning broadcasting legend with SBS television.

21
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:33,019
In 2021, Craig was appointed a member of the Order of Australia

22
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:35,239
for significant service to multiculturalism,

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,340
to human rights and refugee support organisations and to football.

24
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:43,019
Craig was the driving force behind the successful return to Australia

25
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:48,019
of Bahrainian refugee Hakeem Al-Arabi, who was imprisoned in Thailand in 2018.

26
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:52,040
Craig united and led a global coalition of advocacy groups,

27
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:55,420
charities and high-profile Australians to secure Hakeem's release.

28
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,040
Craig is a Bachelor of Law.

29
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:58,560
Master's in Sports Management.

30
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,159
Member of the Australian Multicultural Council.

31
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,739
A director of the Nangala Project,

32
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,420
supporting better outcomes for our Indigenous communities.

33
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,319
And on every level, that is an extraordinary life of leadership.

34
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,960
Craig Foster, thanks for your time today.

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,960
No, it's a pleasure.

36
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,780
Well, it's been fun, I can say that for sure.

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,000
But there's plenty more to go, I hope.

38
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:15,360
You've jammed a lot in, Craig.

39
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:19,639
And I think I'm going to start with a quote that I think is attributed to me.

40
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,039
And please fact-check me if I get anything wrong along the way.

41
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,680
But you, I believe, said this.

42
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,159
The real power of a sporting career,

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,060
is the platform it gives you to do something else.

44
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,039
It's why I work so hard now with human rights.

45
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,539
I wanted to start, Craig, by asking you,

46
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,280
it was an outstanding sporting career.

47
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,819
Why has the next part of your life meant so much?

48
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,539
Because it's just about people.

49
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,800
And many of the lessons that we learn in sport are the same.

50
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,340
And I've just taken those into the rest of my life.

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,919
In fact, I've tried to make them authentic.

52
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:53,219
You know, what I've learned as I've gone on is that many of the propositions,

53
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:57,080
the slogans that sport promotes a lot, you know,

54
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,400
aren't necessarily as real as we'd like them to be.

55
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,879
When we're young athletes, we think that, you know,

56
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:04,719
sport has this extraordinary power.

57
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,419
We think that it's about people.

58
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,460
It's about humanism.

59
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,219
It's about solidarity and equality and all those things.

60
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,099
But sport struggles to live up to that.

61
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,719
So, you know, the older I've got,

62
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,560
I've committed myself to trying to make that occur.

63
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,840
I happen to believe that if sport does become more people-centred,

64
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,159
and that means speaking out for people who are facing injustice,

65
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,939
for racial equality, for gender equality, all of these things,

66
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,340
then the world will be a far better place.

67
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:36,020
Yeah, it's a great thought, Craig.

68
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:40,840
And I clearly want to get into your incredible work in the space of human rights

69
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,740
and multiculturalism.

70
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,340
But just picking up on what you said,

71
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,580
the world that was my sporting upbringing was Australian rules football.

72
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,860
And Australian rules football has taken leadership roles a lot in a number

73
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,939
of different areas from, you know, areas such as diversity

74
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:56,580
and, you know,

75
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,199
around many different facets and specific theme rounds around our Indigenous

76
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:07,180
population and also equality in terms of sexuality as well.

77
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,879
There are a bracket of people, Craig,

78
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,800
that say I need my sport to be a sanctuary away from the heaviness

79
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,199
of dealing with these things.

80
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,939
I want to go to the foot.

81
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:16,079
I just want to support my team.

82
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,339
Do I need at the same time to have to deal with these issues?

83
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,339
You would say yes.

84
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,579
You would say sport needs to step up more than it is.

85
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,980
Well, I'd say two things.

86
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,139
Number one is that the people who play sport are human beings,

87
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,079
and they have the same right as you to speak about any issue

88
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,480
that they feel comfortable about.

89
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,060
I happen to think that human rights are important and that we should all

90
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,879
be helping others.

91
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,259
And why should athletes be different?

92
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,399
It's absolutely no different.

93
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,339
One of the reasons why that's been kind of propagated within the sports

94
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:49,800
industry is because it's been led largely by sponsors

95
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,199
and by commercial interests.

96
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,620
It's a bit like when you talk about climate action in Australia.

97
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,160
You know, clearly fossil fuel companies are still very much shaped,

98
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,240
shaping the narrative of both government and many people in society

99
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,259
and industry and business are a big part of that, as is sport.

100
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:08,500
You don't see sport in Australia being as prominent as even the finance

101
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,100
industry and others at the moment.

102
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,519
So I think this separation of athletes and therefore sport,

103
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,459
because athletes are sport, the rest of the people involved are there

104
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:19,699
just to facilitate for athletes to play.

105
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,560
That's their job.

106
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,220
The concept that they're not citizens, the concept that they're not human

107
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,779
beings, the concept that they shouldn't be cared,

108
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,899
they shouldn't care about all the aspects of social and civic

109
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:34,220
and even political life when they're playing a sport is,

110
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,740
to my mind, just completely ridiculous.

111
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:38,800
I know that that's what people have been led to believe.

112
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,399
I know that's the way that sport has conducted itself,

113
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,220
but I think it's wrong.

114
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:45,699
And sport has contributed to much harm in the world, by the way.

115
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,860
And one of the reasons it's contributed to a huge amount of harm is because

116
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,579
of that, you know, that kind of propaganda telling all the people

117
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:57,160
everywhere that, well, well, sport's exceptional to society,

118
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,939
and, you know, we don't speak about anything.

119
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,120
We're just completely neutral.

120
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,720
And yet if you look at the history of FIFA, for instance, in my game,

121
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,939
and certainly the IOC, you know, the Olympic Games have contributed

122
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:10,860
a huge amount of harm to the cities and the countries where they've gone,

123
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,079
you know, throughout history.

124
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,160
So we turn a blind eye to the harm of sport, but then when people,

125
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:20,939
you know, want to then talk about how sport can do positive things

126
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:24,540
for people and for society, then, you know,

127
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,199
for some reason that becomes a problem.

128
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,139
You see?

129
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,019
What sport does really well, and AFL's the same as ours and almost

130
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:35,920
all others, is that we talk about, you know, the fact that many Indigenous

131
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,819
players are playing, but then, you know, when something happens

132
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,139
to Adam Goodes, you know, then as an industry,

133
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,899
the industry does not respond well.

134
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,259
So I question that.

135
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:48,319
I question whether just giving people opportunity to play is the same

136
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,120
as upholding Indigenous rights.

137
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,420
And I think they're both important, not just providing opportunity,

138
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,360
but being authentic and real.

139
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,360
When people are being harmed.

140
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:00,620
It's great.

141
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,279
I love your directness, Craig, and I really want to talk to you about,

142
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,800
you know, FIFA and you taking FIFA on, and your courage to do that to me

143
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,040
is incredibly admirable.

144
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,839
And I think it's worth noting, you know, our industry did let Adam's goods

145
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:18,139
down terribly, and, you know, the opportunity to speak to him about that

146
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,319
and me working in the media felt part of that.

147
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,519
I missed it, didn't quite get it well enough, and it is an embarrassment

148
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,060
for us.

149
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,519
We had...

150
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:25,699
We had...

151
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:26,199
We had...

152
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:26,399
We had a lot of pressure.

153
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:26,439
We had a lot of pressure.

154
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:26,500
We had a lot of pressure.

155
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,279
We had a lot of pressure greatly from our Indigenous population,

156
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,699
and the contribution to the game is incredible.

157
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:32,879
And you're right, in key moments, we haven't got it right.

158
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,180
Well, sport doesn't.

159
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:37,779
So, you know, as I've said before, you know, I'm not impugning AFL.

160
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:40,939
You know, I'm impugning all sport as an industry, you know.

161
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,100
And, you know, so when it comes to international football,

162
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,040
we've got immense problems with racism, huge issues with FIFA,

163
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:51,779
major events all around the world, and sport continues to...

164
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:54,680
And we've got this now, you know, with the Olympics and the Beijing 2022

165
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,319
coming up.

166
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,379
You know, you've got over a million Uyghurs interned,

167
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:01,500
immense cultural genocide, actually.

168
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,040
The UN, the EU, many organisations have used that term,

169
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,500
and yet the Olympics are saying, oh, we don't have any responsibility

170
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,620
to what's happening there.

171
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,939
We just go and have a tournament.

172
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:16,339
But at the same time, they say that it's a celebration of humanity.

173
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,259
Well, it's not actually.

174
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,379
What you're doing is you're celebrating in part inhumanity,

175
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,459
and we really need to have that discussion in sport.

176
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,199
Yeah, it is a great...

177
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,660
A point you make again, isn't it?

178
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,540
And what's happening in that part of the world with the Uyghur community

179
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,320
is, as you said, genocide occurring on a world scale,

180
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,500
but being ignored not only by the Olympic movement,

181
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,879
but by all the organisations that you speak about.

182
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,580
So much to jump into, Craig, and I love that you go straight

183
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,080
to the heart of every matter.

184
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,919
And I want to talk about your leadership in the Save Hakeem issue.

185
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,700
For those that don't know the story, a former Barani national soccer player

186
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,080
was tortured and imprisoned in his own country before escaping

187
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,899
to Australia as a refugee.

188
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:55,080
He was then imprisoned in Thailand.

189
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,139
He was then imprisoned in Thailand.

190
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:55,179
He was then imprisoned in Thailand.

191
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:56,879
Again, in 2018 on his honeymoon.

192
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,279
Can I get you, Craig, to give a little bit more depth

193
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,820
to Hakeem's story and just for context?

194
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,039
And then what connected you personally to him and your mission

195
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,639
to try and save him from jail in Thailand?

196
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:13,980
So he was part of the Arab Spring, which was a pro-democracy movement,

197
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:19,779
largely in authoritarian or theocratic regimes, you know,

198
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,379
monarchies, for instance, like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain,

199
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:30,340
where the royal family rule and tend to be the judges

200
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,279
and, you know, occupy all the high positions in society,

201
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:35,519
including, I might say, sport positions,

202
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:38,259
which means National Olympic Committees and all of these things.

203
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,159
And he took to the street tens of thousands of people in Bahrain

204
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,100
calling for democracy and following that,

205
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,460
the Crown Prince went on TV with some footage because, of course,

206
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,899
the news organisations were there.

207
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,460
And they...

208
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:56,080
They put up the footage of these people in this demonstration,

209
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,639
peaceful demonstration, by the way, which was ultimately crushed

210
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,120
by Saudi Arabians coming across the causeway between the two countries

211
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,720
in tanks and people died because you can only push a monarchy so far,

212
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:11,000
right, before the use of force becomes, you know, becomes automatic.

213
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,580
And so what happened is they circled some of the athletes

214
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,220
on the television and said, Bahrain is an island, he said,

215
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,139
the Crown Prince, and there is no escape and you will, you know,

216
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,220
you have spoken against the regime.

217
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:25,080
And we're coming for you.

218
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,840
So they went and rounded them all up, over 150 athletes.

219
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,519
He was in the under 23 Bahrain football team, that's soccer.

220
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
And he spent months in jail.

221
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,039
They tortured him.

222
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:38,240
They bashed his legs with a metal pole saying,

223
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,639
you're never going to play football again, we're going to break your legs.

224
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,740
And then they would stand him up, walk him around until he got blood

225
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,299
back in his legs and so that they could then bash him again.

226
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,379
They falsely accused him.

227
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:52,759
It was quite funny because they accused him of being part of apparently

228
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,220
some group of...

229
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,840
A group who burned down a police station.

230
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,639
And that occurred at exactly the same time that he was playing

231
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,299
in a televised football match.

232
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:05,340
And yet they convicted him because they, of course, you know,

233
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,919
in unfair trials in many of these countries, you know,

234
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,379
you can't put that evidence there.

235
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,299
So his brother was forced to, you know, a forced confession to say that

236
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,080
Hakeem Idita, anyway, here's this vision of him playing football at the same time

237
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,720
as they, so they convicted him of 10 years and he fled.

238
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
He ended up in Australia.

239
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,059
And he was granted refugee status, which in Australia is not easy.

240
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:29,860
It's a very prolonged and thorough process.

241
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,019
You know, everyone understands where we are at with refugees in this country

242
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:33,460
at the moment.

243
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,179
And so the Australian government was privy to all of that information.

244
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:40,259
They knew that he fled for, you know, for legitimate purposes.

245
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,960
And anyway, he thought he was safe.

246
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:46,019
He was given a protection visa, which means that he's a recognised refugee.

247
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,679
Anyway, he decided to go on his honeymoon across to Thailand.

248
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:52,960
What he didn't know is that the King of Bahrain,

249
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,980
is very close friends with the King of Thailand.

250
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:59,480
So you have these monarchies around the world, which, by the way,

251
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:00,659
includes Australia's.

252
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,480
And, you know, there's a very small group of these kings and queens

253
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,620
and royal families, and particularly in the Middle East,

254
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,440
they're all very highly connected.

255
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:12,740
Bahrain is very, and Saudi, but Bahrain is a very big investor

256
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,179
in a Thailand property.

257
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:19,700
The former, or the King of Bahrain had bailed out the former prince

258
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,580
and now King of Thailand, which is to the tune of $700 million.

259
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,200
And, you know, some time ago, so very close relationship.

260
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,100
He didn't know that.

261
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,320
And so what it became clear is that they'd been monitoring him

262
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,720
because he'd spoken out against a former ruling member

263
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,779
who actually wanted to become FIFA president.

264
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:38,679
And Hakeem was so brave because he said, these people tortured me.

265
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,000
And this guy didn't speak up because he was the,

266
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:42,480
he was president of the football association.

267
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,019
He said he didn't say anything.

268
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:46,600
And my captain of the country and me and many others

269
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,200
were incarcerated and tortured.

270
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,919
So how can he run FIFA?

271
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,759
So Hakeem basically, that went around the world.

272
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:56,659
He basically played a big role, if not killed the hopes of,

273
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,039
of that Sheikh and member of the Royal family,

274
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:02,179
who now is the president of AFC of Asia.

275
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,299
So what happened is he landed in Bangkok.

276
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:07,419
They directed the Thai government working together.

277
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:11,279
They got on the plane, grabbed him and threw him into detention.

278
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:15,139
And within about a week or so, threw him into the prison.

279
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,659
And they were going to extradite him back to Bahrain.

280
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:20,139
If he went back, he was going to be, A, tortured,

281
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,960
but it had happened before.

282
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:22,659
Thailand had,

283
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:25,480
sent back several other people under the exact same circumstances

284
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,539
and they were never seen again.

285
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,679
So it was our judgment that he was going to lose his life.

286
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,860
So, you know, we went and got him.

287
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:34,559
Amazing, Greg.

288
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,480
And your effort, you mentioned, you know,

289
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,600
the wealth and the influence of the Bahraini Royal family

290
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,220
in that instance.

291
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,200
And so you, from a leadership story, the complexity of that,

292
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,519
you're taking on FIFA and the power of FIFA because they're

293
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:49,580
conflicted as they often are in all their ethics.

294
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:52,620
You know, Australia's own refugee history became an issue.

295
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:56,059
For you, when trying to get some advocacy and some collaboration,

296
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,820
essentially, to bring Hakeem, tell me about stepping into that.

297
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,940
Were you aware from the start just how challenging it was going to be?

298
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,019
And did you face hurdles that you couldn't have imagined?

299
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,279
Well, no and yes.

300
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:15,860
So I wasn't that, I wasn't 100% aware of what it is I was stepping into.

301
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,039
All I knew is I met his wife, you know,

302
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:21,320
and she kind of looked at me and said, look, are you going to help?

303
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,080
And I said, well, look,

304
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,779
I've already spoken to the government and I've made a bit of an issue

305
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,759
publicly and she looked at me and said, yeah,

306
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:28,340
but are you actually really going to help?

307
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,159
You know, and, and what, and that was the right question.

308
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,840
What she was saying is, look, you have some social capital, you know,

309
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,019
you have a position.

310
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:39,960
Are you actually going to do what's required to get him out?

311
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:42,600
And I looked at her and said, yeah, I understood what she was asking.

312
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,399
And I said, yes, I will.

313
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,799
That's kind of when I decided, look, I've got to go.

314
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,419
I went across to Bangkok and, and, you know,

315
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:51,659
went and saw him in the prison and then went to FIFA and just,

316
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:53,419
you know, just went the whole way.

317
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:53,960
Right.

318
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,299
And people often ask, how did you get him out?

319
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,220
It was very complex matrix of stakeholders, obviously,

320
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,700
but the real answer is that I really tried many times in life.

321
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,179
We are trying to achieve things, but, you know,

322
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,419
without treading on toes, you know,

323
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,919
without putting our reputation on the line,

324
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,080
without taking risks to ourselves or our families or our financial

325
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,000
wellbeing, you know, I was working with SBS at that time,

326
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
which is a government, you know,

327
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:25,320
government broadcaster and I knew that I would have to have to advocate

328
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,700
in some ways against the government of Australia.

329
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,379
Although we ended up working together with the foreign minister,

330
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:32,759
Maurice Payne is a very good person.

331
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,059
So I didn't realise then,

332
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:39,440
and I couldn't talk throughout about this relationship between the royals

333
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:42,159
because that would have put him at even more risk.

334
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,759
So we had some areas that became known to us,

335
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,720
but I weren't able to advocate on them, only allude to them.

336
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,600
But those things, I was able to advocate on them.

337
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,919
I was able to tell FIFA when we, when I went over to Zurich,

338
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:57,820
we closed the door and Fatma Samura, the secretary general,

339
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,279
which is the CEO of FIFA,

340
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,340
I was able to be very candid with her and say, this is what's happening.

341
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,220
This is what the foreign minister's told me yesterday. I was in Bangkok.

342
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,519
This is what I found out.

343
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,519
I understand that you are aware of what I've found out.

344
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:16,259
And unless we do something together, you know, that's not going to be good.

345
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,639
I read your history saying you took on everyone. I broke every relationship.

346
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,379
I had to break.

347
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:23,700
And you mentioned personal capital, Craig.

348
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,659
There is, you know, and I love Hakeem's wife question.

349
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:29,059
She understood that you were going to have to, you know,

350
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:30,919
and then that comes back on your own family.

351
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:33,000
I mean, how do you, how do you make those judgment calls?

352
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,240
Because you are effectively having to put skin in the game here to do what you did.

353
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,120
Was it, was it a toss of the coin?

354
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,100
Was there a moment where you thought I'm in trouble here?

355
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,919
I sat down with my wife and children and, you know,

356
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,840
there was a lot of tears everywhere and so on,

357
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,279
because we knew what was at risk.

358
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,740
We also had people camped outside our house.

359
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,500
And so, you know, I had to bring in, you know,

360
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,179
law enforcement agencies and so on.

361
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:02,539
When we had to, and it was just before I was scheduled to go to Bangkok.

362
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:06,619
So we had to put as many protections in place for our children.

363
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,920
We have three as we possibly could and my wife.

364
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,539
And so, yeah, it was very, very worrying.

365
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,720
And that was a very difficult decision.

366
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:15,559
You know, do we leave these guys here?

367
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,519
I had to be satisfied that they had, you know,

368
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,759
that we had the best possible protections around them.

369
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,660
They couldn't go.

370
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:20,839
Well,

371
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,359
I was a way that couldn't be walking anywhere, even to school at school.

372
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,259
We needed someone around the school to be, you know,

373
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,079
proximal to them and on all those things.

374
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,359
So that didn't add to it didn't make it easier because it was already as

375
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,319
intense as you could possibly hope.

376
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,279
But as I said, look in the end, in some ways it's easier because,

377
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:44,640
you know,

378
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,180
when a kid's life is in danger or when the Afghan, you know,

379
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,559
refugees or the women's national football team,

380
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,759
you know, the second generation going out there,

381
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,720
the first generation that we got out recently, you know,

382
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,039
like when it's at that level, then you really have no choice.

383
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,940
And so you have to be as that focuses the mind,

384
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,759
it focuses the skills and 20 years of being in the media and say training,

385
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:10,460
but being in the media allowed me to frame the messaging,

386
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,440
which was really important to the Australian government,

387
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,160
to the Bahrainis and others.

388
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,680
But I remember going to that FIFA meeting and this is really the crux of it.

389
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,880
And I took to the FIFA meeting,

390
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,759
albernian actually is a legendary lawyer who happens to work in sport his name is brennan

391
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:31,279
schwab and uh and um who used to sit on the board of richmond afl actually and um he runs world

392
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,519
players association which is the global players union and i'm a chair of our former chair of our

393
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,579
local players union here and i remember being in the taxi with him and just turning to him and

394
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:45,059
saying okay listen you know what's at stake here he knew anyway but i want i needed to state it

395
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:49,579
said look we're going to go in there you know i'm going to control this meeting and get the outcome

396
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:57,660
that i need to get out of it and you need to understand that this meeting means that we i have

397
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:03,599
to do whatever is necessary to get this kid out uh that they're going to fight and scream and kick

398
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,900
for several hours and that we're going to have to deal with that uh but there's only one outcome

399
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,720
that we're going to have at the end but that you are never going to be and i and you are never going

400
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,740
to be in first class flying around the world going to fifa world cups we can forget about

401
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,299
sitting on

402
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:23,180
fifa tribunals you know he's a magnificent sports lawyer you can forget about that

403
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:30,180
it's not happening you know the our future in relation to fifa and you know all of the gravy

404
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:35,180
train that happens there not that we're looking at it but you know that is going to be gone today

405
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:39,559
and i just need to let you know that you have to be comfortable with that otherwise don't come in

406
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:45,160
and of course he's a he's a you know he's a player unionist um so you know he's very

407
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,220
comfortable with that but we went in and the meeting at time was very robust

408
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:58,119
and in the end we actually fifa issued a press release which was one of my um i guess um demands

409
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:05,099
really a press release that said fifa is working with a craig and world players association brennan

410
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:10,920
to bring this to a speedy resolution and we're calling on bahrain as well as thailand but we're

411
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:16,759
calling on bahrain the highest levels of bahrain it said that was the language we negotiated in

412
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:19,279
other words they told the world that the royals of bahrain are going to be the best players in the

413
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:24,180
world and they need to get out of the way and shortly after that not too long afterwards

414
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:30,980
uh hakeem was out great story of courage and leadership great so yeah incredible to hear it

415
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,039
firsthand and understand what what was at stake for everyone as you said and and listen to your

416
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,059
family i love talking to leaders like you and you go back to your family because we all look there

417
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:44,720
straight away and and you've you know wife lara and you mentioned the three kids uh jake jemma and

418
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,279
charlie and you know teenage daughters as well that's that's tough isn't it

419
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:53,799
i mean you must have had you know moments where you looked at them and went you know have security

420
00:20:53,799 --> 00:21:00,240
at school and have their safety as an issue i mean did you did you at some point think you know wow

421
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,599
i've asked a lot of my family here oh yeah and uh look truthfully you know i've done it before

422
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:12,460
because um you know i had you know when i was at sbs you know i resigned because i gave some

423
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,259
undertakings to the players association to go back and help them and they were in some trouble

424
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:19,279
uh and um and so i think it's it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a

425
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:25,900
you know i do if i feel really strongly about something and i think it's right or wrong um

426
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:33,160
then i'm willing to take almost whatever risk um that is necessary and so my wife's had to deal

427
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:39,319
with that a number of times um and so she knows and she says look i can see the signs and so you

428
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:45,119
know these as we get older we get better at um i'm talking about me here uh better at being able

429
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,759
to manage it and and understand it a bit um ultimately

430
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:56,359
it's never easy it's never easy um you know social change and taking on major institutions

431
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:00,039
is important it's incredibly important it's important in a democracy like ours

432
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:06,079
um and it's certainly important to stand up for people's rights and doing it carries risk that is

433
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:12,400
the reality it shouldn't be the case i happen to think that the more of us that do it the unit cost

434
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,039
per person of standing up for these issues will lessen uh when all of us do it and i might just

435
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:19,279
say i'm not going to say that it's not going to be the case but i'm going to say that it's not

436
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:25,259
that athletes around the world are being very prominent forthright and i think that if sport

437
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:30,980
does that carries its responsibility on behalf of athletes then the risk to athletes will be

438
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:36,039
nowhere near as severe as it is right now you wrote a fantastic book uh co-authored by hakeem's

439
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:42,579
wife uh fighting for hakeem can you tell us a bit about uh clearly that's a special relationship for

440
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:47,839
life when you do what you did for hakeem and his family uh what's your friendship like these days

441
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,279
oh well he's just like a friend of mine he's a friend of mine he's a friend of mine he's a friend of

442
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:55,299
my younger brother and um so you know we we talk um intermittently he was up in sydney um

443
00:22:55,299 --> 00:23:00,039
the last week for his birthday actually and and talked about you know what his future looks like

444
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:05,700
they're still dealing he and his beautiful wife have a young son now uh elia who's about i think

445
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,980
18 months old or so now and he's walking and kicking a football so look it's lovely that

446
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:17,039
you know i i spoke to him in the prison uh you know and i gave him undertakings that i'd get

447
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,259
him out and after he got out what i said to him is you know i'm not going to be able to do anything

448
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:24,079
he went down to parliament house and i said to him look um you don't have to speak about this ever

449
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:29,240
again you know you don't have a responsibility there i do but your only responsibility is to

450
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,640
go and have a life you know have a family if that's what you you want you he was trying to

451
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:39,140
get a house go and do that do whatever you don't owe anything to anyone you know zero to me yeah

452
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:43,740
you know i'm here to help you whenever you need that's all that it is but if you feel that you

453
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,460
have a voice and and you want to you know make change in future i'm happy to help you

454
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:55,599
and you know he's only 28 so what he was put through from his late teens until now you know

455
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:01,339
changed his life it changed his trajectory he he can't have the same career in football that

456
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:06,299
he you know was destined to have he loved real madrid he wanted to play for real madrid

457
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:10,279
well he's not doing that anymore so it's it's fundamentally changed their lives they can't

458
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:14,700
go back to bahrain and you know they can't go back and see his wife's grandparents and these

459
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,240
types of things you know there's there's a lot of fallout from these types of

460
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:31,049
circumstances so he just needs to get on with his life your reputation as a broadcaster you

461
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:36,809
can see when you get focused up greg you uh you get your eye in and uh and watching your broadcast

462
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:42,769
over the journey that's come with a few scrapes along the way um when you reflect on that is that

463
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:48,329
just you that's just you being you is there any you look back with would you soften it with age

464
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:53,730
or is that you being as direct as you could be broadcasting for me in football was not about the

465
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:02,710
game within australia you know i happen to believe and always have that football as the

466
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:07,730
multicultural game has a huge amount to offer to the country it's already done that uh by assisting

467
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:15,890
our somewhat troubled immigration history i mean australia uh and and through that the game uh and

468
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:23,190
that the game is really important uh and that um i have responsibility as a broadcaster to

469
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,950
uh hold the people in the game accountable and to be able to do that and to be able to do that

470
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:31,069
in the best interests of the game and what i believe that to be people don't need to agree

471
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:36,369
but i think when i sit here you know in my early 50s i think most football fans would say

472
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:41,890
that that's been the case there's a high profile moment uh craig i might be going back over you

473
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:48,009
and angie postacoglu it's probably about 15 years ago angie's coaching the under 25 team or the youth

474
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:53,190
team and i think you uh were pointing out pretty uh forcefully that you thought his performances

475
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,690
weren't up to standard and the side hadn't qualified and

476
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:55,950
you

477
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,210
uh you know i think ang described himself as maybe being unemployable on the back of

478
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:04,849
of that i mean you've gone on to extraordinary things in your life and we just spoke about one

479
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:10,630
chapter there and ang now coaching celtic is an incredible story how does that play out over time

480
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,410
when you when you look do you look back with that one and think that there was maybe some more nuance

481
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:18,309
in that um if i had the same discussion today obviously i'd do it differently but it was an

482
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:22,950
important discussion and the question was right um actually what i asked ang was do you take

483
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,690
responsibility and what we used to have a lot

484
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:30,210
was that australian coaches would blame the players all the time you know we had that for

485
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:36,029
decades and decades i saw it in fact when we had our team in 1997 we had a coach come in from abroad

486
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:40,170
his name was terry venables and whilst other coaches were saying that you know australia is

487
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:47,529
only capable of this uh he proved otherwise so i you know i think uh that it's important to question

488
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:53,509
the national coaches particularly around uh their approach to either the game or the australian

489
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:55,670
players or other things so it's an important question and i think it's an important question

490
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:03,490
it's necessary it's necessary then it's necessary today i'm extremely happy look no one planned

491
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:08,450
the interview itself no one planned the fallout of course none of that you know that was all

492
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:14,990
that's live television and anything can happen um and so you know much of that was very sad

493
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:19,890
uh that's why i'm just so thrilled today that ang has gone on and having a brilliant career

494
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:24,490
i'm delighted for him he's at celtic now you know i'm hoping that he has success there this year

495
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,369
and sport now i'm hoping to have him in the champions league next year

496
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:33,309
and i'm thrilled that stephen gerrard has just left rangers that they've had to get a new coach in

497
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:38,329
and what that might mean is hopefully celtic get an advantage because we all need uh you know

498
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:43,809
ang to do well this year in order to you know provide a pathway for young australian coaches

499
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:47,309
yeah that's a fantastic unfolding story isn't it for australian coaching and

500
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:51,970
interesting to hear your reflection on that as time goes on i want to

501
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,670
drift into your passion for multiculturalism you

502
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:02,829
always uh craig an unlikely uh ambassador for for that cause if that term is makes sense as

503
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:07,009
british and irish background where did your passion for for multicultural australia come from

504
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:13,769
yeah so that's a good point i'm from lismore uh in northern new south wales and so i in in kind of

505
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:22,369
you know the 70s early 80s that was a very uh monocultural largely anglo area which is where

506
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:25,369
where i come from uh and so i

507
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:31,269
stepped into multiculturalism if you like at the age of about 15 when i made our australian junior

508
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:36,630
team and that's when i saw you know all of these kids from all around australia that would come

509
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:42,390
from very different cultures to what i'd been used to uh in my life up until that point and i loved

510
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:46,269
it i thought this was extraordinary and they you know all became lifelong friends of mine so then

511
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:51,769
i went down to the ais the same thing occurred and then i stepped into the multicultural clubs

512
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:55,529
of the australian national soccer league which you know we we

513
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:01,190
are clubs of different ethnicity if you like many different cultures and i came to understand those

514
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:07,529
cultures and to love them and to love the difference so therefore when i retired uh i

515
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:14,210
went into sbs which was the natural home uh it was the multicultural broadcaster and i and i believed

516
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:21,430
in the nature of multiculturalism uh and of lifting up minority voices and so that's been a

517
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:25,670
big theme of my life ever since uh you know it came to me as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a

518
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:30,910
out of the game so you know i i advocate a lot quite a lot for refugees so what i would say

519
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:37,269
about that is you know we play with refugees as our teammates and we play against refugees when

520
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:43,009
we play other teams and in both instances in team sport we are saying you are my teammate and

521
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:47,990
therefore you are the same as me right and i'm playing against you and so you know we have respect

522
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:55,009
and we're on an equal level so that connection was very quickly made uh and i think that's why

523
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:55,670
sport can be so important to me and i think that's why i'm here today and i think that's why i'm here

524
00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:04,009
and be so powerful because it is so diverse and part of our world verse part of our uh world view

525
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:09,109
in sport is multicultural sounds like a nice thing to say correct on the back of that but you know

526
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:12,410
as your mind's talking you're thinking about the idea of discriminating against someone for their

527
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,869
ethnicity or their color or their race or their sector is the most absurd thing that you could

528
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:22,869
imagine and when maybe your circle of influence is pretty narrow and you don't really see that

529
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:25,670
day-to-day perhaps you can only know what you know and you can't really see what you know

530
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:31,210
and when you think about it clearly it's a it's still a massive issue in 2021 and people are

531
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:36,930
discriminated daily and often unconsciously uh in our actions without thinking about it i mean

532
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:43,289
it's a big question to ask but what what is the the secret in your what do we need to do for better

533
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:49,569
inclusivity in in sport and in life in general yeah that that is a long a longer discussion but

534
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:54,190
i would say um more of us need to speak out about it that's why black lives matter was really

535
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,670
important uh is because we need to speak out about it and i think that's why i think that's

536
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:02,630
they it turned it coined a term that's really important they said silence is violence and

537
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:07,869
that's true so just today prior to speaking you to you i went from sydney up to newcastle to see

538
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:14,309
the lord mayor of newcastle of the city uh who uh joined the racism not welcome campaign that i am

539
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:19,730
um you know supporting and part of and it emerged out of the grassroots communities here in sydney

540
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:25,670
who particularly during covid experienced a heightened uh incidence of racism uh of

541
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:29,289
course the asian australian community i think everyone knows that's been well publicized

542
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:36,089
uh but also almost every other cold community you know a culturally and linguistically diverse

543
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:41,569
community across australia have have faced racism recently and of course you know it goes to the

544
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:50,769
very nature of the you know uh settlement uh you know post uh first nations um you know 65 000

545
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:55,630
years so what racism not welcome does is encourages all lgas that's

546
00:31:55,670 --> 00:32:01,109
councils around the country to sign up to the campaign and firstly to install street signs

547
00:32:01,109 --> 00:32:05,650
which is really interesting because many people say well why do i need a racism not welcome street

548
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,690
sign in the street where i walk i feel really uncomfortable with that because racism's not here

549
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:16,230
well that's why the street signs need it because the firstly what we want to do is make you

550
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:21,410
acknowledge at grassroots community level which is why i support it i think top down campaigns

551
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:25,650
are really important but this is very very profound coming from the communities in the

552
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:31,069
and as you said before lived experience and so we install the street signs it's in the city of

553
00:32:31,069 --> 00:32:35,670
sydney there's one near parliament house there's a number across the city and in many councils

554
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:40,589
around australia and then what we do is we say okay now we need to acknowledge understand and

555
00:32:40,589 --> 00:32:46,329
have this difficult but necessary conversation i think we're all going to be better for having

556
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:51,390
done that uh it's time that we you know stood shoulder to shoulder and lifted up first nations

557
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:55,650
voices you know we talk about equity that means providing them more opportunities to

558
00:32:55,670 --> 00:33:02,809
speak than us than me uh and to do so we can get this country to the place where i think at least

559
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:09,930
in sport we were all taught and we internalized and really believed uh that this is what australia

560
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:16,849
was is but it certainly should be yeah beautifully said uh craig and once again you can your passion

561
00:33:16,849 --> 00:33:22,690
and your leadership on on those issues is uh is a standout quality clearly uh i mentioned you

562
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,650
being recognized with an order of australia for your work but you can see

563
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:30,150
that it's a part of who you are in a really strong sense we've been talking to a range of

564
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:35,190
leaders craig about we're seeing a a number of traits that make up great leadership and modern

565
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:39,650
leadership and the new face of leadership in lots of ways and so please be expansive i want to ask

566
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:43,990
you a series of questions about the dimensions of leadership as we see them starting with self

567
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:49,549
leadership craig what does that term mean to you when i say self-leadership i would say just um

568
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:55,410
introspection and um i think it's important to always interrogate where we are

569
00:33:55,670 --> 00:34:01,190
who we are what what influence we're having on others um what we have when that others don't

570
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:08,250
have and part of that to me is um being in touch with a whole range of communities who don't have

571
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:12,590
the privilege and opportunities that i've been given and that's how we learn yeah connection to

572
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:18,349
community yeah craig my mind had the privilege um of playing uh professional afl foot with a

573
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:22,010
number of indigenous players who were just incredible in their contribution and their

574
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,550
school and their friendship and sense but it wasn't until actually going

575
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:29,349
back and visiting their communities taking my own kids to their communities sometimes

576
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:35,030
you know remote uh regional parts of australia and then understanding their sense of family

577
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,730
understanding the 2000 years of intelligence around so many different aspects that you could

578
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:44,690
really then get a sense as you said it's until you take that time and effort you really understand

579
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:48,730
you know a much deeper sense of the cultural sensitivities that were going on and that was

580
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:52,829
you know a life-changing moment for me and a change in my relationship and understanding i

581
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:55,650
get your understanding and passion for it you mentioned

582
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:59,230
about positively impacting others in in your environment which is another dimension of

583
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,349
leadership we're seeing great leaders and clearly that has been part of your life's work do you

584
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:09,130
actively think about how you positively impact others craig i don't really plan it but what i

585
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:15,070
you know i i just recognize that a broadcast and what you're doing now and so on is very very

586
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:20,969
powerful and influential position and uh and it can be used for tremendous good as we've seen

587
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:25,349
around the world with trumpism and all of this type of things it can be used for really nefarious

588
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:32,949
untruthful things um and that's perhaps why it needs to be used uh for truth and for uh you know

589
00:35:32,949 --> 00:35:40,510
what is good and to help people um and so um you know that's that's that's the way i look at it

590
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:45,309
is that um you know i have a responsibility through the platform that sport has given me

591
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:53,409
uh to help anyone who comes within my purview if i have time uh and can do it in a you know

592
00:35:53,409 --> 00:35:55,650
an authentic substantive way you know not just you know i'm not going to be able to do it in a

593
00:35:55,670 --> 00:36:00,230
superficial way and what the hakeem you know and i used to like every athlete you know i was

594
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:04,090
ambassador for a thousand things you know even when i was playing i was part of the republic

595
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:09,230
movement you know i spoke at the town hall here in sydney around the referendum on being a republic

596
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:16,429
with malcolm turnbull uh and you know homelessness domestic violence uh you know you name it you

597
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:20,550
know i just think if people came and said look these people don't have what you have they haven't

598
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:25,210
had the same opportunity they're being harmed they're in trouble and you could somehow help

599
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:31,230
then i just always felt compelled to do whatever it is that i could creating and sharing a vision

600
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:35,869
is is something we've been speaking about as well you've had some big visions and you know not the

601
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:41,409
least of which the idea of uh being able to secure hakeem's release from a tie jail with all the

602
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:47,150
complexity we spoke about how do you go about sharing and creating a vision i think it's about

603
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:52,869
firstly it has to be based on principles so when you articulate a vision i happen to believe that

604
00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:55,650
it should be based on goodness on human rights and by the way it should be based on human rights

605
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,750
by a sustainable planet is now a human right and that makes sense to me and i'm glad about that

606
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:04,650
you can articulate a brilliant vision but just because you're shell and you're articulating a

607
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:09,789
vision of the world with energy that doesn't mean that it's sustainable or it's right or it's good

608
00:37:09,789 --> 00:37:17,130
and the second point is um just empowering people like you know everything that i do today and a

609
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:23,809
team is like that you know um there was a good uh anecdote about um i'm not sure if it was a kind of

610
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:31,489
you know who said to some french troops this is this is what i read is the only reason i'm talking

611
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:36,050
about those two nationalities and cultures uh listen that you know that's that's the wall there

612
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:39,250
we're going to go over there and we're going to go and get those people and you know there's like

613
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:43,289
500 000 of them outside there but you ready i'm going to blow this horn you're all going to go

614
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:49,070
and the the french troops said yeah that's a great idea show us great another dimension where we're

615
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:55,650
seeing as a common trait of leaders like yourself is the idea of curiosity as a pathway to improve

616
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:59,150
and approach learning and development what do you think of when i talk about curiosity

617
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:03,530
and your world of learning development look i'm just embarrassed at what i don't know

618
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:08,469
um and you know i'm constantly just thinking wow you know you should have studied that when you're

619
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:11,510
young you should have studied that when you're young like you know what do you what were you

620
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:17,289
thinking um and so you know i had a chance to go back and finish my law degree after many many years

621
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:24,309
you know only a few years ago and that was really a wonderful uh process of discovery um you know so

622
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:35,650
learning about the legal history of uh let's say um you know colonizers and largely white australia's

623
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:42,889
uh interaction with first nations and entrenched disadvantage intergenerational disadvantage and

624
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:50,349
trauma and how the law plays a part in that you know um community policing uh regulations laws

625
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:54,130
and others that means you know young indigenous kids in throughout history have been regularly

626
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,610
locked up families separated

627
00:38:55,670 --> 00:39:02,969
very very interesting um and just you know foundational it just changes your understanding

628
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:07,469
and so when you have conversations and people say well i just don't get it you know uh first

629
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:12,110
nations should just get on with it and do whatever it is so okay what about this you know what about

630
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:16,969
this so when you were you know i used to ride my bike around lismore all the time and not once did

631
00:39:16,969 --> 00:39:24,469
the police pull me up not once they never ever drove past me riding a beautiful melvin star i

632
00:39:24,469 --> 00:39:25,650
used to have the melvin star with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

633
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:31,289
little twinkles coming off the handlebars so did i it was blue and had a sparkly seat it was

634
00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:37,730
magnificent right they go past me multiple times i used to ride it to all my sport there was a lot

635
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:47,230
not once did they pull me up and say where'd you get that bike son not once and so that's called

636
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:52,809
privilege uh because of my color and because there's assumptions made about me that are not

637
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:55,650
made about indigenous kids yeah riding that same bike and i'm not going to be able to do that

638
00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:01,309
you know all that stuff's important so i i continue to try and learn as as much as possible

639
00:40:01,309 --> 00:40:06,590
like i said i you know i try to advocate on subjects and what that mean is that i'm forever

640
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:13,190
discovering how ignorant or ignorant i am on a vast range of subjects great we talk about

641
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:19,329
communicating with clarity as as a identifiable trait of of great leaders and i'm picturing you

642
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:25,150
walking into fifa headquarters in geneva one shot in the locker you've got uh your mate

643
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:31,630
you're brendan schwab and you need to get that communication very very right how do you think

644
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:37,730
about communicating with clarity again you know purpose is really important i say that truth is

645
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:44,690
at a premium because you know i see it every day when you're in social advocacy it's very difficult

646
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:50,170
to find people who are prepared to be truthful and see you know you said to me at the start you

647
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:55,650
know you go directly to the matter is because we're so we're so used to trying to

648
00:40:55,650 --> 00:41:00,869
skirt around what are really fundamentally important issues but people are very uncomfortable

649
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:07,130
with it business operates that way and so people are constantly trying not to uh you know put anyone

650
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:11,750
in a position of discomfort well if you're discomforted about racism you know what it's

651
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:16,730
just too bad right if you're discomforted about the planet burning that's not our responsibility

652
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:21,449
you know if you're discomforted about talking about australia's treatment of refugees

653
00:41:21,449 --> 00:41:24,369
because that makes you feel uncomfortable on some level

654
00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:25,630
so what do you think about that i think it's a really important issue and i think it's a really

655
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:30,210
the point is those people are being tortured those people are actually literally dying

656
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:35,030
either dead or they're dying inside they're dying psychologically their mental health

657
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:43,389
is slowly dying so you know to me it's all relative so for instance when you talk about

658
00:41:43,389 --> 00:41:51,889
real leadership i think 2021 has been very much marked in my life's calendar by women

659
00:41:51,889 --> 00:41:55,630
and i think this is a really important issue and i think it's a really important issue and i think

660
00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:02,269
it's been a defining year for women's rights and women's voice in australia and i'm so thrilled

661
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:10,210
by it i'm i am just enjoying it so much i can't tell you how much so grace tame become australian

662
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:17,730
of the year and she's strong and she's articulate and she's brilliant and she's not captured by the

663
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:25,530
government's adam goods was another one but it's very difficult to be given awards of the highest

664
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:31,409
level by a government and then turn around and say look i you know thank you for that but you're

665
00:42:31,409 --> 00:42:38,329
you need to be accountable on one two three four and five that is so outstanding she is uh because

666
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:44,269
she's made clear and it's obvious she's not like me she's not partisan in her public advocacy she's

667
00:42:44,269 --> 00:42:49,489
not doing it against the liberal national party she's working on principle she's saying this is

668
00:42:49,489 --> 00:42:54,889
what needs to happen and i don't care who's in power this is what you should be doing

669
00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:00,230
sport is like this as you know sport doesn't like to upset each other we don't like you know they

670
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:05,309
don't like to upset people running the sports and all these things um but ultimately when it comes

671
00:43:05,309 --> 00:43:11,510
to harm and when it comes to human rights uh you know that's where i draw the line i say okay it

672
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:17,809
doesn't matter that's more important than your sensibilities your discomfort level if we're

673
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:24,030
talking racial injustice it's just too bad now we're talking about collaboration craig is a real

674
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,630
key to modern leadership

675
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:32,349
how do you approach collaboration oh that's to me that's all it is you know like um you know so

676
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:39,050
for example um you know the hakim campaign or recently with the afghan women whatever it is

677
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:48,690
um nothing good happens by me you or anyone else uh just running off and being the most

678
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:53,329
extraordinary human being that's ever been seen it's just not it's just not reality uh

679
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:55,630
you know that's the why that's the narrative that

680
00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:01,690
people like to uh promote you know i must say when when hakim got back to the uh melbourne airport

681
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:06,710
and i think the first interview might have been i went on abc news breakfast and the first thing i

682
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:11,130
said to him is uh yeah because they said something i don't know you know this is incredible and you

683
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:15,550
ran off over there and i said yeah well i ran off over there that's true but this has been a huge

684
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:20,510
amount of people involved here in organizations and a extraordinary amount of work uh and you

685
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:25,469
know they're too long to mention but you know in the book they can all be mentioned but uh and it

686
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:28,349
You can't go and do something like that by yourself.

687
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,469
Like, you know, it's a ridiculous concept.

688
00:44:30,929 --> 00:44:34,730
To me, you know, let's say that you're a manager in an organisation

689
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:40,409
and one of the reasons that leadership is also at a premium is

690
00:44:40,409 --> 00:44:44,869
because the first thing that you need to do in a team is convince

691
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:46,269
the other people, and it has to be authentic,

692
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:49,110
but the people need to be convinced that you care about them

693
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:52,690
and that you're all going forward together in order

694
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,809
for you to do anything special.

695
00:44:53,809 --> 00:44:56,769
And so someone asked me the other day, well, in sport, of course,

696
00:44:56,789 --> 00:44:58,550
you have robust discussions because, you know,

697
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,909
we get judged every week.

698
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,349
You know, we don't have quarterly reviews.

699
00:45:01,429 --> 00:45:05,090
We have weekly reviews, you know, by fans, and that's totally right.

700
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,550
So, of course, you have to hold each other accountable

701
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:10,389
within the dressing room to create a really high-performing team.

702
00:45:10,469 --> 00:45:12,670
But the only way you can do that is if you trust each other.

703
00:45:12,769 --> 00:45:13,329
Well, what's trust?

704
00:45:13,409 --> 00:45:17,190
Trust is that I actually care about you and I want you to perform well.

705
00:45:17,329 --> 00:45:20,489
I want you, you know, I want you to be the best you can be.

706
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:23,210
But in order to do that, you have to allow me to do it

707
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:23,489
and him.

708
00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:28,849
And we're going to create a set of ground rules here

709
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:31,010
that are respectful and so we can all make that happen

710
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,750
and we're all going to be held accountable,

711
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,050
but it's actually about all of us.

712
00:45:35,889 --> 00:45:39,309
And that to me is, that's what life should be.

713
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:45,789
But, you know, it's sadly rare because people get rewards

714
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:49,889
for being in positions of, you know, we would call authority.

715
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,929
I always look at the way, you know, let's take, for instance,

716
00:45:52,929 --> 00:45:53,530
the AFL.

717
00:45:53,809 --> 00:45:58,210
In my game, Football Australia, people often get upset

718
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:03,570
because I say a governing body of sport is under the sport.

719
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:06,710
They're to serve the game effectively is the role, isn't it?

720
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:07,289
That's the role.

721
00:46:07,449 --> 00:46:10,429
And we draw the pyramid like this and we put the governing body

722
00:46:10,429 --> 00:46:10,989
at the top.

723
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,090
That's totally wrong.

724
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:13,690
They're the players.

725
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:19,670
You are employed to help them play and your job is to serve them.

726
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,809
And I think that's the first thing that all of governing bodies

727
00:46:22,809 --> 00:46:23,789
in sport should do.

728
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:27,550
Because in FIFA, you know, there's private jets and they go around

729
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:30,869
and, you know, million, million euros spent on hotel.

730
00:46:30,969 --> 00:46:31,989
Like, it's just ridiculous.

731
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:33,269
Okay, it's ridiculous.

732
00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:35,170
That to me is what leadership is.

733
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:35,849
You have a team.

734
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:37,829
You might have a team of 25 people in your company.

735
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:38,469
Do you know what?

736
00:46:38,889 --> 00:46:41,429
You have ultimate responsibility and you're accountable.

737
00:46:41,889 --> 00:46:45,449
But your job is to hold them up, let them do the best they can possibly do

738
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:47,510
and give them all the credit in the world.

739
00:46:47,949 --> 00:46:49,349
I think you've burst my bubble today, Craig,

740
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,849
to think that the FIFA Ethics Committee has got some challenges.

741
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:53,289
I find that hard to believe.

742
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:56,750
The FIFA Ethics Committee, it's almost the butt of every joke, isn't it?

743
00:46:56,789 --> 00:46:58,969
Go to the FIFA Ethics Committee and the same in all sport.

744
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,429
And you're right, the bureaucracy becomes bigger than the game itself

745
00:47:01,429 --> 00:47:03,630
as opposed to serving the game.

746
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:05,630
And I align with your thoughts.

747
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,050
And I've got two final questions, Craig.

748
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:09,670
I could spend all day with you because I'm fascinated

749
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,829
by the way you approach life.

750
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:13,929
But I've been asking great leaders like you,

751
00:47:14,329 --> 00:47:16,269
who is the greatest leader in your life?

752
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:18,710
Oh, my wife.

753
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:19,849
My wife.

754
00:47:19,989 --> 00:47:20,670
And I have many.

755
00:47:20,809 --> 00:47:21,809
I have many, many, many.

756
00:47:21,809 --> 00:47:22,429
You know what?

757
00:47:22,489 --> 00:47:23,250
Most of them are women.

758
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:27,969
But the strongest, most, overwhelmingly, not all, of course,

759
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:36,070
but overwhelmingly the strongest, most courageous people that I know,

760
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:39,289
and whether that's heads of human rights organisations,

761
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:43,150
you know, my own family, my own mother and my own wife

762
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:49,510
and many people in business, you know, Sam Mostyn, for example,

763
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:52,610
is a good friend of mine, Kylie Kwong, Rosanna Barbera,

764
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,610
who runs the Addison Road Community Centre,

765
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:56,289
which I love and spend a lot of time at.

766
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:59,909
So many of them, they're leaders.

767
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:01,949
For you and I, it's easy.

768
00:48:02,289 --> 00:48:02,789
It's easy.

769
00:48:02,909 --> 00:48:05,650
We are in a society that respects our voice.

770
00:48:06,269 --> 00:48:06,449
Okay?

771
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:11,750
So, you know, I get on Zooms these days and I say to all the men in a room

772
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,610
where women are, and hopefully there's an equal number.

773
00:48:14,889 --> 00:48:15,590
It's not always the case.

774
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:20,309
Listen, when you feel compelled to say something,

775
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:21,809
can you please use the text?

776
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:23,570
Use the message.

777
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:24,750
I can see it.

778
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:26,570
And just, you know, send me messages.

779
00:48:27,329 --> 00:48:31,369
However, if the women want to interject and have something compelling to say,

780
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:33,969
please just put up your hand or you just interrupt me.

781
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:34,389
Right?

782
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:37,130
And, you know, and people get upset.

783
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,469
I say, no, that's equity.

784
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:45,010
Equity is a rebalancing of a situation that is unbalanced.

785
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:51,010
That means that it's not enough to just have 50% women and 50% male

786
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:51,690
on a call.

787
00:48:51,789 --> 00:48:51,989
Okay?

788
00:48:51,989 --> 00:48:52,050
Okay.

789
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:52,070
Okay.

790
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:52,090
Okay.

791
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:52,150
Okay.

792
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:52,170
Okay.

793
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:52,190
Okay.

794
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:52,590

Okay.

849
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:10,510
Okay.

850
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:16,409
is valid my opinion is valid and i just believe that inherently because every feedback that we've

851
00:49:16,409 --> 00:49:22,050
had as a man uh particularly white males in australia of course that tells us that whereas

852
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:28,929
women are not the same they have not been provided with that feedback by males and particularly in

853
00:49:28,929 --> 00:49:35,530
corporate and even sport environments so in other words let's rebalance you know this scenario um

854
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:41,949
and you know that that those types of things to me uh very very important yeah looking at through

855
00:49:41,949 --> 00:49:46,469
the lens of our own daughters and our own uh partners is a pretty profound way to do it if

856
00:49:46,469 --> 00:49:52,309
you're challenged by it think about uh your own home front uh it's again not surprised that they're

857
00:49:52,309 --> 00:49:57,369
the way you approach the things that are going on in your world um collaboration is something

858
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:02,130
we're passionate about if you could collaborate with any person craig in the world on any level

859
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:05,510
on any issue is there someone that stands out that you'd like to collaborate

860
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:15,550
with um i would like to i would like to change what's happening on climate and race and human

861
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:22,869
rights so that's a big ask um but to do that i think that the way the world is at the moment

862
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:31,190
the most space the most voice uh the most power the most influence is given to the richest

863
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:35,389
that's what the world has decided is of most value now

864
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:40,809
i happen to disagree with that but that is what you know certainly western society anyway or i

865
00:50:40,809 --> 00:50:45,389
would say the vast majority of the world uh they have access they have power they have influence

866
00:50:45,389 --> 00:50:52,369
they have voice uh and therefore they can make very significant change so i would like to

867
00:50:52,369 --> 00:50:57,309
have a group of them actually not one but i would like to convince them

868
00:50:57,309 --> 00:51:05,309
that there is a better way for everyone in the world and that the use of the resources they have

869
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:14,949
should be far more humanely and better deployed and i think by doing that uh we could

870
00:51:14,949 --> 00:51:20,570
change the world very quickly so you're talking about getting the elite wealthy together to

871
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:26,110
collaborate with is that what you're saying or is it is yeah and convincing them that the

872
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:29,530
center and that is one of the great issues isn't at the moment is that the separation of wealth is

873
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:35,150
becoming just obscene effectively yeah and you'd like to yeah yeah so i'd like to convince them

874
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:41,309
that um you know taxation that we all contribute to you know the global commons and the national

875
00:51:41,309 --> 00:51:48,369
commons that it's actually important uh and that companies shouldn't be taking uh you know um a

876
00:51:48,369 --> 00:51:53,489
job keeper and then not having to use it you know and keeping it and these types of things you know

877
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:57,550
i think there's there's all of those discussions are very important so i think that's a very good

878
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:05,150
step forward and i'd like to convince many of them uh that they should do much much more profound

879
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:10,750
