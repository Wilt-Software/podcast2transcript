1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:12,830
What inspires a 19-year-old first-year uni student to be brave enough to take on the

2
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,429
challenge of ending extreme poverty across the world?

3
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:21,129
Despite embarking on a quest for good in the social venture space, what mindset allows

4
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:25,530
you to deal with the inevitable tall poppy syndrome that comes with wanting to change

5
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:25,910
the world?

6
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,829
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,649
The idea of self-improvement and leadership, both on and off the field, has been a lifelong

8
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:35,490
passion of mine.

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,549
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective, and I've had the privilege

10
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:45,090
of working with thousands of leaders in education, sport, industry, and the arts that have helped

11
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,750
shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership, where everyone has a voice.

12
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:54,329
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

13
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,659
At the age of 19, Daniel Flynn discovered the alarming fact that over 900 million people

14
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:18,260
around the world did not have access to safe drinking water, and yet Australians spent

15
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,200
$600 million.

16
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:20,959
on bottled water each year.

17
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:22,400
That was back in 2008.

18
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,959
On the back of this, Daniel founded Thank You Water, a social enterprise that empowered

19
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:32,019
Australians to fund safe water projects in developing nations through the sale of bottled

20
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:32,379
water.

21
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,019
Thank You Water expanded into the Thank You Group with over 50 products, taking on the

22
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:40,780
biggest retailers in the world in food, baby care, and hygiene.

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,159
100% of the profits are directed to Daniel's vision of funding an end to extreme poverty

24
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:46,840
in the world.

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,120
It's a remarkable story of leadership.

26
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:51,340
And Daniel Flynn's been good enough to join me.

27
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,239
Nice to speak to you, Dan.

28
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,280
Hey, Luke.

29
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,120
Thanks for having me on.

30
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,780
At 19 years of age, Dan, I think most of us were sort of struggling to organize school

31
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,939
these week and sort our lives out.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,659
You were taking on extreme poverty around the world.

33
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:06,400
It was an incredible vision at that age.

34
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,939
Where did that sense of purpose come from for you at such a young age?

35
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,979
I mean, it's a bit of a funny story because I think I was the kid at school running around

36
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:15,659
like trying to sell everything.

37
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:18,599
You know, I was like selling whatever was on trend.

38
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,199
I was that.

39
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,080
I had, you know, car washing business and all these little things I think people would

40
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,259
sort of describe as entrepreneurial ventures, you know, that.

41
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,139
So I was, I don't even know why, but I was locked onto this idea of making money.

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,300
And that's, you know, that would be success.

43
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,539
And, you know, so come 19, I wasn't thinking a whole lot about extreme poverty, but I was

44
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:46,819
thinking a whole lot about money and, you know, and investing and in particular property

45
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:47,699
and property development.

46
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:48,479
And I was studying.

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,000
In property development specifically.

48
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,360
So that's kind of me.

49
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,819
I had a moment at 19 that was a good shake up.

50
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,219
And it probably leans on a few things that came through from my parents.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,139
I had sponsored a child through World Vision, which, you know, I think, you know, it's not

52
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:11,400
a bad effort, you know, by 19 and full transparency, it wasn't all me.

53
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,099
I think four friends, we all chipped in.

54
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:18,759
So it was kind of a bit of a joint, but then I had this, this moment where I was watching

55
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,139
stories on my computer.

56
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:24,460
And those that have heard me share the story before, I see it as a bit of a Genesis moment

57
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:30,759
where I was watching extreme poverty, you know, through a screen, but it still felt

58
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,759
so shocking.

59
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,960
And hearing the kids were dying every day from waterborne disease, hearing the numbers

60
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,979
and how big they were, to me, it felt very, very wrong, maybe because I had my head in

61
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:44,699
investing and in, you know, global markets.

62
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:47,439
It's like, wow, I kind of know we are very developed.

63
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:48,699
But then also,

64
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:49,699
we're not.

65
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,699
And that for me was a real wrestle.

66
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:59,439
I was dating shortly after this, my girlfriend, Justine, and now my wife and co-founder, thank

67
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,439
you.

68
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:04,580
Her story is interesting because she loved business, but she was the real deal.

69
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,819
She traveled to developing countries from like 12.

70
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:14,520
She saved up money from bake sales, literally went overseas to Indonesia, stayed with people

71
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
in community.

72
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,879
I remember hearing her story, I'm thinking I would never do that in my teenage years.

73
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:18,879
But that was her.

74
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:29,100
And so, so when we got talking about this idea of extreme poverty and extreme wealth,

75
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,420
kind of in the same world.

76
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:38,379
Her, and I think I Jared, you know, we'd been best mates at school, and we'd, I mean, we

77
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:45,600
just, we just couldn't unsee the gap and also the idea, the idea of what if, what if there

78
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:45,879
was a brand that kind of was a bridge between, you know, the financial world and the financial

79
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,879
world.

80
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:52,060
was a bridge between, you know, our world's two extremes. And so I think we're driven by mission

81
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:58,500
and the cause and then also vision. You know, when you see a picture and you can't unsee it,

82
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,720
you just, you want to chase it. That was that feeling at 19. Yeah. I want to speak to you about

83
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,199
Justine and the fact you've got two kids and that life partnership and partnership in this social

84
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:13,540
venture as well. I'm always fascinated by the dynamics of how that works, but you mentioned

85
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,519
numbers and you can see that your brain works in numbers and there's a brilliant simplicity in the

86
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:23,560
way you explain what is a global problem that no one's been able to solve. And your idea,

87
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:28,199
as you said, of combining, you know, extreme poverty, 736 million people around the world

88
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,360
are your numbers, you know, with extreme consumerism. And I know it's $63 trillion a

89
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,220
year spent in consumer products. You know, you read the thankyou.co website, the simplicity in

90
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,519
that. But in reality, when you go to tackle this, you're now going to take on the

91
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:48,480
biggest companies, the biggest retailers in the world. When you reflect back, that's the way the

92
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:55,199
complexity kicks in. When you reflect back on 2008, what do you think? Well, I loved how

93
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,000
young and naive we were to how the system in the world really works, you know, and we've fought to

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,120
keep that, I suppose you could call it the child, childlike thinking. And actually having a kid

95
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,920
has reminded me, Jed, who's five, the other day was like, dad, I think thankyou needs to be more

96
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,339
relevant.

97
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,800
For the children. He's like, we wash our hands and stuff in our bodies. But I think you need

98
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,220
thankyou toys. Because, you know, thankyou has got to be fun. And I'm just like, I love it, man.

99
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:30,480
Like, that is, that's the heartbeat of this mission. You said it, it's simple. It's one

100
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,660
world, two extremes. And imagine together, if we could combine them and have this consumerism,

101
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,240
which is always going to exist, but if that could serve the end of this injustice, and

102
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,500
I mean, in 2008, we just

103
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:49,939
believed we could. And we have since learned, and really, it's been a 14-year learning curve

104
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:56,480
of the complexities of business, the absolute challenge of taking on really, really, really big

105
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:03,500
and, you know, good businesses. And it turns out that, yes, this idea is simple. And pretty much

106
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:09,139
most people you meet think it should exist. But there's a huge gap between that and actually

107
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:13,360
cutting into the real world and building a sustainable business that you can give profit away.

108
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,939
You are the CEO and the co-founder, as you mentioned, with your childhood friends and now

109
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:24,759
wife and mother of the two children, the social venture, which is taking on the biggest possible

110
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:30,160
vision. Have you been able to reflect on the type of leader that you are and what your strengths are?

111
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,480
Yeah, I mean, I definitely have had time to reflect. You know, we're not one year in.

112
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:41,240
We're sort of, we've gone on a lot of different life cycles that businesses go on from the

113
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,500
scrappy startup, kind of mature.

114
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:49,620
into you know a more established business with scale and then we definitely evolved into the

115
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:55,040
too many systems too risk adverse the kind of stuff you read about that can kind of end

116
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,860
companies when when they become kind of stale we got there as well and then we got back

117
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,339
to kind of the startup years which is where we find ourselves now and it's a real sweet spot

118
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:12,040
but i look at myself as a leader on that journey and yeah i mean i'd love to say it was all good

119
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:20,240
but it like i see a story of a pretty insecure you know individual trying to figure out not just

120
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:28,079
a big bold vision but myself you know and and that has been a big journey um you know and i think

121
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:34,639
if i look back and and say what what marked some of the early years of me as a leader yes i was

122
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:41,000
absolutely bold ambitious but i mean i also was probably trying to please everyone

123
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:48,179
in leadership doesn't really work um i mean you can be popular for a bit but in terms of getting

124
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:53,580
progress it's it's super challenging and so i think the leader i've evolved into now is very

125
00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:00,980
different to the one you would have met five years ago or 10 years ago um and and now you know i i've

126
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:09,159
still got some some way to go but for me um i see my role as not just casting bold vision of hey

127
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:12,019
here's where i think we could go um but helping people to be able to do what they want to do

128
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:18,200
people see how we could get there so the actual plan but then how they could help us get there too

129
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,799
um and and showing people the part they play and and i know my role in that is

130
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:30,679
is you know serves a funny word not thrown around probably enough but it becomes like how do i you

131
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:37,340
know how do i help serve a team and not just have a team serve a leader um to to kind of use it in

132
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,019
in that flip and um i've learned a lot about this one word

133
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:49,039
humility and and the market keeps you humble and you can have these sort of you know high moments

134
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:54,659
and awards on stages and we've had a lot of different things happen in a lot of amazing

135
00:09:54,659 --> 00:10:00,700
ways but i've i think i've learned that this is a long game and so that that long road of humility

136
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:07,980
being willing to learn listen um you know and and work really hard in that process i think these

137
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,519
things kind of mark me now and in the early days it may have looked a bit different

138
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:17,200
language you speak is is the language we're really passionate about that dan a lot of the

139
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,340
leaders are exactly as you said self-reflective constantly wanting to learn you know enjoy the

140
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,519
fact that life is this you know improvement journey from 19 to now and you would expect

141
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:31,419
to have evolved along the way but humility comes up in in all the conversations of this community

142
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:36,899
of leaders that really have a sense of purpose like you do and so i'm not surprised that you

143
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,899
what you're doing is is ultimate humility we haven't even spoken about the incredible

144
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:42,019
achievements yet and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and

145
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:46,659
and they are many i mean we could spend five hours talking about the disruption i want to ask you that

146
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:52,679
i might jump into that uh now i mean what you did if you could retell that story of uh of really

147
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:58,100
getting your product into the big retailers coles and woolworth 70 market share you know you were

148
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,899
told as you have been many times along your journey and this is not going to happen it won't

149
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:06,240
work you're not going to be able to do it but can you share that story and and and where the idea

150
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,000
came from because it's it's genius yeah look and i think this story um you know which which

151
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:17,340
we call the coles and woolworths campaign this kicked in kind of year five um and so you got

152
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,860
to understand the background to this was a lot of no's and a lot of setbacks and we tried to solve

153
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:30,080
them right now our biggest challenge if i could sum it up it was getting this idea that again

154
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,899
most people would say that's cool product that exists all for extreme poverty as long as the

155
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:39,759
product's good i'd buy it getting that into the real world and one of the things about getting

156
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,460
into the real world is getting mainstream retailers on board and that's where we found

157
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:49,080
our problem for five years we had a series of no's but also other people take probably the

158
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,340
idea we shared and do it themselves and a whole bunch of different scenarios and we got to this

159
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:58,639
point where we launched a video and it was a pretty bold call but we said to our community

160
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,940
of supporters which at the time was i think like 20 000 people on facebook so not small

161
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,840
but after five years it didn't feel as big as maybe it we'd hoped it would be

162
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:09,740
but we

163
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:15,500
said hey everybody two weeks from today we're presenting thank you water and new products we've

164
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,679
developed a personal care range a hand wash and body wash and a food range and we're presenting

165
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:25,519
it to coles and woolworths and for five years they have said no but uh in two weeks time we're

166
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,559
wanting you to come with us to the meeting and tell them that if they stocked it you'd buy it

167
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:35,600
and so we asked people to upload a video or a post uh directly onto the coles and woolies facebook

168
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,740
page and it was controversial but it meant it worked i mean people were like oh my god

169
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:46,220
people recorded videos i think in the first 10 minutes or something we just saw hundreds and

170
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:52,259
hundreds of posts on their page uh koshi from sunrise was a legend they'd covered a uh thank

171
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:57,879
you before but he kind of put his support behind it and then more people put their support behind

172
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:04,220
it and we ended up having you know people singing dancing and rapping and and then two helicopter

173
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,259
pilots which is one of our favorite parts flew helicopters above the coles and woolworths head

174
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:09,720
office um and then we ended up having you know people singing dancing and rapping and and then

175
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:15,500
so they carried these 30 000 square foot signs dear coles dear bullies thank you for changing

176
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,919
the world in brackets if you say yes because we hadn't met them yet um for this sort of big

177
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:27,059
official meeting and so these literally circled with the head office um and yeah i mean the

178
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:32,379
message got through loud and clear and when we walked into those meetings they were a little

179
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:39,620
bit tense we had definitely stepped outside of convention and people made that clear you know

180
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:46,860
it was said excuse me that we had made some people's jobs quite difficult um but you know

181
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:54,659
on a personal note uh one particular person summed it up well for me he said well done like yeah it's

182
00:13:54,659 --> 00:14:00,279
gonna make our lives hard um and and and coles agreed to arrange the products five hours after

183
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:05,179
the meeting in woolworths for three hours later but he said hey on a personal note i i just i

184
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:09,279
think you did what you needed to do to stand out and we'd gone for five years and we had

185
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,919
is telling people, this is the vision, this is the mission, it's going to change the world, and we

186
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:20,460
really believe people will back it. We added the people backing it in, literally, thanks to the

187
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:26,440
internet, social media, and it led to, well, one of the fastest product launches in this country,

188
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,240
and today, you know, a market-leading brand and millions of dollars to impact, so.

189
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:37,639
Amazing story, an amazing story of leadership, the power of the people. I didn't realize,

190
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:43,440
I would have estimated your community was maybe 10 times that of a 20,000 on Facebook. Given the

191
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,419
attention it got, it felt like you had a much, much bigger following the noise that you made.

192
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:52,240
There's so many parts of that I love, but, you know, the big multinationals have got so many

193
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,799
ways to say, no, this is a commercial decision, shelf space not available, you know, multinational

194
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:02,600
companies pay for this, so we can't give that. I mean, there's so many ways that they can do that,

195
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,440
and they're reasonable, you know, they exist for shareholders, I mean, effectively.

196
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:12,139
You've shown a way that says, well, actually, it can happen. It is possible. Maybe you made a few

197
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:16,899
people's jobs a little bit harder, but in the end, you've opened up this path, and I'm going to jump

198
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:21,759
ahead because, you know, reading the thank you story in preparation for this today, it looks

199
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:27,460
like you're going to try and take on even bigger fish than that, and are we able to jump to there?

200
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,500
I mean, Procter & Gamble and Unilever are, the scale of them is almost impossible to understand

201
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,940
just how big and how far their reach is, and I mean, is that,

202
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,480
the international model is to try and see if you can get access to them, and obviously,

203
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:46,980
we might talk about the licensing story that's coming up, but what's the plan? Is it replicating

204
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,200
what you did and trying to do that globally? For those that have followed along, there are

205
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:57,820
definitely similarities from some of the past things we've done, but I think we've gone on a

206
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:04,419
journey from that Coles & Willis campaign in 2013 to literally, well, 2020 is when we launched this

207
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:07,620
call out to P&G and Unilever, and I'll give some context to it, but I think it's a really, really

208
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:07,940
long journey, and I think it's a really, really long journey, and I think it's a really, really

209
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:13,220
But in that journey, we went of seven years of listening and learning, and that is sort of

210
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,639
often not seen when you get the highlights, reels of a company, but we went on this really hard

211
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,659
journey, and we got into the big business, and we did, we had the number one hand wash for five

212
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:27,539
years. We then launched into the baby category. We had 10% market share in the first three months.

213
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:34,879
That was our best launch. It was industry, it was incredible, but it also, we went from off the radar

214
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,600
to 100% on the radar of, you know, we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this,

215
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:45,500
of big business, and, you know, it is hard for, I think, consumers to understand the scale of

216
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:51,419
some of these multinationals. They do, you know, run the world is a, it's a fair call. I mean,

217
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,840
they have, you know, Unilever's got 400 brands under their portfolio, and the average person

218
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,399
may not have heard of Unilever, but they may know of Dove, and Streets Ice Cream, and a whole bunch

219
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:07,279
of brands within their portfolio. So, we competed against a lot of big companies, and it is

220
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:07,599
challenging.

221
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:15,059
But they have a job to do, and it is to, you know, and they do that well. After seven years of the

222
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:21,640
battle, we did something that I think every leader has to do. In fact, Simon Sinek talks about this

223
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,160
idea of an existential shift. He says you can, and I'm paraphrasing, Simon Sinek would say this way

224
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:34,500
better, but he says something along the lines of, you can take a 180 degree turn as a leader,

225
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,380
as an organization, if it helps you.

226
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:44,420
And we sat back, and we said, hang on a second. We're competing against, you know, 10, 11, 12 of

227
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:49,099
the biggest companies in the world, and a whole bunch of other medium-sized local players. We have

228
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:54,559
absolute global ambition for thank you. But now most of these companies are talking about purpose.

229
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:58,000
They're talking about how they're going to change the world, and they are changing the world.

230
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,119
And hats off to them. We'd watched them for over a decade and thought,

231
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:06,960
that is some cool stuff they are doing. So, that led us to this hypothesis of what if instead of

232
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:13,160
competing against them as we take thank you to the world, what if we invite one of them to make and

233
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,819
distribute our hand wash products? What if we invite another to make and distribute the food?

234
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,880
And, you know, we started to play that out, and we thought, well, they've already got the factories

235
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,440
and the supply chains. They're trying to replicate essentially purpose, and what we do, we're trying

236
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:34,460
to replicate them, you know, global capability. Hey, let's work together. Now, the key ingredient

237
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,700
in our view would be you just couldn't own thank you.

238
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:42,740
It can be a commercial relationship, and yes, you can make money in the process because we pay

239
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,480
factories now, we pay trucks, we pay warehousing. So, there's money to be made, but it's not an

240
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,599
ownership story. We knew that would be the sticking point, but in 2020, we launched No Small Plan,

241
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:58,359
and it was bold. It was a video. It got a couple of million views. I think, in fact, the video

242
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:04,259
helped us get 840 media features in 38 countries, which was pretty cool for us.

243
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:06,680
You know, since we launched it in lockdown,

244
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,000
in a garage in Melbourne. So, we were pretty stoked about that, but the campaign was a simple

245
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,400
call out to Unilever and Procter & Gamble. They are the two biggest. In the video, we also invite

246
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,980
nine others, and we don't name them, but essentially, we invited the biggest companies

247
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:29,740
in the world, and we said, this is an invitation to change the world together. And a critic would

248
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:36,920
say, hang on, you're David taking on Goliath. Why are you joining Goliath? And the way we went on,

249
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:43,720
this seven-year journey was, these big companies aren't Goliath. What you talked about at the start,

250
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:49,000
Luke, extreme poverty and extreme consumerism, that's Goliath. Maybe we need some big partners

251
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,980
to help us become a bigger David, right? Take on the real. And so, as leaders, I suppose we

252
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:59,299
humbly went, what if we can't do it all ourselves? And what if we found others who were aligned on

253
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:04,940
that mission? And together, we made an even bigger impact. This is not about a cool little social

254
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,900
brand. This is not about founder. This is not about founder. This is not about founder. This is not about

255
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,160
getting credit. This is about a mission. And so, to us, this became a great way forward.

256
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:18,519
And in 2020, we invited them boldly. They got some one-and-a-half-meter wooden crates delivered to

257
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:23,359
their head office in these 26-foot glass trucks. And so, one went to London, one went to Cincinnati.

258
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,640
We were very bold. And in that was an agreement that some of the, I don't know, best minds in

259
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,299
partnerships around the world, I think, helped form. And it's an agreement that isn't about

260
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,519
ownership. It borrows on this phrase,

261
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,980
licensing, which Disney and Virgin and a heap of really successful brands use.

262
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:49,359
And so, we invited them to join us. Now, I'll tell you, that was 18 months ago. It has been

263
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:55,319
a roller coaster of a ride, as we've met with not just two, but some of the nine others and

264
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:59,160
other companies came forward saying, hey, what about us? And so, we've literally for 18 months

265
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:06,160
been meeting with companies all around the world, thankfully via Zoom, but trying to find who's the

266
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,559
partner.

267
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:14,240
And whilst we have no public announcements, it's been very clear, there is definitely a group that

268
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,059
would fit in the bucket of, I think, yesterday's businesses, which is, we can't change what we do

269
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:26,619
at all, because the boxes must be ticked. And then there's others going, the way the world is

270
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:34,579
doesn't work. And if we reshape that, there's a win-win for shareholders, sure, but for humanity,

271
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:36,440
and that's the bit we're interested in.

272
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:43,519
So, as you can imagine, the first group, we may have not gelled with the second group we have,

273
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,140
and there's many companies in that group, and we're working through those details.

274
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:54,759
But look, we haven't changed our ambition. It's global product, and it's globally available. We're

275
00:21:54,759 --> 00:22:01,500
just thinking, what's the fastest way to impact and take the 17 million raised into hundreds of

276
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,039
millions raised very soon. So, that's the current mission we're on, and it's a work in progress.

277
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:06,900
It's not done yet.

278
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:13,400
And I love the thinking behind it, Dan. It's incredible. And I like to think that maybe,

279
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:19,259
you mentioned now companies are really trying to find a sense of purpose. Manufacturing on purpose

280
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:23,900
is potentially the new currency now for businesses. And I think you had a huge impact on that. And I

281
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,200
think, thank you, and your story maybe embarrassed some companies into it. And I realized that you're

282
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,680
100% for profit with a social venture and giving back, and that they worked out perhaps there was

283
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,900
commercial opportunity. And I think that's a great thing. And I think that's a great thing.

284
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:36,960
And I think that's a great thing. And I think that's a great thing. And I think that's a great thing.

285
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,039
And I think that's a great thing. And I think that's a great thing. And I think that's a great thing.

286
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,420
And success in that. So, I totally love where you're going in trying to extend that reach. And it

287
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:49,480
makes sense to find the synergy to do good, which you've done from the age of 19 and all the way

288
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:55,339
through. So, jumping back around again, Dan, it started, as you said, as a vision as a 19-year-old,

289
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,380
this vision to try and end extreme poverty. You started it with your then-girlfriend,

290
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:06,700
and you have two kids. Tell me about the dynamics and the rollercoaster of taking on something as

291
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:11,099
big as this, achieving what you've achieved, but finding the balance in family life as well.

292
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:17,920
Have you managed that? Yeah. Look, it's been a wrestling journey. I think in many ways,

293
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,259
it's been incredibly powerful because Jussie and I were dating. That was pretty high risk

294
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:34,019
in startup days, but now married. But we're aligned in the vision of where we see this going.

295
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:40,200
And so, I think on those longer days, on those harder seasons that we've walked through,

296
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:46,539
we both really knew why. And so, there's that incredible alignment and passion, and it's shared.

297
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:53,180
It's a real shared vision. And we still have that to this day. The challenge, though, is that

298
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:58,259
when you're really passionate about something, it can kind of eat into everything. I mean,

299
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:03,180
you would have found this with sport. I mean, I think every leader struggles with it.

300
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:10,839
Like, yes, the work required is there. There's no two ways about it. And that can eat in if

301
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:15,799
you're not careful. But the passion, it sometimes pushes you a bit further. And you end up saying

302
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:23,039
yes to a whole bunch of stuff that's kind of on your mission, but you're not realizing you're

303
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:30,099
saying no to family time or no to a date night. And I'd never call Justine and say,

304
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:33,940
hey, babe, I just want to call you to say no. No, we're not.

305
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,480
I'm not going to date next week. I'm not going to do that. That's a weird phone call.

306
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,740
But that's actually what I was doing by committing to a talk or this or this trip or this really

307
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:50,079
important must-be-in-person thing. And so, we started to learn and thankfully had some really

308
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:54,660
great mentors and people around us. One mentor summed it up beautifully when he said, when you

309
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,680
say yes to something, you are saying no to something else. And it's a real critical

310
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:03,839
look at your yeses and your nos. And so, I had to go from the yes guy

311
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:10,559
to basically the no guy. And I would say we've carried that forward. So, in terms of boundaries,

312
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:17,700
we've just built in rhythms. And I'm not a super rhythm or planned guy. I'm more spontaneous.

313
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,099
Justine is too, but she's become, since having kids, a lot more planned. But I've actually

314
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:30,180
seen the benefit of really good planning. Like there is one day a week, Sunday, sometimes a

315
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,799
Saturday, but one day every week where there is no work.

316
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:39,700
No emails, no calls, no event could get on that day. We don't even say the T word,

317
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:47,240
thank you, in a work context. We'd say it to be polite. But it's like we really try and have a

318
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:54,480
24-hour period to reset the mind. We have other practices that we've built in the moment. This

319
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,779
has been helpful for us, but we have a morning each. So, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, she's Tuesday,

320
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,759
Thursday, Saturday. This is her idea. It's brilliant. But that's our own

321
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:03,920
morning. We have a morning each. So, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, she's Tuesday, Thursday,

322
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,839
and we don't have to look after the kids. So, the other one will look after the kids. And so,

323
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,640
you wake up, you might get up early and you know, hey, between now and like eight o'clock,

324
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:16,740
I've got time, clear my head, read, exercise or whatever, catch up with someone.

325
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:24,039
And these little rhythms, date nights locked in, these things seem trivial, but

326
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:27,539
they're in the diary and they make a massive difference.

327
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:33,500
Yeah. It's system-based, isn't it? It's fascinating to hear you talk along those lines,

328
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,720
and systems have given you incredible success in the social venture space, and you've done

329
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,359
amazing things on that. But a lot of people don't apply that same thinking to their home life,

330
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:47,259
and it diminishes, I think, your opportunity for happiness. You mentioned Simon Sinek before,

331
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:52,579
read a lot of his stuff around just what are the things you do day-to-day that allow you to be

332
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:59,319
happier and improve that journey. I mean, you mentioned the yes-go to the no-go. I mean,

333
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:03,480
some of the things that you've said yes to are incredible. When you're in a relationship,

334
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,759
when the former President Obama rings and says, I'd like to interview you, Dan, that's a yes.

335
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,660
Keynote speech in front of 30,000 people in jail. You've done some amazing things. Has there been

336
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:19,240
one moment, and maybe I just summed two of them up, where you've gone, wow, this is big?

337
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,220
Yeah, there's, I mean, there were big ones. That President Obama thing was at a whole

338
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:33,259
another level. I think the funny thing is we didn't know about it. So all we knew,

339
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:37,799
the Obama Foundation were hosting their kind of post-presidency. It was like a launch of their

340
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:42,440
foundation or a relaunch. And we had this invitation for me to go and sit in the audience.

341
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:50,579
And that's a huge honor, but it was very like, oh, five days plus travel, you know, and from the

342
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:55,000
whole yes-no thing, like it was a big call. The business needed, I needed to be here, family.

343
00:27:55,619 --> 00:28:00,539
But there was this part in Bojassi and I where we felt that peaceful, like, just do it. Like,

344
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:02,799
you don't know what, who knows? Who knows?

345
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:06,319
Who you'll meet. You know, everyone's like, you should get a selfie. When do you get there

346
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,039
with the president? I'm like, yeah, I'm sure everyone's got that idea. And so we get to this

347
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:15,319
event and I had, you know, I'm queuing up for registration. These two girls came up who were

348
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:18,960
organized and they said, Daniel, are you Daniel? Yeah, yeah. So she didn't get back to her email.

349
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,980
And overnight they'd written an email, I was jet lagged, saying President Obama has asked if he

350
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:28,920
could interview you on the live stream. And so in that moment, in that queue, I was like,

351
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:31,480
oh man, oh man.

352
00:28:33,259 --> 00:28:39,119
And then I found out stuff later, like apparently this summit, 20,000 young people had applied to go,

353
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,039
500 were selected. We'd never applied. So it was sort of, I think we were the token Aussies,

354
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:49,720
but it was a huge honor to be there. And then hearing all of this and then that interview was

355
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,859
like made a little more stressful by the secret service locking the room down. And it was like

356
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:02,319
a movie. And I was, it was one of those moments of, you know, like I would have been fine with

357
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:07,920
a selfie, but he's asking Daniel, you know, this is amazing. When's thank you coming to like the

358
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,839
world? Like this should be everywhere. I'm thinking, yeah, it should like, this is, you know,

359
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:21,279
and so that was a moment of, oh, okay. This, this is, well, we'd never planned for that or thought

360
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:26,740
this, yeah, success would be a president. It's more like in our heart, we'd hoped that everyone

361
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:32,299
would get on board with this idea. And so that was a great glimmer. And so that was cool.

362
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:39,079
I think there are many moments though, that are just pinch, pinch me moments. And so yes,

363
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:43,200
there's that, but I remember doing a school's tour in New Zealand and there was like 10,000

364
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,059
young people, but through kind of different cities and hearing some of their stories at the events.

365
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,579
And then later from like what they went on to do or want to do, because they heard some stuff we

366
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:59,359
thought about it. It's like, whoa, okay. These things we didn't plan for. We thought we're

367
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,140
going to help sell product, make the profit and make an impact.

368
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:07,140
And you hear about these other things kind of flow on. And yeah, man, I do think there's five

369
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:13,819
hours in it of highlights, but then equally there's five hours of moments that are just

370
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:18,559
pretty rough too. And I think every leader resonates with that, that reality.

371
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,720
And Daniel, I might, I might touch on that because that's the reality of life, isn't it? You know,

372
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:27,160
the extraordinary moments and, you know, sitting where you've said the impact you've had, but

373
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,759
there's an old saying, no good deed goes unpunished. You would think, you know, when you set your mind

374
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:38,119
clearly, you've got a commercial bent. You could have gone into any part of finance, I assume,

375
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:42,779
and made whatever you needed to make in that space and pursue that. You've decided to go

376
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:46,900
down the social venture path, but then, you know, when you do research and people

377
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:52,460
always want to attack. And I wonder whether some of that's come from taking on the big guys. They

378
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:57,039
play for keeps and people don't understand social ventures have admin costs and wages costs and

379
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,599
travel costs and flight costs. And so how has that been dealing with critics?

380
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:07,339
Who've come after you? And have you got advice for other people who've started a social venture or

381
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:11,779
want to do something in that space? Yeah. You know, you're going to have to

382
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:16,819
cut me on time on this because I could end up talking about this forever. But just, just,

383
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:22,440
you know, just give me the signal to stop talking. But I think, I think this is, this is the,

384
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:28,859
it is the hard reality. If you, if you claim to do good in any form, I think as a society,

385
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:31,420
there is a really heavy natural skepticism.

386
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:35,420
And it has come actually because a lot of people that claim to do good did bad, you know,

387
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:42,759
and that sucks. Now the, that's probably fueled a lot more by our kind of media addiction around

388
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:48,400
controversy. I remember in PR training once I've done it once, but they, they were like, okay,

389
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,220
so you've got to understand with media controversy sells. So it's always about looking for the

390
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,799
controversy and finding that controversial angle. You know, when it happens and there was a couple

391
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:01,740
of articles that probably two that have popped up over 14 years that were really kind of,

392
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:07,720
that hit piece feeling. And it's so hard. Cause I'm like, oh man, like you had access to four

393
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:13,940
years data. You picked the two worst, which we publicly told everyone. These were, they were

394
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:19,220
our hardest years. We're getting hit on every front by, from retail to competition. They are

395
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:24,019
our hardest years. Call it the dark, the dark years. And then the media kind of like, and look

396
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:29,619
how, look at, thank you. It's like kick a dog while it's down. It just, it's like, okay guys.

397
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:31,700
But then also they could have zoomed out to other data.

398
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:37,920
They had, and I may have emailed the reporter that wrote that article because we had a pretty

399
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:44,859
good last couple of years. And, and so we ended up actually financial review put us in the number

400
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:50,799
29 in terms of giving for all companies within Australia. So they kind of rate rated all the

401
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,059
givings and everyone above us is sort of these billion dollar enterprises and little old. Thank

402
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:59,940
you. I mean, as a group of people, we actually were on the list. And so I said that to him,

403
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,740
I was like, Hey, maybe we could just, you know,

404
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:08,160
like tell a different story. And obviously that email didn't get any response, but, and like,

405
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:13,019
that's not that person's fault. I think that you'll get critique. My dad said this thing that has just

406
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:18,240
stuck with me forever. And, and he said that a person of integrity expects to be believed.

407
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:25,140
And when they're not, they let time prove them right. And I love that because a lot of people

408
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,200
have said a lot of things about me, Justine, thank you. And I did used to get caught up on that,

409
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,640
you know, and now it's like,

410
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:39,140
we've got a secret weapon. It's called time. Like we'll still be here. Like write your piece,

411
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:44,900
do your best. We're not like, we'll still be here. And, and, you know, I mean, we worked really hard

412
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:50,640
back of house to make sure that key risks, you know, things that shouldn't happen, don't happen.

413
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,920
So we, we, we put a lot of work into that. I don't think we'd ever claim to be perfect,

414
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:01,339
but we certainly are well on the side of what is integrity as a business and a leader. And,

415
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:07,279
and so I, I sleep very well at night. Now that's also because I've gone, people will just keep

416
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:12,619
hitting us and then time will prove us right. And I think our world's probably due for a bit

417
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:17,000
of a shake up on this whole cancel culture, whole phenomenon that's happening. Cause it's stopping,

418
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,639
I think leaders from stepping out. I don't know. No one wants to get canceled, say the wrong thing,

419
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,500
launch the wrong thing, have the wrong idea. And my encouragement, and I'll stop here,

420
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,500
but my encouragement to myself actually, in all of us is like,

421
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:36,559
the world needs change and there's some pretty big challenges it faces and we need people to

422
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:41,119
just get out, you know, and, and, and help make that change. Even if you're gonna get

423
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:47,000
shot a couple of times, you know, I, I, I just think we got a, what choice do we have? You know?

424
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,980
It's a great, uh, it's a great answer, uh, Dan, and, and I, and I'm not surprised. I love the

425
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,179
advice from your dad, you know, person of integrity expects to believe, be believed. And if not time

426
00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:00,920
will, will, will prove you're right. It's a fantastic way to think about just continuing to

427
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,280
do good.

428
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,099
In my mind, as you're talking, I'm thinking of, and, uh, without, uh, sounding like a name dropping

429
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:12,300
here, the Shane Warne foundation existed in Melbourne. If you've ever come, Shane is one

430
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,519
of the most generous, uh, interesting, uh, collaborative people you'll ever meet and

431
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:21,059
raised hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars in a Shane Warne way. It was a lunch

432
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:25,699
we'd go on, an invite would come out and connect people. And a lot of money went to a lot of good

433
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:31,099
causes. And then the same sort of pieces came, uh, that, that, that I read about,

434
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:37,219
thank you. And, and so someone who's travels and has a life, unfortunately, you know, that goes.

435
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:41,920
And so, you know, the last gift I think Shane Warne gave was, you know, close to half a million

436
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,719
dollars to a brilliant young story. I believe a young boy called Will Murray here, who's ended

437
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:51,960
up in an amazing contribution to someone's life. And if you went back and saw all the contributions

438
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:58,019
now, you know, the mainstream media can end that pretty quickly. And I think, you know, that is,

439
00:35:58,019 --> 00:36:00,940
um, that is a sad tale in lots of ways. So it, it,

440
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:05,679
it's a great conversation to have with someone like you to understand it. And just, you know,

441
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,920
I love the way you think about it. Time will be here. We'll continue to do good. Our values and

442
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,199
our integrity are strong and that's, that's all we can do, I suppose. Is that, is that how you

443
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:21,739
think about it? Yeah. Look, I mean, we, we, we, yes. And also we are thinking, okay,

444
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:27,539
is the house in order? What base isn't covered? You know, like, and that's, that's just a good

445
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:31,079
map. That is good management. But I think there is a massive,

446
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:35,820
massive problem with the whole nonprofit charity sector. Um, I mean, you know, there are many

447
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,960
problems with every sector, but we as humans judge for-profit and a completely different set of rules

448
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:47,579
to nonprofit. So a for-profit going through the same challenges that shame worn foundation went

449
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:54,199
through, right. Actually can easily weather that because there may be some mismanagement. There's

450
00:36:54,199 --> 00:37:00,059
also some reality of like, Hey, revenue dropped and expenses couldn't drop that quick. Right.

451
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:00,940
Right. And without knowing,

452
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:06,739
all of the shame worn intricacies, I'm not able to fully, fully, fully comment on it,

453
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:15,639
but I would say this, the, the different set of rules is diabolical for those that need help

454
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:21,159
because we're willing to back, you know, as a society, the Facebooks and the Amazons of the

455
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:27,780
world and say, go, go, go, you good thing. Um, but, but actually, you know, and we, I mean,

456
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,940
I mean, Jeff Bezos was amazing. He came out and said, Oh, look, iPhone fail.

457
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:36,219
They tried a phone. It failed. I think he lost a hundred million. Someone listening may know the

458
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:39,920
real number. Maybe it was a couple of hundred million or 50 million. They lost a lot of money,

459
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,179
but they tried something new as innovation. If you were the CEO of name, any, you know,

460
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:51,360
charity or nonprofit and said, Hey, so we tried a thing. Um, it was really innovative.

461
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:55,860
We lost like 50 million, but you know, we're going to learn from it and we're going to go again.

462
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:00,019
Everyone would say the end, the end, like that is it.

463
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:05,760
We like, if we crush innovation, innovation means trial, failure, learn, trial, failure,

464
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,639
learn. So, Hey, thank you. If anyone's listening, we're going to keep trying, failing, learning,

465
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:13,980
and some things will work and that'll get celebrated. Some won't, you can critique it,

466
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,219
but we're going to keep doing that. And I'm so, I think there's a job for us to sort of fight the

467
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:24,559
norms that have ended many good foundations and good people's work. And it probably shouldn't have.

468
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:30,559
Yeah. And I read, you know, what you did with the food business, you sold 750,000 boxes of food.

469
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:31,039
Amazing.

470
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:35,920
Effort, you know, it reached and contributed positively to so many people, but you've worked

471
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,699
out, you can do more from what I'm reading and have greater impact. So you're shutting down,

472
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:45,460
you know, what on the surface looks like a great opportunity, but I appreciate the lens that you're,

473
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,699
uh, you're attacking things through. And look, I don't know the intricacy of the

474
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:52,420
Shane Warne Foundation either. I just look at it from a, from someone who lives in the city

475
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,900
of Melbourne, understood that there was a lot of good that came out of that space and felt like we,

476
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:01,019
we should all be behind supporting initiatives like you're doing. We, we thank you.

477
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:04,699
And, uh, we'll get to that in a minute. Thank you.com. You need to check out Dan's website.

478
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,340
It's a really brilliant summation of, uh, the power of the work that, uh, that Dan Daniel's

479
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:14,079
doing now. I want to ask you, um, a set of leadership questions. We're, we're, we're

480
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,420
interested in different leaders in different spaces. You know, we, we, uh, from sport and

481
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:23,119
industry and the arts and your work you're doing in the, in the not-for-profit sector.

482
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,260
And we're seeing all these different dimensions of leadership, Daniel, where you can expand on

483
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,980
as much as you like, or see how they relate to you. But we see all leaders firstly,

484
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:35,000
think about self-leadership. And, and when I ask you about self-leadership, what does that mean to

485
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,440
you? I mean, that to me means it is, it is where the game is won and lost. And I didn't know that

486
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,300
at the start. And I think I liked the idea that there wasn't a huge link between the internal

487
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:52,980
battle or the internal challenges I face. And then the organization I get to lead and it turns

488
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:59,880
out they're, they're intrinsically linked. And so if I'm, yeah, and that, that's the hard reality.

489
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:06,820
But I think as, as a leader, that's the first job it's leading yourself is taking the time to

490
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:13,139
reflect. And that's not like a 10 minute job that takes time. Um, and, and you probably need help

491
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:17,860
coaches, mentors, advisors. And I had them all. In fact, a couple of years ago, I, I got a

492
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:24,519
2018, I think I, I, I booked a session with a psychologist and I promised you I was going to

493
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:29,760
cancel. And then I, I like, I, I hid myself on the way in and I'll in my head, I'm like,

494
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,059
I'm doing this once. Cause people are like, you should see, you carry a lot of pressure.

495
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:36,860
And I'm like, I'm going to do one. And in this session, I reckon he figured out I was only going

496
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:44,000
to do one because he said, Daniel, you say that you have this fear of failure, but I don't think

497
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,059
you do. And he said, I actually think you have a fear of rejection. And as he said, I started

498
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:52,500
crying. I couldn't stop it. I don't know where it came from, but he, and then we ended up unpacking

499
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:58,300
this like, Oh, what fear of rejection? Yeah. It turns out that was a thing in me and it went back

500
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,440
all my life. And,

501
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,900
and that inward journey helped me to the point that man, I kept those sessions going and now

502
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:11,780
I'm not like hiding my way in. I'm not trying to tell everyone, like, talk to someone. Do you

503
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,940
know what I mean? Like, like, like you crazy if you don't have a psychologist, like it's, it's,

504
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:21,559
it is something shifted in me. Cause I've kind of detached from however I was thinking,

505
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:24,880
but that's actually helped me lead a lot more transparently and authentically.

506
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:29,260
So I think that's the job for every leader. Yeah. And it's a, it's another powerful thing

507
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:29,599
you say.

508
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,380
I, I, I tell the story, you know, as a, as a full-time Australian rules football player,

509
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:40,000
there was, there was access back in the early nineties to psychologists, but you would be

510
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,159
reluctant if someone saw you walk into the office because they would think, God, he's,

511
00:41:43,219 --> 00:41:47,159
you know, he's going to break up with his wife or his girlfriend or not what you're doing and

512
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:51,559
saying, which is such a healthy thing. Like I've got this great life or I've got some challenges.

513
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:56,219
How do I improve? And the positive psychology movement is, is such a power. I've heard you

514
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:59,539
mention mentors a couple of times, just, uh, the digressing,

515
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,199
a moment. How important is mentors? But can you, can you share with us a mentor that's had

516
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:12,199
an impact on you? Yeah, look, I, there are many, um, you know, I just thought once around like

517
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:17,199
mentoring, it's kind of like this time travel thing where you get to sit with someone and in

518
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:23,460
a moment they can drop a sentence or a story or a piece of advice that took them decades to learn.

519
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:29,679
And so I think that's, it's like the closest thing we have to time travel. And so you,

520
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,980
should get on it as much as you can. And there have been many different mentors and, and, you

521
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:40,619
know, people that have provided advice over the years. And I'm so grateful for it. When I was

522
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:47,460
younger, I did some work experience with, um, uh, a guy named George. He was the CEO of Medibank

523
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:54,739
and he was so kind to let me follow him around in it. I give my credit to my dad on this because

524
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:58,760
my dad is another mentor for me. And I've had a, you know, been lucky to have a really good

525
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,739
relationship with my father. And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

526
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,739
but dad, he wasn't like a connected guy. He just was a go get them kind of dad. And at a breakfast,

527
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:11,340
he walked straight up to the speaker, which was this guy, George, and said, I think my son might

528
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,940
be like you one day. Can he do work experience with you? And he kind of put him on the spot.

529
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
And this guy, George was the nicest guy, George Saviti is very kind. And so he kind of was like,

530
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:24,820
ah, we'll consider it. And a long story short, it happened. And I was like, man,

531
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:29,739
dad, you have got guts. And, you know, but there's been many different voices,

532
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:37,239
over the journey, um, some for a season, some for longer. Um, I think we personally have had

533
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:43,940
to detach from, it's a very, very formal process. And for me, it's become more informal, but, um,

534
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:48,780
I try and have regular touch points with people who know a lot more than me. And that's really

535
00:43:48,780 --> 00:44:02,420
helpful. We see leaders conscious now around how they positively impact others in their

536
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,440
environment. I mean, thank you is all about positive impact, but do you,

537
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,219
consciously think about your impact day to day on those that are around you?

538
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:16,940
Yeah, definitely. I think, I think the state of an organization on the inside,

539
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:24,199
it's going to come out and so it should. Right. And, and, and so if you've got good values inside

540
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:30,480
and good culture inside, that's going to come out into all of the things you do. Um, but if you

541
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,980
don't, and so if you're projecting, and then this is often probably where some things get critiqued,

542
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:36,420
maybe right.

543
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:42,179
Rightfully as they project a very positive image on the outside, but there's massive dysfunction

544
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:47,159
on the inside. And it's that dysfunction that everyone eventually says, well, that doesn't

545
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:53,820
add up. How is, how can you be double minded or double life or like what? So, so I think it comes

546
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:59,780
back to that, like our internal culture and our internal, you know, I suppose the flow and effect

547
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:06,380
of me as a, as a leader is huge. And I've probably seen the years when, in the times when I was not,

548
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:11,699
I was not really focused on that. I was just focused on results and sales and outcomes and

549
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:17,000
impact with, with sort of missing the, the internal impact. But I think it's a really

550
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,719
cool question and it's a very important focus for any leader of people.

551
00:45:21,139 --> 00:45:24,420
Yeah. And you can imagine, you know, wanting to impact the world to do that with your team

552
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:30,500
first and foremost is, uh, is important. It sounds like you've got a great handle on that. And as you

553
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:35,139
said, eventually, you know, that becomes who you are anyway. So whether you like it or not, that,

554
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:36,420
that story is, is one that's going to be a big part of your life.

555
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:41,739
That's going to be told. Um, we see leaders really, um, identify how they go about creating

556
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:46,739
and sharing their vision. I mean, your vision to end extreme poverty in the world is, is

557
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:51,940
extraordinary. I mean, how have you thought about it? Cause it's, it's, it's such a bold thing. I

558
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:56,260
mean, how do you share it and create it with a team? I mean, what, what, what's the process?

559
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,559
Look, we, I mean, we have a day coming up, um, in Melbourne where all our team gather for the day.

560
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:06,059
Um, and we're just going to, we'll do content, which is really vision,

561
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,300
lasting vision and the plan. And then we'll hang out for a couple of hours, which I think

562
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:16,260
we've learned is the secret sauce to great vision and great organizations. It's the actual fun

563
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:22,880
slash personal building of those relationships. You know, and I, I used to be like all about the

564
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,079
vision and the plan and then like, yeah, catch up afterwards if you want to go out for drinks

565
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:32,719
or something. And now it's sort of, we've, we've inverted that. But, um, look, I think it's

566
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:36,420
important to have a bold vision. And I think people are compelled to make that decision.

567
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:42,400
Move to bold vision, as long as they can see a plan behind that, that is a step or a couple of

568
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,260
steps to that vision. And, and so I would say publicly helping end extreme poverty. And we're

569
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:55,760
only one of many organizations on that mission. It's very lofty, very lofty, but over time people

570
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,159
like, okay, no, no. Well, I suppose what you're doing here in Australia, more categories. Yeah.

571
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:04,380
And then more countries, maybe, maybe you could make a dent, but I can tell you on the inside,

572
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,119
there's a bunch of us, myself included.

573
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:11,960
That are fully convinced this is going to work. And it's only because we're, we're working on it

574
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:15,940
and we're building plans and we're seeing how it can all come together. And so I think that's

575
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:20,239
the important thing is, yeah, you can want to do something, change something, but if you don't have

576
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:27,360
a really good plan, I don't think people can really buy into that. I know I couldn't buy into

577
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:32,840
that. So, um, you know, that's, that's a bit of the approach. So literally before this call,

578
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,340
I was kind of scrambling to work on the detail of some of the plan.

579
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:41,500
I'm a bit more big picture, but not everyone is. And so really trying to fill in the gaps of the

580
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,300
detail behind the steps to build the big plan, I think is really important.

581
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:51,920
And made some huge dents. I mean, firstly, $17 million is an extraordinary contribution from,

582
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:57,320
from, from one foundation alone, but, uh, the impact on really leveraging off the, the,

583
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:01,460
the big players in the industry and making them sit up and think, and, and, and perhaps even

584
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:06,260
already their behavior changing, uh, is an amazing story that hasn't been told as, as,

585
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:12,019
as widely. We see great leaders in this current setting. Uh, Daniel is being really curious and

586
00:48:12,019 --> 00:48:16,980
curiosity drives their approach to learning and development. Does that, does that resonate with

587
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:22,500
you? Yeah, it really does. One of the values that we have had a thank you from the start

588
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:29,480
is a pretty old school word. It's learning. And we've kept it there to kind of jar people a little

589
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:35,039
bit like learning, like this is a startup. I can't, you come up with a cooler name or like what,

590
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,400
but learning for us, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

591
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:44,579
it is, it is the secret. So it is about staying curious. And we started, thank you, not even

592
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:50,500
joking, just literally Googling how to start a water company. And we Googled everything else.

593
00:48:50,619 --> 00:48:55,719
And today, I mean, I had to Google the spelling and this is only because my grammar is a bit

594
00:48:55,719 --> 00:49:00,719
average, but of licensing, like we got into licensing and we're dealing with these people

595
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:04,179
in New York and the global licensing business. And then people are like, Daniel, you keep

596
00:49:04,179 --> 00:49:06,380
spelling licensing wrong. I'm like, no way. Do I?

597
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,800
Turns out there's like a, of course there's a US and there's a UK version and, you know, and,

598
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:17,880
and so I've, I, but like random example, but we, my point is we keep Google, we keep learning,

599
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:23,880
we keep reading, we keep listening. And, and that is, I think it's a posture. I think if you turn up

600
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:29,340
into a room, even if there's 30,000 people in the room and you're lucky enough to get a segment to

601
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:35,239
speak to them, if you're not in that room to listen and learn and wonder and wonder what you could

602
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:36,380
pick up, you're missing out. And so I think it's a posture. I think if you turn up into a room,

603
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:42,320
you're missing, you're missing and you probably won't grow. And so that, that's been our approach

604
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:48,440
in, and, you know, another saying I heard once is the smartest person in the room is they that know,

605
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:54,800
they know the least. And I don't think that's meant to be like a self-deprecating thing. I think it's

606
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,960
meant to be wherever you turn up, no matter your level of whatever you think you've achieved,

607
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:04,440
you can learn from anyone. And so I, I resonate with, with what you put forward.

608
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,199
Yeah. Communicating with clarity is a, is a key dimension of, of leadership that,

609
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:13,099
that we see regularly. And you're, you're an incredible communicator and incredible

610
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:18,639
speaker and you get your community to, to really act, you know, when, when you do communicate,

611
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:22,179
I mean, what, what's been the secret for you with, with your communication?

612
00:50:23,059 --> 00:50:27,539
Yeah, we, we stumbled into it by, by, you know, I love telling the story, but I can tell you my

613
00:50:27,539 --> 00:50:32,519
mom and dad growing up are like, Hey Daniel. Okay. So you don't need to find a quicker way to tell

614
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:34,420
that story. Right. And so that was,

615
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,380
I grew up in that, like, you need to figure out how to say it quicker. And so I think my whole

616
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:45,340
life I've gone from, I love to just share what's happening in the story. And Jed, he's a splitting

617
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:51,179
image of Jesse and I, like he can, you ask him what happened, he just goes, but like, so, but

618
00:50:51,179 --> 00:50:57,400
clarity matters and, and, and it is a very noisy world and cut through is hard. So it has become a

619
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:03,000
thing that I've had to refine over time more and more and more. And, and someone gave me a couple

620
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,420
of clues and maybe these are secret.

621
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,219
It's for people, but they said, and I found this helpful. When you tell a story,

622
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:15,820
you must always tell it as if it's the first time you told it. And I do that. And it's, I just do.

623
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:21,239
I, I, and it's been, it's, it brought the fun back into telling the story about Coles and Woolworths

624
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:26,340
again. He brought the fun back in because I'm like, yeah, this, they don't know. I know. And

625
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:31,159
I can help, you know, and then the other thing on clarity, I think that's clay. Oh, I'm already

626
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:33,780
talking too long in this answer, but I sat down once.

627
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:39,940
I've had two different opportunities, maybe three for refinement of clarity. One was a,

628
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:45,019
I think it was a thing for Samsung or it was some kind of brand partnership ad thing, but

629
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:51,760
they wanted the thank you story, but in 45 seconds, and I was like, wow, I like, I do it in like an

630
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,679
hour. Like, what do you mean? And so I had this day and there's like 20 people on the set and the

631
00:51:56,679 --> 00:52:02,800
cameras and the producers like, cool. Yeah. So, so what you said, just say that quicker. Cool.

632
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:08,460
Quicker. And he just went and he went and it was grueling. And I eventually said it in like

633
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:13,440
that particular sentence in a few seconds. And, and I walked away from that day. I didn't love

634
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,260
the process, but it helped me communicate clearer. And there's been a few of those moments. And I

635
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:24,639
would say, if you don't naturally find places where you'll get refined, you need a coach and

636
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:29,360
you need to figure it out because it's important. I feel like I want to put you on, on the spot.

637
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,760
I love the idea of telling a story. Like it's the first time you've told it.

638
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,440
And certainly the first time someone's heard it, but you know, with 45 seconds to sum up that,

639
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:42,820
what were the sort of words that you remember? What did you condense that down to? As you said,

640
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:46,880
it's, it's even this interview, I feel like I've, I could go for another four hours. There's so many

641
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,940
different areas to go. I mean, it's a, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, and my favorite thing, my favorite

642
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:56,500
thing about podcasting is it is long form. Like there's a podcast I've been following a bit and

643
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:01,400
it goes for three hours, three hours, but it's a long, long form conversation is beautiful. That

644
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:08,219
I mean, I still struggle with it, but essentially we live in one world, two extremes,

645
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:12,760
extreme poverty, extreme consumerism. And thank you is a bridge between the two and our secret

646
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:19,219
people for years. We couldn't get into mainstream retail until one day we, we called out and people

647
00:53:19,219 --> 00:53:23,920
supported rap, danced helicopter pilots, flew the helicopters above the retailers. They both said

648
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:29,539
yes. And today products on shelf, we hit a number one hand wash and $17 million has been raised.

649
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,980
I don't know. I don't know if I nailed it, but like the,

650
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:32,780
I think you nailed it.

651
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,719
I think you did. Yeah.

652
00:53:35,019 --> 00:53:41,260
But like, but my favorite way to tell that story is in a 45 minutes, you know, I love that. And,

653
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:46,420
but you have to learn to not love what you love and, you know, fit in with the world and society

654
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:52,679
a bit, you know, the final dimension that we're asking leaders about is this idea of collaboration.

655
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:57,760
And we see great leaders now really focusing on collaboration and where thank you is that now it

656
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,559
feels like that's really a huge part of, of, of chapter two. I'll speak about chapter one,

657
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,360
uh, before we finish up, but, but chapter two is that you're going after these huge,

658
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:11,300
uh, multinationals again and, and looking for collaboration. Why is that so important?

659
00:54:11,619 --> 00:54:17,739
We've gone all in on this. We called it engine two and we started building it in 2018. Um, and

660
00:54:17,739 --> 00:54:22,239
it's a, not a physical engine, but engine one was the way we were building. Thank you. And I could

661
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:26,340
like, without critiquing ourselves too much, I'd call it the death star model.

662
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:31,699
So we're trying to build this giant thing. And I went to Facebook's head office and I was like,

663
00:54:31,699 --> 00:54:36,760
ah, yes, this is it. Hundreds of thousands of people in the office. And we're going to build

664
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:43,360
this. But actually over time, I started to see the challenges and the frailties and everything

665
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:48,639
with that. And also, I mean, just in nine, 10 years, and we went through, she went through

666
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:54,500
burnout. I feel like I did, but nearly did. And we read a book and it transformed both of us

667
00:54:54,500 --> 00:55:00,440
personally. And this guy talked about as a leader, he said 5% of what he said, he actually said 85%

668
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,159
of what you do.

669
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:06,579
Someone else can do. Most people won't admit it, but that's truth. 10% of what you do as a leader,

670
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:12,219
someone who you highly apprentice and train can do. And 5%, well, that's the bit that only you

671
00:55:12,219 --> 00:55:17,360
can do. And he went on to list his 5% and it was confronting relationship with his wife,

672
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:21,519
his faith, his sleep. He's like, you can't outsource sleep. And then he's like,

673
00:55:21,539 --> 00:55:26,559
and there's a bit left and that bit left is for your organization. So we were personally like,

674
00:55:26,739 --> 00:55:29,840
gosh, we've been, we need to rethink things.

675
00:55:31,699 --> 00:55:38,059
And when, well, thank you, needs to rethink things. Gosh, we're trying to do 100%. 85% of what we do

676
00:55:38,059 --> 00:55:42,599
running a product company, that company, that company, that company, let's be humble enough

677
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:47,099
to say they're doing a really good job. They could do that bit. 10% of what we do, we're building.

678
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,800
If you walked into our old office, you'd be like, wow, you have a finance team,

679
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:55,099
the size of an accounting firm. You have a creative team, the size of a creative firm.

680
00:55:55,099 --> 00:55:59,639
And we did, we built it all in house. We had 60 staff going on a hundred in our heads,

681
00:55:59,739 --> 00:56:01,219
you know, but.

682
00:56:01,699 --> 00:56:06,219
But we actually learned, man, we can't do everything well. And so we now have a network

683
00:56:06,219 --> 00:56:10,639
of partners and I would just call it that ecosystem model. We've figured out what's our 5%.

684
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:16,199
Right now, thank you. We have 20, 20 on team, which is like the exact opposite of what I thought

685
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:20,679
we're going to be building. But we have a network of creative partners, product partners, innovation

686
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:26,460
partners. And together I'm like, man, this is, this is a secret. And you, you, you know, you

687
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:31,340
talked about it. I think this is the world we live in now. The, the death star models are probably

688
00:56:31,699 --> 00:56:37,920
not going to be as nimble as they need to be in the new world, a highly disrupted world.

689
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,380
And I think we should all be thinking a lot about this.

690
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:44,199
And other leaders speak about that in, in, in slightly different language, but exactly

691
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:49,099
identifying what you said. And that is, you know, one of the versions, I think it might

692
00:56:49,099 --> 00:56:54,019
have been Brian McNamee, who is the, the, the CEO of CSL, one of the greatest, you know,

693
00:56:54,019 --> 00:56:59,079
business stories from turned an old government agency into Australia's biggest company. And

694
00:56:59,079 --> 00:57:01,500
he, he talked about having a couple of cards you dealt in life.

695
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,300
And they're your cards. And can you play those cards well? Because someone else can

696
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:10,380
always do other things better than you can. And focusing on those cards and using them

697
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:15,039
wisely was, was his advice. And you know, it sounds like, you know, your cards really

698
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:18,519
well now, thank you. You know, the community, you know, the power, you know, what you do

699
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:22,820
that others can't do. And it feels like you've, you found a sweet spot. Is it, is that how

700
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:23,820
it feels for you, Daniel?

701
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:29,260
It, look, it does. I would say we're still running where, where we are. Engine two is

702
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:31,420
more and more the business, but we still have elements.

703
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:36,179
Of kind of what we were running and how we were running it. And so I look forward to

704
00:57:36,179 --> 00:57:42,780
kind of just that engine to full focus takes time to transition, but it is, it is the way

705
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:43,780
forward.

706
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:48,559
We've been asking our ladies these two final questions. Daniel, who has been the greatest

707
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:51,539
leader in your life?

708
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:59,920
My dad, my dad has, because I mean, and he, he, Alvins, he's a big known leader of any

709
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,920
big things.

710
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:06,420
Um, but I just think he led himself really well and the impact that had on my mom and

711
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:13,920
my sisters and me was yeah, like, you know, incredible, actually incredible. So, you know,

712
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,280
I, I've appreciated that huge impact on me.

713
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,320
Yeah. It's a, it's a, not an uncommon answer to the people, you know, lucky enough to have

714
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:27,199
someone close to home, a father or a, yeah. And when you do, I feel very, very blessed

715
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,480
in the same way, you know, great influence, uh, for, for my dad as well. But, but, but,

716
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,480
you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

717
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:35,300
from my dad as well it's not surprising that came out very quickly as it did from you then

718
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:41,000
if you could collaborate with anyone in the world uh in any form i you know i'm assuming there's

719
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,460
some collaborations you're thinking about now might be a loaded question given what we've spoken

720
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:50,260
about but uh is there a person or or someone that you thought god this is who i'd like to

721
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:57,980
collaborate with oh such a cool question i mean look it's i need to rethink this because there

722
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:04,139
was someone uh his name is virgil um he was the founder of off-white and sadly he passed

723
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:14,039
away a couple of months back and so but he was so so off-white is i mean he was a one of the

724
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:20,420
most disruptive fashion fashion architecture creative kind of guys out there and he pushed

725
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:27,780
the boundaries in so many ways in fashion i think he was kanye's uh one of his yeezy

726
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:27,960
you

727
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:33,800
original designers and went on to do stuff for louis vuitton and others but if you follow his

728
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:39,559
work and it is a little underground his work but it's very very disruptive and i i always thought

729
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:45,639
man it'd be fun to sit in a room kind of collab on a product or something and just see where his

730
00:59:45,639 --> 00:59:50,780
mind went and in fairness you know he has passed and his incredible legacy but there are many many

731
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:56,320
many people like that and i just look forward to at some point just seeing what happens because

732
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,780
when people

733
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:02,579
come together and collaborate you can go way further and make a way way way bigger impact

734
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:08,420
and that is the ecosystem view not the kind of the death star i can do it all myself for you so

735
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:14,360
it's a it's a it's a brilliant note to finish on as i said uh in the interest of your time and i

736
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:19,300
really appreciate it uh there is a lot to follow up it'd be great to do it again sometime if we

737
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:23,719
found it but my final message is to just you know check out thank you.co support the thank you
