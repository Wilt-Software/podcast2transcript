00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:08,019
This week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is one of the most remarkable stories

2
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:11,259
I think I've ever heard, that of Dani Laidley.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,920
You're going to hear Dani talking about her rehearsing for this moment her entire life

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,820
and that as a 20-year-old AFL player, she met a handful of trans girls in a nightclub

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:28,480
in Melbourne who immediately knew that she was one of them and how they have been supporting

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,420
and mentoring her building up to this moment for her entire life.

7
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,640
And Dani talks about the incredible work her and her partner are doing in the transgender

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,159
space and the sincere gratitude she has for the platform she's been given on the back

9
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,759
of her incredible AFL career and career as a senior AFL coach.

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,380
Dani Laidley, I would have to say, is one of the most joyful, proud and whole people

11
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,960
I've had the privilege to know and to now interview on this podcast, a unique story,

12
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:57,979
an amazing story.

13
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,679
I hope you enjoy and learn from it like I have.

14
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:01,560
It's remarkable.

15
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:02,320
People like Dani.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,120
Dani Laidley that inspire the work that we do at Alita.

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,760

20
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:20,879
globe, whether they be from the world of sport, from industry, from the arts or social venture.

21
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,579
The idea of collaboration and learning and sharing and leading with each other is something

22
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:27,819
we're incredibly passionate about.

26
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:37,900
Huge thanks as always to Jason Nicholas and his team from Temper, Australia and New Zealand

27
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,480
for their support of conversations like this.

28
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,719
Temper is a mattress like no other.

29
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,040
Great leaders understand the value of sleep to live a healthy and happy and successful

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,459
life.

31
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,439
We spend a third of our life in bed.

32
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:54,159
So investing in the world's best mattress like Temper is something I encourage you to

33
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:54,340
do.

34
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:06,569
In May 2020, at the end of a crystal meth fuel bender, Dani Laidley was arrested.

35
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,569
During the arrest, Victoria...

36
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:13,469
Police officers took and distributed photos of her in female attire and makeup streaming

37
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,610
down her face, revealing to the world her gender transition for the first time.

38
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,990
Prior to that moment, we'd only known Dean Laidley, the champion premiership winning

39
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,849
footballer with the West Coast Eagles in North Melbourne, who would go on to be an outstanding

40
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:28,590
senior coach at North Melbourne Football Club for seven seasons.

41
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,490
Dani has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, explaining her identifying as a female at

42
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,330
such a young age.

43
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,150
It is unbelievable to me to think of the courage and mental resilience.

44
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,409
It must have taken to effectively live two lives while excelling in the brutal, alpha

45
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:46,150
competitive world of professional AFL football.

46
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,330
Dani, it's great to see you.

47
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,849
And you just genuinely look incredibly happy when I see you at the moment.

48
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:53,430
Is that how it feels for you at the moment?

49
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,569
Yeah, look, I am.

50
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:56,969
And thanks for having me this week.

51
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,129
Yeah, I do.

52
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,810
It's been a whirlwind probably two years now.

53
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,770
But that comes with another set of circumstances like we all have when we live our lives and

54
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:07,810
family.

55
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,430
And friends and work and all that sort of stuff.

56
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,849
So, but truly, the best thing out of it is it's really good to live in the present now

57
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:20,870
and not having to worry about all the issues that I went through previously.

58
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:22,849
They've been very well documented now.

59
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,569
And it's just nice to be able to live in the present and even start to plan for our future,

60
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,689
which is cool.

61
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:35,050
And Dani, is that possible now because you can be your true self?

62
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,750
You don't have to live the two lives now.

63
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,270
Is that why you're able to be in the present?

64
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,849
Yeah, I think so.

65
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,629
I think so.

66
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,430
It's a funny thing.

67
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:50,110
When, you know, particularly coaching and towards the end of playing, I really thought

68
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,629
my life was compartmentalised.

69
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:56,169
I had to be this person to these people, this person to these people.

70
00:03:56,789 --> 00:04:02,110
And I had to be thinking about who I was talking to, where I was, all that sort of stuff.

71
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:07,810
And obviously, I had a close group of friends in the last probably 10 years that knew.

72
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:08,289
Yeah.

73
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:08,349
Yeah.

74
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:16,449
But I tried to keep them, both my lives, so distant from each other so they wouldn't

75
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:23,769
collide and, you know, coming to fruition or coming into the public arena like it did.

76
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:26,009
Now, you're a champion junior player.

77
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:28,129
You played under-15 state football in Western Australia.

78
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,790
You played the first ever game for the West Coast Eagles.

79
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,290
And then you win that famous premiership in 1996 with North Melbourne and one of the great

80
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:35,730
teams.

81
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,230
So I just can't begin to imagine how you...

82
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,470
You coped with your second life, trying to come to the surface all the time.

83
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:45,170
Can you explain how you found a way?

84
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,089
Yeah.

85
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:50,149
I suppose it goes back to...

86
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:55,949
There's always been the disease of addiction in the Lavey family, going through back to

87
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:00,850
my, you know, great-great-great-grandfather, all alcoholics and all self-harmed, you know,

88
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,750
committed suicide, except for my dad sort of drinking himself to death.

89
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,089
And I was determined to be the one to break that.

90
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:14,750
That cycle for my children, my niece and my nephews, you know, the rest of our family,

91
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:16,029
so to speak.

92
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:23,230
And then feeling the way I was from a young age, and then, you know, getting picked in

93
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,910
the state team, that was a pretty big turning point because, you know, within, I think,

94
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,029
12 or 18 months, I was at West Perth.

95
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:38,029
And when the gender dysphoria was loud and roaring, and I can see...

96
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:39,790
I can say honestly now that...

97
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,610
And I can put a label on it because we've been able to peel back the layers, that it was

98
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:50,050
little Danielle, you know, misbehaving, wanting attention, and all that sort of stuff.

99
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:56,029
And to balance that out, not knowing what it was from such a young age, I would stick

100
00:05:56,029 --> 00:06:02,470
my head into my football career, initially playing, you know, at West Perth, and then

101
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,569
West Coast Eagles, and then North Melbourne.

102
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,029
I became a workaholic.

103
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,689
I became a workaholic.

104
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:13,170
I became my disease of addiction through those early years, which I've only just sort

105
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,529
of found out in the last five or six years that that was the case.

106
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:21,889
I thought it was me just balancing out, trying to get through, you know, the early years

107
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,170
of my life.

108
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:30,069
It did get to the point in my latter years of playing where the gender dysphoria was

109
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:36,209
just, like, so loud, it was difficult to cope on a day-to-day basis.

110
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:37,209
And, you know, things that you just...

111
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:39,870
You know, things that you just normally would go and do.

112
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:44,990
And that's when the depression and anxiety started to really peak, and then obviously

113
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,430
going into coaching, you know, and perhaps I shouldn't have even done that.

114
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,430
I should have perhaps even explored myself a little bit more at that point in time.

115
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:00,189
But, and you know what it's like when you have that, I'm going to call it attachment

116
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:05,709
to the football club or the football environment, it's sort of a bit of a safe space for you.

117
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:07,629
I ended up going into coaching.

118
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:14,850
So that's how I was probably walked side by side with both, if you like, through that

119
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,069
period of time.

120
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:23,629
I think my most difficult time in my life was when I left the AFL to finally realise

121
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:25,610
that I need to do something about this.

122
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:30,910
And then when the gender dysphoria was roaring, because I still hadn't had any professional

123
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:36,689
help at that point in time, there was no AFL career to stick my head into for the first

124
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,069
time since I was 15.

125
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:47,230
That was the hardest part in my life, dealing with both and everything that was going on.

126
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:51,709
There's a theory talking about addiction that all of us have got some form of addiction

127
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:57,829
and we may not understand it, but it could be addicted to other people's praise, or as

128
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:01,269
you said, you turn that into being a workaholic or substance abuse at that end.

129
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:05,470
We understand that as an addiction, but it's our ability to channel that into a way to

130
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,610
have the happiest and most successful life.

131
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,990
It's like, you've been able to do.

132
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:16,930
Did you feel like there was a time where your teammates had some idea, or was it always

133
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:17,870
a complete secret?

134
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:22,889
There was a time, I can share a little bit of a story with you.

135
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:26,769
When I was at West Coast, we won the grand final after 92.

136
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,490
I didn't get to play that day, it was an emergency.

137
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:38,070
And through making trips to Melbourne, I had met some trans girls who became my

138
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,570
great counsel, and they knew about me.

139
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,450
Sorry to interrupt, I find that fascinating.

140
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,970
Last time we caught up, you shared this with me, that you said that you walked into a famous

141
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:52,649
bar, Chasers Nightclub in Chapel Street, people will know that, and the trans girls, as you

142
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:55,710
described, they knew that you were one of them.

143
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,669
That's incredible to me.

144
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,850
They came up and understood, and they were in your corner, were they, forever since then?

145
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,149
Is that?

146
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,789
Yeah, yeah, they were.

147
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:07,870
Yeah, and then what happened?

148
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:14,789
And that particular night, I was with a group of, at Chasers, I was with a group of about

149
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:17,809
eight West Coast players, we all went there.

150
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:23,590
Now, there's no way in the world I would have gone there by myself, but on a Wednesday night,

151
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:29,049
midweek in February in Melbourne, after the game, as you did back then, you go out for

152
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:33,330
a drink, and we all went there, and that's where that relationship blossomed.

153
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:38,070
But it wasn't until the night, the Saturday night, after the 92 grand final.

154
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:43,029
I didn't really want to be with the team, you know, it was, you're a part of it, but

155
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:43,950
you're not a part of it.

156
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:50,769
I played so many games that year, so I organised with them to meet them out.

157
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,009
And then I, about midnight, I think it was, I jumped in a cab, and they gave me the address,

158
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:58,149
and I had no idea where I was going.

159
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,710
And I ended up at a place on Commercial Road.

160
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,649
And as I walked up to the door, the security guy goes,

161
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:07,750
Are you sure?

162
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,710
Do you really want to come in here?

163
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,070
And I've gone, Yeah, why not?

164
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:16,929
So I've walked in, and straight away, it was like, people coming up to me, what are you

165
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:17,309
doing here?

166
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:17,929
What are you doing here?

167
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:23,850
And I quickly realised, I was in Three Faces, the biggest gay club in Melbourne at that

168
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,309
time.

169
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:33,889
And what happened was, there was, anyway, I met the girls, but there was a sons of some

170
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:35,470
people who worked at North Melbourne.

171
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,529
So it was, you know, the...

172
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:43,649
The whispers started to happen, and, you know, I remember walking into the North Melbourne

173
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:44,370
footy club.

174
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:51,850
I sort of carried that night and those whispers, because it did get back to me, that, you know,

175
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:55,309
what was I doing at this, you know, gay club?

176
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:56,169
Was I gay?

177
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:02,190
And even though none of the players ever said anything to me, whenever I walked into the

178
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,110
footy club, I always felt it on my shoulder.

179
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:07,370
You know, I have spoken to...

180
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,129
A number of players that, you know, I played with during that time, we heard a few things.

181
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,289
We found no reason to talk to you about it.

182
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:18,830
You're a good person, and you could play good footy, and that's what we were after.

183
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:23,769
And I, you know, you look back now, and you think, oh, wow, you know, what could have

184
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:24,049
been?

185
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:28,950
But maybe at that point in time, anyway, it's just, you know, everyone's a lot older now.

186
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,789
This is happening in the early 90s, mind you.

187
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,289
That was sort of the inkling of, not specific to...

188
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,970
What was really me, but sort of a roundabout, if that makes sense.

189
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:47,769
Danny, I remember hearing you say, you know, in the last couple of months when this story

190
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:52,710
has come out, that there's always been a rumour that a gay AFL player will come out.

191
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:58,529
And, of course, we know that the percentages tell you that there would have been gay players

192
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:02,649
that haven't chosen, for their own reasons, to become public with it.

193
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,269
And you're sitting there going, wait till they hear my story.

194
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,710
Wait till they hear what I'm going to go.

195
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:13,789
I mean, my sense is, Danny, you know, being a player in the same era as you, that if you

196
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:17,490
had have expressed that to your North Melbourne team, my sense is that they would have put

197
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,870
their arms around you, like we all are now, and feel incredibly proud of you in lots of

198
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,350
ways that you've been able to find a way.

199
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,529
Do you think that would have been, if you had have been able to do it then, it would

200
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:28,029
have been okay?

201
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:36,750
Look, only with the information that I know now, from what they say, but I still don't

202
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:45,149
believe or I don't think that I would ever have got to that point, you know, and maybe

203
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:50,629
that was a sign of the times of my, you know, individual situation, you know, but what I

204
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:58,190
do know now is that everyone that I play with, everyone that I coach has been so very, very,

205
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:04,070
very supportive and, you know, love me for who I am and can say I'm healthy and they

206
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,149
can actually see I'm...

207
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:07,649
Well, obviously...

208
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:13,570
I'm obviously a different person on the outside, but a different, much more relaxed, wholesome

209
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,870
person where I can sit down and relax.

210
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:27,889
It was only last Friday in Melbourne, we caught up with Daniel Pratt, who I coached at North

211
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:33,029
Melbourne, and he was on the doco saying, you know, I've never heard you talk so much.

212
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:37,149
We spent seven hours together Friday afternoon and had some lunch and had a...

213
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:42,110
Had a few drinks and had just the best time ever, you know, because he's been living in

214
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,610
Perth, working for Simmo, so we've been catching up over here.

215
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:53,529
So my relationships with a lot of people are even better now than when they were back then

216
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:54,610
and that's...

217
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,549
I have to take responsibility for that.

218
00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:02,250
That's on me for what I was dealing with, how I was dealing with it.

219
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,629
I just wouldn't let anyone in too close, whereas I can do that now.

220
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:11,110
It's a brilliant documentary, Two Tribes, that you've made, and I encourage everyone

221
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,149
listening to this to go and see.

222
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,129
And that was one of my favourite moments, you walking into Adam Simpson's house, who's the

223
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:21,289
current coach of the West Coast Eagles and a premiership team mate of yours, and around

224
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:26,590
the table, Peter Bell and Spider Burt and Daniel Pratt, you mentioned, and just watching

225
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,230
your teammates put their arms around you.

226
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,129
And it was like a normal night.

227
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,250
You would imagine having a glass of wine and a beer with your great mates.

228
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,250
It was such a...

229
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:35,889
You know, as I would expect.

230
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:36,250
I'm not surprised by...

231
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:41,649
But it's still beautiful to see that unfold the way it did.

232
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:45,169
I mean, when you played, you were known as the Junkyard Dog.

233
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,389
You had that tag given to you.

234
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:51,230
I think Peter McKenna might have even given you that label.

235
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,190
And we knew you as this aggressive, combative...

236
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,110
Your teammates called you Tunnel because you just had this tunnel vision about the way

237
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,610
you went about.

238
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,210
Can you relate to that person now in your city?

239
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:05,429
I always struggled with the name.

240
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,129
Let's say the Junkyard Dog.

241
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:14,909
Well, and I know from the commentator's point of view, it was a term of endearment.

242
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:20,210
And, you know, any footballer, I think, would be happy to be known as that.

243
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:28,309
With me, it was a part of that vicious cycle of gender dysphoria, being a workaholic in

244
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:36,610
my career, and just being this uncompromising beast that would do anything to win.

245
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:38,470
You know, very hard.

246
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:43,230
And then, you know, all of a sudden, you get this Junkyard Dog, and you're thinking,

247
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,169
oh, my God, you're getting put up on a pedestal for this.

248
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:51,909
But it's even further removed from, you know, who I really was.

249
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:58,809
But so that vicious cycle that, you know, we've touched on today certainly took its toll.

250
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:03,169
Danny, you finished up your footy career eventually, 35 years in the industry.

251
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:06,350
You coached North Melbourne incredibly successfully.

252
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:08,710
Dealt with all of that.

253
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,149
But once you lost that routine, as you said, it was your safe place.

254
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:15,230
Life fell apart there for that period of time.

255
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:20,309
You've spoken really openly about, you know, falling into drug use and suicidal thoughts.

256
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,789
And then ultimately being arrested, as I said, the intro and ending up in the front

257
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:26,730
page of the newspaper around the country.

258
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:31,029
Can you tell us how bad was that day when that all unfolded?

259
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:36,970
Yeah, the day was, well, that whole, to be honest,

260
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:44,750
from the sort of the end of 2018, let's say 2019.

261
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,889
That was the year for me from hell.

262
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:53,529
I didn't have my football career to stick my head into.

263
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:59,169
And, you know, I was in a relationship and got introduced to cocaine for the first time

264
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:01,429
at 48 years of age.

265
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:07,130
And I think with everyone who knows, particularly my football friends,

266
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,769
that was the most surprising part for them.

267
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:19,309
Given my stance on drugs, I was never a big drinker because of the stuff that we spoke about.

268
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:24,710
You know, and I wasn't a big gambler until sort of that period of time.

269
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:26,150
I got bored of gambling.

270
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,950
Mind you, I did pretty well.

271
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:31,369
I spent a lot of time studying it.

272
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:35,430
And again, I think this is that addictive personality that you're talking about.

273
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,490
Yeah.

274
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:35,849
Yeah.

275
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:35,869
Yeah.

276
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:35,890
Yeah.

277
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:35,910
Yeah.

278
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:35,930
Yeah.

279
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,029
Yeah.

280
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:36,049
Yeah.

281
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:36,109
Yeah.

282
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:36,130
Yeah.

283
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:36,170
Yeah.

284
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:36,190
Yeah.

285
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:36,210
Yeah.

286
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:36,230
Yeah.

287
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,250
Yeah.

288
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:36,289
Yeah.

289
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:36,309
Yeah.

290
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:36,329
Yeah.

291
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:36,349
Yeah.

292
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:36,369
Yeah.

293
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:36,390
Yeah.

294
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,450
Yeah.

295
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:36,490
Yeah.

296
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:36,509
Yeah.

297
00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:36,529
Yeah.

298
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:36,549
Yeah.

299
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:36,569
Yeah.

300
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:36,589
Yeah.

301
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:36,609
Yeah.

302
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:37,309
So I was doing that.

303
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,150
I was full on.

304
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:44,089
I was studying every night, the NFL or the NBA or the Premier League to get results.

305
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:46,269
And then I got bored of that.

306
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:51,450
So then I started drinking and I've never been a big drinker and I hate hangovers.

307
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,309
So I sort of gave that away pretty quick.

308
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:56,109
And then the drugs came along.

309
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,410
And it's really interesting.

310
00:17:57,569 --> 00:18:05,490
When we as people find ourselves under stress or under pressure, things aren't going well

311
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,410
in life.

312
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:14,650
life we turn to things that we're we're good at um or you know if we're you know we're also

313
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:23,369
unhappy we we turn to things to numb ourselves and certainly in that that period of 12 months

314
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:32,349
2019 um i was caught in that in that black hole and then invariably it got worse in the early

315
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:42,130
months of 2020 i entered back into a relationship um with um a person yeah that did that didn't go

316
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:50,569
down too well so it was and so through all that 2019 um it wasn't till towards the end of the

317
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:58,869
year that i really broke down um and told my uh psychologist at the time that i think this is

318
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:02,329
what's wrong with me and that was because my mental health was i was really

319
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:08,910
struggling depression anxiety the gender dysphoria the drug use i became it just

320
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:16,190
grouped me so quickly then i was ashamed embarrassed because of my views on it to

321
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:22,569
other people of reaching out to anyone to say hey this has happened to me and we know drug use

322
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:31,170
doesn't discriminate but the key factors were there of why you self-sabotage yeah getting um

323
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,329
arrested um

324
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:37,930
i actually rang the police that night i went out and stood about out an apartment which i own in

325
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:46,470
in st kilda and uh rang the police um and i think that was my way of trying to just get off this

326
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:54,950
toxic dance floor you know and it was a cry for help but what i didn't realize was what was going

327
00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:00,150
to happen from when i got arrested when i was at my most vulnerable and i can say i hadn't slept

328
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,890
for i think like nine days

329
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:10,589
leading up to that um i was a complete um mess i was a shell of a person i did self-harm only two

330
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:17,569
weeks before that and was lucky to be found by my um by a girl who who lived with me you know

331
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:23,690
otherwise it could have ended up very badly um so this is what i was going through at all that

332
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:32,309
point so when you talk about that night of being arrested for me it was this is the best way to

333
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:38,730
get off this toxic dance floor the decisions through that sort of 12 14 months were not good

334
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:44,390
ones that period cost me dearly but obviously you know getting arrested and then with what

335
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:50,630
happened publicly i didn't make any mistakes there that's that's not on me at all but it was

336
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:58,269
very very difficult for the family and it was difficult how i was treated um at the st kilda

337
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:02,309
police station then in the in the custody center before i was arrested and then i was arrested and

338
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:07,789
went to prison and even to talk about that now when when i say go to prison like it gives me

339
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:14,190
like really huge anxiety of you know putting me back in that in that place danny you mentioned

340
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:19,329
there the biggest heartbreak for you was the impact on on your family and your three kids and

341
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:25,349
through that time you accidentally sent some pictures to your two daughters of you dressed

342
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:31,009
as danny earl and on the back of that um you know i believe you've lost all contact with your two

343
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:32,309
daughters is is that

344
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:38,309
still where it's at and and that must be incredibly shattering to you as a as a result of what's

345
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:47,670
happened yeah um so um with the snapchat pictures i i've never had a chance to because it happened

346
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:54,390
right just before i got arrested so i haven't had a chance to talk about that at all and then

347
00:21:54,390 --> 00:22:00,410
obviously what happened publicly they've sort of retreated you know and what i've tried to do is

348
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,970
put myself in their shoes

349
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:08,750
with the you know on top of my fear shame embarrassment um you know what they went

350
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:16,369
through you know having um a parent who had somewhat of a a public um profile then adding

351
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:24,269
this on on top of it it's been very very difficult for them uh for the girls but but i will say i

352
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:32,190
have for the first time in a long time received two texts uh from each of them in the last

353
00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:42,049
week and i know it's only a very very small step but for me that's huge i just hope and live for

354
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:47,569
the day that you know we're back we're back where we were yeah incredible danny and i can see that

355
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:53,609
the joy that that brings to you and the smile on your face and i i want to talk about kane your son

356
00:22:53,609 --> 00:23:00,069
as well and again to see you know talk about leadership and compassion and someone that i

357
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:02,289
think his words were that the two of you had this

358
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:09,029
unbreakable bond and he's been a tower of strength for you as as your son and you must be really

359
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:14,089
proud of of him and the way he's been able to find his way as well in this sort in this story

360
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:22,509
yeah and and you know he probably took the brunt of it publicly you know because i was i was in

361
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:31,670
prison so he he's outside being chased and harassed by the um by the media um he's organizing

362
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:37,509
you know the north people from anthony stevens and darren crocker and greg ryan from the

363
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:41,910
northbound football club and then they were organizing the players association and the

364
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:50,089
coaches association so i'm really proud that he was able to stand up at that point in time

365
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:59,509
regardless of what was happy happening to um look after me um look after his his family

366
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:02,029
and get the best outcome um

367
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:09,890
for us so i would never forget that and you know even since that day um he comes to a lot of

368
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:15,829
um speaking engagements that i that i do i think he was the star on the uh on the documentary

369
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:23,690
um you know and i i think you know that's all we can we can ask of our children and i don't think

370
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:29,609
i don't feel any less of the way the girls have reacted as opposed to caves reacted you know we

371
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:32,309
all we all take uh

372
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:39,670
issues and use or and make decisions for um you know my eldest daughter's got a young family

373
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:45,069
herself and you know i'm sure she wanted to protect them as well you know and my my youngest

374
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:51,569
daughter um you know basically took off and came and lived in perth for a few years just to get

375
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:58,509
away from the uh from the fishbowl um that was melbourne and danny your partner donna again is

376
00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:02,309
just an incredible story and you you understand the two of you are going to be together for a

377
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:08,569
great one together and we're boyfriend and girlfriend through school on again and off again

378
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:15,150
and she had no idea about your gender dysphoria and when the lowest moment your life came around

379
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:21,269
she enters your life again uh with this unconditional love she doesn't care if

380
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:26,789
you're dean or danny or transgender she loves you for you it's what we all want in life isn't it

381
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:32,289
someone who just sees us for who we are without concern about uh any of

382
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:37,069
um the baggage that we are worried about ourselves it's amazing for you must be

383
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:43,130
you know really uh proud and lucky to have a partner like donna yeah you know i i think

384
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:47,910
you know and donna says you know how can you not understand that you just want to love

385
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:56,170
a person which that line has gained great uh notoriety out of the um out of the out of the

386
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:01,609
um but um for for me um

387
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:11,670
i i think i've learned this that um it doesn't matter who or what you are you're either a good

388
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:15,170
parent good bad or a different person you know it doesn't matter whether you're

389
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:23,029
um a cisgender guy or female or you're transgender you're either a good person or you're not and i'm

390
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:30,970
hoping that i am a good person and you know that's how how donna sees it and yes i i am and

391
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,309
i'll say we um i'm a good person and i'm a good person and i'm a good person and i'm a good person

392
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:36,369
are very lucky because, you know, she did come back into my life

393
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:42,549
prior to it going pear-shaped, a bit more of a distance between us,

394
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,630
her living in Perth and myself living in Melbourne,

395
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,750
but we caught up in Melbourne and we caught up in Bali

396
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,269
and things like that.

397
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:55,809
And certainly it was growing reasonably quickly prior to that 2019.

398
00:26:55,809 --> 00:27:03,549
But then during that period, and again, this is my behaviour at the time,

399
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:09,309
we would talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, and then I'd go AWOL for a couple of weeks.

400
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:16,549
And that really frustrated her because she has got a sixth sense

401
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:22,049
about some of these things and, you know,

402
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:25,569
she would always check welfare check.

403
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:26,650
How are you going?

404
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,670
And then I wouldn't reply.

405
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:32,509
And that would put her into a spin on the other side of the country,

406
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:40,269
only about worry because I had sort of touched on I wasn't going that well.

407
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:47,269
And then even to when I got arrested and with Danielle,

408
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:52,869
I wouldn't even, I didn't tell her either.

409
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:54,349
I couldn't.

410
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,430
And it wasn't.

411
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:55,789
And it wasn't.

412
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:55,809
And it wasn't.

413
00:27:55,809 --> 00:28:02,190
And it wasn't until then when I did get diagnosed sort of September 2019,

414
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:12,089
it was then my initial thoughts were how am I going to break this news

415
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:20,769
to all and sundry family, friends, I'll say the AFL family the right way.

416
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:25,670
And we started to put a strategy together of, okay,

417
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:34,589
family, then friends, then we had a planned meeting with the AFL to see

418
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:37,089
if they would stand with me or beside me.

419
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:41,369
By the time all that was getting organised, it was all too late.

420
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,269
It became public.

421
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:42,710
Yeah.

422
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,630
So, yeah, Donna's an absolute ripper.

423
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:46,690
We have fun together.

424
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:53,930
And the best thing about us is we can actually be ourselves, both of us.

425
00:28:53,930 --> 00:29:01,730
You know, we laugh, we giggle, we cry together, we go to the beach together,

426
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:08,630
we go shopping together, we work together, and it works really well for us.

427
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,730
And, Danny, you're doing an incredible thing, I feel,

428
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:16,390
for a lot of families that are going through the same situation you grew up with

429
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,309
but without a pathway forward and to break this ground for someone

430
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:23,769
as high profile and successful as you've been to now,

431
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,710
show that there is a way forward, that you can get healthy

432
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:29,190
and you can be yourself and you can share this story.

433
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:34,509
It's an amazing story of leadership, which is the basis for this podcast,

434
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:37,630
is sharing what great leadership looks like in different settings.

435
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:39,470
And yours is so unique.

436
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,789
I use the term success leaves clues, and I'm fascinated

437
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:45,210
because we see some patterns in that.

438
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:48,089
I want to ask you about those patterns and dimensions,

439
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:50,769
starting with, Danny, the idea of self-leadership.

440
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:53,789
It's hard to lead someone else unless you understand,

441
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:59,170
and your journey to understand yourself is the most remarkable one

442
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,109
I've ever heard in my life.

443
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,269
Can you share with us what that means to you, self-leadership?

444
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:08,269
You know, it's for lots of different reasons.

445
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:11,049
There was lots of hurdles with me.

446
00:30:11,589 --> 00:30:13,829
You know, I get this from my son.

447
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:18,690
You know, he said to me, there's only one person that can do this,

448
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:23,069
and that's you, and you need to be you,

449
00:30:23,069 --> 00:30:23,910
and you need to...

450
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,910
You need to be strong, and you need to live your life.

451
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:35,130
And by doing that, people will see you how I see you,

452
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,609
and then with the platforms we've had through the book

453
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:43,509
and the documentary, your leadership or your role modelling

454
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:48,029
will be just you living as you and showing people

455
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:53,349
that you can get through that, you can be honest and can be raw

456
00:30:53,349 --> 00:30:53,910
and can be...

457
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:59,809
You can be vulnerable, which I think does, in society these days,

458
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:01,210
that attracts people.

459
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:07,250
I know now by me being me, and to be honest,

460
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:11,549
I didn't ever think I would end up like this.

461
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:14,930
It was just me wanting to be me, living my life,

462
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,930
and I've sort of been anointed as a transgender community role model,

463
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,829
and at first I was a bit, oh, I don't know about that, you know,

464
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:27,789
because generally we know in any change or any sort of leadership,

465
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:32,990
the first person who walks through the door usually cops one on the beak.

466
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:40,650
And, you know, I thought, well, if that has to be me, that's me,

467
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:43,589
but I'll do it my own way, you know,

468
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,170
and when we're talking about this self-leadership.

469
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:51,470
So by living my life and by having the platforms,

470
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,349
which I'm very lucky to have,

471
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:57,069
that people can't be what they can't see,

472
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,349
and that was certainly me growing up.

473
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:07,269
But now Donna and I both literally get hundreds of messages a day,

474
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:11,930
and particularly over the last month with the doco,

475
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:17,410
parents, grandparents, transgender people themselves saying,

476
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:21,410
thank you for what you're doing, and we're just living our life.

477
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,410
But we're living in a way that...

478
00:32:23,349 --> 00:32:26,789
that people see part of our life in public,

479
00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:32,589
and that gives great reason for families of transgender people,

480
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:36,589
or transgender people themselves to be able to be authentic

481
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:40,849
and be themselves, present their best possible self.

482
00:32:41,069 --> 00:32:42,470
And I think that's all that I'm doing.

483
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,230
Danny, what a gift from your son, isn't it?

484
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:48,490
To say to you, you need to listen now, we need you to be happy.

485
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:51,849
We love you for being yourself and go about doing that.

486
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:52,869
And we're here to support you.

487
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:53,230
That is incredible.

488
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,410
That's an incredible gift, isn't it?

489
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:59,170
And an insight for him, as you said, going through his own challenges,

490
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:04,410
of course, with a high-profile parent and having to work through it.

491
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:05,410
It is amazing.

492
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:08,650
A lot of people live in their own version of not being themselves, aren't they?

493
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:13,150
Yours is a little more profound, but a lot of people just are trying

494
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,269
to be someone else all the time for whatever reason.

495
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,990
And so I think you're clearly paving the way for transgender people,

496
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,369
but I think for other people as well.

497
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:23,210
It's like it's an unhappy world, isn't it?

498
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,650
To not be yourself is unhappy.

499
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:30,970
Yeah, and, you know, in the doco and the book, there's lots of different,

500
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:33,769
there's the disease of addiction, there's mental health,

501
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:37,930
there is gender dysphoria, there is a little bit of sexual orientation,

502
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:42,269
all these things which everybody goes through.

503
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:47,210
It's just, it so happened that I, you know, I was reasonably talented

504
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:52,869
at something that, you know, our nation loves,

505
00:33:53,230 --> 00:34:02,509
and, you know, I'm thinking that's why I have been gifted this platform

506
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:04,089
with the support.

507
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:10,150
And I've always said about it that I'm happy to be seen and, you know,

508
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:15,250
show some of our life and what we do on Instagram or whatever it might be.

509
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:22,250
And I think that's a great thing, but there's also time

510
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:28,329
to pull back and just have our time and balance that out.

511
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:33,670
Because, you know, in this world, there's lots of, you see,

512
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,349
lots of demonstrations, and I don't know if you remember,

513
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:40,030
there was an anti-trans rally earlier in the year in Melbourne.

514
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,769
It was actually round one of the AFL season,

515
00:34:43,769 --> 00:34:47,769
and North and West Coast were playing at Marvel.

516
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:51,889
And Donna and I took a couple of our friends who barracked for West Coast,

517
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:57,530
and we all went along, and it was quite vitriolic towards me

518
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,809
in the city that day, and I really felt it for the first time.

519
00:35:01,329 --> 00:35:04,769
But then as we got closer to the ground with West Coast and North supporters,

520
00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:08,349
all of a sudden there was this outpouring of love,

521
00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:11,610
and they were at the game, and, you know,

522
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,449
you feel like a bit of a rock star a little bit.

523
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:19,730
But, you know, I truly appreciate it when people will come up and say,

524
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:20,949
you know, well done.

525
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:21,869
You know, good on you.

526
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:25,469
But then later that night, we went out for dinner,

527
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:32,469
and we were getting into an Uber, and this guy walked around the back

528
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:37,369
of the Uber, recognised who I was, took to me, black eyes,

529
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,070
said, I've got a knife in my pocket.

530
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,909
I know who you are.

531
00:35:39,949 --> 00:35:40,750
I'm going to kill you.

532
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:41,289
Wow.

533
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:42,210
Yeah.

534
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:47,710
And there was like a scuffle with some family and that.

535
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:51,869
But you'll never see me in any protest.

536
00:35:51,889 --> 00:36:01,190
Or I think there's far better ways to get your messaging across in a more loving,

537
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:08,690
caring, with science in some degree, in research and experience from me.

538
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:12,409
And that's the way we will do it.

539
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:18,809
And I think from afar, if you talk about leadership, you always – you have

540
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,630
and I have, and you've looked at someone from afar,

541
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,030
and, you know, I really like what they do in regard to this, this, and this.

542
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,610
You'll take that part out of it.

543
00:36:26,909 --> 00:36:29,829
And really, that's what I hope people will do with me.

544
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,829
Yeah, I'm sure that's what's happening.

545
00:36:31,909 --> 00:36:34,309
I find discrimination such a bizarre thing, isn't it?

546
00:36:34,309 --> 00:36:40,269
When you see you as a happy person being yourself, how can you look past that

547
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:44,269
and not want that for another person, regardless of what shape, colour, size,

548
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,429
persuasion they are?

549
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:51,010
I'm always disturbed by that incident and hearing that.

550
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:54,489
And that is still something you're going to have to deal with at various stages.

551
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:59,170
I want to talk to you about leaders being really conscious of having a positive impact

552
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,570
in their environment.

553
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,110
And you've done that throughout your whole life.

554
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,010
Now you're doing it in a different way.

555
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:09,610
Is that something you think of now, that you can have that positive impact daily?

556
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,769
You know, yes.

557
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:18,289
And that's – we're living that right now, certainly over the last – since the book

558
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:20,969
came out, about 14 months.

559
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:29,409
The only difference about – and in a way, it's still coaching, but it's just coaching

560
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:34,849
from afar, or role modelling, whatever term you want to use.

561
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:41,130
I suppose you don't get the cut – and this is what I'm looking for – the cut and thrust

562
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:46,210
of coaching a football team, with what we know.

563
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,730
You don't get the cut and thrust of the win and loss each week.

564
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,429
You know?

565
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:51,610
They burn.

566
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:59,329
It's really creating a culture and a society, and it's still through education and developing

567
00:37:59,329 --> 00:38:01,389
people's skills.

568
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:15,889
And I sort of miss the cut and thrust of the win-loss each week, but really enjoy doing

569
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:17,889
what we're doing now.

570
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,309
Because I know –

571
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:20,989
I know.

572
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,550
But football is win and loss.

573
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,650
What we're doing now can save lives.

574
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:32,469
Danny, creating and sharing a vision is another dimension we talk about in this forum, about

575
00:38:32,469 --> 00:38:37,769
– and you have done that in your world as an AFL senior coach and winning premierships

576
00:38:37,769 --> 00:38:38,389
with success.

577
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:43,929
Is there a different vision that you've got now for Danny Laidley in your second half

578
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:44,510
of your life?

579
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:49,389
And is that something that you're conscious of and you want to go about creating that

580
00:38:49,389 --> 00:38:50,150
vision and sharing it?

581
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:56,969
Yeah, I'm – because the doco and the book were sort of both two and a half years in

582
00:38:56,969 --> 00:39:05,710
the making, we sort of put this time to be, okay, well, what's next after this?

583
00:39:05,789 --> 00:39:07,590
And we've been slowly talking about it.

584
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:18,110
And we probably thought 2024, if it was to be back to what I grew up doing, which is

585
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,909
playing footy – not playing, but coaching.

586
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,429
And what does that look like?

587
00:39:22,909 --> 00:39:25,250
Because I still have a passion for that.

588
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:35,469
Or is it the gender and diversity training that I'm doing in the corporate world at

589
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:35,829
the moment?

590
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:43,289
Is it opportunities that I'm – we're now just dotting the I's and crossing the

591
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:49,250
T's with the AFL in regard to diversity and inclusion training?

592
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:49,989
Yeah.

593
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:50,130
Yeah.

594
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:56,710
Within clubs, their stakeholders, right down to community level.

595
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:03,570
That's the really, really hard one for me at the moment.

596
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:14,190
So I'm sort of just doing – having a look at everything, whatever I or whatever we decide

597
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:18,329
to do, it has to align with the values.

598
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,110
And that – you know, when I – when I – when I – when I – when I – when I – when

599
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:27,349
I went through that bad shot, and I was working with my psych, you know, I built

600
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:36,849
some pillars around being the best person that I could be first and getting myself right

601
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:46,150
and then being the best partner, parent, friend, colleague as I could and what that looks like.

602
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:49,150
And the last one was educating.

603
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:53,070
And supporting transgender community.

604
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:58,909
But also – and this is not trying to change the world by any stretch of the imagination.

605
00:40:58,909 --> 00:41:06,710
Just pass on education and my life experiences of what I've gone through, because I have

606
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:11,510
no doubt all the training that I've done through the book, through the documentary,

607
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:19,150
I have men and women who come up and say, you know what, I just didn't get it.

608
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:25,989
I couldn't get my head around it, but you've opened my eyes.

609
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:31,750
And you know, if I ever come in contact with anyone, or if it's a family or a friend, I

610
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,610
will be there to support them.

611
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:40,789
And then when that happens, it's not quite like winning the grand final, but it's – it

612
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,050
gets there.

613
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:48,730
You know, so to set that pathway, if you like.

614
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:53,570
So that's the first – that's the first step, is to really build that relationship

615
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,349
and that relationship to success.

616
00:41:56,349 --> 00:42:02,230
I've probably been now at my busiest building that, with all the bits and pieces that we've

617
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,409
done over that period of time.

618
00:42:04,409 --> 00:42:10,750
But it'll certainly revolve around – the number one would be helping the transgender

619
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:14,150
tribe, I think.

620
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,309
And again, in the right way.

621
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:17,309
For instance.

622
00:42:17,309 --> 00:42:18,309
So Donna's just gone on the book.

623
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:20,010
on the board of Trans Folk WA.

624
00:42:20,449 --> 00:42:23,570
They're a very small organisation, the only one here in Western Australia.

625
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:30,349
So we want to be able to use our contacts and support all those people

626
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:34,929
and their corporates and hopefully bring in some more funding

627
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:37,710
to the organisation so we can do more things.

628
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:43,110
The reality is I would say that would be the most significant thing

629
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,489
in our lives.

630
00:42:45,489 --> 00:42:48,769
Yeah, what an incredible legacy, Danny, it is.

631
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:50,090
And you're teaching all of us.

632
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,949
You're teaching me by sitting down and having this conversation

633
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:55,789
and saying, I know you and I know the person you are

634
00:42:55,789 --> 00:43:00,030
and I know your mates and your teammates and it does.

635
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,130
It normalises it.

636
00:43:01,289 --> 00:43:05,510
As you said before, really, you can't understand what you haven't seen before

637
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:11,190
and as much as we think we're open-minded, really someone has to take the path

638
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:14,489
and show us and see the person that you are.

639
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:15,429
And, yeah.

640
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:21,469
Amazing success that you're creating for others who maybe didn't get through.

641
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:24,409
Maybe they didn't get past the milestones and, you know,

642
00:43:24,449 --> 00:43:28,869
you had your moments where it might have been possible for you

643
00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:30,570
to be able to live past some of the challenges.

644
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:35,269
So it's an amazing story that's unfolding and great credit to you.

645
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:38,730
Curiosity is a word I want to use because I ask everyone

646
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:41,510
about this idea of being curious and that's how they learn.

647
00:43:41,949 --> 00:43:43,250
Is that real for you?

648
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:45,230
Is that something that has come up for you a lot?

649
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:46,929
Very.

650
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:51,710
You know, if I – I can give you some examples in my coaching career.

651
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:58,349
Firstly, North Melbourne Football Club, a small niche football club in the AFL,

652
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:05,349
not much money, but had been pretty successful over the last 30, 40 years.

653
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:07,150
Gone through some patches.

654
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:13,369
So I went and spent a couple of years in the off-season with a club called

655
00:44:13,369 --> 00:44:14,309
Charlton Athletic.

656
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:15,369
In the –

657
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:16,550
English Premier League.

658
00:44:17,309 --> 00:44:21,110
Small club, not much money, but their success,

659
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:26,230
how they rated their success in the Premier League was being in the Europa Cup,

660
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,969
competing with these big clubs.

661
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:34,969
So to scratch away at that and find out what I could take from that.

662
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:41,570
And then I've always been fascinated with the New England Patriots as an organisation,

663
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:45,369
not so much on the ground, but, you know, how Robert Kraft,

664
00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:51,690
built and bought the stadium and has grown the brand, you know,

665
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:54,929
from patsies to Super Bowl champs many, many times.

666
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:58,769
I've done that in that sphere in my life all the time.

667
00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:02,170
If you walk into my house, I've got books upon books and upon books.

668
00:45:02,289 --> 00:45:04,849
And I'm not a great reader as such.

669
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:09,250
It's having them there as a resource to go, oh, I've got that.

670
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:11,650
I'm going to go and read up on that.

671
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:12,789
Or I'm going to go and find out.

672
00:45:12,789 --> 00:45:14,110
Or I'm going to go and talk to someone.

673
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,690
About that.

674
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:21,449
And I suppose now I'm not at the start of that journey,

675
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:27,869
but I think I'm still in its infancy in regard to the rainbow community

676
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:30,889
and the transgender community because I'm still learning about myself.

677
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:39,329
And having been too scared to dip my toe in there for what possibly would be said.

678
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:44,090
So I'm sort of trying to eat as much as they,

679
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:52,210
and now, and get to the coalface of the community, you know,

680
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:56,730
where the action is, what people, what their experience, how they're living,

681
00:45:57,329 --> 00:45:58,530
what are their barriers?

682
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,269
Is it family?

683
00:45:59,389 --> 00:45:59,730
Is it friends?

684
00:45:59,809 --> 00:46:00,510
Is it work?

685
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:04,550
Is it the cost of, I don't like the word transition,

686
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:12,329
but it's a very, very expensive cost that comes onto you to be the best person

687
00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:13,090
that you can be.

688
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:13,210
Yeah.

689
00:46:13,309 --> 00:46:13,449
Yeah.

690
00:46:13,449 --> 00:46:13,469
Yeah.

691
00:46:13,469 --> 00:46:13,489
Yeah.

692
00:46:13,489 --> 00:46:13,510
Yeah.

693
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:13,530
Yeah.

694
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:13,550
Yeah.

695
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:13,570
Yeah.

696
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:13,630
Yeah.

697
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:13,650
Yeah.

698
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:13,670
Yeah.

699
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:13,690
Yeah.

700
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:13,789
Yeah.

701
00:46:13,789 --> 00:46:13,909
Yeah.

702
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:14,730
All these things.

703
00:46:14,969 --> 00:46:16,289
So absolutely.

704
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:24,429
And I think if you stop being curious or that curiosity leaves you,

705
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:30,130
maybe it's time to start then looking in other areas, you know,

706
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:35,349
but that's always fascinated me and that's all we learn, you know.

707
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:39,869
History and Michael Malthouse always would say to me,

708
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:41,230
history is a wonderful teacher.

709
00:46:41,409 --> 00:46:42,590
History is a wonderful teacher.

710
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:43,590
And I would go, oh, okay.

711
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:44,090
Right.

712
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:45,989
So if you want to know something, go back.

713
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:46,809
What happened here?

714
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:47,969
How did they do that?

715
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:54,630
And then the issue or the way forward may be a little bit different, but it just, it's

716
00:46:54,630 --> 00:47:01,170
the way you can get yourself thinking about breaking down barriers and how to be the best

717
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:03,829
you can be so you can bring people along with that journey.

718
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:08,050
Communicating with clarity, Danny, is a dimension we talk about a lot.

719
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:11,190
And you've gone about that in a really profound way.

720
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:11,250
Yeah.

721
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:11,309
Yeah.

722
00:47:11,309 --> 00:47:11,349
Yeah.

723
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:11,369
Yeah.

724
00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:11,389
Yeah.

725
00:47:11,389 --> 00:47:11,489
Yeah.

726
00:47:11,489 --> 00:47:11,550
Yeah.

727
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:11,829
Yeah.

728
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:11,849
Yeah.

729
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:12,010
Yeah.

730
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:12,070
Yeah.

731
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:12,090
Yeah.

732
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:12,110
Yeah.

733
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:12,190
Yeah.

734
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:12,250
Yeah.

735
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:12,289
Yeah.

736
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:12,349
Yeah.

737
00:47:12,349 --> 00:47:12,429
Yeah.

738
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:12,489
Yeah.

739
00:47:12,489 --> 00:47:12,750
Yeah.

740
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:13,030
Yeah.

741
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:13,570
Yeah.

742
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:13,929
Brilliant.

743
00:47:14,349 --> 00:47:18,949
Produced by Luke Tunnicliffe and JamTV, a great friend of mine.

744
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:20,510
He's done a fantastic job with you.

745
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:21,289
You've written a book.

746
00:47:21,429 --> 00:47:27,289
You're speaking about this in a very articulately, and you're getting your story across really

747
00:47:27,289 --> 00:47:27,550
well.

748
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:32,030
Have you really thought about it or is it just unfolded and you've been able to just

749
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:32,869
take the opportunities?

750
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:35,570
No, it hasn't just unfolded.

751
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:37,829
It may seem that way.

752
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:41,090
I've spent a whole lifetime of rehearsing this, Luke.

753
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:49,710
it's with real clarity now that I can communicate with the way that I feel and

754
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:57,889
that's very therapeutic for me now in so many different ways the way it came out I also think

755
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:08,289
the narrative of how it all came out was quite unkind going back a few years and I wanted to

756
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:18,389
articulate my story and my my family story so people would understand my journey and and our

757
00:48:18,389 --> 00:48:26,409
journey and and and and take control of that narrative but also the keeping it trying to

758
00:48:26,409 --> 00:48:36,210
keeping it quite basic using a lot of analogies from past experience in you know wrapping football

759
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:37,789
around into a

760
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:45,989
analogy of what I was dealing with with gender dysphoria or and getting people to get give them

761
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:53,610
a light bulb moment where they go ah okay and keep it very simple for them that way they can take

762
00:48:53,610 --> 00:49:01,130
one or two gold nuggets away and that if they go and tell another two or three people and then

763
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:06,429
those two people go and tell two or three people that's how we grow education that's how we grow

764
00:49:06,429 --> 00:49:07,869
support guidance

765
00:49:08,289 --> 00:49:15,050
um and you know even culture in society it's fascinating to me Dan I love what you said I've

766
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:20,949
been rehearsing for this my entire life and I go back to you you know in your early 20s you walk

767
00:49:20,949 --> 00:49:26,829
into a nightclub in Melbourne you meet a group of trans girls and they say to you some stage

768
00:49:26,829 --> 00:49:31,829
you're going to tell this story and we're here for you is that the rehearsal to get to this point

769
00:49:31,829 --> 00:49:38,130
that it was always going to happen so and that yes it was but that was a very slow burn

770
00:49:38,289 --> 00:49:44,070
at the start they I wouldn't I didn't say anything so it was I'm asking all these questions

771
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:51,909
just fishing away fishing away just trying you know uh trying to walk away with something um

772
00:49:51,909 --> 00:49:57,190
because you know even in the late 80s there's no there's no internet still back in those days

773
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:08,050
you know the resources were few and far between um you know but from that time and then

774
00:50:08,289 --> 00:50:14,530
the other times and and there was there's been quite a few but it's always been at that point

775
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:24,349
secret safe with us you're we're here if we um if you need us um reach out any time um I went

776
00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:35,389
through a really bad stage in my mid to late 20s um and my marriage at the time wasn't going that

777
00:50:35,389 --> 00:50:37,389
that well um

778
00:50:38,289 --> 00:50:44,590
and the genesis four and I said you're not I'm leaving I'm leaving I can't do this anymore I

779
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:50,469
don't even know what this thing is blah blah blah and they said no no no you stay there we're here

780
00:50:50,469 --> 00:50:59,230
to support you through that period and they were and and they did um and you know they could have

781
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:06,929
been like the Victorian police they could have done a hell of a lot of things um and I'm very

782
00:51:06,929 --> 00:51:08,090
very grateful for that

783
00:51:08,289 --> 00:51:10,230
Danny who's been the greatest leader in your life

784
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:27,590
I'd say the the person there's probably three who got me through my young years and teenage years

785
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:34,989
and got me to that point of when I did get picked in the state school boys um then obviously I had

786
00:51:34,989 --> 00:51:39,969
some great coaches you know coming through but I'll say my first football

787
00:51:39,989 --> 00:51:49,010
coach is his name was Tom James um so I had him all through my um junior career he actually lost

788
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:59,429
his uh only son to leukemia when we were about 11 and he became a father figure to me um and it

789
00:51:59,429 --> 00:52:06,250
was always talking about you know working hard being a good person because at that point in time

790
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:09,969
in my life I was still I was quite intense I was quite intense I was quite intense I was quite intense

791
00:52:09,989 --> 00:52:16,650
I wouldn't let many people in um and he really took me under my wing and I felt really safe

792
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:25,670
with him and I could be um the best person um that you know he made me the best person but also um

793
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:33,670
hopefully I'm thinking a good um a good person as well as a good footballer and he influenced

794
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:39,670
me all the way up until I was 16 and then he left and became um

795
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:46,070
the Colts coach which which is for the people who you know interstate um is the equivalent to the

796
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:54,949
TAC under 18s competition um so when I left junior footy he still was my coach um and then he became

797
00:52:54,949 --> 00:53:00,670
the the um the chairman of the West Perth football club and the chairman of the Fremantle Dockers

798
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:08,929
um and he was always there for me the whole way through to have uh not too much of that

799
00:53:08,929 --> 00:53:09,969
do more of this and do more of that and do more of that and do more of that and do more of that

800
00:53:09,989 --> 00:53:17,989
um and I was it was I was so very very grateful um until he he passed away I had a another one

801
00:53:17,989 --> 00:53:24,869
Paul Lucas who did exactly the same thing uh as my cricket coach um because look I was lucky enough

802
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:33,670
to play state cricket up until for WA up until you know 1984 I think it was um with our friend

803
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:39,969
Skinny Brayshaw um um and he did exactly the same thing um and he did exactly the same thing

804
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:51,030
um life at home not that flash um so they just made you safe and feel felt worthy and self-esteem

805
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:59,329
um so I'm forever grateful for that so but overriding those two um is my my nana she died

806
00:53:59,329 --> 00:54:07,489
in 2015 she was 94 and because of the disease of addictions he outlasted two husbands and three

807
00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:09,969
her three children who were diseased and she died in 2015 and she was 94 and because of the

808
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:15,510
disease of addiction as well and I lived with her for quite a few years from a very young age

809
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:22,929
and she loved me for me um she provided a safe space she kicked a footy out the back with me

810
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:30,750
every single day or in cricket season she you know handsaw a piece of wood um make a cricket

811
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:38,349
bat and I'd bowl to her or she um bowled to me for hours upon hours upon hours and she was just

812
00:54:38,349 --> 00:54:39,610
the most beautiful

813
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:39,969
you

814
00:54:39,989 --> 00:54:44,989
uh woman and I I'm thinking that I learned a lot of those

815
00:54:44,989 --> 00:54:54,010
stuff that we talk about now has been ingrained in me from you know a very a very young age um

816
00:54:54,010 --> 00:55:01,389
and then you get coaches you know um I had Dennis Cometti he was my first coach um

817
00:55:01,389 --> 00:55:09,050
and then I had Alexander, John Tide, Mick Malthouse um then Dennis Pagan um

818
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:14,050
you know they all bring bring their own you know Mick was more of a caring loving

819
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:22,150
um person but but particularly hard on on people um you know I never I'll never forget one thing

820
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:28,369
he said to me he goes I'll never give you a pat on the back um for the ability that your mum and

821
00:55:28,369 --> 00:55:34,449
dad gave you and I just thought wow that's that's pretty good you know because as we know to to

822
00:55:34,449 --> 00:55:39,030
be successful in the AFL competition you need to be successful in the AFL competition you need to be

823
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:44,829
you need more than that um and you know then obviously Dennis he was very rigid very structured

824
00:55:44,829 --> 00:55:53,110
um you know um basically well whatever was going in your life when you're driving the car park

825
00:55:53,110 --> 00:56:00,210
take your head off put it over there get up on the way out which was you know um it was a sign

826
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:06,929
of the times back then so I've had a lot of people who have shaped me over and I've been very very

827
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:08,670
lucky uh for that

828
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:13,050
I love asking that question because you see the influence don't you from a young age and how lucky

829
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:18,630
you are to have and your grandma a remarkable person and it's incredible to be able to listen

830
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:24,030
to that impact that still reference that now and understand what that had on you final question

831
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:29,010
Danny I love asking this as well we're passionate about collaboration and what happens when you get

832
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:33,309
great people together and how that works now and leadership's changed from hierarchy now to

833
00:56:33,309 --> 00:56:38,650
we think a healthier space where you do tend to collaborate if there was anyone in any of

834
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:42,829
your passions that you would love to collaborate is there a name that springs to mind it could be

835
00:56:42,829 --> 00:56:47,110
um in the chapter you're experiencing now or something else you're passionate about is there

836
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:54,349
a person that you would love to collaborate with in the sporting field um talking about the cut

837
00:56:54,349 --> 00:57:00,630
and thrust of winning and coaching journeys and developing people and leaving a legacy um and I

838
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:08,530
actually know this person reasonably well um Ange Postacoglu like you know he's um

839
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:16,070
I very first met him when he was coaching the um the Victorian or the Australian under-19s

840
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:25,750
um team when I very first came to Melbourne in like mid-90s um and just to see his journey so

841
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:31,130
and I've had a few chats with him over the years but to be able to just

842
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:38,630
walk beside him and have a chat something like that would be would be awesome um

843
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:46,150
and I suppose you know I'm that's not just to do with football world football or our football

844
00:57:46,150 --> 00:58:03,150
the other um the other person um is um a a young trans girl who I've known now for a few years

845
00:58:03,469 --> 00:58:08,409
and she is such a role model and her way of

846
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:18,190
leaving a legacy is she's an actor um and she's done some great played some great roles in um TV

847
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:30,010
series um as herself as a transgender girl um and um I'm a bit of a dinosaur now um and this

848
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:38,590
