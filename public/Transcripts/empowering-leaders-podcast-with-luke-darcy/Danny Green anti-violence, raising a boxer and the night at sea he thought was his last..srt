1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Danny Green is a legend of Australian sport.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,280
He's the only Australian boxer to win four world titles

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,040
across three different weight divisions,

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:09,779
having previously represented his country at Commonwealth

5
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:11,699
and Olympic Games level as an amateur.

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,380
Danny is highly respected in the community for his philanthropy

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,140
and passion for supporting people from all ages and walks of life.

8
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:23,800
Danny Green has dedicated himself and self-funded his anti-violence movement,

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,300
the Cowards Punch Campaign,

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,039
aimed at preventing senseless and unnecessary attacks on helpless victims.

11
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,780
Danny's efforts has resulted in a change in the vernacular

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,500
from what was previously labelled a king hit or a one-punch attack,

13
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,380
seemingly glorifying the sickening acts

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,939
to now the term used everywhere as Cowards Punch,

15
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:48,159
a legacy that may well outweigh Danny Green's extraordinary achievements

16
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,039
in the boxing room.

17
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,200
Danny, it's always good to see you.

18
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:50,820
Thanks for joining me.

19
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:51,979
Thanks for having me, Luke.

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,799
It's been a long time, mate.

21
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:54,640
It has been too long, Danny.

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,380
I look at the screen and I see a good-looking young surfer from Perth.

23
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,159
How did you go on and become an international boxing star?

24
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:08,299
Well, I've gone the full circle because I'm surfing more than I've ever surfed

25
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:09,040
in my life now.

26
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,480
So I don't know, mate.

27
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:13,379
I guess I could ask you the same question.

28
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:15,019
You kick it back doing what you're doing.

29
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,420
You don't look a day over 35, mate.

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,359
So you've kept in great nick in your career.

31
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:24,500
I guess you might agree to help me out here with this question that we'll answer.

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,120
But I don't really – when I was doing it and I was younger and I was really

33
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,099
pushing and striving, I didn't really think I was going to be a champion

34
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:35,739
and I didn't really think I was going to achieve what I did.

35
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,140
I wanted to and I dreamt of it, but I didn't.

36
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,480
I wasn't so self-assured.

37
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,879
Like with someone like yourself, were you always like,

38
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm going to be an AFL superstar?

39
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:47,939
Was that what you thought when you were young or you just pushed towards it?

40
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,760
It's a good reflection, Danny, isn't it?

41
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,799
Because I think as a kid, I could picture myself, that's me and what I want to be.

42
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:54,620
But a lot of times –

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,859
On the way, you always got injured.

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,560
Am I good enough?

45
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:01,500
Am I going to be able to compete at this level?

46
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,640
So I think the doubt is always there.

47
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,140
And you're right.

48
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,479
You're probably so focused on trying to do it, you don't overthink about getting

49
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,259
to the end point.

50
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,840
But I suppose I'm asking the question, Danny, because I look around the world

51
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,379
of boxing and this may be a generalization that's wrong.

52
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,280
And I think most kids come potentially from broken families or the hardest

53
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,680
to know.

54
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,319
The Mike Tyson story where dysfunctional kids,

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,099
dysfunctional family.

56
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:28,759
And I look at Danny Green, I think, you know, from a really solid family

57
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:32,219
and there are a lot of other choices to go on to be one of the –

58
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,560
an internationally regarded boxer.

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,120
Is that, you know, maybe more surprising?

60
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:38,500
Probably – I don't know, mate.

61
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,960
No, because I started – my old man got me into karate.

62
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,539
He was a farmer from back in the day.

63
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,740
My old man was very old school and he was a farmer on the wheat belt,

64
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,360
wheat and sheep.

65
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,539
And then him and my mother ran into drought three years in a row.

66
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:53,639
So my sisters and them came to the city, but my brother was just born.

67
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,180
Then I was born.

68
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,099
A couple of years later, then Dad started working at Huntley Jacks

69
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:58,580
and 38 years later retired.

70
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,199
So Dad was, you know, very working class and worked his butt off

71
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,460
and instilled some great values in us kids.

72
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,639
And we were very, very blessed, as you said, Luke,

73
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:09,740
to have a very tight family unit.

74
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,120
Yeah, we had ups and downs.

75
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,340
Like all families do, you know, you have your ups and downs.

76
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,240
But generally speaking, we were very blessed to have a mother

77
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,319
and a father that were both completely invested in all our lives.

78
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,740
And then our father passed in 18.

79
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,300
But Mum's still with us.

80
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,460
And she's still kicking and she's still invested in our lives.

81
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,259
And we're very fortunate.

82
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:32,000
And then myself and my wife were invested heavily in our children's lives.

83
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,199
So it's flowed on to that.

84
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,840
But for me, boxing, Dad got me into fighting.

85
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:36,620
He loved fighting.

86
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,620
My old man was old school.

87
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,900
He was a bit of a knockabout, the old boy.

88
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:41,680
And he loved the game.

89
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:43,099
He didn't really want me to fight.

90
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,759
He got me into karate early so I could, you know, protect myself.

91
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,419
He wanted me to be able to and my brother to be able to look after ourselves.

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,780
It just went from there.

93
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,659
I fell in love with it.

94
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,379
And then when Dad took me down to Nookaburra Hotel,

95
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:54,159
which is a...

96
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,300
Yeah.

97
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,199
It used to be an iconic hotel here in Perth.

98
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,400
Pretty rough old joint.

99
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:00,460
That was Dad's local down the road.

100
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,419
And we were down there.

101
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:03,819
I was there 13 years old, 12 years old,

102
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,500
watching Jeff Fennec win his first world title against Shingaki in 1985.

103
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,340
I was in my PJs, propped up on the bar,

104
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:11,699
looking around with these blokes going mad,

105
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,740
going...

106
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,819
And look at the TV going,

107
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,300
I think I want to do that.

108
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:16,519
Extraordinary, isn't it?

109
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,579
Your dad was one of 11, as you said,

110
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,199
from the weak belt in country WA

111
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,459
and came down and, you know,

112
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:24,060
after drought,

113
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,459
ran the Hungry Jack store.

114
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,019
You said you got into mixed martial arts as a kid.

115
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,459
It was about maybe learning to protect yourself.

116
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:35,480
Do you look now and think perhaps if that era was brought forward

117
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,300
that you might have been in the UFC

118
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,139
or would that have been a path you might have taken?

119
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,019
It was a bit early for UFC.

120
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,959
So I started boxing,

121
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,540
my first amateur fight in 1992

122
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,899
and I had a couple of kickboxing fights before that

123
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:48,000
and I got my black belt in karate when I was 17.

124
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:49,420
All I did was hold my pants up, look.

125
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,019
You know, but I was around that for a long time.

126
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:53,339
I was competing in contact,

127
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:55,279
full contact tournaments from the age of 15

128
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,319
so I really loved it

129
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,959
but I actually always wanted to box

130
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,480
because my father loved it.

131
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,620
I used to watch Wildwood Sports on Sunday mornings.

132
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,100
You know, Kenny Sutcliffe would bring us all the highlights

133
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,680
from Roberto Duran and Sugar Ray Leonard

134
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,199
and my favourite Thomas the Hitman Hearns

135
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,860
and marvellous Marvin Haglis.

136
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,560
I'd watch those guys on TV going,

137
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,279
fuck, I want to do that.

138
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,699
But I didn't realise I gravitated towards it

139
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:17,800
and then my father's,

140
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,519
a guy that my father worked with,

141
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:20,180
the Hungry Jacks,

142
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,220
was a little Burmese guy

143
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,779
that emigrated from Burma with his family

144
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:23,199
and his brothers.

145
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:25,620
And he was in line at Hungry Jacks one day

146
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,100
to get a job

147
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,060
and the old man saw him and said,

148
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:27,699
come on in, mate.

149
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,360
You look like a hard worker.

150
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:28,899
And they had a chat.

151
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,860
Dad gave him a go

152
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,300
and they became very, very close, mate.

153
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,680
So close that, you know,

154
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,959
he was holding my father's hand

155
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,339
when he took his last breath as we were

156
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:38,300
so he was really close with us.

157
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,180
And he was my very first boxing coach,

158
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,199
little Burmese guy.

159
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,600
He looks like Mr. Miyagi.

160
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:43,540
My name's Daniel.

161
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,660
He used to call me Daniel's son.

162
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,600
He'd never seen the bloody movie Karate Kid.

163
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:48,759
But it was magic, mate.

164
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,899
And yeah, from when I met Pat,

165
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,379
my first,

166
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:53,259
I used to go watch Pat's son,

167
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:54,879
box amateur when we were younger as well.

168
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,079
Dad would take us to the fights.

169
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,680
I've always gravitated

170
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,800
and wanted to be a boxer.

171
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:00,560
And then since I had my very first

172
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,519
training session with Pat,

173
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:02,639
that was it.

174
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,980
I was completely hooked.

175
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:04,839
Danny, it's a great,

176
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,199
I didn't know that part of your story.

177
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:08,519
It's the best of multicultural Australia,

178
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,100
isn't it?

179
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,720
Burmese friends as parents goes on

180
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,759
to train Danny Green,

181
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,600
a four-time world champion

182
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,980
as it turns out.

183
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:18,000
And, you know,

184
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,360
I look at your history, Danny,

185
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,019
as I said in the intro,

186
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:21,399
you've done things others

187
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,639
have never been able to achieve

188
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,319
in Australia.

189
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:23,899
In boxing.

190
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:25,279
But to me,

191
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,240
I think I even gain more respect for you.

192
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,120
And I go to that night

193
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,339
that all of us will remember,

194
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,259
17th of May, 2006,

195
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:33,560
your first fight against Anthony Mundine.

196
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,779
Record still for pay-per-view event

197
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:37,819
in Australian sport.

198
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,959
And it's a fight that you ended up losing.

199
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,420
But I think your words immediately,

200
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,500
and I can only imagine

201
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,079
what that would have been like,

202
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,019
that huge event

203
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:48,879
and every pub in Australia is full

204
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,920
and you're either in the Mundine camp

205
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,360
or the Danny Green camp.

206
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:52,959
But you said,

207
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:53,519
afterwards,

208
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,360
straight away,

209
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:55,540
simple as that,

210
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:57,300
I was beaten by a better man

211
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:57,959
on the night.

212
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,399
How did you find that integrity

213
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,279
after such a disappointing moment

214
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,480
right after it happened?

215
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,339
I guess if I had my time back

216
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:07,339
in many of my interviews,

217
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:08,639
I would have said different things.

218
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,639
You know, hindsight's a wonderful thing, Luke,

219
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,800
as we all can appreciate.

220
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,000
But I wouldn't have changed

221
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,839
what I said that night.

222
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:15,240
You know,

223
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,699
I was beaten fair and square

224
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:17,839
on the night by Mundine.

225
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:18,560
He did the job.

226
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,459
There's no point talking about

227
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:21,959
some of the immense hardships

228
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:22,759
physically and emotionally

229
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,819
that I went through

230
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,180
leading up to that fight.

231
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,199
There's no point worrying about that

232
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,639
because it doesn't matter.

233
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,000
We were both in there

234
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,899
trying to knock each other out

235
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:31,259
and he won on points

236
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,839
and he fought a great fight.

237
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,720
He had a...

238
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,420
And I now know the training camp

239
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:35,899
that he had.

240
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,480
I've looked back

241
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,620
and spoken with his father

242
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,980
and I've known Tony for a long time.

243
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,600
He's a great man.

244
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:41,180
And Choc and I,

245
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,439
you know,

246
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,639
we've broken bread

247
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,959
and for me,

248
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:44,959
it was never a hatred

249
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,819
or never a particular dislike.

250
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:47,300
It was just,

251
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:47,939
I'm a better fighter.

252
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,560
He thought he's a better fighter

253
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,139
and it went on for a long time

254
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:52,600
and,

255
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:52,959
you know,

256
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:53,259
right,

257
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,060
it's still going on

258
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,800
because if I die tomorrow,

259
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,639
I'll die knowing

260
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,759
I'm a better fighter than Choc

261
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,439
and he'll probably be at my funeral

262
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,199
telling people

263
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,459
that he's a better fighter than me

264
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:02,480
even though I'm fucking dead.

265
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,300
So,

266
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,160
it's a genuine rivalry

267
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,420
that will go to where it's gone

268
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,120
and I think that's what made it work

269
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,480
because,

270
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,300
you know,

271
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,620
it was genuine

272
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,680
but it was,

273
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:13,040
for me,

274
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,100
it was never really personal much

275
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,899
at all.

276
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,180
I think the media,

277
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:18,259
as you know,

278
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:18,459
Luke,

279
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,920
the media really helps mould

280
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,740
and shape things

281
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,259
and they really love to go down

282
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:22,579
the road

283
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:22,819
with the,

284
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:23,279
you know,

285
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:23,879
the Muslim,

286
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,660
indigenous angle

287
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,100
and me being the Catholic white fella

288
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,779
where I'm an atheist

289
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:29,139
and I'm,

290
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:29,420
you know,

291
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:31,500
I had nothing to do with religion.

292
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,139
It doesn't mean really much to me

293
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:35,159
and it was kind of skewed that way

294
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,820
by the media

295
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,879
and Choc ran with it

296
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,860
because he knows what's good for sales.

297
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:39,759
So,

298
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:39,980
it was,

299
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:40,620
after the fight,

300
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,399
it was what it was.

301
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,279
I'm severely concussed,

302
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,460
you know,

303
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,139
you bust it up

304
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:44,960
and,

305
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:45,480
you know,

306
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,559
I just wanted to pay respects

307
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,399
to the bloke

308
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,559
and that's how I was raised,

309
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:48,799
mate.

310
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:49,919
Shake hands,

311
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,860
look the guy in the eye,

312
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,620
cop it sweet,

313
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,919
cop it on the chin,

314
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:53,460
move forward

315
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,399
and go back next time

316
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:54,860
and do better.

317
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,159
So,

318
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:55,960
that was it,

319
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:56,120
mate.

320
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:57,440
I don't think it was something

321
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,120
that I tried to do.

322
00:08:58,179 --> 00:08:59,159
It was just how I've been raised

323
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,240
by my old man and my mum

324
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,500
and that's how we are

325
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,419
and that's how you are.

326
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,539
It's how a majority of people

327
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:05,000
I'd like to think are.

328
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:05,720
Yeah,

329
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:06,720
but you've still got to do it

330
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,220
in the moment,

331
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:07,559
Danny,

332
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,019
and I think that,

333
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:08,460
to me,

334
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,559
I remember watching the screen

335
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,059
and I think there's nothing

336
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,440
harder to watch

337
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,620
than a fighter

338
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,600
at the end of a fight

339
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,399
that hasn't won

340
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,899
because it's the ultimate

341
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:17,720
combat sport,

342
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,080
isn't it?

343
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,440
I feel great empathy

344
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,019
immediately

345
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:20,440
and I think,

346
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,220
you know,

347
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,340
in a footy game,

348
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,340
there's 17 teammates

349
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,120
to share that with.

350
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:24,899
You know,

351
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,200
in the square circle,

352
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:27,019
as you guys say,

353
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,259
you've got only yourself

354
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:28,759
and,

355
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:29,580
you know,

356
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,000
as you said,

357
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,360
it's well known

358
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,279
that the amount of weight

359
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:32,940
you had to lose

360
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,820
leading into that,

361
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,159
you know,

362
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,279
left you dehydrated

363
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,740
and there were plenty

364
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,580
of reasons for you

365
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,379
to say,

366
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:38,659
hey,

367
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,440
I wasn't at my best

368
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,039
on the night

369
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,460
but it takes integrity

370
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,000
to choose

371
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,820
just to cop the values

372
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,460
at the time.

373
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,279
Is that,

374
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:46,720
as you said,

375
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,440
just how you're raised

376
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,399
and how you raise your kids?

377
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,100
Yeah,

378
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:50,419
I'd like to think

379
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:51,200
that my children

380
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,799
behave in the same manner,

381
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:53,000
mate.

382
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:55,039
And the Anthony Mundine rivalry,

383
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,419
I'll ask you again,

384
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:56,759
it's,

385
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,899
it captivated all of us,

386
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,059
Danny,

387
00:09:59,139 --> 00:09:59,379
didn't it?

388
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,679
Remember that night,

389
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,679
it was such a big night

390
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,799
in every bar

391
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,580
and you thought

392
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,159
that there was

393
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,039
that long-running feud

394
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,340
so it's great to hear

395
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,039
that over time

396
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:08,899
there's that respect

397
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,659
and even caught up

398
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:10,940
with his father,

399
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,220
Danny,

400
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:12,019
so the two of you,

401
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,720
if you catch up,

402
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,460
you're broken bread

403
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,860
and happy to share a beer?

404
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,500
Well,

405
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:18,480
both of us don't drink

406
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:18,779
so,

407
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,399
you know,

408
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,120
I go like this

409
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,399
with you

410
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:20,659
for a while,

411
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:21,580
I feel like I went

412
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:21,919
and chocked,

413
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,600
never drank

414
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,620
and that's something

415
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,240
that I really,

416
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,360
really admire

417
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
and respect about him too,

418
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,600
you know,

419
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,179
he's never drunk,

420
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,779
never smoked,

421
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:28,580
never touched drugs

422
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,080
and he's a very,

423
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,279
very clean living bloke

424
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:31,480
and,

425
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,460
you know,

426
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
there's a lot to admire

427
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:33,919
about that

428
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,039
and it's a lot

429
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,000
that people from today's

430
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,379
youth,

431
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:37,799
you know,

432
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,500
should look at

433
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:38,919
and take,

434
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:39,460
you know,

435
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:40,500
take something away

436
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:40,840
from that

437
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,980
and I gave up the grog

438
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,879
nearly five years ago

439
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,799
so we'll have a cup of tea

440
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,200
and a laugh

441
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,539
but yeah,

442
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,360
we've spoken,

443
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,159
we've seen each other

444
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:47,980
on a few occasions,

445
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,120
I've commentated

446
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,039
his son's first

447
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:50,899
professional fight,

448
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,740
I've always been

449
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,840
very respectful of his father

450
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,399
because I grew up

451
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,460
watching TV ringside,

452
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,279
my old man had me

453
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,220
watching TV ringside

454
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,100
so that Tony Mundine

455
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,779
and Hector Thompson

456
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:01,019
and Kahuma Hunga fights,

457
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:01,379
you know,

458
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,500
they're legendary fights

459
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,080
back in the day

460
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,120
and Sharky Raymond

461
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,820
and all those boys

462
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,559
so I grew up

463
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,179
with a great respect

464
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:07,639
for Tony

465
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,559
and then obviously,

466
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,200
you know,

467
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,500
to be in such a massive fight,

468
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,779
it was pretty bizarre,

469
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,399
I remember driving

470
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,019
to the venue

471
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:14,639
on the night

472
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,820
and we were doing it

473
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,600
so we didn't really know

474
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,320
how big it was

475
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,639
and I don't think anyone knew

476
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:19,500
how big the pay-per-view

477
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,019
was going to go,

478
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,139
so Foxtel,

479
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,100
again,

480
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:22,779
you know,

481
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,820
proved how good they are,

482
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,080
they ran out of people,

483
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,580
the phone line shut down,

484
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:28,299
they couldn't cover

485
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:29,399
and to be fair,

486
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,559
in the future,

487
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,879
they did it numerous times

488
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:32,860
when we had pay-per-views

489
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,000
and they should have

490
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,480
handled it

491
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,019
and should have been

492
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,059
equipped way better

493
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:36,820
but the first one,

494
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,500
to be fair,

495
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,440
they just didn't realise

496
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,360
the enormity

497
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,399
of how many people

498
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,559
wanted to see the fight,

499
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,919
I don't think that record

500
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,659
has ever been broken,

501
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,639
they can talk about it

502
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,039
in the media,

503
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,820
they can throw numbers around,

504
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,179
it ain't going to get touched

505
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:49,480
and the second one

506
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:49,960
was myself,

507
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,000
and the third one,

508
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:51,840
the third highest

509
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,379
still rates

510
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,120
is myself

511
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,059
and Mundine's remap,

512
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,139
so the top three

513
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:57,059
Choc and I have got,

514
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:57,840
I've got three,

515
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,600
he's got two of them,

516
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,639
so I've got one up

517
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,200
in the end of the Choc,

518
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,240
I've got three pay-per-views

519
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,039
but yeah,

520
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,759
it was pretty bizarre,

521
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,399
driving down Cleveland Street

522
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,159
which is an artery

523
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,100
from where I was

524
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,120
in Newtown to the city

525
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,519
to go to Aussie Stadium,

526
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:11,960
there was pubs

527
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,460
that had barriers

528
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,840
and traffic cones

529
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,139
out on the road

530
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:16,720
because people

531
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,419
were spilled out

532
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:18,399
onto the footpath

533
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,039
and there was all these

534
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,019
high-vis security guys

535
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:20,799
and all these pubs

536
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:21,279
were driving down

537
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:21,919
because it's quite a busy

538
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:22,159
artery,

539
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:22,940
Cleveland Street

540
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,919
with a fair few pubs

541
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,399
and it was packed

542
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,019
and that's when I went

543
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:27,179
driving past

544
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,100
looking at these people

545
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,620
all spinning out

546
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,580
of the pubs

547
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,360
on all the pubs

548
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,200
on the way to the venue,

549
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,320
I was like,

550
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:33,779
wow,

551
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,340
this is a big deal,

552
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,159
this is full on

553
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,580
and as it turns out

554
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:37,799
it was,

555
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,039
yeah,

556
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:39,120
it went gangbusters

557
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,340
and Choc and I

558
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:40,960
had a great run,

559
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:41,419
we dominated

560
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:42,860
the pay-per-views

561
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,419
for 15 years,

562
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,139
16 years,

563
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,860
17 years,

564
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,139
it was a great run

565
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:48,360
and we're both

566
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,799
very, very appreciative

567
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,759
of being in each

568
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:51,519
other's careers,

569
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:52,779
having enriched

570
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:53,600
each other's careers

571
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,019
I feel.

572
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,679
I love hearing you

573
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,539
say that Danny,

574
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,720
it's a great end point

575
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,100
isn't it,

576
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,799
after a rivalry like that

577
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,639
to finish where

578
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,940
the two of you are

579
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,759
and I sometimes think

580
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,159
the ultimate alpha male

581
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,559
to me is the combat sport,

582
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,840
Danny Greens

583
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,980
and Anthony Munday

584
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,580
as you put it all

585
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:08,980
on the line

586
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,860
and go in the ring

587
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,100
and then to hear

588
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,259
that you guys

589
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,200
are such self-aware

590
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,500
that you can give up

591
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:15,759
drinking

592
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:16,200
and say,

593
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:16,500
you know what,

594
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,360
I don't need to do that

595
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,860
as well,

596
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
that that leadership

597
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,600
of self

598
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,059
transfers into other

599
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:22,059
areas of your life,

600
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,220
it's a great example,

601
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:24,600
is that how you felt

602
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,039
about it,

603
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,539
that you just,

604
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,679
you get to know yourself

605
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,139
pretty well

606
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:27,700
when you're a fighter?

607
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,480
Yeah,

608
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:29,059
you know,

609
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,659
I love to beer mate,

610
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,360
no one loves to beer

611
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:31,980
more than me

612
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,559
and I just did beer,

613
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,659
all I did was drink beer,

614
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:35,259
that's it,

615
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,919
didn't drink spirits,

616
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,039
occasionally I'd drink spirits

617
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,139
when I had way too many beers

618
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:40,820
but being a hyperactive bloke

619
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,879
I was the first to start

620
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:42,480
and I didn't want

621
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,279
the party to finish,

622
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:43,480
you know,

623
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:43,659
I was like,

624
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:44,120
come on boy,

625
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,820
let's get going,

626
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:45,120
you know,

627
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,559
and I had to give

628
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,039
and my father gave up

629
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,440
drinking around the same age,

630
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,139
and you know,

631
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,159
I'm telling my son,

632
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:53,019
I don't want my son

633
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:54,000
or my daughter to drink

634
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,820
and my daughter's been,

635
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,860
she's,

636
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,179
you know,

637
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:56,779
dabbled in a little bit

638
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:57,200
of alcohol

639
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,460
and she's never,

640
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,460
never to our,

641
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,740
to our delight,

642
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:02,820
she's not touched drugs

643
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,120
and she's never going to

644
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,500
because she,

645
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:04,899
it just,

646
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,059
it terrifies her

647
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:08,159
and alcohol's not really

648
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,419
a part of her life whatsoever,

649
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:10,799
she's 22 very soon

650
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:11,779
and my boy's only 16

651
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:12,799
and he's,

652
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:13,799
he's on a path

653
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,360
to doing something

654
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:14,940
with his life

655
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,620
and we just,

656
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,980
you know,

657
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:18,779
particularly as a young bloke,

658
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,379
alcohol,

659
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,000
um,

660
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,360
drugs it goes that same

661
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,159
but alcohol I think

662
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:22,679
is more damaging,

663
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,840
that'll ruin whatever

664
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
aspirations you have

665
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,559
of making anything

666
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,039
of your life,

667
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,299
particularly at a young age

668
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,940
and I couldn't tell him,

669
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:29,360
hey mate,

670
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,159
I don't want you drinking

671
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,179
if I'm still drinking

672
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:32,159
so I had to give it away.

673
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:33,299
Yeah,

674
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,759
which is great leadership

675
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,279
in itself.

676
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:35,519
Dan,

677
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,299
go to New Year's Eve 2012

678
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:38,820
and tragically,

679
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,419
a young man

680
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:40,600
by the name of Daniel Christie

681
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,860
was cowardly attacking

682
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,879
King's Cross,

683
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,820
he was minding his own

684
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,779
business that night

685
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:46,720
and he lost his life,

686
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,019
it,

687
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,419
it changed your life

688
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:48,980
as well Danny

689
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,519
when you look

690
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:49,899
back,

691
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,080
why did you feel

692
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,919
so compelled

693
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,120
after that

694
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,840
to make a stand?

695
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,860
I don't really know

696
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,039
look,

697
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:56,559
I guess,

698
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,440
I'm,

699
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:57,799
I'm,

700
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,279
I'm a bit

701
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,799
torn between

702
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,799
anti-violence

703
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,460
and violence

704
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:02,820
because

705
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,919
there,

706
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:04,860
I think there's a,

707
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,120
there's a necessity,

708
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:06,919
not necessity

709
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:07,879
but I think in violence

710
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:08,820
in some forms

711
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,639
regulates,

712
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,120
I think we could use

713
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,279
punishment

714
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,440
as,

715
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,379
as a regulator

716
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:16,820
and I don't mind

717
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,899
young blokes being,

718
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:18,620
I'm,

719
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:18,879
I'm,

720
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:19,120
I'm,

721
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,200
I'm completely opposed

722
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,100
to how young men

723
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,200
and young boys

724
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,980
are being shown

725
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,000
the right way

726
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,259
and the way to be

727
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:26,720
in our,

728
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,419
in our world

729
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:28,299
moving forward.

730
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,480
Young men have

731
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,500
a lot of testosterone,

732
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:31,840
it's a natural hormone,

733
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,879
we all know what it is.

734
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,340
Young women don't have

735
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,139
anywhere near as much,

736
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:35,960
they have a tiny bit

737
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,259
but they have mostly estrogen

738
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:38,360
which is a different

739
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:38,919
emotional,

740
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:39,720
you know,

741
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,100
hormone

742
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,220
and so then

743
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,360
when young boys

744
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:43,600
have,

745
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,379
are raging

746
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:45,759
and have testosterone

747
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,080
raging through their body

748
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,000
and they're told

749
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,879
to suppress it

750
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:49,039
and,

751
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,820
and keep it inside

752
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,860
and you can't do this,

753
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:51,559
you can't do that,

754
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,299
you're not allowed to tackle

755
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:53,159
on the footy field anymore,

756
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,700
you can't play British Bulldog

757
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,159
at school,

758
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,480
you can't bump and wrestle

759
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,320
and grind with your mates,

760
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:57,720
it's not,

761
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,059
it's,

762
00:15:58,059 --> 00:15:58,720
it's too violent,

763
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,360
it's too aggressive.

764
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,779
It's going to come out

765
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:01,500
in different areas

766
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,120
when they're older

767
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,740
down the track

768
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,039
in different scenarios

769
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,519
which is no good.

770
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,139
So,

771
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,139
young boys need,

772
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,340
not need to be violent

773
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,019
but they need to be,

774
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:10,139
they need to release

775
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:10,759
that aggression

776
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,120
and that aggression

777
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,240
needs to be channeled

778
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,659
because every boy has it

779
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:15,779
and I think it needs

780
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:16,299
to be amended

781
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:17,019
the way we're looking

782
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,299
at raising our young boys

783
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:18,879
in society

784
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:19,519
and but,

785
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:19,879
Yeah,

786
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,720
it's a great point Danny,

787
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:21,159
isn't it?

788
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,059
I'll jump in on that

789
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:22,500
for a second

790
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,100
and I'll ask you

791
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,799
coming back to the

792
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,759
Cowards Punch campaign

793
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,279
because it feels like

794
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,440
the needle has moved

795
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,039
as you said

796
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:28,879
to a point where

797
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,039
it's so confusing

798
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,440
for our young boys

799
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,100
growing up

800
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,740
and you listen to

801
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,379
Scott Galloway

802
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:34,360
who's an academic

803
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,000
on this

804
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,759
and really articulate

805
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,220
about,

806
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,279
you've got to let,

807
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,500
we want young boys

808
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,000
to grow up

809
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,179
to be strong young men

810
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:42,039
but as you said

811
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,960
in a regulated environment

812
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,120
competitive sport

813
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,019
and combat sports

814
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,019
are a great avenue

815
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:47,460
for that,

816
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:47,960
aren't they Danny?

817
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:48,840
It teaches you

818
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,100
a way as you said

819
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,039
to control emotions

820
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:51,919
and have the discipline

821
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:52,460
and have a life

822
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,059
like Danny Green's had

823
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:54,820
and if we try

824
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,360
and over correct that

825
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,840
we're trying to turn boys

826
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,259
into something

827
00:16:58,259 --> 00:16:59,220
that they never are

828
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,059
and never should be

829
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:00,639
and so is that

830
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,860
the point you're making

831
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,740
is that we've pushed

832
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,440
too far

833
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,059
and we've got to

834
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:05,339
in safe spaces

835
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,859
because that leads to

836
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,900
as you said

837
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,240
then these cowardly attacks

838
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,920
like there's nothing

839
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,099
brave about someone

840
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,599
king hitting

841
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,500
was the old term

842
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:13,859
you know

843
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,380
cowardly punching someone

844
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,299
out the front

845
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:16,859
of a nightclub

846
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:17,440
and you've taken

847
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,559
a stand against that

848
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:18,819
because

849
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,119
there's the line

850
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:20,579
in the sand

851
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:20,880
isn't it?

852
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,400
That behaviour

853
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,319
comes out of

854
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,299
cowardice

855
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:24,279
rather than courage

856
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:24,640
doesn't it?

857
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:25,460
Absolutely

858
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,539
and we'll touch on that

859
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:26,940
in a second

860
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,819
going back to your point

861
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,440
about the needle

862
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,460
shifting too far

863
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,480
with young boys

864
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:30,960
in particular

865
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,619
absolutely

866
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:33,359
it's become absurd

867
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,519
and everyone gets

868
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,839
a participation trophy

869
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:36,859
there's no need

870
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:37,420
to strive

871
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,299
to be successful

872
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:39,480
there's no need

873
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,000
to strive

874
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,640
to be better

875
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,480
or good

876
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,240
or better yourself

877
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,720
because you're going

878
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,259
to get a trophy

879
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:43,920
and everyone wins

880
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,519
and it's okay

881
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:46,160
I think that's a shit go

882
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,279
and that's teaching people

883
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,059
to be ordinary

884
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,259
and to be extraordinary

885
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:51,700
is almost looked at

886
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,980
upon as a bad thing now

887
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,079
I can't get my head

888
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:54,400
around it

889
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,779
and how does that

890
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:56,339
teach people

891
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:57,079
to strive

892
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,240
to be better

893
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,740
how does that

894
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,619
teach people

895
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:00,599
to come back

896
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,259
from a loss

897
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:01,779
to come back

898
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:02,579
from a setback

899
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:03,380
and improve

900
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,099
their own lives

901
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:05,240
through their mental health

902
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,180
through their mental strength

903
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,099
it doesn't matter

904
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:07,920
everyone gets it

905
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,880
I don't have to try

906
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,940
because it's not really

907
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,640
there's no point

908
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,339
we're all the same

909
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:13,460
but we're not all the same

910
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,339
and some people win

911
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:15,180
some people lose

912
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,359
some people do things

913
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:16,940
better than others

914
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,480
and some people

915
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,000
don't

916
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,779
do things better

917
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:19,319
that they're better

918
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:19,880
in other ways

919
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,099
and I think we need

920
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:24,720
to really quickly

921
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,079
change the needle

922
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,099
back to where it was

923
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:28,480
because a good friend

924
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:28,720
of mine

925
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,420
a very close friend

926
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:29,619
of mine

927
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:30,539
worked in juvenile

928
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:31,519
detention over here

929
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,200
in Bankshire Hill

930
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,900
which is the prison

931
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,859
for young kids over here

932
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:35,759
they get 10 year olds

933
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:36,539
12 year olds

934
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:37,680
they get 14 year olds

935
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,380
15 year olds

936
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,559
that are murderers

937
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,039
rapists and murderers

938
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,380
from a very young age

939
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,819
violent offenders

940
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:44,859
very violent

941
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:46,180
and they've had

942
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,400
a horrendous upbringing

943
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:47,960
and there's a

944
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:47,980
really

945
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,740
reason why

946
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,619
they are that way

947
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:50,700
they're not born that way

948
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,380
the majority aren't

949
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:51,960
born that way

950
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,900
there's a reason

951
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,259
trauma etc

952
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,900
has formed

953
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,720
the way they are

954
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,220
but in the jail

955
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,220
my mate Brooks

956
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,900
he would

957
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,200
he was a very strict

958
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,819
disciplinarian

959
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:02,859
and he used sport

960
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:03,619
and exercise

961
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:04,579
as a way

962
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:05,480
to harness

963
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,279
these young men

964
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,480
these young blokes

965
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:07,940
energy

966
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,740
harness their energy

967
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,759
and channel it

968
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:10,400
and funnel it

969
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,259
into the right way

970
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:12,839
and he swears

971
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:13,900
and he knows

972
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,339
nearly 30 years

973
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:16,220
working with young men

974
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,619
that are violent offenders

975
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:17,940
and he swears

976
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,039
they loved

977
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:19,819
the discipline

978
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:20,599
they loved

979
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,299
to be told

980
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:21,920
what to do

981
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,740
they respected

982
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,640
being told

983
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,119
what to do

984
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,220
they actually looked

985
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,240
for a person

986
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,160
to guide them

987
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,839
to lead them

988
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:28,839
and to tell them

989
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,640
no not right

990
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,220
that's not right

991
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,299
and sternly tell them

992
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:32,200
no that's not right

993
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,660
I'm not politically correct

994
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,779
I raise my kids

995
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:35,640
how I raise my kids

996
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,660
no one's going to tell me

997
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,940
how to raise my own offspring

998
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,160
because my kids

999
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,480
are going to have

1000
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,539
self-respect themselves

1001
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:41,539
that means if they

1002
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:42,319
respect themselves

1003
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,279
they're going to respect

1004
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:43,940
everyone else

1005
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,519
in the community

1006
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,259
and Danny

1007
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:46,440
that's why I love

1008
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,019
when you've got

1009
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,779
a four time world

1010
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:48,160
champion

1011
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,559
who's made a living

1012
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:50,299
out of violence

1013
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:50,940
and better than

1014
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,579
anyone else

1015
00:19:51,579 --> 00:19:52,900
saying hey

1016
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,720
this is cowardly

1017
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,539
this is something

1018
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:55,779
that I'm not going

1019
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:56,220
to accept

1020
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:56,960
so you're the

1021
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,019
perfect voice

1022
00:19:58,019 --> 00:19:58,400
for that

1023
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,839
because you know

1024
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,299
no one has got

1025
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:02,140
more courage

1026
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,240
than you and your

1027
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
colleagues in your sport

1028
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,539
so when you take a stand

1029
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:06,400
you've changed

1030
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,200
the needle on that

1031
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,420
it's now part of

1032
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,539
how we speak about it

1033
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:10,140
that must make you

1034
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:10,579
really proud

1035
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:12,519
yeah it does

1036
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:13,059
look it's

1037
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:14,380
it's something

1038
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,059
that many people

1039
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:15,480
have asked

1040
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:15,940
over the years

1041
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,480
and they've stopped

1042
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,380
asking it so much

1043
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,359
oh what's a boxer

1044
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:18,980
telling people

1045
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,779
not to be violent for

1046
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:20,059
you know

1047
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:20,500
that's what he did

1048
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:20,819
for a living

1049
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,380
my violence

1050
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,039
was sport

1051
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,019
I've been you know

1052
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:24,859
around that violence

1053
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:25,440
from the age of

1054
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,380
12, 30 years old

1055
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,200
and it's you know

1056
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,900
it can be unpleasant

1057
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,619
it can be tough

1058
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:30,220
it can be brutal

1059
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:30,680
at times

1060
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,400
but it is what it is

1061
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:31,920
it's a sport

1062
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,400
and I love it

1063
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:32,740
and I wouldn't

1064
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,339
change a thing

1065
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:34,579
the fact that

1066
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:35,200
young blokes

1067
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,099
I was able to

1068
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:36,859
going back to

1069
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:37,740
the very first question

1070
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,200
sorry Luke

1071
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,420
why I started it

1072
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:39,980
and why I wanted

1073
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,619
to make a difference

1074
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:41,900
is I thought

1075
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,440
young blokes

1076
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,480
would look up to me

1077
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,259
hopefully seeing

1078
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:44,779
what I'm doing

1079
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:45,660
hopefully take a bit

1080
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,839
of a get in the air

1081
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:47,359
and what I'm going

1082
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:48,160
what I'm doing

1083
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,700
with the sport

1084
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,279
and respect what

1085
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,019
I'm trying to say

1086
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:51,940
and trying to show them

1087
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,140
and trying to tell them

1088
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,180
that no one respects

1089
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,859
this type of

1090
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:57,000
anti-social cowardice

1091
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
no one respects it

1092
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,900
no one condones it

1093
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,880
no one I know

1094
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,160
that's a fighter

1095
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,299
that's a top line fighter

1096
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:03,140
or an ordinary fighter

1097
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,400
or any

1098
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,059
no one I know

1099
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:04,539
none of my mates

1100
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:05,680
respect that type

1101
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,799
of putrid cowardice

1102
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:07,700
you're not tough

1103
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,259
you're not brave

1104
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:08,920
so I wanted to

1105
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,039
if two blokes

1106
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:10,539
got a problem

1107
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:11,119
they go outside

1108
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:11,680
and have a fight

1109
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,480
I don't have a problem

1110
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:12,740
with that

1111
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,839
that's the way it goes

1112
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,700
that's the way it used to be

1113
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,880
I mean we need to change it

1114
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,319
a great deal

1115
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:16,819
as long as it's

1116
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:17,700
it's fair

1117
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,460
and there's no one

1118
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:18,839
you know

1119
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:19,920
it is what it is

1120
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,660
people are going to

1121
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,180
jump up and down

1122
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,920
with me saying that

1123
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,380
because everyone's

1124
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,299
so politically correct

1125
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:24,660
and afraid to say

1126
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,380
things these days

1127
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,480
it gives me the shits

1128
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,700
so if two blokes

1129
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,380
want to punch on

1130
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,119
and get their differences

1131
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:29,539
out of the way

1132
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:30,559
let them do it

1133
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,759
this complete cowardness

1134
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,400
where people are

1135
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,740
looking for trouble

1136
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,140
and just

1137
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,019
I can't imagine

1138
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:36,880
hitting someone

1139
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,339
from behind

1140
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,059
or from the side

1141
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:39,799
without them even

1142
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,440
knowing that

1143
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,400
without even knowing

1144
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,900
who they are

1145
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,299
and they've done

1146
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:42,920
nothing to me

1147
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,079
I can't get my head

1148
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:44,380
around that

1149
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,000
so I want to make

1150
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,420
a difference

1151
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,680
I want to get them

1152
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,259
the message

1153
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:47,960
to the community

1154
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,200
particularly young blokes

1155
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,039
that no one respects

1156
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:51,680
or condones

1157
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,259
this type of

1158
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:53,200
putrid cowardness

1159
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,859
and you're going to

1160
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:55,000
be branded a coward

1161
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,119
that's why I chose

1162
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,420
it to coward punch

1163
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,220
it was kind of awkward

1164
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:58,599
at the start

1165
00:21:58,599 --> 00:21:58,920
people were going

1166
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,380
what's that

1167
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,339
but it's resonated

1168
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:00,900
with it now

1169
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,480
the slip-slop-slap

1170
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:02,940
campaign

1171
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,539
the drink-driving

1172
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:04,079
campaign

1173
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,420
the buckle-up

1174
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:05,940
campaign

1175
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,160
have had billions

1176
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
of government funds

1177
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,740
poured into them

1178
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,380
over decades

1179
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,319
four, three, four,

1180
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,039
five decades

1181
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:11,940
and people

1182
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,740
slip-slop-slap

1183
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,640
people unfortunately

1184
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,440
are still dying

1185
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:14,859
from those

1186
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:15,779
related issues

1187
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:16,359
but the numbers

1188
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:16,660
have grown

1189
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,579
greatly reduced

1190
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:18,720
and the coward punch

1191
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,119
campaign

1192
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:20,180
since 2012

1193
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,359
we did a piece

1194
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:21,799
of research

1195
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:22,460
from the Victorian

1196
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,539
Institute of Forensic

1197
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:23,859
Medicine

1198
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:24,920
through Professor

1199
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,779
Jennifer Schuman

1200
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:26,319
who was leading

1201
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:26,819
the way there

1202
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:27,240
an absolutely

1203
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,839
awesome lady

1204
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,740
and it showed

1205
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,660
that from 2012

1206
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,539
to 2018

1207
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:31,640
the number of

1208
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,119
deaths through

1209
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:32,619
coward punches

1210
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:33,460
have come down

1211
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,339
and the campaign

1212
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:35,759
is absolutely

1213
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:36,480
working because

1214
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,539
the awareness

1215
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:38,579
now yourself

1216
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:39,180
and everyone

1217
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:39,740
in the media

1218
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,960
whether it's TV

1219
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,079
radio or print

1220
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,019
publications etc

1221
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:44,079
all referencing

1222
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:44,640
the term

1223
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,240
coward punch

1224
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,299
judges and magistrates

1225
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:47,180
handing down

1226
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,640
terms

1227
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,900
referencing the term

1228
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,579
coward punch

1229
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:50,619
so if the vernacular

1230
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,079
has changed

1231
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,559
in less than 10 years

1232
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,099
it's been a magic

1233
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:55,680
outcome

1234
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,720
it's a great legacy

1235
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,359
Danny

1236
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,660
and I've got

1237
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,759
enormous respect

1238
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:00,579
and credit for you

1239
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:01,019
and I love

1240
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:02,259
the plain language

1241
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:02,859
that you talk

1242
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:04,119
because you can

1243
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:04,660
it's a world

1244
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,160
that you know

1245
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,079
better than anyone else

1246
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:06,740
I think you couldn't

1247
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,859
get a better

1248
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:08,960
advocate for it

1249
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,079
almost 13 years ago

1250
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:10,740
to the day

1251
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,480
you defeated

1252
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:11,940
the great

1253
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,099
Roy Jones Jr

1254
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:14,319
who is in the

1255
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:14,900
conversation

1256
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,599
for one of the

1257
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,119
best pound for

1258
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:16,940
bound boxers

1259
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,579
in the history

1260
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:18,900
of your sport

1261
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,359
by a knockout

1262
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,259
in the first round

1263
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:22,359
and his form

1264
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:22,980
leading into it

1265
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,640
was outstanding

1266
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,519
his form after it

1267
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:26,039
was outstanding

1268
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,200
how do you look

1269
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,799
back on that one?

1270
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,259
Not as good as

1271
00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:32,400
the degenerate

1272
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,240
cigar cigarette

1273
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,079
inhaling

1274
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:35,920
you know

1275
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,940
bottle of whiskey

1276
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,299
a day

1277
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:37,759
journos

1278
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,000
that tend to

1279
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,519
discredit

1280
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,380
what most people

1281
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,200
in this world do

1282
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,839
but you know

1283
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,700
it's just

1284
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:45,980
unbelievable

1285
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:46,859
like it's

1286
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:47,819
I still pinch myself

1287
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:49,079
and it

1288
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,380
he took out

1289
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:50,960
Jeff Lacey

1290
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,460
in devastating

1291
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:52,980
fashion

1292
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,500
three months

1293
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,079
before we fought

1294
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:54,960
then he went

1295
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,839
12 rounds

1296
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:56,700
with the pound

1297
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,299
for pound king

1298
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:57,940
Bernard Hopkins

1299
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,880
four months

1300
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,599
after we fought

1301
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,980
and I take him

1302
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,799
out in the first round

1303
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:02,599
people go

1304
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:03,460
oh you know

1305
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:03,900
it was

1306
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,059
it was a set up

1307
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:05,500
it was this

1308
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:05,839
it's like

1309
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:06,619
it's like saying

1310
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:07,299
that you just went

1311
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:08,079
and walked on the moon

1312
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,140
that shit doesn't happen

1313
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,579
and I don't ever

1314
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:11,500
I've never ever

1315
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,160
put myself

1316
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,819
anywhere near

1317
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:13,599
the same category

1318
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:13,960
of fighter

1319
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,799
as Roy Jones Jr

1320
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,460
and I never will

1321
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,019
I know where my

1322
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:17,720
standards and levels

1323
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,539
are but I knew

1324
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:19,940
that on that night

1325
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,779
if I'm able to

1326
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:21,579
catch him clean

1327
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:22,859
I can hurt anyone

1328
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:23,240
in the world

1329
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,480
I was gifted

1330
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,680
with a punch

1331
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,640
in 2005

1332
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,619
and 2006

1333
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:28,619
two years consecutive

1334
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:29,319
running the ring

1335
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:29,720
magazine

1336
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,500
the bible of boxing

1337
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,599
voted me the best

1338
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,160
puncher in my

1339
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,680
weight division

1340
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,000
so I knew

1341
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,740
I knew I had

1342
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,180
a chance to beat him

1343
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:36,740
but I wasn't

1344
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,119
going to beat him

1345
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:37,559
on points

1346
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,660
and I had to jump

1347
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,079
on him early

1348
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:39,720
and Angela Hyde

1349
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,400
my trainer and I

1350
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,539
we had an amazing

1351
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:43,299
training camp

1352
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:44,500
and like yourself

1353
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:44,940
Luke you know

1354
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,140
when you

1355
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,440
when you

1356
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:45,900
go into the

1357
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,480
biggest games

1358
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,180
of your life

1359
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,299
and you're going

1360
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:49,200
injury free

1361
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,160
you're going so

1362
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,619
confident

1363
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:51,380
you're going so

1364
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,900
relaxed

1365
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,339
not expecting to

1366
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:54,460
take out the

1367
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:54,980
three votes

1368
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,619
but you do

1369
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,500
well for me

1370
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,039
that night

1371
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,319
was the feeling

1372
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:58,579
I had

1373
00:24:58,579 --> 00:24:59,059
I didn't have

1374
00:24:59,059 --> 00:24:59,599
any injuries

1375
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,000
it was about

1376
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,880
a week ago

1377
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,880
about injuries

1378
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,279
and stuff

1379
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,099
and that training

1380
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:03,599
camp was the

1381
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:04,019
best training

1382
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:04,519
camp I ever

1383
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:05,000
had

1384
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,740
I really

1385
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,480
didn't have

1386
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:06,900
any injuries

1387
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,420
that I can remember

1388
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,680
and just felt

1389
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,380
sensational

1390
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,779
and took the

1391
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:11,460
opportunity when it

1392
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:11,900
came and I

1393
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,740
identified Roy

1394
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,920
you know it was

1395
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,640
a slow starter

1396
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,119
in many ways

1397
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,400
and he was

1398
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,960
open to the

1399
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,559
overhand right

1400
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,059
to the ear

1401
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:18,420
when he was

1402
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:18,920
on the ropes

1403
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,359
we identified

1404
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,140
all these things

1405
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,019
and I took

1406
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:21,500
the chance

1407
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:21,920
I jumped

1408
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,279
him in the

1409
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:22,799
first round

1410
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,839
and I took

1411
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:24,180
a punt

1412
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:24,440
because I

1413
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:24,660
could have

1414
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,259
gassed myself

1415
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:26,259
and I dropped

1416
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:26,640
him in the

1417
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,339
first minute

1418
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:27,640
in a bit

1419
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,099
of a fight

1420
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:28,440
and then he

1421
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:28,759
got up

1422
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:29,420
and I just

1423
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,799
basically clubbed

1424
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,240
him until the

1425
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:31,960
referee stepped

1426
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,380
in because he

1427
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:32,720
was going to

1428
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,119
get knocked

1429
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,279
out and he

1430
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:34,920
was in shock

1431
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,559
the world was

1432
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:35,880
in shock

1433
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,700
I was in

1434
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,119
shock

1435
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,160
it was bonkers

1436
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,599
and like I

1437
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:40,859
said I'm

1438
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:41,220
nowhere near

1439
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:41,700
Roy Jones

1440
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:41,960
Jr.

1441
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:42,539
but on my

1442
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:42,920
night I

1443
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,220
knew that

1444
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:43,859
if I hit

1445
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:45,440
my weight

1446
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:45,880
division I'm

1447
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,160
going to be

1448
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,559
able to hurt

1449
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,420
him and

1450
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,240
yeah it

1451
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,819
was bonkers

1452
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:51,400
I'd encourage

1453
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:51,880
anyone if you

1454
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,359
haven't and you

1455
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:52,960
follow the sport

1456
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,420
or you don't

1457
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:53,839
go back and

1458
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:54,339
watch that

1459
00:25:54,339 --> 00:25:56,019
it's anyone

1460
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:56,500
at the top

1461
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,400
of their game

1462
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,140
and you

1463
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,039
articulated that

1464
00:25:59,039 --> 00:25:59,359
brilliantly

1465
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,619
to beat some

1466
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:01,039
of that level

1467
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:01,559
you've got to

1468
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,220
have everything

1469
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:02,859
right and you

1470
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:03,420
maybe have one

1471
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,000
little window

1472
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,140
you take the

1473
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,900
window and

1474
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,240
that will stay

1475
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,720
with you for

1476
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,339
the rest of

1477
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:08,660
your day

1478
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,720
a lot of

1479
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,460
you know

1480
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,700
you play sport

1481
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,160
for a living

1482
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,539
or I'd imagine

1483
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:14,160
particularly in the

1484
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,839
fight game Danny

1485
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,759
life afterwards

1486
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:16,720
there's a lot of

1487
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,680
stories of people

1488
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,319
that you know

1489
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:18,980
hit the wall

1490
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,000
afterwards because

1491
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,599
they can never

1492
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,799
recapture their

1493
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:22,420
moment as a

1494
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,259
boxer or whatever

1495
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:24,259
sport they chose

1496
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:25,359
but I look at

1497
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:25,920
you Danny and

1498
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,519
you've had success

1499
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,460
in everything

1500
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,039
you've done

1501
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:28,579
you know in

1502
00:26:28,579 --> 00:26:29,039
your work in

1503
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:29,819
the media or

1504
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:30,740
your own

1505
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,480
business career

1506
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,299
what did you

1507
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:32,720
what have you

1508
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,200
found within

1509
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,839
yourself Danny

1510
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:34,380
to be able to

1511
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:34,940
have such a

1512
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,460
great chapter

1513
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:35,980
after your

1514
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,500
boxing career

1515
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:36,700
ended

1516
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,700
I've been

1517
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,599
blessed mate

1518
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,079
to have

1519
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:40,720
you know

1520
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,759
a wife that's

1521
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:42,460
been extremely

1522
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:42,980
supportive

1523
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,660
and she's

1524
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,339
50% of what

1525
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:45,700
we've done

1526
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,039
if not more

1527
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:47,500
at times

1528
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,539
and when I was

1529
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:49,039
away in training

1530
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:49,700
camp for long

1531
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,380
periods of time

1532
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:50,880
you know

1533
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,960
my wife was

1534
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,380
on her own

1535
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:53,859
looking after

1536
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:54,140
the kids

1537
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,700
and she doesn't

1538
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,299
ask for help

1539
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:55,619
she does

1540
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:56,700
everything herself

1541
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,740
never look for

1542
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:57,940
help

1543
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,740
never ask anyone

1544
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,500
for not a

1545
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,099
single person

1546
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:00,519
for a hand

1547
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,799
and you know

1548
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,539
just buckled up

1549
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:03,940
and did what

1550
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,539
she needed to do

1551
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,099
so she's been

1552
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:06,000
a massive

1553
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,819
contributing factor

1554
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:07,559
to our success

1555
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,079
as a family

1556
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:08,640
and my kids

1557
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:08,980
as well

1558
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,839
you know

1559
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:10,720
they've been

1560
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,259
fantastic

1561
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:12,240
and I just

1562
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,740
I guess

1563
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,859
my old man

1564
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:14,640
I

1565
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,539
channel what

1566
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:17,299
I think my old man

1567
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:17,660
would do

1568
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,200
and what I think

1569
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,599
he would do

1570
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:18,960
because he was

1571
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,420
just a

1572
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,039
ripping bloke

1573
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:22,680
and one of my

1574
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,680
best mate

1575
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,839
and I really

1576
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,380
took a lot

1577
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:26,940
from what he

1578
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,839
did in his life

1579
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:28,319
and I look at

1580
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,319
what would you do

1581
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:29,839
after life

1582
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:30,420
and I realised

1583
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,640
boxing doesn't

1584
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,079
last forever

1585
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,359
I can't chase

1586
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,099
those highs forever

1587
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:34,680
and so I've

1588
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,740
replaced the

1589
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,380
drug of boxing

1590
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,000
with the drug

1591
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,440
of surfing

1592
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,000
so now I push

1593
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,359
my limits

1594
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:38,880
in the ocean

1595
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,680
and want to

1596
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,000
you know

1597
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,579
test them

1598
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:41,019
because I love

1599
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:41,319
adrenaline

1600
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,160
I love going fast

1601
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,720
I love being scared

1602
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,619
so I push

1603
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:45,140
it in the ocean

1604
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,380
now

1605
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,119
so I've replaced

1606
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:46,900
it for the ocean

1607
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,420
and

1608
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,720
you know

1609
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,460
realising that

1610
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,839
I was blessed

1611
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:52,759
to have a

1612
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:53,660
career

1613
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,519
I was blessed

1614
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:54,980
to be able to

1615
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,759
do what I love

1616
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:56,799
that I was born

1617
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,140
to do

1618
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,680
I was good at

1619
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,140
I was given

1620
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:58,519
a gift

1621
00:27:58,519 --> 00:27:59,880
and I ran

1622
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,220
with it

1623
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,259
so I look at it

1624
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:01,920
I'm not going

1625
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,759
to piss and moan

1626
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:03,440
about oh I can't

1627
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,000
do this anymore

1628
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,740
I go no man

1629
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,599
I'm so lucky

1630
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:07,140
I was able to do that

1631
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,680
every single day

1632
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,319
I need to

1633
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:09,839
thank

1634
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:10,880
thank whoever

1635
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,019
for that opportunity

1636
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:13,319
and thank myself

1637
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:13,680
for it

1638
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,339
and be blessed

1639
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:15,099
and feel blessed

1640
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:15,980
and move on

1641
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,240
and go

1642
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,140
it can't last forever

1643
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,859
and the guys

1644
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:18,240
that are coming

1645
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,660
through now

1646
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,160
I look at them

1647
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,440
and go

1648
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,740
I hope you're enjoying it

1649
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,220
and I always

1650
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:21,920
I always give

1651
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,299
you know

1652
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:23,079
a text message

1653
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:23,660
all these fighters

1654
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,140
from now on

1655
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:24,319
and go

1656
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:24,940
mate

1657
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,500
the one thing

1658
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:25,880
I want to give you

1659
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,740
is enjoy it

1660
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,519
just lap it up

1661
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,039
and enjoy it

1662
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:28,559
while you're doing it

1663
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,559
because you know

1664
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:30,500
you're in the prime

1665
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:30,940
of your life

1666
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,759
I'm ready to take

1667
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:33,599
a bit to unnerve

1668
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,839
Danny Green

1669
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:35,859
from what I've seen

1670
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:36,720
but they tell me

1671
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,859
that Sydney to Hobart

1672
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:39,140
2009 Danny

1673
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:39,559
I read

1674
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:40,700
in preparation

1675
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,680
for our chat today

1676
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,819
the first night

1677
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:43,400
I think you might have

1678
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:43,960
said something like

1679
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,299
nothing

1680
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:44,960
will erase

1681
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,420
the memory

1682
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,140
of that night

1683
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,220
for Sydney to Hobart

1684
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,099
I genuinely thought

1685
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,059
I was going to die

1686
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:50,059
can you share

1687
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:50,880
that story with me

1688
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,779
I'm really pissed

1689
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:53,319
in my pants

1690
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:53,660
I reckon

1691
00:28:53,660 --> 00:29:00,740
and I'd not

1692
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,440
been on the boat

1693
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,000
so I made

1694
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,259
a morning

1695
00:29:02,259 --> 00:29:02,940
Anthony Bell

1696
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,720
organised

1697
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,039
this trip

1698
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:05,779
this voyage

1699
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:06,839
this maiden voyage

1700
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:07,720
from a boat

1701
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,079
that had been

1702
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:08,759
sitting in

1703
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:09,640
the swampland

1704
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,460
in New Zealand

1705
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,440
for four months

1706
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,359
prior to the race

1707
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,380
and then

1708
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,279
all of a sudden

1709
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:14,299
I was like

1710
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:15,240
organised a magic crew

1711
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,940
and got together

1712
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,700
a group of people

1713
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,960
that had some profiles

1714
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,559
so myself

1715
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,720
Larry Ender

1716
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,539
Phil Waugh

1717
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:21,440
Phil Kearns

1718
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,119
Grant Hackett

1719
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,140
we went on the boat

1720
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:23,980
so we organised that

1721
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,420
and it was to

1722
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,700
raise money for

1723
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,579
the Humpty Dumpty

1724
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:26,920
Foundation

1725
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,579
which then

1726
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:28,339
puts machines

1727
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:29,039
into hospitals

1728
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:29,740
around regional

1729
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,460
hospitals

1730
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,440
around the country

1731
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:31,859
so it was a

1732
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:32,559
fantastic cause

1733
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,539
how can I say no

1734
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:34,660
and I'm terrified

1735
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,059
of sailing

1736
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:35,960
I love the ocean

1737
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,359
I'm terrified

1738
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,079
of being stuck

1739
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:38,619
in a boat

1740
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:38,920
I thought

1741
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,660
I just

1742
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,460
don't want to do it

1743
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,480
I was shitting myself

1744
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,140
and the first night

1745
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,259
I'd never been on the boat

1746
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:45,980
because I was fighting

1747
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,640
Roy Jones

1748
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,059
so I'd not done any training

1749
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:49,119
the first time

1750
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:49,920
I'd actually stepped

1751
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,819
onto the boat

1752
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:52,140
was on Boxing Day morning

1753
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,940
when the boat left

1754
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,819
and I'd never been

1755
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:55,319
on the thing before

1756
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:56,140
and then

1757
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,880
got a

1758
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,000
five minute run down

1759
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,460
of what to do

1760
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,319
we were just there

1761
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,160
as the labourers

1762
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,039
we were just pulling

1763
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:01,700
the sails down

1764
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,460
pulling back up

1765
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,619
lugging stuff up and down

1766
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:05,019
I was the first to vomit

1767
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:06,299
I was the very first one

1768
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:06,779
to spew

1769
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:08,240
and after I didn't spew

1770
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,960
I was pretty happy

1771
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,539
yeah

1772
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:10,660
the very first night

1773
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,279
I remember we had to go

1774
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,000
in the front of the boat

1775
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,079
and it was just like

1776
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,059
and we're on the

1777
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:14,460
side of the boat

1778
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,039
and you're just getting

1779
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,240
buckets of water

1780
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,000
coming at you

1781
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,920
and I had to crawl

1782
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,759
up the front of the boat

1783
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:19,640
with other guys

1784
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,980
and pull this sail

1785
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,200
that had come unhitched down

1786
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,940
and because

1787
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,920
the front of the boat

1788
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,900
was almost going

1789
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,359
under water

1790
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,339
with these big swells

1791
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:27,099
that had come back up

1792
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:28,619
and the sail was

1793
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:29,579
over the edge of the boat

1794
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,200
and the bow of the boat

1795
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,859
is like a pin

1796
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:33,359
it's so sharp

1797
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:34,700
and I was crawling

1798
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,119
and I didn't know

1799
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:36,880
that I had to actually

1800
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,539
latch on

1801
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:38,140
my hook on

1802
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:38,759
I had a belt on

1803
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:39,440
that could latch on

1804
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,140
these two lines

1805
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,619
that ran down

1806
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:42,500
the side of the boat

1807
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,619
so if I did go over

1808
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:44,039
you'd hang on

1809
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,140
you'd be clipped on

1810
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,259
I didn't even clip on

1811
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:47,059
because I didn't

1812
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:47,980
I wasn't trained

1813
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,799
I wasn't used to it

1814
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:49,619
and then

1815
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:50,579
I remember lying

1816
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:51,420
on the deck

1817
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,680
like a cat

1818
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,900
on a high

1819
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,420
like I don't know

1820
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:54,799
how to tell you

1821
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:55,539
but just like a cat

1822
00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:56,559
just trying to crawl

1823
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,380
crawl myself

1824
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,680
to the deck

1825
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,940
and I was thinking

1826
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,299
to myself

1827
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:02,079
I'm going to

1828
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,019
fucking die

1829
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:04,220
it's terrifying

1830
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,880
excuse my language

1831
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,779
and then

1832
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:07,380
eventually

1833
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,740
we pulled up

1834
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,160
and I sat

1835
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,880
on the edge of the boat

1836
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,299
and our job

1837
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:11,779
was really just

1838
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:12,400
to sit in the boat

1839
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,500
when it's on the edge

1840
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:13,940
we'd sit on

1841
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,359
this so I could

1842
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,000
wait down a bit

1843
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,339
so I was

1844
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:15,660
you know

1845
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,240
playing you right

1846
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,220
and then

1847
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:17,799
I remember

1848
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:18,920
breathing to myself

1849
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,720
in this lightning

1850
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,279
and thunder

1851
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:20,859
and hail

1852
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:21,500
and squalls

1853
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,539
pitch black

1854
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:23,299
terrified

1855
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:24,779
and just breathing

1856
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:25,099
going

1857
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:26,559
you're not going to die

1858
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,819
you're going to be okay

1859
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,339
you're not going to die

1860
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:30,240
just chill out

1861
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,740
and breathe

1862
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,880
I had so much fun

1863
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,980
I went back in 2014

1864
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,579
and did it again

1865
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:37,279
that sums you up

1866
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:37,680
doesn't it

1867
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,640
you actually went back

1868
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,619
after that experience

1869
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:39,900
and said

1870
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,220
I can go again

1871
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,299
Danny I love

1872
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:43,240
asking people

1873
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,740
from different

1874
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,700
backgrounds around

1875
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,700
for us

1876
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,200
what leadership

1877
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,779
looks like

1878
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:47,519
and your story

1879
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,579
is one of the

1880
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:49,259
greats for me

1881
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:50,000
and the work

1882
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,440
you've done

1883
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,480
in the ring

1884
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:51,940
as a legend

1885
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,859
but outside of it

1886
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:53,880
is incredible

1887
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,339
and we see

1888
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:55,420
these sort of

1889
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,119
patterns that

1890
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,079
it's hard

1891
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:57,539
we think

1892
00:31:57,539 --> 00:31:58,240
to start with

1893
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,039
to lead someone else

1894
00:31:59,039 --> 00:31:59,599
unless you know

1895
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,259
yourself Danny

1896
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:00,859
like your own

1897
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:01,500
sense of self

1898
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:01,900
leadership

1899
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,019
what does that

1900
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:03,599
mean to you

1901
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:04,660
to lead yourself

1902
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,160
firstly

1903
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,799
it's a tough one

1904
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:08,019
Luke

1905
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:08,599
because I'm

1906
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,480
a space cadet

1907
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,039
and everyone

1908
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:10,460
knows me

1909
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,200
I don't know

1910
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,599
how he does

1911
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,180
this stuff

1912
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,160
he's hopeless

1913
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,359
and I guess

1914
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,519
I just want

1915
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:17,599
I want to

1916
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:18,380
try and always

1917
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,099
you know

1918
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:19,720
be seen

1919
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,519
not be seen

1920
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:22,299
but be known

1921
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:22,880
to be doing

1922
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,480
the right thing

1923
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,640
but although

1924
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,680
I'm a severe

1925
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,700
non-conformist

1926
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,559
and I really like

1927
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,160
I don't like

1928
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,980
following many rules

1929
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,319
I'm not a conformist

1930
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:31,839
at all

1931
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,240
I'm bad

1932
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,940
when it comes to that

1933
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,160
I won't go into

1934
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,599
that stuff

1935
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,519
but I just

1936
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,000
like to do

1937
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,539
the right thing

1938
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,480
by the right people

1939
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,799
I believe everyone

1940
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,980
deserves a second chance

1941
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,559
I was raised

1942
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,259
you know

1943
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:43,859
to give everyone

1944
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:44,440
a chance

1945
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,579
I always

1946
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:46,299
I've been raised

1947
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:47,160
and I always have

1948
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,960
my kids are the same

1949
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,920
we always bat for the

1950
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,220
underdog

1951
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:49,960
we always look out

1952
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,359
for people

1953
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,480
always go looking

1954
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,519
to help someone else

1955
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:54,079
because I've found

1956
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,640
that I live in Australia

1957
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,319
I live in Perth

1958
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:58,039
you know

1959
00:32:58,039 --> 00:32:58,700
I have a roof

1960
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,380
over my head

1961
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,400
I have a car

1962
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,900
I can go to the

1963
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,480
petrol station

1964
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:02,980
and put petrol

1965
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,440
in my car

1966
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,539
I can go to the

1967
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:05,519
doctor if I need to

1968
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,640
I can go get groceries

1969
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,480
so therefore

1970
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,160
I have nothing

1971
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,079
to complain about

1972
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:10,240
and that's

1973
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:10,680
I guess

1974
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,059
how I just want

1975
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:12,500
to live my

1976
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:12,900
life is

1977
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,200
I don't

1978
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,799
I don't need a

1979
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,279
great deal

1980
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:15,940
all I need to be

1981
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,039
is our health

1982
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,319
and have the respect

1983
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:18,940
of my family

1984
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,359
and the love

1985
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:19,839
of my kids

1986
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:20,839
and I was looking

1987
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:23,400
at a thing

1988
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:23,880
on Instagram

1989
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,660
my wife sent to me

1990
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:24,859
the other day

1991
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:25,319
it was about

1992
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:26,539
what's true success

1993
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:27,140
and I was interviewing

1994
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,640
this very successful

1995
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,460
and well-known

1996
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:29,880
billionaire

1997
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,640
I can't remember

1998
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,180
who he was

1999
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,019
but he said

2000
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:32,500
this guy said

2001
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,339
what's success to you

2002
00:33:33,339 --> 00:33:33,640
and he says

2003
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,619
well success to me

2004
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:35,759
is when my adult

2005
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:37,200
children want to

2006
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,660
come over

2007
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,440
and spend

2008
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,599
all their time

2009
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:39,960
with me

2010
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,039
and to me

2011
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,240
that's what success

2012
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,619
is

2013
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:43,819
is having the

2014
00:33:43,819 --> 00:33:44,740
love and the

2015
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,980
respect of our kids

2016
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,200
and then if that

2017
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,039
means being a leader

2018
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:48,720
so if that means

2019
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,299
being a leader

2020
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:50,359
then I guess

2021
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:50,940
it's worked

2022
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,279
because you know

2023
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:53,119
our kids are very

2024
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:53,740
close with us

2025
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,759
and we try and

2026
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:55,160
guide them

2027
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,299
and as you do

2028
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:56,980
every old parents

2029
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,420
do you go

2030
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,200
through ups and downs

2031
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,319
that's brilliantly

2032
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:00,740
said

2033
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,559
Danny

2034
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:02,240
and I love

2035
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,799
you know

2036
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,140
the way

2037
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,880
you know

2038
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,859
your words come

2039
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:05,720
out so authentically

2040
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,559
in everything you say

2041
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,099
it's funny you say

2042
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:07,640
that we had last

2043
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:07,960
night

2044
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,440
our oldest is 20

2045
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,619
moved out of home

2046
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,159
and brought

2047
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:12,800
a rang around

2048
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,460
so I'm coming home

2049
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:13,760
for dinner

2050
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,480
I'm bringing a young

2051
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,739
mate he's playing

2052
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:16,420
AFL football

2053
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,260
and a new recruit

2054
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,760
and my wife and I

2055
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,460
looked at each other

2056
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:19,699
and went

2057
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:20,440
you know what

2058
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,199
it's sort of as good

2059
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:21,639
as it gets

2060
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,119
isn't it

2061
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:23,019
they love your home

2062
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:23,400
still

2063
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,280
they're comfortable

2064
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,119
bringing their mates

2065
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:25,500
around

2066
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,679
and I think you

2067
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,300
described that

2068
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,559
in a brilliant way

2069
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:29,079
I haven't heard

2070
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:29,940
anyone do it

2071
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,820
quite like you just did

2072
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,179
we see another

2073
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:32,880
dimension Danny

2074
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,599
around people

2075
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,619
and you just described

2076
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:34,880
it then

2077
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,519
the idea to have

2078
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:36,659
an impact positively

2079
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,139
everywhere you go

2080
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:38,880
on other people

2081
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,920
on a daily basis

2082
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,320
and you said

2083
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,199
the values of the family

2084
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:41,900
to always look out

2085
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,159
for another person

2086
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:42,500
underdog

2087
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,679
and help other people

2088
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,260
is that something

2089
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:44,780
you think about

2090
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,260
all the time

2091
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:45,739
having that

2092
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:46,780
positive impact

2093
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,760
I don't think about it

2094
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:48,920
Luke

2095
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,980
I just can't help it

2096
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,099
I see some

2097
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:52,119
bloke on the side

2098
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:52,420
of the road

2099
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:52,739
or someone

2100
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:53,300
that needs a hand

2101
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:53,940
you know

2102
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,659
that's just how we are

2103
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,099
it's going

2104
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:55,539
hey mate

2105
00:34:55,539 --> 00:34:55,900
need a hand

2106
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,599
what's going on

2107
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:57,119
how can I help

2108
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:57,800
what do you need

2109
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,199
need a lift

2110
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:58,900
or whatever it may be

2111
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,599
you know

2112
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,239
I can't walk past

2113
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,159
people who are

2114
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:02,900
doing it tough

2115
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,619
I find it very tough

2116
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:04,199
and my wife's

2117
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,079
exactly the same

2118
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:05,900
and our kids

2119
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,639
are exactly the same

2120
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:06,920
I think

2121
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,659
we're lucky

2122
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:08,039
we're born

2123
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:08,739
with a lot of empathy

2124
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:09,619
and

2125
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:12,139
I don't know

2126
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:12,539
it's

2127
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:13,239
for me

2128
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:13,860
it just feels

2129
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,039
the right thing

2130
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:16,539
to do

2131
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:17,800
and I always

2132
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,900
I almost sometimes

2133
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,639
feel guilty

2134
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:21,239
being healthy

2135
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:22,519
having a roof

2136
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:23,139
over my head

2137
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:24,119
and being able

2138
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:24,360
to go

2139
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,260
to the

2140
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,139
grocery store

2141
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:28,199
I almost feel guilty

2142
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:28,679
I don't know why

2143
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:29,159
but I always

2144
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,219
have felt that way

2145
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:30,659
so therefore

2146
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:32,059
it's innate

2147
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:32,960
in my personality

2148
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,420
and my wife

2149
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,739
we have to look out

2150
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:35,159
for each other

2151
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:35,940
for everyone else

2152
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,940
and try and

2153
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,960
help people

2154
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,800
I don't know

2155
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,480
what that is mate

2156
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,699
but it's important

2157
00:35:40,699 --> 00:35:41,179
to us

2158
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:42,079
and

2159
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:42,480
I think

2160
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,480
people go

2161
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,400
oh it makes you feel better

2162
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,179
yeah it does

2163
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:47,300
but it's something

2164
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:47,980
that I can't help

2165
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,340
not doing

2166
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,940
it just is what it is

2167
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,860
It's pretty special

2168
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,659
Danny

2169
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:53,699
I love hearing you

2170
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:54,260
talk about it

2171
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:54,599
it's interesting

2172
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:55,280
when you're

2173
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,420
a four time world champion

2174
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,519
and most people

2175
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:58,880
have got a vision

2176
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,360
of that

2177
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,900
you said in the first answer

2178
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,099
I didn't know

2179
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:02,440
where that was

2180
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:02,980
ever going to happen

2181
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,960
I wanted to box

2182
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,840
because I loved it

2183
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,659
but have you

2184
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:07,760
someone that sort of

2185
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,840
creates a vision

2186
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,579
and you really go about

2187
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:11,380
sharing it

2188
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,059
in the

2189
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:12,719
areas of your life

2190
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:13,360
you've had success

2191
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,360
how do you go about

2192
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,300
when you want to

2193
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:15,860
achieve something

2194
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,340
like that

2195
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,500
I guess I do

2196
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,380
I guess I did

2197
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:19,760
you know what

2198
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,199
I guess I worked out

2199
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,099
early on that

2200
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:23,139
if I train really

2201
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:23,659
really hard

2202
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:24,440
I'm going to get better

2203
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,400
if I train hard

2204
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:25,880
at that guy

2205
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,019
I'm working hard

2206
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:27,480
at that guy

2207
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,000
then I'm going to

2208
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,019
surpass what he's doing

2209
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:30,079
and I'm going to

2210
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:30,500
beat him

2211
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,519
and if I've got

2212
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:33,980
a good work ethic

2213
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,519
my old man had

2214
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:35,300
a great work ethic

2215
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,000
and so

2216
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,960
he passed that on to me

2217
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,059
in some areas

2218
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:39,539
like I said

2219
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:40,239
my mates and family

2220
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,199
go he's hopeless

2221
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:41,980
he's got no

2222
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,440
work ethic

2223
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,539
he's a space cadet

2224
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:44,599
so but

2225
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:45,800
obviously I've got

2226
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,619
something

2227
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:47,699
doing something right

2228
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:48,260
every now and then

2229
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,840
but yeah I guess

2230
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,579
at the moment

2231
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:51,139
I've got something

2232
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:51,559
you know

2233
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:52,659
brewing I want to

2234
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:54,079
put some flights together

2235
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,679
so once I get a

2236
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:56,219
B in my bottom

2237
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:57,099
I kind of buckle up

2238
00:36:57,099 --> 00:36:57,519
and

2239
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:59,840
and trying to achieve

2240
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,400
that and try and

2241
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,460
make it work

2242
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,260
as good as possible

2243
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,119
you know

2244
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:03,960
but I've done

2245
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,639
some things that

2246
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,579
have not worked as well

2247
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:06,239
plenty of things

2248
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:06,780
that haven't worked

2249
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,139
like you know

2250
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:07,460
I've been

2251
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,780
I've failed at things

2252
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,440
and like we all do

2253
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,159
that's part of life

2254
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:11,960
and you learn from that

2255
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,179
it's such a wanky

2256
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:13,960
saying I learned it

2257
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,920
it's a good learning curve

2258
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,659
but it is

2259
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:16,039
it is

2260
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:16,219
you know

2261
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:17,480
you learn from your mistakes

2262
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,960
and if you don't learn

2263
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,579
from your mistakes

2264
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:20,559
which I have been

2265
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:23,019
guilty of

2266
00:37:23,019 --> 00:37:23,760
not learning from

2267
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,539
my mistakes

2268
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:25,199
then you

2269
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:25,780
you know

2270
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,579
you pay for it

2271
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,179
so I try and tell my kids

2272
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,280
and try and educate my kids

2273
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:29,840
as you would

2274
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,860
as we all do as parents

2275
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,320
don't make the same mistakes

2276
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:32,699
I do

2277
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:33,340
I'm trying to

2278
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,199
and they go

2279
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,500
oh you did that

2280
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,460
yeah I did mate

2281
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,039
I did that

2282
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:37,940
and that's why I'm telling you

2283
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,659
don't do it

2284
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:39,820
so you know

2285
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,179
someone said to me

2286
00:37:40,179 --> 00:37:41,099
this week

2287
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:41,880
the only mistake

2288
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,320
is the one

2289
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,280
that you don't learn from

2290
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:43,980
and I think

2291
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,880
you summed that up

2292
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,780
pretty well

2293
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,239
are you curious Danny

2294
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:47,880
we see leaders

2295
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,500
who have success like you

2296
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,480
they're curious

2297
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,079
they're always

2298
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:51,960
wanting to learn

2299
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,000
and get better

2300
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,579
or is that

2301
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:55,320
the way you describe yourself

2302
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,079
as being curious

2303
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,460
yeah

2304
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,340
yeah I would mate

2305
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,800
like I was up last night

2306
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,019
because my son

2307
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:02,659
wants to fight

2308
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:03,800
and I don't want him to fight

2309
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,059
you know

2310
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:05,440
your son's

2311
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,119
on his way

2312
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,300
to doing

2313
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:07,679
you know

2314
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:08,900
some magical things

2315
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,440
in his life

2316
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,420
and my boy's

2317
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:10,639
you know

2318
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:11,420
not quite 16

2319
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:11,860
and he wants

2320
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,300
to fight

2321
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,079
and he's grown up

2322
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:13,719
my whole family

2323
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,139
he's grown up

2324
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:14,940
my wife loves boxing

2325
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,400
my kids

2326
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,099
it's been a boxing household

2327
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:18,179
and will be a boxing household

2328
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:18,500
forever

2329
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,039
and he wants to fight

2330
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:21,539
and I'm like

2331
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:22,480
mate I don't want you to fight

2332
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,139
biologically

2333
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:23,820
he's very young

2334
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,599
he's a late maturer

2335
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:24,940
you know

2336
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,599
I didn't shave

2337
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,780
until I was 23 years old

2338
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,739
so you know

2339
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:28,239
he's probably

2340
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,280
13 or 14

2341
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,000
although he's almost 16

2342
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,179
but he's got a lot of talent

2343
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:33,219
he's got a lot of ability

2344
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:34,480
he's tough

2345
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,519
he can punch

2346
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:36,480
he can move

2347
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,320
he's fast

2348
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,159
he's skillful

2349
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:40,019
and he loves to work

2350
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:40,360
you know

2351
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,280
and I'm pushing him

2352
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:41,800
pushing him

2353
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,360
pushing him

2354
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,420
in the hope that he goes

2355
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,119
this is too hard

2356
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:45,280
and he keeps coming back

2357
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,699
for more

2358
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:46,820
so now I'm like

2359
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,139
okay

2360
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:49,059
he really wants to do this

2361
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:50,480
so you know

2362
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,320
I try and

2363
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:51,940
I try and

2364
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,199
you know

2365
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,139
always teach him

2366
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:53,400
you know

2367
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,000
and show him

2368
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,559
you know

2369
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:55,780
the right things to do

2370
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,820
but it's dangerous

2371
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,599
it's not great for your health

2372
00:38:58,599 --> 00:38:59,619
it's you know

2373
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:00,340
it's a fact

2374
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:00,880
it's not

2375
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,300
it's not

2376
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,980
I'd rather

2377
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,500
I'd rather him do something different

2378
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,340
but if he wants to do it

2379
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,099
I can't stop him

2380
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:07,699
and I said to him

2381
00:39:07,699 --> 00:39:08,900
mate I'm not going to stand in your way

2382
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,179
if unless it's

2383
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:10,760
you're boxing

2384
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,780
you want to fight for the wrong

2385
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,099
reasons

2386
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,519
if you think you'd be famous

2387
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:14,079
and rich

2388
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,039
and all this kind of shit

2389
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:16,820
I won't

2390
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,599
I'll stand in your way

2391
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,320
but if you want to

2392
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,380
if you want to fight

2393
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,519
because you want to be fit

2394
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:20,960
strong

2395
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,280
willing

2396
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:21,739
and able

2397
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:23,420
and you want to be victorious

2398
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,880
against another person

2399
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,099
in a competitive nature

2400
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:27,559
then I'll help you mate

2401
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:28,500
I'll support you

2402
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,420
so he's

2403
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:29,699
you know

2404
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:31,260
he's doing that at the moment

2405
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,340
and he's loving it

2406
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:32,480
but

2407
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:32,940
yeah

2408
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,840
well I loved it Danny

2409
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,480
because I was thinking

2410
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,280
you know

2411
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,239
my own eldest son

2412
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:36,559
Sam

2413
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:37,619
who's 20

2414
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:39,159
and you know

2415
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:40,400
he's on the Bulldogs

2416
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,639
loves it Danny

2417
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:41,760
he's

2418
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:41,780
he's a great guy

2419
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,079
and

2420
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,739
probably similar to you

2421
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:44,119
as a dad

2422
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:44,340
he goes

2423
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,579
he's in a lot of ways

2424
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:46,820
to do a lot of other things

2425
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,340
but you can't manufacture passion

2426
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,340
is what I always say

2427
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:49,639
and he

2428
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:50,639
he loves it

2429
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:50,800
but

2430
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,619
but for the first time in my life

2431
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:53,239
when I watch

2432
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,139
AFL

2433
00:39:54,139 --> 00:39:54,920
I see danger

2434
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,059
and I see

2435
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:56,699
oh shit

2436
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:57,420
don't run there

2437
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,500
oh don't do that

2438
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:58,659
and

2439
00:39:58,659 --> 00:39:59,460
yeah

2440
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,460
that's in a footy field

2441
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,119
I can imagine

2442
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,119
as a

2443
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:02,800
as a boxer

2444
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,739
having your son

2445
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:05,199
that must be a hard thing

2446
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,239
to watch and go

2447
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,260
it's a sport

2448
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,219
where you try and knock someone out

2449
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:09,159
that's the aim of the game

2450
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:09,860
is that you get in the ring

2451
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,519
and you hope to knock your opponent out

2452
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:11,760
and

2453
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,559
that's not going to be easy watching is it

2454
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:15,059
no it's not

2455
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:16,000
I did it the other night

2456
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,139
and he was sparring

2457
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:17,639
and

2458
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:19,099
I was agitated all night

2459
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:19,739
and I was in

2460
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:21,519
I was in a pretty prickly mood all night

2461
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:22,659
and then I went

2462
00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:23,400
oh look I'm sorry

2463
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:23,860
I just

2464
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,739
it is

2465
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:25,539
this is the why

2466
00:40:25,539 --> 00:40:27,079
because I don't like seeing you get hit mate

2467
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:27,599
I don't

2468
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,900
I don't want to see you get hit

2469
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,699
so don't show me how tough you are

2470
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:31,960
I said I love the fact

2471
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,039
you want to show me how tough you are

2472
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:33,940
I love the bravado

2473
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,380
but show me how good you are

2474
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,059
I prefer

2475
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,219
I prefer to see how good you are

2476
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:37,900
than how tough you are

2477
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,519
I know you're tough

2478
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,500
that

2479
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:39,960
that's

2480
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,420
that's

2481
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,500
I don't want to see that shit

2482
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:41,739
I want to see you

2483
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:42,699
I want to see how good you are

2484
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:43,820
I want to see how skillful you are

2485
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,400
hitting and not getting hit

2486
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,340
is the art of boxing

2487
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,960
I want to raise him to be a boxer

2488
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,059
not a brawler

2489
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:50,860
but he's going to have to be a brawler

2490
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,719
at certain stages

2491
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:52,159
but yeah

2492
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:52,940
it's like you mate

2493
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,179
like I

2494
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:53,619
if

2495
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,079
I used to get nervous

2496
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,340
when my boy was on the footy field

2497
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:56,739
when he was

2498
00:40:56,739 --> 00:40:58,219
8, 9, 10, 11 years old

2499
00:40:58,219 --> 00:40:59,579
so I couldn't imagine

2500
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:01,099
how nerve wracking it would be

2501
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:02,519
seeing him against your boy

2502
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:03,519
if you were watching your boy

2503
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:04,019
and you watch your boy

2504
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:04,480
in against

2505
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,019
big, strong, explosive, powerful men

2506
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:07,800
you know

2507
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,579
it's

2508
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:09,300
yeah it's not easy

2509
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:09,880
seeing your kids

2510
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,420
and it kind of

2511
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:11,719
particularly

2512
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,719
combat sport

2513
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:14,260
goes against

2514
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,639
every parental instinct

2515
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,400
that you have

2516
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,699
yeah and you can't

2517
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:18,699
I suppose as you said Dave

2518
00:41:18,699 --> 00:41:19,559
you stand in his way

2519
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:20,460
you're not

2520
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,559
being the parent you want to be

2521
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:22,019
either A

2522
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:23,239
if he's got a passion for it

2523
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:24,099
you have to

2524
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:25,000
be on the journey

2525
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
do you coach him

2526
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,219
will you outsource that

2527
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:28,159
will you let someone else

2528
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:29,239
jump in

2529
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:30,239
and do that

2530
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:31,679
I'm training him

2531
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:32,219
at the moment

2532
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:33,340
and that's what it was

2533
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:33,800
you said

2534
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,280
am I

2535
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,659
am I

2536
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,159
curious

2537
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,539
so last night I was up

2538
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:39,719
and writing down

2539
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:40,599
all the strength

2540
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:41,460
and conditioning

2541
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,820
exercises that I've done

2542
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,360
in my career

2543
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,079
that I've learned off

2544
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,340
my strength and conditioning team

2545
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,199
that I've had over two different

2546
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,139
strength and conditioning teams

2547
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:47,679
in my career

2548
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:49,420
so I was writing

2549
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,539
all the exercises

2550
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:51,159
that I've done

2551
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:52,659
and then my mom was going

2552
00:41:52,659 --> 00:41:53,800
right well I can do this

2553
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,119
and I can put all of them

2554
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:55,960
into body parts

2555
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,320
what exercise works

2556
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,139
what body parts

2557
00:41:58,139 --> 00:41:59,920
and then write a whole list

2558
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,699
and a whole program

2559
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:01,340
it's going to take me

2560
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:01,860
a long time

2561
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,820
but I've started the process

2562
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,539
and once I start

2563
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:05,500
hopefully I'll get it done

2564
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,039
and finish it

2565
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:07,099
but yeah I'm curious

2566
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:07,739
because then I started

2567
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:09,159
looking at googling things

2568
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,039
and going well Faraday

2569
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:10,599
can do this

2570
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:10,920
and this

2571
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,219
and this

2572
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:11,440
and this

2573
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,179
just so I can try

2574
00:42:13,179 --> 00:42:14,699
and as a father

2575
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:15,739
but as a coach

2576
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:16,440
it's difficult

2577
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,820
you'll understand this Luke

2578
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,400
as a father

2579
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:19,840
I tell him

2580
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,599
we have our blow ups

2581
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:21,739
in the gym

2582
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:22,420
and I say mate

2583
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,019
I'm not your father

2584
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:24,940
in this instance

2585
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,800
I'm your coach

2586
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,360
and you will not talk

2587
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:27,960
to me that way

2588
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,440
as your father

2589
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,119
because you know

2590
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:29,860
boys and men

2591
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,940
young blokes

2592
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:31,519
and fathers

2593
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:32,519
they get pretty heated

2594
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:34,059
I said would you talk

2595
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:34,780
that way to Pat

2596
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,559
my old coach

2597
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:36,900
I said would you behave

2598
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:37,219
that way

2599
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:37,739
and would you speak

2600
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:39,000
that way to Pat

2601
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,679
ever

2602
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:40,559
and he said no

2603
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:41,219
I said well the same

2604
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:41,980
applies to me

2605
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,340
I'm your coach in here

2606
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,420
I'm not your father

2607
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,579
and I'll talk to you

2608
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:46,860
as a fighter

2609
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,579
I won't talk to you

2610
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:48,039
as my son

2611
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:49,500
and that's the way

2612
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,079
it's got to be

2613
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,699
so it's a different dynamic

2614
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:52,340
and we're working

2615
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,059
our way through it

2616
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:54,559
and obviously

2617
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:55,119
there's been some

2618
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,139
great success stories

2619
00:42:56,139 --> 00:42:57,000
with fathers and sons

2620
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,679
and there's been

2621
00:42:57,679 --> 00:42:59,280
some horrid stories as well

2622
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,380
hopefully as is

2623
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,380
the first one

2624
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,960
a success

2625
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,460
but it's early days

2626
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,119
and I'm really enjoying it

2627
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:05,940
but the main thing is

2628
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,260
we get to spend

2629
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,900
so much quality time together

2630
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,780
and for me as a father

2631
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,199
to be able

2632
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:11,800
to pass on

2633
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,860
the skill of fighting

2634
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,820
and be able to protect

2635
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,639
and defend himself

2636
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:16,019
and to make him

2637
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:16,579
because I said to him

2638
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:17,219
when they were very early

2639
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:17,780
both our kids

2640
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,340
being strong

2641
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,079
and able

2642
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,099
in this household

2643
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,000
is non-negotiable

2644
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,800
you're going to be

2645
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,559
you're going to work

2646
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,679
you're going to train

2647
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:25,719
you're going to build

2648
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:26,300
your body up

2649
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:26,980
to be strong

2650
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,559
and resilient

2651
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:28,579
and that's going to build

2652
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:29,380
this to be strong

2653
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:29,860
and resilient

2654
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,079
and that's non-negotiable

2655
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:31,679
and whatever you want

2656
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:32,000
to do with it

2657
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,460
you can do it

2658
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:32,980
so our daughter

2659
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,860
she was a very successful

2660
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:35,260
swimmer

2661
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,059
she was a three-time

2662
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:37,039
national 10km

2663
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:37,780
open water champion

2664
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,659
and now Archie's

2665
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:40,960
he's going

2666
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,139
into a sport

2667
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:43,380
so we'll see

2668
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,300
but yeah

2669
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:44,800
it's difficult

2670
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,360
as a father

2671
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,099
as you know

2672
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:47,159
watching your kids

2673
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:47,840
play a sport

2674
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,280
particularly when you see

2675
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:49,719
an opening

2676
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:50,559
where they could take

2677
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:51,059
or you see

2678
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:52,880
someone's on the

2679
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,460
out on the flank

2680
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,199
and you could have

2681
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:54,659
passed it there

2682
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:55,360
he doesn't do it

2683
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,179
because you know

2684
00:43:56,179 --> 00:43:56,920
we're experts

2685
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,519
we know everything

2686
00:43:58,519 --> 00:43:59,260
from the sidelines

2687
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,440
yeah you don't make

2688
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,179
a mistake from

2689
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:02,579
the 10th row back

2690
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:03,800
as I've found out

2691
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,619
in recent times

2692
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:05,179
hey Dan

2693
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:05,880
let me ask you this

2694
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,800
who's been the greatest

2695
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,719
leader in your life?

2696
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:09,159
my father

2697
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:10,920
yeah my father

2698
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,500
my father Malcolm

2699
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,059
without doubt

2700
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:13,099
no he was

2701
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:14,480
he was my footy coach

2702
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:14,960
when we were young

2703
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,860
from the age of 9

2704
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:16,579
until I was 17

2705
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:17,679
we won three premierships

2706
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:19,699
14s, 15s and 17s

2707
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:20,739
and only junior footy

2708
00:44:20,739 --> 00:44:21,320
and I was

2709
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,599
I was the smallest guy

2710
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:23,000
I was a four

2711
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,760
the only place

2712
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,440
the only place she could

2713
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,079
hide me was on the

2714
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:25,480
four pocket

2715
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,780
and occasionally

2716
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,320
I'd get a crumb

2717
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:27,900
every now and then

2718
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,480
and yeah but

2719
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,599
we were

2720
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:31,480
not one of us

2721
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,119
in our team

2722
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:33,019
we played against

2723
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:33,880
guys at you know

2724
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,579
17s grand final

2725
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:35,559
Daniel Sirikowski

2726
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:37,559
David Sirikowski

2727
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:38,300
and Daniel Souther

2728
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,420
and then

2729
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,920
Mark Miranda

2730
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,300
as well

2731
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,320
I think played in the team

2732
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:42,880
we played against

2733
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,539
in the grand final

2734
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:44,500
so you know

2735
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,719
really good footballers

2736
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:46,940
but in our team

2737
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,360
not one person played

2738
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,440
reserves footy

2739
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,400
a couple guys

2740
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,019
played a few games

2741
00:44:51,019 --> 00:44:51,320
of Colts

2742
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,360
we were ordinary

2743
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,360
players

2744
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,780
but we were a fantastic unit

2745
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,440
so for instance

2746
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,260
this will make you smile

2747
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:57,900
my old man was

2748
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,219
he loved his footy

2749
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:00,159
he was a good football

2750
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:00,599
in the bush

2751
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:01,039
when he played

2752
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:01,920
and then

2753
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,800
he loved coaching

2754
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,480
and he was a really

2755
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:03,980
really good

2756
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,159
he knew how to get

2757
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:06,320
the best out of young blokes

2758
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,380
and he was a dad

2759
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,139
he was a coach

2760
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:08,599
who'd go and

2761
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:09,599
pick up and drop off

2762
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:10,340
boys who couldn't

2763
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:10,900
make it to training

2764
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,840
or his old man

2765
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,940
wasn't present in their life

2766
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,460
and they all keep in touch

2767
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,380
with me to this day

2768
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,639
saying your old man

2769
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:17,619
was just so good to me

2770
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:19,139
you don't realise

2771
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:20,000
how much of an impact

2772
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
he had on my young life

2773
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,219
and so that makes me

2774
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:22,760
very proud

2775
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,059
but on the way

2776
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:25,239
to our grand final

2777
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:26,300
the 17th grand final

2778
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,460
we played at Claremont Oval

2779
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,199
and they were already

2780
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:30,579
on the ground

2781
00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:31,340
so we'd organise

2782
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,880
to meet at our home ground

2783
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,480
where we played

2784
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,840
we all go there

2785
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,659
we all go in our gear

2786
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:36,340
we all train

2787
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,599
and warm up there before

2788
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:38,820
we all get in a bus

2789
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,800
and we drive to the venue

2790
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,340
on the bus

2791
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,699
when the bus got there

2792
00:45:41,699 --> 00:45:42,400
it got there like

2793
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,179
five minutes before

2794
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:43,940
the game started

2795
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,440
we ran straight off the bus

2796
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,260
onto the oval

2797
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,239
did a few laps

2798
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:47,900
a few warm ups

2799
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,300
bang

2800
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,079
so I went

2801
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,139
and we kicked the first goal

2802
00:45:50,139 --> 00:45:51,320
and hit the ground running

2803
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,000
so his idea was

2804
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,900
let's rattle them

2805
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,099
let's rattle them

2806
00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:56,199
no one knew where we were

2807
00:45:56,199 --> 00:45:56,880
they thought we'd gone

2808
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,480
to the other ground

2809
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,079
because there was not

2810
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,460
one person from our team

2811
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,340
at the oval

2812
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,179
and there was five

2813
00:46:01,179 --> 00:46:02,840
one of my favourite

2814
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,900
ever teammates

2815
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,340
he came over

2816
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,699
and was doing stuff

2817
00:46:06,699 --> 00:46:07,340
at a level

2818
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,380
we hadn't seen before

2819
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,000
and he was

2820
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,699
he was

2821
00:46:09,699 --> 00:46:10,320
he was

2822
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,599
instead of the end of season trip

2823
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:12,199
he'd be off

2824
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:12,860
you know

2825
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:13,320
in

2826
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,000
you know

2827
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,400
the last pygmy tribe

2828
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,079
somewhere in

2829
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,159
wherever they are in the world

2830
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:18,639
and he was an adventure

2831
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:19,659
and a tough guy too

2832
00:46:19,659 --> 00:46:20,219
Danny Southern

2833
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:21,099
he's the bloke

2834
00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:22,820
you want on your team

2835
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,079
oh big time

2836
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:24,780
he wanted to stand

2837
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:25,699
alongside Danny Southern

2838
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:26,619
but a brilliant guy

2839
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:28,159
and he's back in Perth

2840
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:29,199
and going

2841
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:29,860
beautifully

2842
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,780
we love the idea

2843
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,380
of collaboration

2844
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,780
in the world we are Danny

2845
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,440
in this leadership space

2846
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,039
called a leader

2847
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:36,179
have you ever thought about

2848
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:37,159
someone you'd like

2849
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:38,119
to collaborate with

2850
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:38,900
whether it was

2851
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,800
from the world of boxing

2852
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,300
or

2853
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,579
someone you thought

2854
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:42,159
you know

2855
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:43,199
another area of your life

2856
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,280
that a name springs out

2857
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:44,559
you've gone

2858
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:45,340
that's someone I'd love

2859
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,480
to spend some time with

2860
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,119
too many to name

2861
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:48,619
look

2862
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:49,920
too many to name

2863
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,340
there's a lot of really good people

2864
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:51,659
out there

2865
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:52,719
doing some really good things

2866
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:53,159
that have got

2867
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:54,440
that would have a massive

2868
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,000
impact on my life

2869
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,920
yeah there's so many people

2870
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,659
I couldn't name

2871
00:46:58,659 --> 00:46:59,420
I couldn't name them

2872
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,119
off the top of my head

2873
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:01,099
there's just so many people

2874
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:01,659
that have been

2875
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:03,480
and I don't rate success

2876
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:03,960
as being

2877
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,480
you know

2878
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,219
loaded or winning

2879
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:05,679
premierships

2880
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:06,360
I rate success

2881
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,780
as being a good bloke

2882
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:09,920
and having good people

2883
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,320
around you

2884
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,440
that's what I rate as success

2885
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,880
so there's so many people

2886
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,659
out there like that

2887
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:14,579
and as you have

2888
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:14,739
mate

2889
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:16,599
you're in a massive industry

2890
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:17,559
you have met

2891
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:18,159
come across

2892
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:19,360
so many good people

2893
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,699
I guess one bloke

2894
00:47:21,699 --> 00:47:22,300
and it's probably

2895
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,320
it's not going to happen

2896
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:24,800
but you know

2897
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,519
David Goggins

2898
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:26,179
is the guy

2899
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:26,500
you know

2900
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,300
he's the guy

2901
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,079
I'd love to just

2902
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:28,860
sit down

2903
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:29,400
and spend

2904
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,400
20 minutes with

2905
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,039
and my son

2906
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:32,980
just spend 20 minutes

2907
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:33,260
with him

2908
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:33,739
and just go

2909
00:47:33,739 --> 00:47:34,440
whoa

2910
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,000
that guy

2911
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:35,940
I tell my boys

2912
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,159
he's actually like

2913
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:37,320
you know

2914
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:37,860
you watch the

2915
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,460
the Marvel movies

2916
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:39,900
and the Transformers

2917
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,639
he's like a real life

2918
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:42,059
one of those

2919
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:43,300
he's actually the real deal

2920
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,880
my three boys

2921
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,840
are obsessed with that

2922
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,380
I don't know

2923
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,340
his work as well

2924
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,659
but that's the one

2925
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:50,360
on their list

2926
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,380
why so special

2927
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:52,900
about him

2928
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:53,239
what's

2929
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:54,320
tell me more

2930
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,159
about David Goggins

2931
00:47:55,159 --> 00:47:56,480
just

2932
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,679
I think he's

2933
00:47:57,679 --> 00:47:58,519
what he

2934
00:47:58,519 --> 00:47:59,659
how he pushes

2935
00:47:59,659 --> 00:48:00,440
his mind

2936
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,400
so he obviously

2937
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,280
pushes his body

2938
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:02,880
to limits

2939
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,559
that not many

2940
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:04,719
there's only very few

2941
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:06,099
people could ever do

2942
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:07,460
but then

2943
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,840
his mind

2944
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,400
so his mind

2945
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,260
pushes the whole thing

2946
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,280
so his mind

2947
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:11,559
is

2948
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:12,480
it's

2949
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,039
I think it's

2950
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:14,380
it's airtight

2951
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,059
it's like

2952
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:15,619
you can't

2953
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:16,559
you couldn't

2954
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:17,139
you just couldn't

2955
00:48:17,139 --> 00:48:17,980
penetrate his mind

2956
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,679
and to be that strong

2957
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:20,539
and to have that much

2958
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:21,559
resilience

2959
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:23,099
and to be so bold

2960
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:24,820
but to continue

2961
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:25,800
walking the walk

2962
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,739
not just talking

2963
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:27,780
like he can give up now

2964
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,820
with what he's done

2965
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:29,599
and continue to

2966
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:30,320
talk the talk

2967
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:30,699
forever

2968
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:31,699
and everyone would go

2969
00:48:31,699 --> 00:48:32,320
you know

2970
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,559
you're the messiah

2971
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:34,880
but he continues

2972
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,780
to walk the walk

2973
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,599
so he's leading

2974
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:37,239
by example

2975
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:38,300
so he's a true leader

2976
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,199
and so

2977
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:40,539
you

2978
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:41,900
Danny Green

2979
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,380
I've always

2980
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,940
been inspired by you

2981
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:44,940
and the person you are

2982
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:45,800
and even listening today

2983
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,960
going back to the values

2984
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,679
and how grateful you are

2985
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:49,119
for everything

2986
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:50,019
in your life

2987
00:48:50,019 --> 00:48:51,139
and continually doing

2988
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:52,179
outstanding things

2989
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,139
and you know

2990
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,119
I look back at

2991
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:55,340
you changing the whole

2992
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,380
narrative around

2993
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:56,980
what it means

2994
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:57,880
for young people

2995
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,199
to think about

2996
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:00,320
the violence on the street

2997
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,460
but also being able

2998
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,559
to articulate

2999
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:03,400
as you have today

3000
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,480
it's important for young boys

3001
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,000
to grow up

3002
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:05,460
and understand

3003
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,360
that side of themselves

3004
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:06,780
and we

3005
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:07,179
you know

3006
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:07,619
we've got a

3007
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:08,659
strong conversation

3008
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:09,360
to have on that

3009
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,280
I always love

3010
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,199
bumping into you

3011
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:11,719
Danny

3012
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:12,800

3013
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,739

00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:14,300
