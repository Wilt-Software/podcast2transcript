1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:09,060
Rod Campbell is one of the most positive and passionate people that I have ever met.

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:22,600
A lifelong firefighter whose passion for educating young people has helped reduce the trauma of road incidents across a sustained period of more than a decade in one of the most vulnerable times in young kids' lives in their teenage years.

3
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:32,399
Rod is a father of five who shares my passion for wanting to change what we both see as the escalating bad behaviour of parents at junior sport.

4
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:57,420
In my view, the crazy actions of many adults at junior sport, abusing junior umpires, screaming and yelling from the sidelines at their kids and the opposition, actual physical violence, zero regard for the experience of other teams and their kids, aggressive coaches who are stacking teams, are all causing problems for our kids and their enjoyment of sport in what is a devastating way.

5
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,880
Rod's education program to teach the values of respect for sportsmanship.

6
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,659
Is for me a huge part of the answer.

7
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:13,040
What we've seen is junior leagues forced to create a number of legislative rules to try and combat this bad behaviour.

8
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,379
Banning parents from the field, creating umpire escorts, huge suspensions, tribunal hearings.

9
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:25,780
Whilst this has a role to play for extreme bad behaviour, it doesn't seem to be working at anywhere near the level it should.

10
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,299
Rod's program of educating, positive reinforcement of good behaviour.

11
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,379
To me is a huge part of what we do.

12
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,980
It's what we need to do to create better junior sporting environments for all of us and our kids going forward.

13
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,159
Every parent, in my view, you need to listen to this conversation.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,400
I generally think there's a crisis out there in junior sport.

15
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,879
We all need to be part of the change.

16
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,280
Rod Campbell can be a big part of that.

17
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,599
It's wonderful leadership stories like Rod Campbell's that inspire the work we do at Alita.

18
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,659
In particular, it's our Alita Connect Signature for Spoke Leadership Forum that I want to talk to you about again today.

19
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,859
We're currently curating groups.

20
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,540
We're all around the world and one with Rod Campbell in mind.

21
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,900
He's a fireman, passionate about junior sport, as you're about to hear, but has great values of positivity, impacting others.

22
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,400
And they're the sort of values that we really want to share in this ever-expanding community of Alita Connect.

23
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,560
If you're looking to enhance your own personal development or you want to support the development of your team,

24
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,180
then come and join our growing community at Alita and Alita Connect.

Go to alitacollective.com, book a discovery call.

26
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,379
We'd love to chat to you about a program for you.

27
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,379
Huge thanks as always.

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Huge thanks to Jason Nicholas and his team from Tempur, Australia and New Zealand.

29
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:43,199
Success leaves clues and we know that good leaders, especially those we've talked to on the Empowering Leaders podcast,

30
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,719
all value sleep as one of the key pillars to their success.

31
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:53,520
Given we spend a third of our life asleep, investing in the world's best in bedding just simply makes sense.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
Tempur is a mattress like no other.

33
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,400
I encourage you to check it out.

34
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,620
Rod Campbell is a firefighter, football coach,

35
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,099
and father of five who has dedicated his adult life to helping people.

36
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,039
Rod uses the superpower of selflessness to inspire others to make someone else's day better.

37
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,900
Rod has been honoured with the Australian Fire Service Medal

38
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,699
for his inspirational efforts in educating adolescents in road safety.

39
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:26,000
Rod's road awareness campaign he coordinated for 15 years resulted in a 75% reduction in fatalities

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,240
in the 16 to 19-year-old bracket in South Australia

41
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,740
and a reduction in serious injuries of over one-third in that time.

42
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:40,680
Rod has created an education program, Learning Life Through Sport,

43
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:48,120
to tackle what, in my view, is a crisis in bad parenting behaviour in junior sport in Australia and around the world.

44
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:51,439
Rod, I've been looking forward to catching up with you and lots to talk about.

45
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:52,139
Thanks for joining me.

46
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:53,139
Yeah, thanks, Luke.

47
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,800
I'm really excited to be here.

48
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,500
Your dad, Graham Campbell, is a Hall of Famer at the Fitzroy Football Club in the AFL.

49
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,900
He played against my dad, David, in the VFL,

50
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,680
and they became great players.

51
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:03,719
Yeah.

52
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:03,740
Yeah.

53
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,979
They've been great mates, broadcasting football for many years in South Australia.

54
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,419
To sit in the back of the commentary box behind my dad and your dad,

55
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,580
I think they'd both be smiling now, knowing that we're catching up today, Rod.

56
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,339
Yeah, I think they'd be genuinely excited by that, Luke.

57
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,339
And when we first met, we shared a few anecdotes about our dads,

58
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,399
and I know we share the same love and passion for family and for our dads,

59
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,779
so we have that in common, which is lovely.

60
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,779
Your impact on reducing the road toll is a brilliant story.

61
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,360
Can you tell us how you went about it?

62
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,439
Yeah.

63
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:33,959
Yeah, thanks, Luke.

64
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,439
So it was in the MFS.

65
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,839
I'm a firefighter, qualified firefighter.

66
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:40,139
I was working in that space as a station officer,

67
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:45,699
and the predecessor who ran the road awareness program fell ill with cancer,

68
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,360
and he asked me just to look after the program.

69
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,800
I was a footy coach at the time at different levels,

70
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,160
and he thought footy coaches would be good in presenting the program.

71
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,160
So, yeah, I came into it and changed it up a bit.

72
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,839
We needed to sort of modernize it a bit.

73
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,600
It was a bit clunky, and it was like firefighters presenting in road safety,

74
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,240
so we created a PowerPoint.

75
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,639
The presentation and the strength of it was getting crash survivors in

76
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,759
so they could tell their story.

77
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,500
So it was either people who'd survived crashes,

78
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,120
so they were quadriplegics, paraplegics, people with brain injuries,

79
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,720
or parents who'd lost kids in crashes.

80
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,680
So one of my closest friends, Kim, lost his two children,

81
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,920
his wife and his kid's best friend in a crash.

82
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,040
So his whole family went in one crash.

83
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,759
And to just see the selflessness of these people

84
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,720
and the emotion that we would create in the room and that genuineness,

85
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,000
so what we wanted to do was not change things through enforcement.

86
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:39,660
We weren't seeing that as working,

87
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:42,660
but we wanted to empower people and inspire them to do things differently.

88
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,019
So we created some mottos.

89
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,180
One of them was looking after our mates, so rap looking after our mates,

90
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:49,759
so we kind of Australianized it.

91
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,319
But also one of our key sayings was you get to choose the risk,

92
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,660
but you don't get to choose the consequence.

93
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,279
So we would show people, young people aged 16 to 19,

94
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,000
so usually around about year 11 students in South Australia,

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,620
and we got the opportunity to present it around.

96
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,839
The risks that we choose and the consequences we couldn't control.

97
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:10,860
And ultimately we would want to empower and inspire them

98
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,019
to want to be better behaved,

99
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,000
so to be selfless on the roads and care about others.

100
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:18,680
I think we just inherit these selfish behaviours on the roads.

101
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,379
And because the students we would talk to,

102
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,379
their parents were around about my age,

103
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,420
we didn't have much road safety education,

104
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,959
but we were exposing these young people to education

105
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,439
and how they could look after their mates.

106
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,439
So the difference in the road toll we couldn't claim as the MFFs

107
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:33,779
and we don't.

108
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,500
But what we could say is that the young people

109
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,779
certainly were making the change that we needed to see.

110
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:43,300
So while we provided the vehicle, they were providing the change.

111
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,240
And that's where I learnt that education is the key

112
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,720
and that's what I use now in learning life through sport.

113
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,920
And Roy, we understand on the road

114
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,180
that there virtually aren't a lot of accidents.

115
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,240
They're mostly through high risk taking behaviour,

116
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,459
whether it be alcohol or speeding or someone doing something

117
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,600
that is, as you described,

118
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,639
selfish in a car.

119
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,939
And I thought the road toll was almost capped.

120
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:06,980
You couldn't make an impact.

121
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,420
So when you got to the 16-year-olds consistently

122
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,279
and you explained it in this way,

123
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,839
we're talking, you know, 70, 80, 90 lives a year

124
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,060
and then another massive bracket of people

125
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,420
that had life-changing injuries

126
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,860
that literally it didn't happen to.

127
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,899
So education can work even in those circumstances.

128
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,800
It's a powerful message, isn't it?

129
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,279
Yeah, until you expose people to a different way to go about it,

130
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,019
they don't know.

131
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,279
They don't know.

132
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:32,420
They don't know.

133
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:32,459
They don't know.

134
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:32,579
They don't know.

135
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,040
And in the road safety space,

136
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,439
we wouldn't talk about accidents

137
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:37,160
because accidents are unavoidable.

138
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,240
We talk about crashes

139
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,379
because crashes, someone is responsible.

140
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:41,139
And you're right, Dar,

141
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,740
so three major killers on our roads,

142
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,439
people driving under the influence,

143
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,639
people speeding or distracted drivers,

144
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,279
and they probably make up, you know,

145
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,860
up to 90, a high proportion,

146
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,240
98% of crashes that occur

147
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,720
are because of things that we do,

148
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:55,980
so behaviours that we have.

149
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,680
And if they can see the outcomes of those behaviours

150
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,879
and in a way where they're emotionally impacted

151
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,420
by these guest presenters,

152
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,459
so they can see how their lives have changed,

153
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,240
and they don't want that to be them,

154
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:08,220
they don't want their parents to have a crash like that,

155
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:09,800
they don't want their friends to go through that,

156
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,639
so we really bring it to the forefront.

157
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
We don't hide anything, like it's in your face,

158
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:14,779
but it's real.

159
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,480
If you want to be on the roads and you want to drive,

160
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,620
this is what you're up against,

161
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,720
or these are the risks that we're choosing,

162
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:21,259
the consequences we can't control.

163
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:22,639
So we want to trust you.

164
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,519
We want you guys to make the difference,

165
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,139
and that's what we're seeing in South Australia on the roads.

166
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,500
The young people have been amazing.

167
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,240
Rod, I wanted to get that story out

168
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,240
because it sets up ostensibly

169
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,779
the reason why I wanted to sit down with you.

170
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,500
It's a shared passion that we have,

171
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,600
nine children between the two of us.

172
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,960
Junior sport is a great passion of both of us.

173
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,779
It changed my life as a kid,

174
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:49,299
and for me, junior sport should be the happiest place on earth.

175
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,179
It should be the most fun for all kids,

176
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,620
regardless of ability, regardless of standard,

177
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,840
but having spent a fair bit of my life

178
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,840
either as a kid playing it and now as a dad around it,

179
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,460
it's not that for me at all.

180
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:02,399
The fun has gone.

181
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,580
The fun has gone for a lot of young kids,

182
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,139
and I think every parent needs to listen to this conversation,

183
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,100
and I couldn't be more passionate about it.

184
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:16,220
What I've seen, I've got four kids ranging from 20 to 12,

185
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,279
so I've spent a huge amount of time around junior sport.

186
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,860
The behavior of parents is horrific.

187
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,580
It's out of control.

188
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,639
It's ruining junior sport for a whole generation of kids,

189
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,240
and I get emotive about it because it is literally that upsetting.

190
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:32,059
Am I overstating it, Rod?

191
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,159
What's your thoughts?

192
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,779
No, I'm on the same page, Luke.

193
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,559
You might be understating it, to be fair.

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,100
I've experienced the same thing.

195
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:40,159
My youngest is 12 years old.

196
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,480
He plays footy, and I go right up to 29 years old.

197
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,580
He's my eldest daughter.

198
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:46,320
As I said, I've got five kids,

199
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,980
and for that whole period, I haven't seen any change.

200
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,019
I appreciate all the leagues and footy I'm mainly involved in,

201
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,580
but I've been involved in basketball, netball, other sports,

202
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,360
but I think everyone's working hard in the space,

203
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,200
but we're not getting the results that we want to see,

204
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:02,379
and it's this inherited behavior.

205
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,679
It's this inherited behavior that we have

206
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,100
that seems to be the excuse for how we behave,

207
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:08,980
and if you just want to look at one example, Luke,

208
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:11,360
and I only developed this program at the end of last year,

209
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:12,799
which is Learning Life Through Sport,

210
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:13,899
which I've shared with you,

211
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,919
and we share the passion to try and create

212
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,179
and be part of that change,

213
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,120
but once again, it'll be the coaches that create the change.

214
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:21,679
It'll be the leagues that create the change

215
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,580
or the sporting bodies that create the change,

216
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,100
and the program is the vehicle to do it,

217
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,220
but when I was reading and researching it,

218
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,399
there were stories in papers all over Australia,

219
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,340
but one really grabbed my attention.

220
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,779
It was in the Herald Sun,

221
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,399
and it was a story about umpires and junior umpire abuse,

222
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,440
and it went to a quote, and it said,

223
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,059
where else in society would two adults be able

224
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:46,940
to virtually stand on the side of an oval

225
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,039
and just hurl abuse at a 14-year-old,

226
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,519
and this might be a 14-year-old kid

227
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,620
who's in a green shirt, right, boy or girl,

228
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,100
because they're the umpire, but that's our right, okay?

229
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,779
So if we're in footy as an example,

230
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,460
and other sports are similar, we know that,

231
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,779
and we'll show examples of that,

232
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:01,120
but let's use footy

233
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,740
as the example.

234
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,679
So we've inherited this behavior.

235
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,519
When you go to the footy,

236
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,539
and you're a junior parent or a junior coach,

237
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,159
because the coaches have the biggest impact,

238
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,259
it seems like it's almost okay,

239
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,340
or it's your right to abuse the umpire.

240
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,720
At what point that ever became okay,

241
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,179
you know, I find hard to fathom.

242
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,240
I was brought up, I imagine, like you with your dad,

243
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:20,820
and we respected the umpire's decision,

244
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,240
but we don't see that out there in society,

245
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,100
and as soon as we get to a junior game,

246
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:27,519
at any age group, you'll hear it from the sidelines.

247
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:29,279
You'll hear the parents buying in.

248
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,679
You'll hear coaches commentating.

249
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,080
And screaming out,

250
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,919
ball, come on, ump, you know,

251
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,080
what about that decision?

252
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,440
And then they enable their players to do the same,

253
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,159
so then the players start commentating it,

254
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,120
and all of a sudden,

255
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,500
there's this massive disrespect for the umpire

256
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,620
who's out there to try and do a wrong.

257
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,779
So in this instance, the example that I gave,

258
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,779
you've got a 14-year-old umpire out there.

259
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,100
Who's supporting them?

260
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,960
And I would ask parents out there,

261
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,120
do you want the governing body or the league

262
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,820
to create a safe environment for your children

263
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,559
to play sport, to play footy,

264
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,600
boys or girls in footy?

265
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,019
And I'd imagine that their answer would be,

266
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,159
yes, is that what you expect, Luke?

267
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:03,980
100%, yeah, absolutely.

268
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,480
So do you expect it to be a safe environment

269
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,299
for the umpires?

270
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,419
Because that's someone's son or daughter as well.

271
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,580
Correct there, Rod.

272
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,120
And I talk to people overseas,

273
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,940
and I explain that in our leagues,

274
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,159
we have parents who have to escort

275
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,659
the 14-year-old umpires to the centres.

276
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,340
And I understand why leagues legislate.

277
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:22,259
So you've got umpire escorts whose job is

278
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:24,940
to protect these kids from other parents

279
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,299
who may say something horrifically abusive

280
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:30,379
or even physically intimidate young umpires.

281
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:33,720
Now, I've seen on more than a dozen occasions

282
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,039
the umpire escorts abusing the umpires

283
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:36,980
who are 14-year-old kids.

284
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:39,059
That's how crazy this has got.

285
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,379
You and I have shared a lot of correspondence

286
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,779
over the past sort of 18 months.

287
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,440
And even in preparation for today,

288
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,659
you're on a Zoom in the last week

289
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:49,620
with Chris Donnellan.

290
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,259
He's a 400-game AFL umpire.

291
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,320
He's the president of the AFL Umpiring Association.

292
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,960
Have a listen to this grab from him.

293
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,820
He's given us permission to share it.

294
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,600
This is someone who's been around the game

295
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,000
for a long period of time.

296
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,080
He's been around the game for a long period of time.

297
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,159
He's been around the game for a long period of time.

298
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:00,259
He's been around the game for a long period of time.

299
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:01,879
You'll hear him talk about his daughter

300
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:05,299
who umpires Division III community sport.

301
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:08,440
Have a listen to the language that Chris Donnellan's

302
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,279
talking about how bad junior sport's got.

303
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,019
If I could just show you some of the threats

304
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:13,259
and other stuff that's been said,

305
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,159
I mean, it's disgusting.

306
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,279
But we've got avenues.

307
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:17,480
It's okay for us.

308
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,740
You know, my daughter, she's umpiring

309
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,220
community football, Division III sometimes.

310
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,279
And, I mean, you guys and girls would know this.

311
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,000
It is horrendous, right?

312
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,000
We're the blessed ones.

313
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,799
We're the lucky ones.

314
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:28,580
We've got protection.

315
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,039
You know, we can go to Integral.

316
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,759
We can go to Integrity and have people's accounts

317
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,519
pulled down or whatever, or police officers

318
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,840
knocking on doors, or AFL Integrity, you know,

319
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,340
rescinding memberships, all sorts of things.

320
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:41,639
We've got all levers we can pull.

321
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,779
But I see it on a weekly basis at local footy,

322
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,000
coaches behaving like ignorant pricks,

323
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,720
players wanting to punch on and belt each other up,

324
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,000
spectators full of piss and booze,

325
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,940
just creating all sorts of stress and anxiety.

326
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,440
And, you know, I'm looking at this cohort,

327
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,019
apologies, but it's not a young cohort.

328
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,279
And umpiring is going to be in serious trouble

329
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,039
if we don't start creating safer environments,

330
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,659
and I mean match day environments, for officials.

331
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,460
Because my daughter, she's lucky that I'm there

332
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,200
to support her.

333
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,779
Other young people don't have that same mechanism

334
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:16,779
and that same support.

335
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,799
And so why the hell would young people put themselves

336
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,879
in a position where they're going to be abused,

337
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,759
racially, physically even?

338
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,360
We see it physically more often, emotionally.

339
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,860
And frankly, you know, I'm getting on a bit

340
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,019
of a high.

341
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,899
But I'm fed up with local footy.

342
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,360
And I think local community and groups can do a hell

343
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,419
of a lot more to embrace and ingratiate young people

344
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,039
into umpiring environments.

345
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,120
That old blokey behaviour's got to stop.

346
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:44,860
You know, we've got to be more inclusive and open

347
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,120
and supportive of all our umpires.

348
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:49,679
So pick up on the back of that, Rod.

349
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,059
It's a motive, and I want to set the scene in this

350
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:55,039
so that parents listening don't point the finger

351
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:57,659
and say, oh, I know Billy's the coach from that side.

352
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,440
He's the one that's, we've got to put a mirror up

353
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,000
to all of our umpires.

354
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,899
We've got to put a mirror up to our behaviour now

355
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,360
because, you know, that's one example, but we have

356
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,700
got dozens and dozens of examples that are turning

357
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,840
out to be horrific, aren't they?

358
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,759
Absolutely.

359
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,860
And please, if you're listening out there, have

360
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,220
some empathy for the umpire and Chris in his position.

361
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,360
So he speaks about the fact that at AFL level,

362
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,639
they've got some support and they've got people

363
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,799
around them that can protect them, if you like.

364
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,879
But these young people that go out and want to

365
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:26,299
umpire the game, you know, they want to be part

366
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:26,940
of our great game.

367
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:29,539
They might choose not to be players, but they want

368
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:30,039
to umpire.

369
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,720
They should have a great experience.

370
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:34,399
And Chris is experiencing it over here in community

371
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,799
footy.

372
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:37,259
We experience it, you know, in South Australian

373
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:37,940
community footy.

374
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,139
I know it's all over Australia.

375
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,200
It's not just here in Victoria where Chris is

376
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,960
exposed to it.

377
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,480
So we need to get on top of it.

378
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,639
And I love his passion and also his courage.

379
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,000
Like someone who's in his position, so he heads

380
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,419
up the umpires, the AFL umpires association, to

381
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,039
have the courage to come and speak out.

382
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,279
And again, there'll be people out there that

383
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,879
listen and they might find fault in that or try

384
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:58,980
and find fault in Chris.

385
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,179
So, you know, I think it's a great experience.

386
00:15:59,179 --> 00:15:59,240
I think it's a great experience.

387
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,340
I think it's a great experience.

388
00:15:59,340 --> 00:15:59,399
I think it's a great experience.

389
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,179
I would ask you to have, just have some empathy

390
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:03,840
and understand he, as the parent of someone who's

391
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,279
umpiring football, how animated he was and to

392
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,460
speak like that when he can be so controlled and

393
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,759
he has to be when he umpires, but his passion

394
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,159
came out and I think he's clearly had enough and

395
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:16,039
you're the same, Luke, I'm the same.

396
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,879
We need to make a difference and we're the

397
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,759
parents, we're the adults that can make the

398
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,100
change.

399
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,940
And until we can educate other adults and show

400
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,700
them a different way and empower them to be part

401
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,000
of the change and, you know, through the program,

402
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,600
which we'll talk about a bit later, we can show

403
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,700
how that can easily happen with three values of

404
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,240
sportsmanship, respect, and trying your hardest and

405
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,399
how we can get on top of this.

406
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,960
But first of all, we've got to acknowledge that

407
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,460
it's there.

408
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:40,980
We might blame the past.

409
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,519
So let's say it's inherited behavior, but until

410
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,340
we draw a line in the sand and take responsibility

411
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:49,340
from now on in and make it our responsibility to

412
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,240
leave this area better than we found it.

413
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:51,919
Okay.

414
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,019
It's not going to change.

415
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,340
So we need to get on top of it and we need to all

416
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,000
be part of it.

417
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,960
And that happens by building relationships.

418
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,559
All the way through.

419
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,019
We're using footy as an example, but all the way

420
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:04,460
through, and I'll give you a quick example.

421
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,519
So we're looking for change in, in culture.

422
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,960
The best definition I've ever heard for culture

423
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,720
comes from the culture code, Daniel Coyle.

424
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,799
You may be familiar with it, Luke, but it talks

425
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,619
about culture being a set of living relationships,

426
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:18,500
working towards a common goal.

427
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,319
It's not who you are, it's what you do.

428
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,140
So if we go back to junior sport, as an example,

429
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,920
let's have a look at the living relationships that

430
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,299
we are or aren't building.

431
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,920
So the people who are involved there.

432
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
So as a coach, I coach junior sport at the moment,

433
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,180
junior footy, I'm trying to build relationships

434
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,980
with my players.

435
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,099
So as a coach, I should be able to do that, but

436
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:36,980
not everyone can.

437
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,119
Then I'm trying, I should be building relationships

438
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:39,859
with their parents.

439
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,240
We know as coaches that it can be really difficult

440
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,099
with parents if we're not on the same page.

441
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,220
The other people involved are the umpires.

442
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,799
Are we building relationships with the umpires?

443
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:51,920
Are we building relationships with the opposition coach?

444
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:55,319
Are we building relationships with the opposition players?

445
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,720
So now we've got all the people who are involved, and if we want

446
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,220
to change culture, we need to work in this space.

447
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,960
And again, a program like Learning Life Through Sport shows in a one hour

448
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,880
session with consistent reinforcement weekly with a system that's in place,

449
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,980
how we can build these relationships and put ourselves out there to the

450
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,519
umpires and tell them what we're about.

451
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,259
We're all about sportsmanship and respect.

452
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:18,839
You won't get any issues from our kids.

453
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,119
My kids won't be reacting to any of your decisions.

454
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,819
And I won't say one word as a coach from the boundary.

455
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,279
They look at me, this is before the game, I shake their hand, Luke.

456
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:28,339
They look at me like I'm stupid.

457
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:28,720
You won't say.

458
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,400
I won't say one word.

459
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,740
And the key to it is not watching decisions.

460
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,240
They're going to make decisions.

461
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,099
They'll make mistakes.

462
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,640
I'll make mistakes as a coach.

463
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:38,480
Players will make mistakes.

464
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,279
But as coaches now, we shouldn't be watching the decisions.

465
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,500
We should be watching how our players react.

466
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:45,880
And there's one reaction that we teach in the program.

467
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,799
That's zip your mouth and put your hands up on the mark.

468
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:50,180
If we're doing that and the umpires feel safe.

469
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,960
And then at the end of my introduction to an umpire pregame, I say,

470
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,980
do you guys want to have fun?

471
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,559
They look at me like I'm from out of Mars.

472
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,960
So do you want to have fun?

473
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,619
Like this is the game.

474
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,339
We love, we want you guys to have fun.

475
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:03,880
The end of the game, all of our players shake hands with the umpire and thank them.

476
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:07,079
We give them a gratitude gift bag of lollies to each of the umpires.

477
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:10,700
And I asked the umpires after the game, I'll say, guys, you did an amazing job.

478
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,039
I don't know what job they did.

479
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:12,220
Luke.

480
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,220
I don't watch one decision, but I do watch what I can coach.

481
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,740
And that's how our kids behave because I'm teaching them life

482
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,059
lessons through sport, right?

483
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:21,759
And the umpires are happy that I said they did a great job.

484
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,720
And then I say to them, how are our kids today?

485
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,680
And they say, amazing, unreal, great sports.

486
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,599
You know, they were so polite, you know?

487
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,900
And so we can't tell our kids that.

488
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,359
So the players are getting the reinforcement.

489
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,180
The umpires are feeling happy and safe.

490
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,819
We're giving them a gratitude gift.

491
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,039
And then they tell our players how well they were going.

492
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,339
We go into the rooms after the game.

493
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:40,759
That's our message after the game.

494
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:43,539
The umpire said to the players that we're the best behaved team that they've umpired.

495
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,259
We're all feeling good about our behaviors during the day, not about winning and losing.

496
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,339
So we're taking that paradigm of winning and losing out of it, which might get the parents

497
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:56,240
upset on the side with a yelling and screaming to one of learning great life values through sport.

498
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:58,579
And I really want to move on to you.

499
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:00,000
Because it's profound.

500
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,140
And, and, and there'll be people listening to that, that, you know, I want to put that

501
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,299
to the table today.

502
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,059
So what is it?

503
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,299
Everyone wins a prize and that's the criticism.

504
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,079
Absolutely opposite of that.

505
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,599
You can still compete really hard.

506
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,700
I'd be all for under eights playing for premierships and scoring.

507
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,740
We ban scoring at junior level at that level, because we can't trust the parents to behave

508
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,099
appropriately.

509
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,380
The kids educated the right way almost always do.

510
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,339
And I think you're right.

511
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,079
I stand there as a junior coach as well.

512
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:27,519
And I think.

513
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,400
And I've got a responsibility to my team.

514
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,279
I've got a responsibility to the opposition team.

515
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:36,079
I've got a responsibility to the umpires to make sure everyone has an enjoy.

516
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:38,720
We're talking 12 year olds, 13 year olds, 10 year olds.

517
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,460
So I think you're right in changing the mindset, but I just don't want to undersell the problem

518
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,039
first before we move to your solution.

519
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:49,839
I think it is important because I think people are able to sort of pass this off and see

520
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,019
it as someone else's problem.

521
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,680
But, you know, I want to make a documentary on this road because it needs probably four

522
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,039
hours.

523
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,319
We'll spend the time on it.

524
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,019
But you sent me something this morning.

525
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,940
It's worth playing again.

526
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,680
I just want to make sure people don't miss this.

527
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,119
This is a group of young girls.

528
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,500
They might be 13 or 14 playing rugby league.

529
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:08,700
It's in New South Wales.

530
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,440
And someone has recorded what the parents are saying on the sidelines.

531
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,380
Now, listen to this.

532
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,900
This happens at junior netball, junior basketball, junior footy.

533
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,619
This example is rugby, but it's happening everywhere around Australia.

534
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,680
Have a listen to some of the language from the parents on the sidelines.

535
00:21:23,680 --> 00:22:09,740
You listen to that and you might need.

536
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,259
There's some subtitles that go with it.

537
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,559
We've got parents yelling out, hit the bitch, punch her in the face.

538
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:21,720
That's the parents who are, and we're not pointing fingers at any particular sport here,

539
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:23,279
Rob, because it is everywhere.

540
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,740
That's the environment our kids are now participating in junior sport.

541
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,480
It's horrific.

542
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,460
Yeah.

543
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,700
And it's life and death and it's junior footy and it shouldn't be that.

544
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,900
And, you know, some of it is, Luke, as we know, parents living their unfulfilled sporting

545
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,259
dreams.

546
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:43,400
It's potentially through their kids, but, you know, we get our kids out there and we

547
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,980
need them to have, we need to provide them with a safe environment, you know, so psychologically

548
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,660
and emotionally somewhere where they can go and play and learn.

549
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,859
And we're not providing that.

550
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:59,740
And, you know, surely that's the fundamental of us as coaches to provide that safe environment

551
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,599
and certainly as leagues, whatever sport it is, to provide that environment.

552
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,440
We're not seeing it.

553
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,000
And I know in basketball, as an example, in South Australia last year, there were games

554
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,359
that were abandoned because they couldn't get referees simply because of the poor behaviour.

555
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:20,359
I know also in the SNFL juniors this year, I was talking to an umpires coach and they're

556
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:25,299
going to employ, for the season just gone, they employed, so 200 new coaches, as I understand,

557
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:31,480
sorry, umpires, as I understand it, they're teenage umpires into the SNFL system so we

558
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,859
could have two umpires at every junior game of footy.

559
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,700
And I said to the umpires coach, I said, well, that sounds good.

560
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:37,279
That's great.

561
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:38,980
I said, so what's, what's, what's the, what's the, what's the, what's the, what's the, what's

562
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,380
the problem?

563
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,220
He said, at the end of the year, we're going to have 200 umpires that leave the game.

564
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,279
And I said, why?

565
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:45,920
He said, because of abuse.

566
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,059
I was just like, hang on a minute.

567
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,119
Like this is, these are people's sons and daughters that are umpiring and apparently

568
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,819
it's fair game to abuse them.

569
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,940
And I said, so what are you doing about it?

570
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,700
And he said, we're trying to teach them resilience.

571
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,980
And Dash, you can see my face now.

572
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:03,900
Like I, we're trying to teach the kids resilience so they can umpire in the game that we love.

573
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,359
Surely we can be better.

574
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:08,420
And the people who manage that environment are the coaches.

575
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,519
We've got to get to the coaches to set the environment and the leagues need to support

576
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:15,140
that as well for us to make the change that we want to see.

577
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,779
But it's a, it's a massive problem and it's there in every sport.

578
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,099
Can I share with you, Rod, the first time I got involved in junior sport and I was a

579
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:27,839
reluctant participant because my dad, who played the game at the highest level, I said

580
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,559
that in the intro alongside you, I didn't realize what a great gift he gave me.

581
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,319
I grew up as a kid.

582
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:37,940
I wanted to play NFL football, but he never once overlaid any of his world or his experience

583
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,380
on me.

584
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:44,000
He just sat in the background, supported me unconditionally and was there without ever

585
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,359
making it feel like it was his ambition.

586
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,420
It was always mine.

587
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,859
And I didn't quite understand.

588
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,579
You'd call that conscious parenting now.

589
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:52,279
I don't think he even had an understanding of it.

590
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,839
It was just who he was, Rod.

591
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,960
It was this great gift.

592
00:24:55,339 --> 00:25:01,779
So intuitively when it came around to my own kids, I wanted to do the same and be in the

593
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:03,940
background without making it about me at all.

594
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,099
But before my eldest son, Sam, he was playing.

595
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:08,339
I think.

596
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:08,980
It was the under nines.

597
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:09,960
Might've been under tens.

598
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:13,700
Our coach got ill and had to have an operation.

599
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:16,019
And he rang me the day before the start of the season.

600
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:17,819
And he said, Hey, mate, I'm out.

601
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,279
Would you mind stepping up?

602
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:20,339
And what do you say?

603
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,259
It's like, yeah, of course I will.

604
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:30,039
Within that 24 hours of me taking on the under nine role, I got a series of phone calls from

605
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:30,500
other parents.

606
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:36,019
I didn't know, um, suggesting that I could leave one kid out of the team because he wasn't

607
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:37,299
good enough in the under nines.

608
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:38,299
And I remember talking to my wife.

609
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,980
I said, I can't believe what I'm hearing this.

610
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:46,539
And these were good people, but they were, Hey, we got to win the under nines and little

611
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:46,880
Billy.

612
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,980
I won't use his name.

613
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,200
Can't, can't catch, can't.

614
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:52,720
And so can't play, can't kick.

615
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:54,099
Hey, better result.

616
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:56,180
Now's our opportunity to get him out of the side.

617
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,440
And I made this pact with myself.

618
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,759
I said, I don't know this kid, but he's going to have the best year.

619
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:03,099
I promise you that he's ever had in his life.

620
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:05,660
And I made it my mission to just find out who he was.

621
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,079
He was a beautiful young kid.

622
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,359
And yeah, he struggled.

623
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:12,339
He struggled with the basic motor skills of sport, but we made a focus on he could

624
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:14,220
defend, he could tackle, he could spoil.

625
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:16,079
We taught him how to do all those things.

626
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:17,380
And you know what?

627
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,579
The boys loved him because he played a role that the other kids, you know, I went to his

628
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:24,819
mom and dad and said, Hey, it's probably appropriate that we probably just settle him down in one

629
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:26,180
position, played him in defense.

630
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,000
That group went on and actually won the grand final that year.

631
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,380
And in the grand final, he laid this tackle and I've never seen a group of kids more excited

632
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,880
in my entire life.

633
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,359
And it was genuine because they valued.

634
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,400
Him as a teammate.

635
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,299
Now, some of those kids played at a really high level at nine years of age.

636
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:48,039
Their year wasn't diminished at all by Billy coming along and having his moment as well.

637
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,539
And us supporting him in a great way.

638
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:53,380
And I remember speaking to his mom, uh, afterwards and she said, you know what?

639
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,140
He's actually happier at school.

640
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,920
He's got better friendship system.

641
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,480
Now I'm not, I don't deserve a medal for that.

642
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:03,099
I was doing what every basic human being should do, right?

643
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:08,359
Is look after all nine year olds, not the ones that were naturally a little bit gifted.

644
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,799
At eight or nine years of age.

645
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,140
And I was staggered at that moment.

646
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,740
I went, this is strange, you know, and I have only seen it get worse from then on.

647
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:19,460
And I think what you're talking about is educating parents.

648
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,079
They're good people around who wanted to get this kid out of the time.

649
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:26,119
We need to say to them, what if that's your son?

650
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,279
What if that's your daughter?

651
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:31,420
How do we have a conversation that, uh, includes everyone?

652
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,420
Because it's gotta be where it starts, doesn't it?

653
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:35,480
Absolutely.

654
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,019
And I have the shared experience that you did with my dad.

655
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:38,119
We're.

656
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:38,839
We're so lucky.

657
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:41,359
Like dad never pushed me or my brother at the time.

658
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,019
My sisters weren't playing footy, but me and my brother were footy and dad had a footy background.

659
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,339
He never pushed us at all.

660
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:52,099
And as I look back, I probably wish she had have in some ways, like I was only an average

661
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:56,059
player, but at the end of the day, he was just so supportive as was mum.

662
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:57,500
And it was quite amazing.

663
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,940
But what you speak of it and particularly down in those, uh, lower age groups, I think

664
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,519
there's a place as you get up to under thirteens and fourteens and these age groups, and we

665
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,059
are learning more about, you know, as you.

666
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:11,720
As you come to finals that the players do get left out and the better players do get

667
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,420
a game, but you don't lose sight of the players who aren't getting a game.

668
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,500
You wrap your arms around them.

669
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,319
The whole team wraps their arms around them.

670
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:22,640
And the same experience that I had with coaching, uh, at, at junior level.

671
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,819
So it was at school level.

672
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:28,640
And, uh, we coached in a team that we, you know, we, we didn't keep scores, but you played

673
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,599
a lightning premiership type thing, but you know, all the parents knew and all the kids

674
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,259
knew who had and hadn't kicked goals.

675
00:28:33,259 --> 00:28:37,640
And I did keep a tally of who kicked goals for the only reason that I wanted everyone

676
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,880
to be.

677
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,720
To be able to kick a goal.

678
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,359
And that experience that you're talking about with Billy laying a tackle.

679
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,259
We had that when we got to our last game, we had three kids who it's a school footy,

680
00:28:45,339 --> 00:28:47,039
you know, might play 10 games.

681
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,940
There were three kids who hadn't kicked a goal yet.

682
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,000
And we played them as our, as our forward three.

683
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,359
And ultimately they all got a goal in that game.

684
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:55,279
And just to see the joy on their faces.

685
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,559
And as you said, I'm sure they go back to school and think how amazing is this and the

686
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,480
parents as well.

687
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,700
So we're taking the parents along for the journey.

688
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,319
So again, but you were the coach at the time.

689
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:07,460
I was the coach at the time we have the biggest impact, but some

690
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,500
coaches don't have the background that we have.

691
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:13,299
So we need to be able to put them in the environment and show them how good this can be.

692
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:18,240
And when we do, and that they're enlightened, you can just see the enthusiasm in, in the

693
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,119
parents or the coaches.

694
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
Well, I can do it like this.

695
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,819
Cause at the moment, Das, it's like the last parent standing who's going to be coached.

696
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:27,200
Cause we're worried about what's it going to be like with the kids.

697
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,000
What's it going to be like with their parents?

698
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,960
You know, this is a hard gig, but if it's not all about winning, if it's not all about,

699
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,160
uh, you know, developing skills and all that.

700
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,279
But it's a big thing.

701
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:37,420
It's a big thing.

702
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:37,440
It's a big thing.

703
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,680
And if it's about developing values, lots of other people can coach and we can get in

704
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,819
there and teach really good values to people that they learned through sport, which again,

705
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:46,799
we'll talk about later.

706
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,420
Let me play one more grab, uh, for you, right.

707
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,640
And I, you know, I get sent this stuff all the time because people have been around me,

708
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,720
know how passionate I am about the role that we get to play.

709
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:00,640
When you're a junior coach, you can change someone's life for the good and regardless

710
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,599
of ability.

711
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:06,440
And this was sent to me, Gary Neville was an English soccer legend, um, you know, scored

712
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,279
dozens of goals.

713
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,839
Goals at the highest level for England.

714
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,039
He's got four boys.

715
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,859
He's on a podcast in the UK.

716
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,059
So this is a global issue.

717
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,259
Uh, he uses pretty direct language around what he's seen with his four boys and parenting

718
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:17,660
behavior.

719
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,400
This is Gary Neville, a legend of English soccer.

720
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:21,440
I've got four boys.

721
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:24,779
I've watched them all play football all through.

722
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,220
Just let them play.

723
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,799
I'm standing on the sidelines.

724
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,700
I'm listening to parents shouting and bawling.

725
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,480
Get rid of it.

726
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,859
Don't mess about it there.

727
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,720
And 99.9% of what I say.

728
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:37,940
Is wrong.

729
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:42,240
99.9% of what they say is damaging their children.

730
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,940
It's instilling fear into them.

731
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,539
Just shut up.

732
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:45,799
Yeah.

733
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:47,460
Shut up and let them play.

734
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:53,519
I remember one distinct thing, um, where a parent, Watson's pick, picked his child up

735
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,680
by the scruff of the neck and said, if you play like that, you're never going to make

736
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,220
the grade.

737
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,400
And I thought, mate, I've just watched him play.

738
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,559
He ain't going to make the grade anyway.

739
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:01,859
So just chill.

740
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:02,460
Yeah.

741
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:02,660
Yeah.

742
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,279
Let him enjoy his football.

743
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,259
The truth is they'll reach the level that they'll reach.

744
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:12,380
And with that pressure though, they're less likely to make it because much less likely,

745
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,579
even if they had an, even if they had an inkling of a possibility of making it, they are decreasing

746
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:18,380
those chances.

747
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,740
So you hear him talk about, he's pretty blunt, isn't it?

748
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:26,359
The, the one kid that maybe he's going to be the one in 15,000 that does play professional

749
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:34,140
sport, the dad that's over coaching him and actually not helping and everyone else who's

750
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,900
screaming out from the sidelines.

751
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,240
None of that is possible.

752
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:42,039
And I, and I see that all the time, Rob, where you're trying to coach in a positive way.

753
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:46,500
And there's always three dads that are grabbing their kids or a mom that's sort of trying

754
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,720
to coach them on the side.

755
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,039
And I just look at the, uh, the sadness that overflows into those kids.

756
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:56,599
I, I referenced this all the time as a story in a study done in the U S called the conversation

757
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:57,319
in the car.

758
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,960
And I used to share it with all the parents that whose kids I was coaching and a guy did

759
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,799
a study in the U S around at 13 years of age, the drop off in kids playing sport in America

760
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,240
is really, really low.

761
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:07,799
It's ridiculous.

762
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,400
Like 75% or thereabouts kids stop playing sport.

763
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,779
His thesis is all kids love it regardless of ability.

764
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:16,660
And you know what?

765
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,480
They don't actually care that much about winning a little, win a 12 year old grand final.

766
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,500
It's a good moment, but it lasts for five minutes and they lose one.

767
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:25,200
They go and grab a hot dog and they're happy.

768
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:31,099
But he says they get in the car and little Billy sits in the car and mom or dad turns

769
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:33,519
around and says, why didn't you play more like Rod Maynard?

770
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:37,240
Why didn't you play more like, Hey, you could have gone a little bit harder there.

771
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:41,500
And immediately it just takes the fun out of sport.

772
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,940
Parents sap the enjoyment out of it straight away.

773
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:50,220
And his study is saying, Hey, all you need to say to the kids, only thing you need to

774
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,680
stay is I love watching you play.

775
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,960
And that's all I've ever said to my four.

776
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:55,920
Nothing else.

777
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,500
It's just how I love watching you play.

778
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:00,940
And at the end of the day, it's not that complicated, is it?

779
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:02,740
No, I agree a hundred percent.

780
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:04,180
And those words are amazing.

781
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,519
I love watching you play.

782
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,240
And the same with coaches.

783
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,960
It's the same thing, same message.

784
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:12,680
We should be saying that we love coaching you, you know, at the end of training, at

785
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:17,279
the start of training, you know, bringing these positive, uh, or bringing the positive

786
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,220
messaging, uh, to our coaching.

787
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:24,980
And it's not the time or place straight after a game to be talking to your kids about where

788
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,299
they need to improve, right?

789
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:27,339
Cause they've just finished the game.

790
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,900
They may not be feeling great about it.

791
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:32,380
They may have lost the game, even though we don't keep scores.

792
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,299
That's for another time and place.

793
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:35,960
At that time, it's just being supportive.

794
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:36,920
Come in the car.

795
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:37,160
Mate.

796
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,240
You did some great things.

797
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,579
So to your daughter, though, you just played so well today.

798
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:43,059
I love the way that you ran and the way that you got involved.

799
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:48,259
And all of a sudden that, uh, you know, there might be a little bit downhearted, heartened

800
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:51,000
at the time, but you're lifting up their spirits and like, yeah.

801
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:53,380
And you, and you talk about some things that they did really well.

802
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,420
And all of a sudden they feel good about their sport.

803
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,039
I mean, at the moment, and you've got young kids as I do, the amount of time that they

804
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:03,720
spend on their devices, you know, we want to get them out playing sport.

805
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,140
It's a, it's a healthy, uh, recreation to do.

806
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,079
And, and the opposite to that, if they're giving it away at 13 and 14, I've seen the

807
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:14,619
same studies that you speak of is they're probably going to get stuck on devices and

808
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:17,980
it's not going to help them lead a healthy lifestyle going forward, but it's not just

809
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,260
the health side of it.

810
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,119
It's the great values that we can learn through sport if we teach them.

811
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,360
And again, it becomes the responsibility of the, of the governing body of the club, but

812
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,820
most importantly, the coach and that we're all on the same page in the messages that

813
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,400
we're delivering.

814
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,000
And so I say it once again, right?

815
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:36,840
Cause I know the counter argument to this is I, he's Rod Campbell looked down, they're

816
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,139
sitting there.

817
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,019
And they're holier than now and they're taking the model higher ground.

818
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:45,039
And yeah, I brilliant, you know, it's past the parcel now at, uh, at the kids party and

819
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,320
everyone gets to win a prize.

820
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,760
It's not that I'm as competitive as anyone.

821
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,239
And I love seeing kids compete really hard and they should, so long as you do it with

822
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,579
a value set, that's fair.

823
00:34:55,699 --> 00:35:01,300
I see friends of mine and people I see in our community who are used to going hard in

824
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,280
their business life.

825
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,960
They take that to junior sport and it's about list managing an under 19.

826
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:13,300
They're trying to curate every kid from the local area to win by 30 goals and tag two

827
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:13,900
players.

828
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,559
And it's like, guys, that's not the place for that age.

829
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,639
You know, we can still compete really well, but what that's not sport, there's gotta be

830
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:27,019
an element of education around a responsibility of the opposition and making sure that it's

831
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:28,480
a good day for them.

832
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,940
And I want to move now to the solution because that's where I have crossed over with you.

833
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:38,760
And I think the only way punishment and legislation, as you proved in the road safety space has

834
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,179
got a place and we need it, but I feel sorry for the leagues.

835
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:44,719
They have to put bands in place in our league.

836
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:48,619
Now you're not allowed to walk out to the huddle at quarter time and halftime.

837
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:51,119
I totally understand why they have done that.

838
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,559
It's to try and keep the crazy parents away from saying insane things to the players and

839
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:56,940
the umpire.

840
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:02,119
So I totally get it, but what a sad thing, the beautiful thing, if you have a coach spreading

841
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:02,800
a great message.

842
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,980
To be able to share that we've lost that now we've lost the ability for that family

843
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,599
environment.

844
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,199
So education, and this is what I love about your program, learning life through sport.

845
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:16,039
It's designed for challenge, the social norms that have become acceptable, abusing umpires

846
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:16,800
at junior footy.

847
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:20,900
It's about creating a new standard of respect at junior sport.

848
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,679
I could not be more supportive of what you're doing.

849
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:28,840
Can you just explain to people what you're planning, what you're doing in South Australia,

850
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,780
because the South Australian Football League have been bolding you to share this message.

851
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,780
How does it work?

852
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,780
Yeah.

853
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:40,679
So the SNFL juniors, our first client, so that they run with learning life through sport.

854
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:45,820
So how it's done is you show the leaders of the league, this program that we think can

855
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,820
help in the area.

856
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,739
So everyone's working hard in the area and we acknowledge that and doing the best that

857
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:51,739
they can.

858
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:55,059
And as we spoke about, Luke, enforcement is often the way that we're trying to teach.

859
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:59,579
But when you go, and I've gone and spoken to several leagues here in Victoria and around

860
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:02,579
Australia, and you'll talk to the people who are full-time employees of the leagues.

861
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:06,139
And they'll talk about the first three days of their week being spent.

862
00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:09,820
There might be only one full-time employee putting out spot fires from the weekend before.

863
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,679
And these are behavioural issues that they've got to manage.

864
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:16,559
How good would it be if they could spend their whole week just developing the program, developing

865
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:18,280
the league, developing footy.

866
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,000
So putting something in place, it needs to be a united approach.

867
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,639
So learning life through sport is not a club by club initiative.

868
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,960
It's something a whole league has to take on board.

869
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,139
It's a little bit, and I learned this through the RAP, the Road Safety Education Program

870
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:32,139
that I was in.

871
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:36,340
We expanded our program to, say, 20% of year 11s across South Australia.

872
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:41,360
We're not going to see a change in the road toll, okay, but we expanded our program to

873
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,460
get to about 90% of year 11 students.

874
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,599
And we saw a massive change that coincided in fatalities and in serious injuries.

875
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,199
So learning life through sport is the same.

876
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:53,199
It's the same principle.

877
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,500
Let's get to a league.

878
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,059
Let's get everyone on the same page.

879
00:37:56,059 --> 00:37:58,199
And there are three principles that go with it.

880
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:01,579
They are sportsmanship, respect, and try your hardest.

881
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:02,579
The three.

882
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:11,079
So sportsmanship is pretty obvious, the way that we behave, you know, shaking hands before

883
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:12,820
the game, shaking hands after the game.

884
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:17,300
I learned listening to, and it might have been on one of your podcasts, Luke, a soccer

885
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,619
coach that spoke about, at senior level, how when all of his players come to training,

886
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,440
they have to come and shake his hand and greet him.

887
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:27,659
So I've done that for the last four years with the junior clubs, junior team that I've

888
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:30,760
coached at Morfordville Park, so the Morphy Roos in South Australia.

889
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:32,460
So my kids come to training.

890
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,300
And it's beautiful, mate.

891
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,960
They'll come up to you.

892
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,840
And my nickname's Rocket.

893
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,960
And they'll go, hey, Rocket.

894
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,699
And they'll shake your hand.

895
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:37,699
And they have to look you in the eye.

896
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:39,179
So it's a young person looking you in the eye.

897
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:43,019
So they're learning to be confident and look the coach in the eye and talk to an adult.

898
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:43,800
You know?

899
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,460
And one of my side things that I've done in the past, I've been a host family for Port

900
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,699
Adelaide young footballers.

901
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:52,400
And I had one of the players there one night called Josh Sinn.

902
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,679
He's going to be a ripping player.

903
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:55,079
But he came out to training one night.

904
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:58,239
So he can just come out and watch and maybe just speak to the kids because they're excited

905
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:02,199
that, you know, that Rocket's got a Port Adelaide player living at his house.

906
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:05,019
And his son, who's Cruz, you know, has a player living at his house.

907
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,079
And so when the players would come in and shake my hand and greet me at the start of

908
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,760
training, I said, look, Josh Sinn's out there.

909
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:11,500
He's dressed in the Port Adelaide kit.

910
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,420
Can you go out and shake his hand and thank him for coming?

911
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:15,699
And I actually videoed it.

912
00:39:15,699 --> 00:39:17,519
It's one of the most beautiful things you could see.

913
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,860
A young 13-year-old kid called Axel who goes out, looks Josh in the eye and says, hey,

914
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,360
Josh, thanks for coming, mate.

915
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,199
And then I look at Josh and I see the reaction.

916
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,260
Like this is understanding how sport can teach great values.

917
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,539
Just one example of it.

918
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:32,199
So we go sportsmanship.

919
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:34,139
That's an example of sportsmanship.

920
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:39,159
Respect for me in the program is I just go to respect for umpires and just want to teach

921
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:41,239
one thing, just one reaction to a free kick.

922
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,119
If you get a free kick against you, zip your mouth and put your hands up on the mark.

923
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,519
That's what coaches should be teaching their players.

924
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:51,340
Then the coach can't react to a free kick ever again.

925
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,739
Just don't react.

926
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:55,360
Just watch the reaction of your kid that you can coach.

927
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,440
That's what good coaches do.

928
00:39:56,539 --> 00:39:57,119
They coach.

929
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,760
So now we're taking the heat out of the decision.

930
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:01,579
So we're learning life through sport.

931
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:06,119
These three values, once a team takes them on board, so a club takes them on board,

932
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,139
each team that's coached within the club, so you might have 10 junior teams,

933
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:13,300
each of the coaches will watch the presentation with their cohorts.

934
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,300
So people are coaching the same age group.

935
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,280
So they get to know each other.

936
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,980
So they're starting to build those relationships with the opposition coach, albeit.

937
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:20,460
Yep.

938
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,079
And then they'll be connecting with the opposition players.

939
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,360
So we're building these relationships to change culture.

940
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:31,199
Then ultimately, when we go out and deliver these messages and we're teaching the same message,

941
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:34,119
so you'll go back to your club once you adopt these principles.

942
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,260
And when you go back on your first night at training, you'll talk to your players about,

943
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,519
these are the three values, sportsmanship, respect, try your hardest, go straight to respect.

944
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,559
No arguing with umpires decisions.

945
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:44,739
So guys, do you understand?

946
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,019
Your players, boys or girls, you understand that's how we're going to coach.

947
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,360
The SNFL decrees that, that's how I'm going to coach.

948
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,800
And the kids agree to it.

949
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,360
Then you look over to the parent group because you have them all in on the same night.

950
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,400
And I'm starting to build my relationship now with the parents.

951
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,320
I say to the parents, this is the new paradigm we're coaching under.

952
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
These are the three values.

953
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:00,699
And in relation to respect,

954
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:03,860
your children will no longer be able to argue an umpire's decision.

955
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,760
We'll teach it at training.

956
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,619
We'll teach the reaction.

957
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And I will never argue an umpire's decision as a coach.

958
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,800
Can you guys support me?

959
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,119
I'm talking to the parent group now.

960
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:13,579
Can you support me in doing this?

961
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,860
Well, the parents look over at their kids that they love.

962
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,360
And they're looking over at me, the coach that they, I hopefully they'll respect,

963
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,099
that's trying to bring good values to the game.

964
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,219
Well, they're not going to say no in front of their kids.

965
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:26,360
So they make a commitment to their children who they love.

966
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,619
They make a commitment to the coach who hopefully they respect.

967
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:30,579
They're also making a commitment with their,

968
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:35,079
cohort of parents that they're not going to say a word about umpire's decisions.

969
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,059
So now we're all on the same page.

970
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,460
So the coach who, that's his job to coach,

971
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,059
he's actually coaching the whole team.

972
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:43,280
He's coaching the kids and he's coaching the parents.

973
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,659
And this is just one area of it.

974
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,539
But I can tell you in four years of coaching this same team,

975
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,420
we have an unbelievable relationship with the players and the parents.

976
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,039
But my parents, they police that.

977
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:55,380
I don't police their behavior.

978
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,880
They know that's what we're about.

979
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,139
They want to be honest to their kids.

980
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,679
And they want to be honest.

981
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:01,420
They want to be honest to the coach.

982
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:02,840
So they're all supporting it.

983
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,480
So we don't have issues from our parents.

984
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:05,579
Honestly, we don't mate.

985
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,840
And this can be taught.

986
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,480
It's a taught behavior and we need to take that responsibility.

987
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,059
Yeah.

988
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:11,219
And I'm listening to you, right?

989
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,780
And I feel like I need to take responsibility as well.

990
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:19,000
I look back at myself as a professional football for 14 years playing in the AFL.

991
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:22,119
And some of my reactions to umpires was disgraceful.

992
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,500
You know, I look back and some of the things I said to umpires,

993
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:27,579
you know, it was really, really poor.

994
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,960
And, you know, I look and it's embarrassing.

995
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,920
When you think about it, it was the nature of the environment at the time.

996
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,599
So I'm not making any excuses for it.

997
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,880
But you look at a game like Rugby Union,

998
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:44,079
the respect for the umpires at that code is absolutely top of the tree.

999
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,840
Like the captains get called in.

1000
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:49,019
They get immediately told around.

1001
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,320
If there's any sign of disrespect, the game stops.

1002
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,400
And umpires in that code umpire into their 60s

1003
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,880
and they are held at the highest systems.

1004
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:57,800
It's not as though it's not possible.

1005
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,940
We're never going to change it at the,

1006
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,840
at the elite level and we're trying to get behavior change there through

1007
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,619
legislation and free kicks, which, you know, in, uh,

1008
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:08,360
in the code that we're both passionate about has had some effect.

1009
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,420
But I think you're right.

1010
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,039
It's got to start at the grassroots level with what you're saying and,

1011
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:15,360
and, and, and you can make an impact immediately.

1012
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,119
These aren't hard things to do,

1013
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:19,980
but they're going to take a cultural paradigm shift.

1014
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,679
And I think you're, you're on the point.

1015
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,400
Yeah.

1016
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,500
And we're just explaining in Rugby League or Rugby Union that,

1017
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,780
that respect that's there.

1018
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,239
So that's their inherited respect.

1019
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,179
Unfortunately,

1020
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:32,579
we go the other way in, in AFL or in Australian rules footy.

1021
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:34,340
We don't have that inherited respect,

1022
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,760
but it doesn't mean it can't change.

1023
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,559
And what I do know is that rapid impactful change in culture can happen really

1024
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:40,920
quickly.

1025
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,760
And we saw it virtually happen overnight in road safety education,

1026
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,679
just by getting the message out there and empowering people.

1027
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,280
So if we can get the message out to, to groups of people,

1028
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,619
so a whole league, all the coaches were all on the same page.

1029
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:57,460
It's about meeting the coach, opposition coach before the game,

1030
00:43:57,579 --> 00:43:59,139
shaking their hand, wishing them all the best.

1031
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:02,139
And I'll say, and we're about sportsmanship and respect and, you know,

1032
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:03,219
you won't get any issues out of us.

1033
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,800
We'll play good, fair footy within the rules.

1034
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,800
We'll be fierce competitors.

1035
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,719
I'm like you and yeah, we'll be playing to win.

1036
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,659
It's not as though we're not trying to win,

1037
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:12,159
but we're doing it with great values.

1038
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:16,139
And when we lose, what a great opportunity to learn about life, Luke,

1039
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:17,960
like in life you lose, right?

1040
00:44:18,019 --> 00:44:19,559
And it's how we handle adversity.

1041
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:20,619
That's really important.

1042
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,719
So what I do know and being a firefighter, so we, sadly, you know,

1043
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:26,920
we go to suicides.

1044
00:44:27,019 --> 00:44:27,380
Okay.

1045
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,699
And I know that youth suicides,

1046
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,820
the biggest killer of young people in Australia,

1047
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,840
imagine going and witnessing suicides as an example, you know,

1048
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:40,699
and we can set our kids up for falls by having these massive expectations of

1049
00:44:40,699 --> 00:44:42,400
them in their sport or in life.

1050
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:43,699
If our expectation is,

1051
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,059
and this is a teaching and learning life through sport.

1052
00:44:46,139 --> 00:44:47,579
One of the values is try your hardest.

1053
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,820
If our expectation is for people to try hard.

1054
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:55,340
So there's no emphasis on winning or on outcomes, but just try hard.

1055
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,300
We can teach them an amazing value.

1056
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,679
And my biggest lesson in life,

1057
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:01,639
is teach your kids with five kids, teach them to try hard.

1058
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:03,460
They'll end up being the best version of themselves.

1059
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,440
And they don't need to be AFL footballers.

1060
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,059
They don't need to be doctors or lawyers, but if they learn to try hard,

1061
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:11,139
they will give genuine effort.

1062
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,559
They'll probably give honest effort all the time.

1063
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:18,500
Now, if you're trying to employ someone in your elite space or in any of your

1064
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,079
workspaces, I know you used to have pubs.

1065
00:45:20,139 --> 00:45:22,739
You would want to employ someone who tries hard, Luke, I'm sure.

1066
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:24,460
And that's not a skillset.

1067
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:25,599
That's a value set.

1068
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:28,099
So if you, if we teach the right values through sport,

1069
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:28,320
they can be a part of our life.

1070
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:32,199
You can be employable in any area, you know, but I'd like to share,

1071
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,199
if I can, the story behind trying your hardest.

1072
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,179
So I was coaching a school football team, year threes and fours.

1073
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:44,019
We played our first four games and I had a couple of players and not trying

1074
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:46,900
to name drop it, Braden Maynard and John Noble played in that team.

1075
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:47,699
We couldn't win a game.

1076
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,980
Braden's your nephew, by the way, the vice captain of Collingwood Football

1077
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,320
Club and All Australian and lives the values that you're talking.

1078
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:55,880
Yeah, he epitomized the value.

1079
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,039
So this is year three or four.

1080
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:58,059
So Braden's in the team.

1081
00:45:58,159 --> 00:45:58,599
My son is.

1082
00:45:58,699 --> 00:45:59,179
John Noble.

1083
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,780
They're playing this team.

1084
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,539
They're all bottom age.

1085
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:04,679
We're getting, getting, you know, belted each week, but no one keeps scores,

1086
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,599
but the kids know, right?

1087
00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:06,900
And I'll watch the kids come off the ground.

1088
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,840
And as they come off the ground, I would see every parent go up to those

1089
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,679
kids and they were, it was a boy's team, put their hand on their shoulder

1090
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:15,619
and say, bad luck, mate, bad luck, bad luck, mate, bad luck.

1091
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:17,960
I'm thinking this has nothing to do with bad luck.

1092
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,619
We're not good enough, but it's okay.

1093
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,480
We can lose and still learn some good life values.

1094
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:23,719
So I thought, how can we get this right?

1095
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,719
Because I don't want to see the kids.

1096
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:25,619
We're not scoring.

1097
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:27,480
They come off the ground with their bottom lip on the ground.

1098
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:28,579
The parents then tell them.

1099
00:46:28,579 --> 00:46:29,679
It's all because of bad luck.

1100
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,079
So I said to the parents this week, I said to the players before the game,

1101
00:46:33,139 --> 00:46:35,760
to the assistant coach, just say to the boys, we're just going to rate them

1102
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,840
today on how hard they try.

1103
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,760
If they try their hardest, that's a win for us.

1104
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:40,059
I got the parents into a group.

1105
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:41,119
I said, look, I'm no psychologist.

1106
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,079
And please, respectfully, what I'm seeing is you're going up your kid

1107
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:44,960
and saying bad luck.

1108
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:46,920
They think it's because of bad luck that they lose.

1109
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,340
They think footy brings bad luck.

1110
00:46:48,659 --> 00:46:50,820
Maybe they won't play footy again, the game that we love.

1111
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,179
How about you just take some license and from now on just say, well done.

1112
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:56,059
You tried your hardest.

1113
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:57,000
So imagine this, Luke.

1114
00:46:57,059 --> 00:46:58,539
Your son comes off the ground with his bottom lip.

1115
00:46:58,579 --> 00:47:00,820
He's on the ground and thinks his parents are going to tell him bad luck,

1116
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,880
bad luck, because footy's bad luck has struck again.

1117
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,500
But this time he gets a pat on the back.

1118
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:05,280
He says, well done, mate.

1119
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,000
You tried your hardest.

1120
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,500
Well, hang on a minute.

1121
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:11,380
So if I try hard, this is your 3-4 kid, I get a pat on the back.

1122
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,619
So I'm encouraged now to try hard.

1123
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,320
And then when you walk to the car, so there's no bad luck.

1124
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,639
We take that out of our vocabulary.

1125
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:18,920
It's got nothing to do with bad luck.

1126
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:23,320
Then when we go to the car and sit in the car, all of a sudden the kid's there

1127
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,380
and he's feeling pretty happy.

1128
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,519
And you just encourage and say, mate, you tried so hard.

1129
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:27,360
That was so good.

1130
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:28,260
Oh, wow.

1131
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:29,820
So now we're rewarding.

1132
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:30,239
I love watching you play.

1133
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:32,099
I love to watch you play, yeah.

1134
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:33,820
And that's all kids need.

1135
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,519
They don't need any more than that.

1136
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,000
I'm here for you regardless.

1137
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:39,239
Am I going to love you less if you won?

1138
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,900
Am I going to love you more if you become a professional athlete?

1139
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:46,300
And I think for parents to listen, you can change the whole relationship

1140
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,800
with your kids right now.

1141
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:52,519
There's this whole Tiger Woods mentality that unfortunately has ruined it,

1142
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:57,239
that people think getting 10,000 hours of a golf club into the hand

1143
00:47:57,239 --> 00:47:58,559
of a two-year-old is good parenting.

1144
00:47:58,579 --> 00:48:00,500
And it's just not.

1145
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:03,119
It comes with a whole range of different issues.

1146
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,980
And that story played out for what it did because there's this mentality,

1147
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,179
I'm going to live my life through my kids' success.

1148
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:12,780
And if they are successful, I'm going to feel good

1149
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:13,500
and they're going to feel good.

1150
00:48:13,659 --> 00:48:15,199
Reality is, what does that mean?

1151
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:20,679
Like, what does that mean for the 99% of kids that just want to enjoy their sport

1152
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:21,639
and enjoy their life?

1153
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:22,940
And I see that so often.

1154
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,400
I get really sad to see parents who are overlaying their world of what they may

1155
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,460
or may not have achieved.

1156
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:31,980
through the eyes of their kids and even start from there.

1157
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:34,079
Just start from there around what Rod's just saying.

1158
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:36,179
Did you try your hardest?

1159
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,300
I love watching you play.

1160
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,980
You can change your relationship with your kid there.

1161
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:42,260
And if our coaches take on board what you're saying as well, Rod,

1162
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,460
we've got a game changer on our hands.

1163
00:48:44,539 --> 00:48:46,019
And I appreciate you sharing it.

1164
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:48,760
You know my passion for it is real.

1165
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,239
People listening, I hope, understand we're coming from a good place with this.

1166
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,519
This paradigm needs to shift.

1167
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,780
Check out Learning Life Through Sport.

1168
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:57,940
We're in your corner, mate.

1169
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,480
We're in your corner.

1170
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,280
We need to get you out there.

1171
00:48:59,619 --> 00:49:00,099
We need to spread.

1172
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,980
And to me, you know, when you have got a problem with a coach,

1173
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,980
I've seen this against coaches I've before.

1174
00:49:06,099 --> 00:49:07,539
They need more education, not more.

1175
00:49:07,659 --> 00:49:10,400
We should spend people all the time in junior footy.

1176
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,159
12-week bands are a common place now in our league.

1177
00:49:13,699 --> 00:49:14,780
All those people are good people.

1178
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,340
They actually mean well.

1179
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:17,960
They think they're doing the right thing.

1180
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,360
They need to be educated on a different way.

1181
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,659
And this is the only way.

1182
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,059
So thanks for sharing.

1183
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:26,320
I know you've tuned into the podcast before.

1184
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,159
And I love the idea of success.

1185
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:32,260
Leaving clues and the idea of leadership showing up in different ways.

1186
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,719
You've lived your life, mate, in an amazing way.

1187
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:38,880
And I chose the words at the start around selflessness and you impacting others.

1188
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:39,920
That's been your life, mate.

1189
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:41,719
You should feel really proud of it.

1190
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,980
So self-leadership is, you know, a big thing we talk about a lot in our world of a leader.

1191
00:49:47,059 --> 00:49:47,719
What does that mean to you?

1192
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,739
Self-leadership for me starts with selflessness.

1193
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,719
So I think that's the superpower we can all have.

1194
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,059
So think about others before ourselves.

1195
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,260
And I think that comes with...

1196
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:01,260
Humility, obviously, and being true to yourself.

1197
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,059
So you need to have a...

1198
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:04,880
So self-leadership for me is being consistent with how you behave.

1199
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,260
So you need to have a set of values that you stand for, but they're consistent in every walk of your life.

1200
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:16,099
So you can't just turn them on for footy and say, this is how I behave in football, but I don't behave that in my life in general.

1201
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:17,980
So I think that consistency of behavior.

1202
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:22,280
And one of the things for me is that the standard you walk past is the standard you accept.

1203
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:26,059
So I'm really big on that, like not accepting poor standards.

1204
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:27,940
So if I'm going to be a leader and I know that I'm going to be a leader, I'm going to be a leader.

1205
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,679
And I need to have self-leadership.

1206
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,039
I need to make sure that I don't walk past those things.

1207
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:35,900
And another saying that I really like is to make someone else's day better.

1208
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,940
So for self-leadership for me, I want to look for those opportunities to make someone else's day better.

1209
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,400
And it might be as simple as going away with a mate and, you know, we'll make a...

1210
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,079
You know, we'll arrive in Melbourne and come for a footy weekend and we'll jump on the Skybus to come in.

1211
00:50:48,139 --> 00:50:51,619
But, you know, we'll be looking for opportunities, whatever it might be, just to help someone.

1212
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:55,300
It might be to help someone get their case off the Skybus or whatever it is.

1213
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,880
Just look for some opportunities to make someone else's day better.

1214
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:03,659
So that self-leadership is just that consistency of behaviour and looking to help others in a selfless way.

1215
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,840
And I love the language that you use, Rod, and you live it every day and it comes across, mate,

1216
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:13,699
and everyone who's interacted with you and you probably flow really well into that positive impact on others.

1217
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,460
And, you know, I love what you're saying there, isn't it?

1218
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:19,360
There's a chance just to make someone's day that little bit better.

1219
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,539
Even when you're going away on a boys' weekend, you can find a way.

1220
00:51:24,099 --> 00:51:25,659
That's an example you shared before.

1221
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,820
It's obviously something you're conscious about impacting others.

1222
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,420
Yeah, absolutely.

1223
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:34,500
I think, you know, to be a positive person, and I see that in you, Luke, it's really important.

1224
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:37,719
And I'm lucky that I was brought up by positive parents.

1225
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,440
So I've had that positivity in me.

1226
00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:44,440
But I think you get the opportunity, and we're talking about coaching, to bring that energy to the room.

1227
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:47,920
So you can choose to bring negative energy or you can choose to bring positive energy.

1228
00:51:48,219 --> 00:51:52,400
So I really think that bringing that positive energy is really good.

1229
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:56,579
And that get to instead of got to, I'm sure you've heard it before and it's a Ben Crowism,

1230
00:51:56,619 --> 00:51:57,559
that, you know, you get to.

1231
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:00,599
So a quick example, you know, I drive my kids to school.

1232
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,599
So I can either say I've got to drive the kids to school.

1233
00:52:03,739 --> 00:52:07,880
And as soon as I say got, you know, I'm looking for a lawn and my mouth is changing.

1234
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,960
It's like I'm upset.

1235
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:11,219
Or I can say to you, Luke, as you look at me, I get to.

1236
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,659
When I say get, I smile.

1237
00:52:13,139 --> 00:52:17,139
And when I think about taking my kids to school or picking them up, it's the best opportunity I have.

1238
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:18,099
They're not on their devices.

1239
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:23,519
You know, I build my relationships with my two youngest kids a lot of the time just driving them to and from school.

1240
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,619
So it's that get to, so that positivity.

1241
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,539
But I also like this.

1242
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:31,739
This one, Luke, that people won't care how much you know until they know how much you care.

1243
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,840
So you need to show that care.

1244
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,880
So in leadership, I reckon that's the best saying that you could go with.

1245
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,179
The saying was from Teddy Roosevelt in 1901 to 1909.

1246
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,019
He was a U.S. president where he espoused that.

1247
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,280
And somewhere along the way, we've lost contact with that.

1248
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,199
We've become selfish.

1249
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,800
We've become, you know, all about ourselves instead of being about others.

1250
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,420
And he had it right 110 years ago.

1251
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:57,280
But we need to get back to that and leadership.

1252
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:03,340
But A is about showing how much you care to others so that, you know, you can positively impact them.

1253
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,280
And I think that relationship building, leaving things better than you found it,

1254
00:53:07,579 --> 00:53:13,000
but our opportunity to inspire, to motivate, and to empower, that's what we've got.

1255
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:14,079
And we've all got it in us.

1256
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:18,340
But it just takes that flicking of the switch to be able to do it.

1257
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,079
It's really important.

1258
00:53:19,179 --> 00:53:22,440
Coming back to junior sporting for a moment, we're all emotive around our kids.

1259
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,159
I get emotional watching them play and you want them to do well.

1260
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,440
So I'm not saying you can't.

1261
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:43,579
I'm not saying you can't feel that, but the idea that for them to have a good time, it's ultimately they have to win every single moment and at someone else's expense and you're not looking out for someone else, you can do both, you know, as an opportunity to have some care and empathy for everyone at that event.

1262
00:53:43,579 --> 00:53:55,860
I liken it to going to a kid's party and half of the 12-year-olds on one side beating up on the other 12 with parents on the sidelines yelling and thinking, you call human services and you say something's wrong.

1263
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:57,539
But, you know, it's wonderful.

1264
00:53:57,539 --> 00:54:00,699
But what happens every single weekend at a range of different sports?

1265
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:06,139
And I think you bring your attitude to life as you're talking about, you're a chance to change the paradigm.

1266
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:07,639
Look, I remember one example.

1267
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,099
I was coaching basketball with my son.

1268
00:54:10,199 --> 00:54:11,239
It's about three or four years ago.

1269
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,619
So he would have been eight or nine.

1270
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:14,420
And I am the worst basketball coach.

1271
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,980
I don't know anything about basketball.

1272
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,460
I'd like to think I know a little bit about leadership and about sportsmanship.

1273
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:25,840
But we played against a team that I knew because one of my cousin's children were playing in the team.

1274
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,420
And I knew that they hadn't won a game at all.

1275
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,300
Sorry, they hadn't scored in a game.

1276
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,780
And we were leading them pretty well.

1277
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:34,539
So I said to the players, look, let's just let them score.

1278
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,840
And the face on some of the kids, because it was only the second or third game that I'd coached them, let them score.

1279
00:54:40,219 --> 00:54:41,460
Because they hadn't been brought up to it.

1280
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:42,659
I said, yeah, let them score.

1281
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:44,539
Let them take the ball down and let them shoot.

1282
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,219
And then let them get the rebound until they actually shoot a goal.

1283
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,960
At the end of the game, they ended up scoring their first time they'd scored for the year in three or four games.

1284
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,639
And I just remember the delight on the kids' faces.

1285
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:56,420
And on the parents' faces.

1286
00:54:56,539 --> 00:54:59,199
And I said to our players who were young, I said, this is empathy.

1287
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,619
This is caring about others.

1288
00:55:01,019 --> 00:55:02,519
This is not about sheep stations.

1289
00:55:02,519 --> 00:55:05,099
It's about them coming back and wanting to play basketball the next week.

1290
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:06,460
So what you say is exactly right.

1291
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:09,500
But once again, it's the coach who can change that paradigm.

1292
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:10,900
He can control the environment.

1293
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:11,719
You've got a vision.

1294
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:16,440
And we talk about leaders having the capacity to create and share a vision.

1295
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:21,539
And I love your passion for this paradigm shift in junior sport around the country.

1296
00:55:21,539 --> 00:55:23,539
How are you going about sharing it?

1297
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:24,539
And maybe.

1298
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:25,219
Making it happen.

1299
00:55:25,579 --> 00:55:27,219
Yeah, I think obviously I believe in it.

1300
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:31,820
So the first thing with, you know, creating and sharing a vision is believing in what you're doing.

1301
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:33,559
But you need to share it authentically.

1302
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:35,079
So in your own style.

1303
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:35,860
So we're all different.

1304
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,119
We can have the same values.

1305
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,340
But you make sure that you stay with your authenticity.

1306
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:43,780
And you need to share it with passion and enthusiasm.

1307
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:47,980
You know, like some people will listen to people talk and think, well, you're a good talker or whatever.

1308
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:53,039
But for me, if it's a subject that I love and I'm passionate about, I can speak about it.

1309
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:54,199
So you need to find your passion.

1310
00:55:54,199 --> 00:55:57,199
And I think it becomes easy to share your vision then.

1311
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:03,559
But if it's coaching, if there's coaches out there, so you can describe what you want done,

1312
00:56:03,619 --> 00:56:06,360
then you need to put it up on a whiteboard and you need to walk through it.

1313
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,059
Then you need to go out and teach it and action it.

1314
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,059
So words don't teach.

1315
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,340
It's empowering people through actions.

1316
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:17,579
And that's why, you know, with the learning life through sport, we need to practice it, rehearse it.

1317
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:19,000
We need to reinforce it weekly.

1318
00:56:19,139 --> 00:56:22,559
So it's that reinforcement that makes these things happen.

1319
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:23,559
So again, creativity.

1320
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:25,079
Creating and sharing a vision.

1321
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:29,300
You need to bring the energy to the room and you get that opportunity if it's positive energy.

1322
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,800
But if it's negative energy, you bring that as well, Darcy.

1323
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,059
You get the choice whether it's positive or negative.

1324
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,780
For me, I want to bring positive energy.

1325
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:42,340
That way, you know, we can help, again, motivate, inspire, and empower people to want to behave in a certain way.

1326
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:50,300
And they'll get that fulfillment by competing and doing it well to good values just as much, if not more, than winning.

1327
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,320
Andrew Dillon, you're on notice.

1328
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,940
We're coming your way with this.

1329
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:54,619
We're coming your way with this vision.

1330
00:56:54,800 --> 00:57:04,099
The CEO of the AFL, who is a great community sports lover, Dills coached my daughter for four years.

1331
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:11,079
And his platform, as the new CEO of the AFL, is all about really taking this sort of values to community sport.

1332
00:57:11,139 --> 00:57:14,420
He was a champion player in amateur football, Dills, as well.

1333
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,699
So he gets it at a high level.

1334
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,940
And I'm sure he'll share the passion for this, Rod.

1335
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:23,900
So any way we can help to spark that message, just putting that out there publicly.

1336
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:30,480
Curiosity, and through curiosity, we see people really approach their learning and development, and they're constantly curious.

1337
00:57:30,679 --> 00:57:31,400
Does that resonate with you?

1338
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:32,559
Yeah, 100%.

1339
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:37,360
I think back in the day, you know, I probably learned I wanted to be a coach.

1340
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:40,059
My dad was a coach, and I wanted to learn to be a coach.

1341
00:57:40,099 --> 00:57:41,679
I wanted to follow in my dad's footsteps.

1342
00:57:42,219 --> 00:57:46,820
And along the way, I just understood that it's, you know, you give so much time to coaching.

1343
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:53,920
But along the way, I was super curious, and I had the opportunity to speak to, I had the best teacher ever, which was my dad, Graham Campbell, to teach me.

1344
00:57:54,019 --> 00:57:56,280
But then I really sought other leaders at the time.

1345
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:01,659
And Rick Charlesworth was a great hockey coach at the time, been an Australian cricketer, Australian hockey player.

1346
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,599
And I sought him to just sit down with.

1347
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:07,719
And you found that the best people would speak to you if they knew you were passionate.

1348
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,960
Charlie Walsh was another one who was quite amazing, Australian cycling coach.

1349
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:12,920
So this is back in the early 2000s.

1350
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:17,179
I had a chance to speak to some amazing leaders to try and learn from them.

1351
00:58:17,179 --> 00:58:18,039
Malcolm Blight, I remember.

1352
00:58:18,139 --> 00:58:19,440
He may not remember, but I rang him up.

1353
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:22,860
I was on the phone with him for about two hours just talking about footy and coaching.

1354
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:23,780
This is post his.

1355
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,480
This is Adelaide Premiership Coaching Days.

1356
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:31,360
Yeah, the people will give you their time, but I've always been curious to try and learn.

1357
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:36,639
And even now, like, I don't know that I'll coach going forward because I really want to get learning life through sport going.

1358
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,860
But I still have a massive curiosity.

1359
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:45,159
Like, I listen to post-match press conferences, and I love listening to podcasts like your one, Luke.

1360
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:48,000
And just, you know, it's an opportunity to learn from the best.

1361
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,199
Like, to think that, you know, 20 years ago, if you think you could sit there and listen to Mike Dunlap

1362
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:53,760
and find out how to do it, you know, it's a great opportunity.

1363
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,840
And to think about his theories on life or on sport, you know, or Ash Barty or whoever it is.

1364
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,639
Like, it's an incredible opportunity to learn.

1365
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:02,719
So I'm super curious, and I'll never lose that.

1366
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:03,900
And that's how we learn and get better.

1367
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:08,340
Yeah, it's a brilliant platform, isn't it, now in real time to have great people sharing the way they do.

1368
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:14,019
And it's a great privilege to be able to talk to some of them in this podcast, communicating with clarity.

1369
00:59:14,139 --> 00:59:18,619
And as I go back to the road toll for me, and I think, you know, for you to be able to –

1370
00:59:18,619 --> 00:59:23,460
and I hope people then say, oh, what's a one-hour presentation with learning through life sport going to do?

1371
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:27,780
I've sat through your presentation, and it immediately impacted me straight away.

1372
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:31,480
I changed a couple of things I was doing that week in coaching.

1373
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,699
You know, went over and engaged the opposition coach better and engaged their players.

1374
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:43,019
And it immediately de-escalated any of the tension around a couple of coaches that were challenging in the past.

1375
00:59:43,059 --> 00:59:45,880
So you've got a great communication strategy.

1376
00:59:46,059 --> 00:59:47,019
Tell us a bit about it.

1377
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,559
Yeah, I think you need to keep the message really simple.

1378
00:59:50,039 --> 00:59:51,679
But you need to be clear and concise.

1379
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,980
And you need to inspire high standards.

1380
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:57,579
So high standards aren't only applicable to the highest level.

1381
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,760
High standards we can apply at any level.

1382
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:04,880
So you need to have that about you or part of your makeup so you have high standards when you're teaching.

1383
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:12,840
But again, letting your passion and enthusiasm flow in specifically because I'm from a fire service background, so as a station officer.

1384
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:17,500
So communicating with clarity is critical because they could be life and death situations.

1385
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:21,380
So an example of that would be you have a crew working with you.

1386
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:23,039
You might go into a fire situation.

1387
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:27,880
So you'd explain, you'd discuss the method of how we're going to control this situation.

1388
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:30,679
And then you'd discuss that with your team.

1389
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:36,800
But then as you task them, you'd identify the task and then get them to repeat that task back to you.

1390
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:39,719
Okay, so we've got absolute clarity on what we're doing.

1391
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:44,360
And then when they go in, we know that they can perform that task or we're aiming towards that goal.

1392
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:48,099
So that clarity is super important in emergency services.

1393
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,239
So I guess that's where I learned that.

1394
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:51,360
But yeah.

1395
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:56,820
When you talk about communicating with clarity, so in the road safety space, a little bit different.

1396
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,699
So it'll be the key messages.

1397
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:04,059
So in RAP, the Road Awareness Program, we'd have the key messages of, you know, you get to choose the risk.

1398
01:01:04,099 --> 01:01:05,340
You don't get to choose the consequence.

1399
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,940
What we do know is that most people will take what they feel emotionally away from that presentation.

1400
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:13,539
And that'll give them the passion to go forward and want to be part of it.

1401
01:01:13,719 --> 01:01:15,340
But what messages will they remember?

1402
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,019
So that consistency of that same saying.

1403
01:01:18,019 --> 01:01:20,840
So we might say that saying 20 times during a presentation.

1404
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,219
And it might be the one thing that they go away with.

1405
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:29,780
So keeping it simple, reinforcing the message and understanding that people aren't going to take away lots of messages.

1406
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,340
They might just take away a few.

1407
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:36,639
And if they take away the main ones that are going to empower them to change their behaviors, they're really important.

1408
01:01:36,699 --> 01:01:38,199
So that reinforcement of the message.

1409
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:38,739
Yeah.

1410
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:45,440
And I think, you know, listening to your words again, what you're wanting to do in sport, sportsmanship and respect and, you know, the values.

1411
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,199
You're keeping it simple so people can recall that.

1412
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:50,579
We can't absorb a whole hour.

1413
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:53,460
And 15, but you get a couple of those values, right?

1414
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,780
It's going to have a massive difference.

1415
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,320
How important is collaboration been for you?

1416
01:01:57,079 --> 01:01:59,079
Collaboration is massive, Luke.

1417
01:01:59,079 --> 01:02:01,579
You don't get anywhere without collaborating, collaborating.

1418
01:02:01,579 --> 01:02:07,820
And even now with a new business that we want to move forward and try and help create change, you need to collaborate with the right people.

1419
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:19,800
Uh, and I think, yeah, it's been important to learn from people, to, to be empowered by people, but also to empower, to inspire people, but also to be inspired.

1420
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,340
So it's that.

1421
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:21,440
And I think that's really important.

1422
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,300
And I think that's really important.

1423
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:22,400
And I think that's really important.

1424
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:22,519
And I think that's really important.

1425
01:02:22,519 --> 01:02:22,579
And I think that's really important.

1426
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:24,920
You just can't do any of this stuff by yourself.

1427
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:29,900
So you need to get the right people on board and again, the right people aren't necessarily a skillset.

1428
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,039
It'll be a value set.

1429
01:02:31,159 --> 01:02:35,159
So you get the right people with the right values on board that you collaborate with.

1430
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:36,000
You'll learn from them.

1431
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:37,000
You know, you can trust them.

1432
01:02:37,099 --> 01:02:44,000
Trust is really important in this space, particularly around change and around culture because people need to be invested to change culture.

1433
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:45,599
It's a hard thing to do.

1434
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:49,159
We might talk about it, but how, how badly do you want to change culture?

1435
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:50,500
So if you want to change.

1436
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:57,539
The culture of junior sport, if you really want to, and you're one of the leaders, you need to take the time to do it and invest the time because it's not going to happen.

1437
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:01,239
So you'll see a presentation like ours and you might feel inspired.

1438
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:07,340
You need to feel inspired to go forward and check it out and let's have a go at it because things aren't going to change.

1439
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:13,579
I don't want to sit here in another generation's time or I may not be here in a generation's time, but in a decade's time and nothing's changed again, Luke.

1440
01:03:13,579 --> 01:03:19,480
Because if we look back decade by decade, we've seen no change in junior sport and it's probably as bad as it's been now.

1441
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:20,519
But I see a really.

1442
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:23,800
Clear vision, a really clear way to move forward.

1443
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:32,519
And that happens by us all working together and, you know, taking the hit a bit, just, you know, bottle your, your, uh, anger and just understand this is not about you.

1444
01:03:32,539 --> 01:03:35,000
And when we talk about being selfless, this is not about the parents.

1445
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:36,320
This is about their kids.

1446
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,440
If we're talking about junior sport, but this applies to seniors as well.

1447
01:03:39,579 --> 01:03:49,079
But at junior level, we want to start, you know, at the base level and start teaching these great values so that we can enjoy our sport and learn some great values to take into life.

1448
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:50,019
And along the way.

1449
01:03:50,019 --> 01:03:55,079
You might have a much better relationship with your own kids and a much happier space all around.

1450
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:56,320
It's incredibly worthwhile.

1451
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,300
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1452
01:03:58,780 --> 01:03:59,559
Oh, without question.

1453
01:03:59,559 --> 01:04:05,780
My dad, yeah, just, you know, incredible leader, uh, lucky to, yeah.

1454
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:14,280
He passed away a bit over a year ago and had dementia for, um, you know, the last six or seven years of his life, Luke, but just an incredible leader.

1455
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:19,860
Like he, he knew selflessness, but he coached Fitzroy for one year in 1978.

1456
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:20,000
Yeah.

1457
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:21,860
Bought our family over from Perth.

1458
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:26,039
So we're from Melbourne, went over to Perth cause he couldn't get the Fitzroy coaching job and coached the reserves premiership.

1459
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:31,000
Went over to WA, went from last to first in a season with West Perth, who were a great team.

1460
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,780
And then Fitzroy got him back.

1461
01:04:33,219 --> 01:04:34,219
Dad coached for one year.

1462
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,619
They had a lot of close losses.

1463
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,000
There's some great players like Gary Wilson back in that era.

1464
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,780
Robert Walls, Bernie Quinlan were playing there.

1465
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:40,940
Dad got them to the club.

1466
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:43,300
Coached for one year and then left.

1467
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,900
Like the club wanted him for as long as he wanted to be there.

1468
01:04:46,179 --> 01:04:48,880
But our family wanted to go back to Perth to live cause we liked the weather.

1469
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:49,860
My brother had stayed there.

1470
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:50,880
He was in year 12 at school.

1471
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:57,679
The family had been broken up and that had no hesitation to stop what he loved, which was coaching to keep our family together.

1472
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:00,699
And like, he taught us the value that, you know, family is everything.

1473
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,500
And yeah, just great leader.

1474
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:07,260
I never heard him argue umpires decisions like that was built into me.

1475
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,619
It was like, they'll never change their decision.

1476
01:05:08,699 --> 01:05:09,340
So why argue?

1477
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:10,820
That was kind of his philosophy.

1478
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:13,500
And he was, he was just so inspirational.

1479
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,900
Like his pre-match speeches.

1480
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:19,039
I just wish I could have had the video DAS back in the day.

1481
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:19,280
And.

1482
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:19,699
Yeah.

1483
01:05:19,699 --> 01:05:19,840
Yeah.

1484
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:19,860
Yeah.

1485
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:26,260
He was just amazingly, uh, empowering, passionate, just, just the best leader anyone could ever have.

1486
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,039
Just so blessed.

1487
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:30,139
He was a great broadcaster and I feel privileged to have got to know him.

1488
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:38,539
And as I said, we were probably sitting on the sidelines of Sunday footy shows, not far apart and knocking off the pies out of the pie warmer.

1489
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,500
And, uh, you know, dad, a very similar person.

1490
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:42,199
It's interesting.

1491
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:48,579
You know, you and I've both had the privilege to have, uh, fathers who have the same sort of values and they were great mates.

1492
01:05:48,579 --> 01:05:49,840
And I, uh, feel.

1493
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,500
Privileged to have, uh, known your dad.

1494
01:05:51,539 --> 01:05:53,619
I'm not surprised by, uh, that answer.

1495
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:58,280
If you collaborate with anyone on anything, who, who might it be?

1496
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,940
I've developed a real passion for Ash Barty.

1497
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,440
I just think she's amazing.

1498
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,360
Like I love the way she goes about her sport.

1499
01:06:06,539 --> 01:06:10,239
I love the way she's developed herself to be, to be a great role model.

1500
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,039
She just epitomizes the values that learning life through sport stands for.

1501
01:06:14,119 --> 01:06:15,960
And, and, you know, I listened to her on podcasts.

1502
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:19,679
Uh, I've followed her, her development and she's clearly.

1503
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:25,119
Gone through a lot of adversity, but she's learned from adversity and she's her own person, but she's amazing.

1504
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:29,960
I I'd love to potentially sit down with her, uh, and, and Craig McCrae is the other one.

1505
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:35,440
Like I know he's flavor of the week at the moment, but I just watched the way that he coaches and the way that he empowers.

1506
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:41,820
And when you talk about people, won't care how much, you know, until they know how much you care, uh, he epitomizes that as well.

1507
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:44,579
So I know he does coach my nephew, Braden.

1508
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:49,619
So Bray, if you're listening out there and you can get me an audience with Craig McCray at some point, I'd love to sit.

1509
01:06:49,619 --> 01:06:50,519
Down for an hour.

1510
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:53,519
Uh, I know Hayden Skipworth, who coaches under him is a great man.

1511
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:55,840
And yeah, there's some good people.

1512
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,500
I mean, I, I love collaborating with my, my children.

1513
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:01,260
You know, I've got three adult kids that are amazing.

1514
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,239
Like one's a school teacher, come counselor.

1515
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:07,079
She's 29 and my next son down, uh, he's a paramedic.

1516
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,199
Uh, my next son down is a fly in fly out worker.

1517
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:14,679
They've all got their own experiences and they're all, um, contemporary people.

1518
01:07:14,679 --> 01:07:17,800
And, you know, you stay in touch with that because they're the people that you're working with.

1519
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:23,719
And, and even my youngest two kids, like to collaborate with them, you know, they all go through stuff and we need to be there for them.

1520
01:07:23,719 --> 01:07:27,239
And I learn as much from my kids as, as I do from others.

1521
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:32,860
But yeah, that's, you know, that family first and, and, uh, and those two people really come to mind.

1522
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,980
Beautifully said, uh, right.

1523
01:07:35,059 --> 01:07:39,639
And you can hear the selflessness and the positivity and the impact that, uh, just pours out of you.

1524
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:42,000
And I should be incredibly proud of what you're doing.

1525
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:47,719
I'd love to collaborate with you in any way to support this program that, uh, learning life through sport is all about.

1526
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:54,559
It's a, it's a free hit really in a country like our sports, so much of our DNA want it to be a happy and fun place.

1527
01:07:54,559 --> 01:08:01,760
It's got to get back to being that we need to educate ourselves and we need to educate each other on making this a better space.

1528
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:09,099
So I'm in your corner big time, as you know, um, incredibly, um, you know, amazed by the work you're doing, the passion that you're showing.

1529
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:14,800
So well done again, uh, Rod, look forward to maybe doing this again in the future with some impact in the coming years.

1530
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:15,940
Thanks so much, Luke.

1531
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:16,560
Appreciate it.

1532
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:23,140
