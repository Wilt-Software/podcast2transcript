1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,000
How do you advocate against hatred in a way that makes a real world difference?

2
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:15,140
And in the battle against bigotry and ignorance, how can you lead with integrity and act as

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,140
a voice for the voiceless while still maintaining your own sense of self and personal identity?

4
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,039
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

5
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:28,839
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field has been a lifelong

6
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:29,699
passion of mine.

7
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,740
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective and I've had the privilege

8
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:39,280
of working with thousands of leaders in education, sport, industry, and the arts that have helped

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,960
shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership where everyone has a voice.

10
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:48,539
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

11
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:07,840
Don Winslow was born in New York City, Rhode Island in 1953.

12
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,959
He credits his parents for shaping his love of storytelling and ultimately inspiring his

13
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,480
incredible success as a writer.

14
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,920
Don's portfolio of work is full of award-winning and internationally

15
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,599
best-selling books, including his revered work on the trilogy of novels in the Cartel

16
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,799
series, The Power of the Dog, The Cartel, and The Border.

17
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,760
Don's work has been regularly transformed into film and television, including collaborations

18
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,540
with legendary producers Oliver Stone and Ridley Scott.

19
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,120
Don has taken a strong leadership position in American life on issues like the war on

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,359
drugs and produced a series of videos that have been viewed more than 250 million times

21
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,400
in response to the Donald Trump era.

22
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,900
His latest work, City on Fire, is original.

23
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,819
Don Winslow has already been described as a masterpiece, Don Winslow being described

24
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:58,340
as America's greatest ever crime writer, and it is a wonderful pleasure to meet Don today

25
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,739
in California, I believe.

26
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,480
Welcome to you, Don.

27
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:02,780
Thank you.

28
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,959
Thanks for having me, Luke.

29
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:07,000
You've got an incredible gift for storytelling.

30
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,819
Can I start by asking, where did that passion come from?

31
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,479
You know, my dad was a sailor, in fact, who was in Melbourne in World War II right after

32
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,919
the Battle of Guadalcanal.

33
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:24,180
When he left that war and he was 18 years old, he said that all he wanted to do was

34
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,879
ride around on the ocean, go to every zoo in Europe, and read books.

35
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,580
And my mom was a librarian, and so we always had books around the house.

36
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,120
And we were allowed to read anything we wanted at any age, didn't matter.

37
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,280
And so from a very young age, you know, I thought, man, if life works out the way I

38
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,840
want it to, that would be the best of all possible worlds, you know.

39
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,340
It would be to become a professional novelist.

40
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:57,439
And your academic path was an interesting one via the University of Nebraska, graduating

41
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,800
with a master's degree in African history.

42
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,960
What drew you to that space initially?

43
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,740
When I, again, going back to childhood, I guess we all do, right, for those influences.

44
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,500
There was a guy called Jack Parr who had a late night talk show, and he was always going

45
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,159
off to Kenya, and he'd take these home movies.

46
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,979
And I was just intrigued with them.

47
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:18,840
And then my dad.

48
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,979
He turned me on to a couple of books about Kenya.

49
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,419
And when I had a chance, I was asked to go into this special areas program at university.

50
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,680
I took it.

51
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:34,699
Segwaying there, you passed back from being a guide effectively through Africa and China

52
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:35,539
at various stages.

53
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:40,120
You worked as a private investigator on this path to being an internationally bestselling

54
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,479
author of many, many great books.

55
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,780
But I want to come back to that at some point, if that's okay, Don.

56
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,860
But probably you.

57
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:53,860
You are, as well as anyone on the planet, through your extensive work in the research

58
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,979
of the Mexican drug cartels, and we all now know names like El Chapo, and we know the

59
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:00,180
Sinaloa cartel.

60
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,219
I mean, you probably are as well placed as anyone to understand that.

61
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,620
Well, can you describe how those cartels work and how dangerous they are and what sort of

62
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,259
damage they do?

63
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,319
Well, they do immense damage, and most of the damage is in Mexico and in Central America.

64
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,319
You know, around 2000...

65
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:24,680
2001, 2002 was a major shift in the way the cartels operated, in that they became, in

66
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,139
effect, paramilitary organizations.

67
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,620
They started to hire mercenaries.

68
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:37,319
They hired Mexican special forces who'd been trained by the United States and by Israelis.

69
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:45,500
And so the level of violence escalated to a ferocious amount, something like 200,000

70
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,500
deaths have been attributed to, you know, conflict.

71
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,139
It's between the Mexican cartels.

72
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,060
Eventually, the Sinaloa cartel won that war, although it's now fighting with something

73
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,939
called the New Jalisco cartel for dominance in the market.

74
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:07,480
I think the important thing for us, though, really to realize is that the so-called Mexican

75
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,500
drug problem is not the Mexican drug problem.

76
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,699
It's the American drug problem.

77
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,899
It's the Western European drug problem.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,079
I suppose it's the Australian drug problem.

79
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,680
We're the ones...

80
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:24,420
We're the ones that send billions of dollars a year, i.e. $60 billion a year, roughly, from

81
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,740
the United States alone, to these cartels.

82
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:32,660
So we are the people, through our drug usage, that fund this kind of violence.

83
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:38,519
It's a combination, isn't it, Don, between this insatiable appetite for drugs in the

84
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:44,459
West, and I believe Australia per capita is almost at the top of the tree in terms of

85
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:45,620
illicit drug use.

86
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,620
And then you've got the prohibition on drugs, which I'm...

87
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,300
I'm keen to talk to you about, because you've used your leadership platform a lot.

88
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:55,120
You've taken out full-page ads in the Washington Post.

89
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,480
You've written to every member of Congress without getting a response, I understand.

90
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:03,939
And can you maybe first explain, for those that don't know their history, Richard Nixon

91
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:07,740
nearly 50 years ago made drug abuse public.

92
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,759
Any number one, I think, was the language he used.

93
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:14,120
But can you explain why that policy has really been nothing short of a disaster?

94
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:15,860
Yeah.

95
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,879
Nixon declared the so-called war on drugs.

96
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,860
Now, it wasn't particularly new.

97
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:26,360
Drug prohibition started around the 1900s with various types of drugs, but it was really

98
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,519
Nixon who launched this campaign.

99
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:35,259
Once you define the anti-drug movement as a war, you've already lost that war.

100
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,600
You will never, ever solve this problem trying to interdict the supply, because the demand

101
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,040
is always so strong.

102
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,040
So all you're doing is driving drug prices up and creating massive...

103
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:59,040
to knock down the drug prices and eventually, chapter, the reduction of protective equipment

104
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:06,180
and you'recommitting, you're cons AAA small 걔yy stars investigations into

105
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,100
criminal organizations, such as, but not exclusively, the Mexican cartels.

106
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,120
If you make a substance illegal, only criminals, by definition, can deal with it.

107
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:25,160
the whole idea of a war on drugs was a disaster. And then later in our history, in the 1980s and

108
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:32,899
early 1990s, when crack cocaine became an issue, we responded with draconian laws, putting people

109
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:39,519
in jail for 30 years to life. The American prison system became the largest prison system in the

110
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:47,220
history of the world with 2 million people incarcerated. The social damage was incalculable.

111
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:53,939
You know, you don't just put an individual in prison, you put his whole or her whole family in

112
00:07:53,939 --> 00:08:02,220
prison, in a way. We've spent something like a trillion dollars trying to interdict the shipment

113
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:08,120
of drugs, when that trillion dollars would have been much more effective put into education and

114
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,519
treatment.

115
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:15,639
So we'll never solve it as a law enforcement problem. We won't, for God's sake, solve it as

116
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,920
a military problem. It can only be addressed successfully as the social health problem that

117
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,379
it is.

118
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:27,819
And Don, are you seeing some movement? I think clear thinking people would understand that

119
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:33,419
that is a logical step, given, as you just beautifully articulated, the resources that

120
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:39,320
have gone into it. And if you make something, as you said, by prohibition, the criminals

121
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,500
can't do it.

122
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,299
It can only exist then if it's illegal. If you make it decriminalized effectively,

123
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:50,399
you take out, you know, I know it's a bit more complex than that. I mean, being in the US prior

124
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,799
to the world shutting down for COVID, we're seeing lots of, you know, medicinal marijuana

125
00:08:54,799 --> 00:09:02,539
stores now becoming almost on every second corner. It felt like last time was in Los Angeles. Are we

126
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:07,240
seeing a slow trend towards decriminalization and making drugs a health issue?

127
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,139
Yes, with a major hiccup. Now,

128
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:15,620
you mentioned legalization of marijuana. When that happened, the profits for marijuana for

129
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:22,500
the Mexican cartels dropped by 46%, almost literally overnight. They're virtually out

130
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:29,279
of that business now. The unintended side effect was, though, that they put more of their efforts

131
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:36,720
into heroin and methamphetamine, which gifted us with the opioid epidemic. So the solution is not

132
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,120
to legalize one drug. It's to legalize one drug. It's to legalize one drug. It's to legalize one drug.

133
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:45,779
Or at least decriminalize all drugs. We have seen some movement toward that. We've seen

134
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:50,460
movement toward drug courts, for instance, that put people into treatment programs instead of

135
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:58,220
into cells. We've seen more legalization. Now, when the former president, whose name I almost

136
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:04,580
hate speaking, came into office, he started to reverse that progress, of course, as he reversed

137
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,120
all other kinds of progress, and told this incredible lie.

138
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:15,220
About building a wall and saying that that wall would stop the drugs. He knew it was a lie.

139
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:22,679
Everybody involved in the drug world knew it was a lie, because 97% of the drugs come through gates

140
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:28,740
that are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They come in tractor-trailer trucks

141
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,379
through normal commerce between the United States and Mexico, and you are never going to shut that

142
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:39,120
commerce down. Now that we have a new administration, though, I think it's going to be

143
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,039
difficult. I think that that progress will continue. We'll start to see some sanity.

144
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:49,820
You know, look, look, it's not a right or left issue. It's an issue of common sense. It's an

145
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:57,399
issue of dollars and cents. Everybody should be able to agree with this. For every $1 you spend

146
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:04,659
on education, you save $5 in imprisonment. Both liberals and conservatives should be able to do

147
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:08,259
that math, like that math, and agree with that math.

148
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:14,100
Yeah, Don, your points are so well made. And the unfolding tragedy, as you said, to have the

149
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:21,179
history's biggest prison population in America. And the other crazy part to that, to me, is

150
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:27,059
you've now privatized a lot of those prisons. So you've effectively commercialized the idea of

151
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:32,559
building more prisons. And so that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy unfolding before our

152
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:38,379
times. And you see the tragedies of low-level misdemeanors for drugs resulting in these 30,

153
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,120
40-year life sentences. And I think that's a great point. And I think that's a great point.

154
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,179
Is there any movement on that towards common sense?

155
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,080
Yes, there's been quite a bit of movement on that. Again, it was stopped during the previous

156
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,299
administration. It started with the Obama administration, who were, I think, a bit late

157
00:11:54,299 --> 00:12:01,299
to the dance on drug and prison reform, but they got there. So we are seeing movement again. We are

158
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:07,259
seeing people released. We are seeing prison sentences reduced. The phrase prison privatization

159
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,100
might be the filthiest conversation I've ever heard. But I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good

160
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,539
combination of words I know in the English language, maybe other than jazz fusion. But we

161
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:23,460
are moving in that direction. They're shutting down federally privatized facilities. Now it's

162
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:31,379
up to the states. But when you create a profit motive for building prisons and a profit motive

163
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:37,779
for keeping those cells full, which is the way that they make their profits, you're into a really

164
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:39,100
disgusting and soul-throbbing situation. And I think that's a good thing. I think it's a good

165
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,059
killing business, I think. Don, you've probably seen the worst of what humans can do to one

166
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:52,340
another. Your research is extensive and in some ways almost overlooked the brutality of what the

167
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:57,259
Mexican cartels have done. And we've seen other examples that seem to have gained more traction

168
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:04,519
in recent times with other forms of terrorism. Are you still surprised by our capacity to do

169
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,600
evil things to each other? No. Luke, I wish I were. I

170
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:17,240
profoundly wish that I were. You know, when I started this drug trilogy, it was over the massacre

171
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:24,840
of 19 innocent men, women, and children. At the time, that was shocking. Ten years later,

172
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:32,299
it wouldn't have made the papers. It was a low body count. And I spent 23 years, a third of my

173
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:39,100
life, I guess, on that drug beat. And so the capacity to be shocked by the

174
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,440
inhumanity of man toward man has, I'm afraid, left me.

175
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,120
And sort of segueing a little bit, Don, as you're talking, a part of your life was as a private

176
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,200
investigator. And I remember, you know, in preparation for catching up today, that there

177
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,179
was a point in your career as a PI where you literally, there was a horrific murder, I believe,

178
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:05,620
and a body had been burnt horrifically by a husband, a horrific crime. And you were literally

179
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,000
scrolling through the horrific images of this.

180
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,000
Burnt body. I blistered and, you know, in preparation for court, you were doing your job.

181
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,299
But the fact that you were surprised that you weren't surprised, I think, was that a moment

182
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:24,279
for you that went, I need to shift out of this? And that's sort of your trajectory towards

183
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,519
your career as a full-time author started there?

184
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,019
No, it started earlier, but that certainly was a moment when I realized that I needed to get out.

185
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,299
You know, I was, I want to say, six or seven published books into my career before I could

186
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:39,019
quit my job.

187
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,440
One of which was, was investigating. I remember that moment vividly, flipping through these

188
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,460
photographs with one hand, eating a ham sandwich with the other, because we were too busy to get

189
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:57,740
out to lunch. And boy, it just struck me so forcefully that I had become so jaded and so

190
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:03,500
inured to this stuff. And I was looking at photos of a human being, you know, a person with,

191
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,940
with dreams and hopes and children, you know, that had been taken away. And I was looking,

192
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,559
I was looking for very, very specific images on the body that would indicate a, a death prior to

193
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:23,820
asphyxiation by fire or smoke. And it was highly technical. But then I thought, boy, what, what have

194
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:30,779
you become? You know, who are you now? Fortunately, shortly after that, I got kind of a break with a

195
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,580
book and a film, and I was able to leave that work.

196
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,179
Don, it's an, it's an interesting transition in some ways, because

197
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:39,100
the podcast is about, it's about, it's about, it's about, it's about, it's about, it's about,

198
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,460
recording now is sort of born out of identifying what we've seen as a new era of leadership. You

199
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:50,919
know, people we've worked with firsthand in industry, sport, the creative arts, you know,

200
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,500
diverse backgrounds. So we're seeing a really self-reflective, a bit like what you just

201
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,000
described then. Hey, what have I become out of this? Who are collaborative, they're,

202
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,220
they're lifelong learners, really conscious of how they impact their environment. Are you

203
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,740
seeing that as well? I mean, you've obviously seen the worst of humankind, but are you hopeful

204
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,840
that there's enough community of people that we're trying to talk to and, and I suppose share

205
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,360
their stories? Is there hope for you in that space as well? Yeah, absolutely. You know, I see it more

206
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,740
and more and I see it more and more in the, what is hopefully the post COVID era. You know, I think

207
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:30,279
that these last few years starting really in 2016 for us here, and then, and then going through

208
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:37,320
COVID has forced a lot of self-reflection about what's important to us. You know, what, what

209
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:43,519
really means something to us? Why are we doing this work? What are we about? What do we value?

210
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:51,419
You know, and I think there were a lot of things taken away from us, you know, contact with friends

211
00:16:51,419 --> 00:17:00,580
and with family, time spent together, time spent to reflect, time, time spent to appreciate

212
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:06,920
beauty. You know, it's funny, you know, here in the States, we, we've cut down

213
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:15,759
on programs in the arts, you know, painting, art, music, theater. And then we wonder why life has

214
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:23,900
become so crass. And so I think I am optimistic because I think, and I've said this before, that,

215
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:31,980
that pessimism, pessimism isn't a choice. It's a suicide pact. We can feel pessimistic. We can

216
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,259
feel down about things, but then how do you get up in the morning? What are you supposed to do?

217
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:43,960
You just give up, uh, and, and walk into this endless gloom or, or do you say to yourself,

218
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,319
no, I'm going to do what I can, even if that's just a little bit here and there.

219
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:55,240
Yeah. I'm filled with great hope as well, Don, on the back of this time where you're forced into,

220
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,579
if you were lucky, I suppose, and you could cope financially and were healthy to reflect,

221
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,359
uh, at the other end of the scale, there were people who've been left behind here in Australia

222
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:07,299
and around the world horrifically. And that, you know, is incredible.

223
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:12,440
It's incredibly disturbing, but I hope out of the positive aspect of being out of it, people

224
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,779
in America, you know, the term has been the great resignation. People have now looked at what they

225
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:22,539
do day to day and, uh, and, uh, you know, probably a bit like your life path, uh, Don, finding their

226
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:27,619
purpose and their, and their passion maybe, and doing that in a more immediate fashion. So it

227
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:32,960
feels to me as though out of, uh, this challenge, there's going to be some creativity that I, that

228
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,819
I hope sets us on the right trajectory is, is, as we said before.

229
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,140
Yeah, I share that.

230
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,700
I hope with you, you know, and listen, I mean, I see signs of it. I see it among my friends. I

231
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,460
see it among my colleagues, you know, who I think are thinking a little deeper about things,

232
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,779
thinking, you know, a little more creatively about things. So yeah, Luke, let's hope.

233
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,539
Now, uh, part of your, your, your great history is, you know, you used your influence and your

234
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:03,740
own funds to create the series of, uh, videos in response to the Trump era and the craziness

235
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,059
of it. I mean, I think the last count I could measure 250,

236
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,920
million people or more have downloaded those videos in itself is an incredible impact. I mean,

237
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,160
you've sold so many copies of your books, but to get that sort of, did you feel like it made an

238
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,259
impact? I hope so. I think so. You know, look, I mean, we're always concerned that you're just

239
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:28,680
preaching to the faithful, you know? Uh, but even there, I think that there's a, a positive aspect

240
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,339
of, of getting people fired up and reminding people what we have at stake and to get out there

241
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:37,039
and to vote and to, to contribute to people who feel the same.

242
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,339
Yeah. So I think that there are

243
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:44,579
a few things you've 우녔 to get out. And I, I, if you you're not waiting to, even if you're not

244
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:48,339
ready to give that stuff away, you know what I mean? Uh, you've lost all of your forces and

245
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:55,259
you are the ones who don't stand. And I, I, when I work with myself or with my boss, I since was

246
00:19:55,259 --> 00:20:00,619
spent half a decade usually speaking at the comments to him. And we have some, some issues

247
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:05,779
where, and I think we've all experienced some of those at the beginning is when you see someone

248
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:06,859
get fired up or get fired.

249
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:06,980
Yeah.

250
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,099
Yeah.

251
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:14,420
been there before. Around the election time, though, we very much targeted our videos towards

252
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:22,140
swing voters in critical states. And I think that we did have an impact there. Mr. Springsteen helped

253
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:28,400
us out with that. Wonderful actor, Jeff Daniels, helped us out with that. And I think we did have

254
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,940
an impact. They're powerful collaborators, aren't they, to have Bruce Springsteen allow his

255
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:39,779
incredible work alongside your videos. And we'll send some links to check them out. They are

256
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:46,259
obviously impactful and have a great sense of who you are, Don, and the stances you take.

257
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,740
I mean, going back to what you said previously in the war on drugs, to me,

258
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:54,799
they don't have to be Democrat, Republican, left or right. The fact, in my mind, that we can't agree

259
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,480
even on basic facts these days is the challenge. And so turning back to Trump, I mean, sitting here

260
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,920
in Australia, you're generally pretty agnostic, you know, on US politics.

261
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:10,619
Because, you know, it's not my fight, given where we sit. But when you have a president,

262
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:17,799
you know, effectively lose an election and then claim that, you know, on every count that it was

263
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:21,759
stolen from him, and that's been thrown out of every court in America. When you stand

264
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:29,319
next to the Capitol and incite a riot on your own Capitol and have five people die,

265
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:33,859
and by sheer miracle, senators, you know, weren't killed in that insurrection,

266
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,339
and then by all intents and purposes, it appears to have, the American society's moved on and he's

267
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:44,640
gotten away with it. I mean, how do you explain that? How have we got to this point where that's

268
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,279
even possible? Well, first of all, it's infuriating. And you've laid out the reasons why.

269
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:55,640
And I do not understand it. And I've put out a number of tweets and videos about it, you know,

270
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:02,059
to the so-called January 6th committee that seems to be moving at glacial speed and with timidity.

271
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,839
And at the Attorney...

272
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:10,700
General, we all saw it. We heard it in the man's own words, you know, on the phone,

273
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:17,920
trying to change votes in Georgia, you know, leading a rally that became an insurrection.

274
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:24,519
We all saw it. It's hard to explain why it is. I think part of it's fatigue. You know, I think

275
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:33,039
that our country and maybe most countries are so fatigued from the COVID years. I think our country

276
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:33,920
is larger.

277
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:39,920
I think our country is largely fatigued from the Trump era. And maybe too many people want to think,

278
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:47,019
let it go and just move on. It's in the past, but it's not in the past. You know, Trump is holding

279
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:54,460
rallies. I think he's going to run again. And what's to stop him if and when he loses from

280
00:22:54,460 --> 00:23:02,440
launching another insurrection? So, you know, myself and people like me keep urging, you know,

281
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,920
the committees and the attorneys.

282
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:10,720
General and other folks prosecute. Let's have public hearings. Let's swear people in and put

283
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:17,039
these hearings on television where the American people and the world can hear what went on and

284
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:24,440
what happened. And then you can't doubt those facts. So, Don, there's a relaxed life for you,

285
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,779
isn't there, as a bestselling author. And clearly you love, you know, your routine and your prolific

286
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:33,920
writer and an extraordinary storyteller and a city on fire.

287
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,619
I've got it in my hand at the moment. If you haven't experienced Don's work, have a read of

288
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:43,799
this. It's an absolute masterpiece. It's much of Don's work. But you decide that, you know what,

289
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:47,839
there are bigger issues in life and you're going to put some skin in the game financially,

290
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:53,019
emotionally. Does that come at a cost? And where does that leadership come

291
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:56,099
in you to take on these issues and these challenges?

292
00:23:56,819 --> 00:24:03,599
Well, everything has a cost. You know, it's just life. And again, Shane and I, you know,

293
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:10,539
I'm not a big name, you know. I have a certain platform, I suppose, at times.

294
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:18,160
But we made a very clear decision to use that platform. You know, I wrote three books about

295
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:24,339
the drug cartels and those books were very good to me. But I would have felt like a voyeur,

296
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:32,220
like just another person profiting off drugs if I hadn't taken some of those resources

297
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,559
and tried.

298
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:41,079
To do something, you know, about it. I think that's just the ethical thing to do,

299
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,920
the moral thing to do, you know.

300
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,839
Again, it's the leadership we're trying to celebrate, Don, is that people who

301
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:53,119
have those clear values and are prepared to not only talk about them, but actively go about doing

302
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,819
what you have done. In another one of your great books, The Force, you wrote about

303
00:24:56,819 --> 00:25:03,279
police lives being threatened by the proliferation of guns and not just sort of handguns, but you've

304
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:03,579
got military guns. You've got military guns. You've got military guns. You've got military guns.

305
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,980
You've got military-grade assault weapons on the streets of America now. I mean, I love America.

306
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:14,579
It's one of my favourite places, but there are parts of it that are almost impossible to understand.

307
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:22,339
I mean, can you explain to us, in Australia, what's the craziness with guns in America?

308
00:25:22,579 --> 00:25:26,980
Why is that something that can't be moved? Why the needle can't be moved at all?

309
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,880
Well, it boggles my mind. I mean, I can give you practical reasons why the needle hasn't moved,

310
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,579
and that's because so many politicians,

311
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:40,200
are in the pocket of the gun manufacturers and the gun lobbies. So it comes down to money.

312
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:48,420
But I also think that there is this cultural, I don't know how to describe it, phenomenon in

313
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:56,140
American life that worships this image, and it's a very macho image of the man with the gun. And,

314
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:02,119
you know, you'll get my gun when you rip it out of my cold, dead hands, which is okay with me. But

315
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:08,440
something needs to be done. There was another shooting this morning in the New York subways.

316
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,160
I've been busy today, so I haven't really had a chance to follow up on it.

317
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:18,960
You know, what the cause of it was. You would have thought that after Sandy Hook, you know, when little kids

318
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,640
were massacred by one of these assault rifles, I think a lot of us thought, well, this is it.

319
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:32,420
You know, this is the end. And then again, you know, you have people like Alex Jones coming out and telling outrageous lies about it and denying it.

320
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,500
So,

321
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:39,980
Luke, I wish I had an answer for you. What I say to my gun right friends and neighbors,

322
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:44,940
and I live in the country, I live in cowboy country, really, you know, I ask them the following

323
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:52,019
question. Do you think that you should have the right to own a shoulder fired missile with nuclear

324
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:58,859
tips? And they say, of course not. And I say, well, we already agree on gun control.

325
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:03,579
But now we need to decide where we should draw.

326
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:11,980
You know, and from there, you can have a kind of a reasonable, at least, conversation about it.

327
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,480
I think one of the things that outcome, we get a lot of things right, wrong here as well, consistently.

328
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:27,859
And, you know, the last two years, I think history look back on and see full of extraordinary decisions and damaging decisions.

329
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:33,140
You know, personally saying our kids taken out of school for two years at a time.

330
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,680
I can't say our history is going to look back and think that was, that was the right approach.

331
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,720
You know, that will create controversy.

332
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:47,599
There'll be others that say that wasn't the case, but we had had one mass shooting effectively in a place called Port Arthur, which you would be aware of.

333
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:53,640
And, and a crazed lunatic caused, you know, immeasurable damage and we had horrific scenes.

334
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:00,440
But the reaction from our politicians was as good, I think, a bit of leadership as I've seen in recent times.

335
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,480
And it was an amnesty on guns and, and, and assault rifles.

336
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:02,880
I agree.

337
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,359
And, and assault rifles.

338
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:03,599
And, and, and assault rifles.

339
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,259
Were banned.

340
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:06,480
I mean, does that get any traction?

341
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,099
I mean, is that sort of story happens around the world that doesn't resonate at all?

342
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:10,980
It doesn't.

343
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:22,180
Hasn't so far, you know, look, I mean, there is no legitimate civilian use for an assault rifle and it's in the name and assault rifles for assault period.

344
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:33,599
Uh, one of our politicians, uh, Beto O'Rourke in Texas, you know, after a massacre in El Paso, uh, Texas came out and said, I will ban assault rifles.

345
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:40,980
And now he's running for governor and, and it's going to be a very, very tough job for him, largely because of that statement.

346
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:43,160
Uh, I don't get it.

347
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,099
I wish I had an answer for you.

348
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:48,099
Um, I wish I had an answer for myself and for the country.

349
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,180
Yeah, you've had, uh, as you said, you're, you're happy to get in the alleyways.

350
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:55,180
You don't mind, uh, getting in a, in a, in a scrap yourself.

351
00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:03,579
And I mean, you've regularly been on the receiving end of, of death threats, but you seem unfazed by when you were stabbed in Times Square once working as a private investor.

352
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:08,000
So it's not as though that you haven't had, uh, your moments.

353
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,599
How do you compartmentalize that?

354
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:21,779
Oh, you know, look, uh, I think most of these people making the threats are physical as well as moral cowards, you know, uh, and you, you can't live your life afraid.

355
00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:25,079
Um, I I'm coming on 68.

356
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:33,500
I've had a extraordinarily fortunate and blessed life, you know, I mean, you know, from my career to my family, to my, to my family.

357
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,279
My friends, I've been so, so lucky.

358
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,799
And so if it were to end, you know, I've had a really great run.

359
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,680
Not that I want it to not saying that.

360
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:44,420
Thank you.

361
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,640
You know, and I don't invite assaults.

362
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,420
Uh, I'm a little more careful about, you know, what I do.

363
00:29:51,500 --> 00:30:00,599
I'm probably a little more aware of my surroundings and that kind of thing, but it's, yeah, it's, you know, it's nothing I go to sleep worrying about or wake up thinking about.

364
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:08,819
Don.

365
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,019
Um, I think.

366
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:17,299
When you listen to stories like yours of, uh, of success consistently, you know, and I'm, and it's never that, uh, linear, there's always bumps along the road.

367
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:25,700
I, I just pausing before there's a series of questions that I'm, that I'm keen to ask you that I've been asking a range of different leaders, but has there been a memorable failure?

368
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:30,660
Have you, have you looked back and think, God, I got that one horribly wrong along the journey.

369
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,779
Is there something you can share on that front?

370
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:32,859
Oh yeah.

371
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:39,420
Every day, you know, uh, look, I, uh, ours are the writing businesses of failure business.

372
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:46,099
And, and what I try to tell aspiring writers is that, that failure is the first step towards success.

373
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:58,559
You know, so, uh, I mean, just before I got on with you, uh, uh, on proofreading and rewriting a manuscript and, and what do I see is failure after failure after failure.

374
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,740
The nice thing is that you get to fix it.

375
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:06,160
You know, uh, I'm not a doctor with a kid on an emergency room table.

376
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,019
You know, I, I can make mistakes and nobody dies.

377
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:18,099
And look, I was, uh, I suppose the outer world would consider me a low grade failure for most of my life and most of my career.

378
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:22,819
You know, I didn't, didn't get my first novel published till I was 37.

379
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:29,339
Um, I, I wrote a book called the power of the dog, the first in that drug trilogy.

380
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:32,339
And after that, I had $37 in our bank account.

381
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,839
So yeah, it has not been a, uh, a success only journey, you know, and yet I don't regret it.

382
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:54,119
Any of it, you know, uh, because I, I think that, that every step of the way and, and, and every mistake, um, has informed me and I've learned from it and, and it's moved me toward, you know, whatever success I have now.

383
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,680
You're running pretty thin there.

384
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:03,440
$37, uh, Don, before that, that takes, did you have a sense that that work was the one that was going to catapult you?

385
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,480
Did you feel like you had a, a, a, you know, a book in your hands that was going to be that big a commercial success?

386
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,019
No, you know, and it was.

387
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:20,559
Um, at first, uh, it was when I wrote the sequel to it, which I never intended to write, by the way, a book called the cartel, it became a big success.

388
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,059
And then people went back and went, Oh, what was the first book power of the dog?

389
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:38,339
So power of the dog sold far more books in its sort of second life, you know, after the cartel, when people went back to look at the original, uh, that it did, that it did at first, at first, it didn't sell very many copies in English.

390
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:39,940
It sold a lot of copies in Spanish.

391
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:48,019
And I think maybe German, but not a lot in the United States, but, you know, I, I wrote that books.

392
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:57,599
I had to write that book, you know, uh, not because I thought it was going to do anything particularly great for my career.

393
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:01,819
Why did you have to write that book on the back of the massacre that was close to, to, to home?

394
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:04,940
And you, you felt like I need to go and find out about that story.

395
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,920
Was that the genesis of it?

396
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,240
Yeah.

397
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:07,960
Yeah, it was.

398
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,019
And, and I spent, I think.

399
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:18,019
It was six years on that book, which does not improve your profit margin, you know, your six years between books.

400
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:29,619
Uh, but I felt, and then especially later with the cartel, you know, I guess I'm getting off track here, but after I wrote doc at power of the dog, uh, I swore I would never go back to that world.

401
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,059
Swore to myself, promised my wife that I would not go back.

402
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:40,000
Um, and, and Shane kept saying, you know, you need to write a second.

403
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:43,799
Book, uh, about this because things had changed so much.

404
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:57,980
And, and I thought that I understood those changes and I understood why they were, and, and I had knowledge about what we were experiencing that I thought that American readers particularly did not understand.

405
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:09,980
Uh, and so I, I felt, man, here I am sitting on the bench, I'm sitting on the sidelines and I could be useful in some regards as much as enough.

406
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:11,860
Novelist can be useful, you know?

407
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,280
Uh, and so I decided to write the cartel.

408
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:24,380
Um, and again, after the cartel, I said, no, no, no, no, never going back, never reentering that world.

409
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,420
It was too sad.

410
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,179
It was too hard.

411
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:36,599
Uh, too many funerals, you know, uh, too much watching atrocity videos and photographs and all of that.

412
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,039
And then Trump was elected.

413
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:49,119
Uh, and the whole thing about the wall and insults of, of Mexicans, you know, people of Mexican origin.

414
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:52,760
And then the opioid, uh, crisis started.

415
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,780
And again, I thought, I, I understand it.

416
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:06,019
You know, I have the background, uh, to, to talk to people about this in a way that maybe journalism doesn't or, you know, or politicians certainly don't.

417
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,139
And so I wrote the third in that series.

418
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:08,599
Yeah.

419
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:09,880
And that's the, the, the great.

420
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:19,099
I love hearing about, and you struck me as someone that, uh, when you have, uh, a moral sense, can't sit on the sidelines and, and I love your language.

421
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:20,280
I'm happy to get in the alleyways.

422
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:27,440
I'm happy to take the fight up, uh, in your own way, as you said, as, as a novelist, it's, it's such a unique, uh, uh, perspective and achieve it.

423
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:33,260
Don, I've been asking a range of leaders and I, and I love the diversity of, of, of talking to someone like you today.

424
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,099
Um, you know, his path is so unique and so interesting to me, but we're identifying leaders.

425
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:44,099
Um, uh, with a range of, of different sort of similarities in the way they're approaching their life.

426
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:46,199
And, and your story resonates really strongly with me.

427
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:49,360
We, we, we think most leaders have a sense of self-leadership.

428
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:52,800
When I say that term back to you, Don, what, what does that mean to you?

429
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,440
Self-leadership?

430
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:54,780
Hmm.

431
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,719
I've not heard that phrase before.

432
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:09,079
Uh, but I, I guess what it would mean to me is that I just need to get up every morning and do my job, you know, uh, whether it's a good day or a bad day.

433
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:11,340
Uh, I'm the only one who's going to do it.

434
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,300
No, one's going to write it for me and it's what I love to do.

435
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:23,380
And so for me, it's, you know, it's, it's funny, Luke, you know, people always say, uh, oh, you must have so much self-discipline.

436
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:29,199
And I want to say back, doesn't don't most people, you know, big deal.

437
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,300
I'll show up at work.

438
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,380
Almost everyone I know does the same thing.

439
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,079
You know, very few people I know say, I don't feel like it today.

440
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:40,420
See ya, you know?

441
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,219
Uh, and so it always makes me laugh a little bit.

442
00:36:44,219 --> 00:37:01,400
I love how you're trying to, you consistently try to debunk that sort of idea that the author is this tortured soul that, you know, has to find this creative, you know, and I thought reading, uh, some of your work before you said, I, I'm sure a plumber has a day where it doesn't feel like getting out of bed or, um, so you've, you've got a very methodical though.

443
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,340
And I get up, you know, I go for my morning walk.

444
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,199
I write from five 30 to 10 30.

445
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,760
Your process is your process.

446
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,380
And you just say it is, is turning up like everyone else does.

447
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,260
Yeah.

448
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,380
I don't see what's so special about it.

449
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:16,219
Listen, it's, it's a job.

450
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:16,860
It's a job.

451
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:21,199
I'm very grateful to have, you know, thank you readers.

452
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:21,559
Thank you.

453
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:30,860
Booksellers thank you fate or whatever, but I, I treat it like a job, which, which I think me means for me, what it means for most people.

454
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,519
I treat it with respect, you know, uh, I'm lucky to have it.

455
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:37,719
And, and so I.

456
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,739
I treat it with respect, but I don't think it's any big deal that I show up in the morning for work.

457
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:47,360
Uh, I love your, uh, humble perspective on that.

458
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:54,360
Uh, we see leaders in now really conscious of how they positively impact others in their environment, their direct environment.

459
00:37:54,360 --> 00:38:00,860
As an author, you, you obviously spend a fair amount of time, you know, writing on your own, but you only have to look at your work.

460
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:05,960
We mentioned the impact of your videos and, you know, a quarter of a billion people downloading them.

461
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,760
That's that's serious, positive impact.

462
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,559
In the world that you're passionate about.

463
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:13,420
Have you, have you thought about that and, and how you impact others positively?

464
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:19,340
You know, when, when I first start working on a manuscript, I don't think about anybody.

465
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:36,360
I write very fast and I'm just enjoying myself as you know, I usually write, I don't know, 10 to 14 drafts, maybe probably by the end of the day, as I get later in that process, then I'm only thinking about the reader.

466
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,659
I'm only thinking of.

467
00:38:37,659 --> 00:38:38,960
What the impact will be.

468
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,960
You know, and I, and I try to be very aware of it.

469
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:48,260
Um, as I get a little older, uh, I think I get more concerned about that.

470
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:52,260
You know, w what's the reader going to think?

471
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:58,760
Am, am I bringing the reader into these worlds, into the drug world or the cop world or the mob world?

472
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,900
Um, in a way that lets them see it from the inside.

473
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:07,559
You know, it's, it's one thing to.

474
00:39:07,659 --> 00:39:08,860
Talk about immigration.

475
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:14,059
It's another thing to see it through the eyes of a 10 year old boy on a train coming up from central America.

476
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:17,260
It's one thing to talk about the opioid crisis.

477
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:21,760
It's another thing to spend months with a 26 year old heroin addicted woman.

478
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:32,659
Um, so I, I, I'm really aware of, of trying to let the reader see that world through the character's eyes, see it from the inside out as maybe a better way of putting it.

479
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:37,559
And in that regard, I hope they see some of these issues and.

480
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:39,260
Some of this world a little differently.

481
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,860
It sounds very pretentious as it's coming out of my mouth.

482
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:50,260
I mean, at the end of the day, you know, I'm, I'm a crime fiction writer, you know, I, I hope I write entertaining, you know, suspenseful books.

483
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:52,760
But you do write in a unique way.

484
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,159
And I think you articulated that, uh, beautifully.

485
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,360
And I, and I, you know, reading, there is a, you know, a consciousness.

486
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:07,360
I think you, you separate your politics a little bit from your crime writing, but occasionally it feels as though in, in some of, uh, the, the, the, the

487
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:15,659
monologues that come out of your characters, that does that tend to creep in occasionally where you get some messages through that, uh, that you've been wanting to pass on.

488
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:18,760
I think creep in would be an accurate description.

489
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:22,059
I have what I call the 80, 20 rule.

490
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:30,059
Maybe, you know, this rule that, uh, if you behave yourself 80% of the time, you can misbehave 20% of the time.

491
00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:35,559
And so 80% of the time I'm behaving myself as a crime fiction novelist.

492
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,059
20% of the time.

493
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:43,559
I might be sneaking some of these opinions in through my character's mouth or, or in their thoughts.

494
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:43,760
Yeah.

495
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:44,760
I love it.

496
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:55,260
We see a dimension of leadership, uh, that is consistent with, with, uh, a range of leaders that they really consciously think about how they create and share their vision.

497
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:04,059
And I, and I say that in, in your writing, but also in your activism, how do you go, how have you gone about creating and sharing your vision, your vision actively?

498
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:06,860
Well, I, I think you've seen it, you know, it's, it's with.

499
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:07,860
We can get.

500
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,260
I think we should get out there.

501
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,860
And this is why I was so keen on asking Shane.

502
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:28,159
And I, on those videos and in those tweets, you know, we, we agree on certain issues that we think we should get out there and that we can get out there in plain and simple language and sometimes harsh language, you know, just, just talking

503
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:33,659
to people the way that you would, you would talk to them on the street, you know, let's, let's stop clowning around.

504
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,860
Let's not talk around the issues.

505
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,260
Let.

506
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:42,260
them and to them. I think that's useful. I think that's the way that people want to be talked to,

507
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:48,679
you know, and I wish that our politicians perhaps were doing a bit more of that.

508
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:56,639
You know, in terms of the books, again, it's important to me to get the reader close to the

509
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:02,400
characters and to take them into a world that they probably couldn't otherwise get into,

510
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:09,360
you know, and show them what that world is like. And I think that that, if we're going to talk

511
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:16,199
about issues, has changed some minds. Don, we're seeing leaders, the term curiosity is a common

512
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:22,500
word that we're hearing and, you know, I look at your life and as you said, I was compelled to write

513
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:29,199
the Cartel series, not out of commercial gain or an opportunity for my career. The curiosity of

514
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:32,380
wanting to find out about what happened led you to this part.

515
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,480
And I think that's a common trait and then, you know, through curiosity, you know, a lot of leaders

516
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,420
are then developing their own learning and their own development through that lens. Does that

517
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:49,440
resonate with you? Yeah, no, absolutely. You know, after that massacre, I couldn't get my head

518
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,940
wrapped around it. You know, how could something like that happen at that time, whether I had no

519
00:42:54,940 --> 00:43:01,960
interest in or knowledge of the drug world? You know, it was just like, how did we get here?

520
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:10,639
You know, who would do this and why? I started by reading philosophy books. What is evil? The

521
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:15,780
problem of evil? There were no answers for me there. So I went back to history and to journalism

522
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:22,960
and to documents and pretty soon, you know, sort of a mosaic, I suppose, started to form and patterns

523
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:31,760
started to form. That's how really, you know, I approach most of my writing is to see, you know,

524
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,699
how does that work and how do these patterns come together? And then can we show these patterns

525
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:43,559
in a fictional way? It's amazing juncture in your life, isn't it? Because as you said, it wasn't as

526
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:49,519
though that was something you intended to follow, but a big portion of your life now has been

527
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:54,039
understanding this. And then I look at that and think of your impact in really challenging this

528
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:59,619
narrative around the war on drugs and the craziness of it and the damage that's been done by that term

529
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:02,380
and what's evolved from there. Is it?

530
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,820
It's a brilliant part of your story. A lot of leaders, and we speak to leaders in sport, Don,

531
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:12,199
and industry as well, but I'm fascinated in this. They really are conscious about how they

532
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:17,300
communicate with clarity. That's what you do. You communicate in a way that is brilliant,

533
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:23,380
sometimes in its simplicity. You know, I've got the city on fire in my hands. It's a gift to be

534
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:29,539
able to get the words out the way you do. I mean, was that something at a young age you knew you

535
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:32,000
had, or is that a skill that's got better and better with age?

536
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,380
I hope it's gotten better with age. It'd be sad if it went the other way.

537
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:48,440
No, listen, I would hope that for any of us in whatever field, you know, that maybe athletics

538
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:56,079
isn't so because the body is the body, you know. At some point it gives out. But I think that we

539
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:02,380
get better at our craft, you know. I think maybe with some of the things that we've done in the

540
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:11,559
some age comes that wisdom that very often less is more. That silence, in my case, it being white

541
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:19,079
space on a page as opposed to black space on a page, has its own kind of power, you know.

542
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:29,159
So, yeah, I'm very aware of that. Again, probably in later drafts, you know. I just went through it

543
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,380
just minutes ago, you know. I was looking at a sentence and I went, you know, I'm going to do

544
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:39,139
Do I really need those words? They're not really doing anything. You know, my saying to myself is

545
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:45,500
that no one freeloads in this house, you know. Every word has to either pay rent or at least

546
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:51,199
do the dishes or take the garbage out, you know. Or if not, it has to go.

547
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,300
And you can see that if you look up Don Winslow on Twitter and, you know, as I said, have a look

548
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:02,280
at the succinct language, direct. It's confronting. It's, you know, it's

549
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:02,380
brilliant. It's, you know, it's, you know, it's, you know, it's, you know, it's, you know,

550
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:11,059
at times when you take on your political, you know, power and go after, you know, the Trump

551
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:17,840
craziness, I'd call it. So that, as you said, that's a conscious, specific use of your skill

552
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:22,699
set in that way too, isn't it, in terms of how you communicate? Is it different clearly to the

553
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:28,320
way you write? Yeah, they're two different things. You know, look, these right-wingers are bullies,

554
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,239
man. You know, they're so tough. They talk so...

555
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:39,280
tough until someone punches them in the nose, you know, and then they go running to teach her.

556
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:52,880
I have no problem doing it, you know. They're not good people. I really am a gentle guy. I

557
00:46:52,880 --> 00:47:00,679
almost never raise my voice. But, you know, I think when I started in researching the drug

558
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:02,360
thing, I got angrier and angrier.

559
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:08,760
I got angrier and angrier about what I learned. At a later point in my life, during the Trump

560
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:16,599
administration, it was impossible not to be angry on a daily basis. You know, this guy calling my

561
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:25,280
friends and neighbors rapists and thieves and murderers. This guy making fun, mocking a disabled

562
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:31,480
reporter, mocking a war hero. These are the least of his sins, you know.

563
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:40,320
It was impossible not to be angry. So, yeah, sometimes people call me an angry guy. They say

564
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:45,800
that your language is harsh or it's too tough. And I say, well, we have to be tough. This has

565
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:54,179
been an existential moment in democracy. And it's incumbent upon us to stand up and fight.

566
00:47:55,179 --> 00:48:00,760
Yeah, interesting transition to the last dimension I wanted to talk to you about of leadership,

567
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Don. And that is the idea that...

568
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:07,639
Leaders now really seek out collaboration. It's the opposite of what we're seeing in the Trump

569
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:13,699
era, which is extreme hierarchy and closing down collaboration, having these small, you know,

570
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:21,059
almost family office. No one could penetrate that to get maybe a common sense. And we have this

571
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:26,639
feel that when leaders do collaborate, you do end up with a broader sense of opinion and you can

572
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:32,179
debate what is real and what is not real in a much stronger way. I mean, how important is it,

573
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:37,840
as an author who's written so many books so successfully, how does collaboration fit into

574
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:43,539
your world? Well, in a number of ways, you know, I've collaborated on a couple of screenplays,

575
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:49,460
again, with my buddy Shane and the ideas that flow back and forth. Even the debates and the

576
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:54,639
arguments are extremely important. I'm a big believer in the battleground of ideas, you know,

577
00:48:54,679 --> 00:49:00,860
check your ego at the door and let the best idea win. And that will be the best for everybody.

578
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,059
In the long run,

579
00:49:02,179 --> 00:49:06,719
the other sort of collaboration, though, that's important in my life is almost a silent

580
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:12,440
collaboration. And that's with my predecessors and my colleagues. And that's in terms of reading,

581
00:49:13,179 --> 00:49:18,380
you know, reading Shakespeare, reading the great Greek and Roman classics,

582
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:25,639
reading the great writers in my genre, both past and present. There is a, you know, I get those

583
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:32,059
ideas. I hear that great writing. I hear that poetry in that writing. And so, in a sense,

584
00:49:32,179 --> 00:49:39,280
you know, all of my work has been a collaboration with those great people. I've received great

585
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:46,400
gifts from them, you know, and I hope likewise, maybe some, it'd be a great hope of mine, you know,

586
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:53,159
that maybe some young writers read my stuff and maybe, maybe get some ideas, you know,

587
00:49:53,179 --> 00:49:58,559
and some techniques. And so there's a collaboration, I think, among writers that's not

588
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,059
so often spoken as it is.

589
00:50:02,179 --> 00:50:07,059
it's mutually read. Does that make any sense? It does indeed. I haven't really thought of it

590
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:13,699
in that way, Don. It's a brilliant understanding and I suppose respect for, as you said, your

591
00:50:13,699 --> 00:50:20,000
colleagues, predecessors and your peers. And I've got no doubt your work inspires many, many

592
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,619
currently and many, many more in the future. I'm going to ask you the question. I'm waiting for

593
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:30,860
the eye roll, which I'm sure is going to come, but I can't help but do it anyway. What are you

594
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:37,840
reading? Can you recommend a couple of books that we just have to read as someone who's clearly

595
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:44,159
read voraciously across your life? What are the couple of books we just have to read?

596
00:50:45,139 --> 00:50:49,219
Well, you know, you should be reading one of your own guys, Daryl McTierney. We should be reading,

597
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:54,679
oh my God, Adrian McKinty. What am I reading right now? You're going to be very surprised

598
00:50:54,679 --> 00:51:00,320
by it, I think. I just finished Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen.

599
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:05,460
Yeah. And you hadn't read it before?

600
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:09,480
I had not. Now, this is a sad confession.

601
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:19,159
It might make me some enemies. I tried to read Austen earlier in my life and couldn't do it. I

602
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:23,619
couldn't get through the first few pages, but oddly enough, I have no way of explaining this,

603
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:30,320
by the way. In the past couple of years, I have read Austen and thoroughly enjoyed it and gotten

604
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:30,840
a lot out of it. I've read a lot of it. I've read a lot of it. I've read a lot of it. I've read a lot of it.

605
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:31,300
I've read a lot of it. I've read a lot of it. I've read a lot of it. I've read a lot of it.

606
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,960
So, I don't know how to explain that.

607
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:39,079
And do you flip from fiction to nonfiction? Are you reading other crime writers regularly?

608
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:47,719
Yeah. There's a lot of people I read and I often hesitate to come out with names. I don't want to

609
00:51:47,719 --> 00:51:53,860
inadvertently offend somebody because there are so many. I mean, our genre is so strong. It is so

610
00:51:53,860 --> 00:52:00,239
strong and so many terrific writers. But yeah, listen, I go back to the people that you probably

611
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:00,840
expect me to read. I go back to the people that you probably expect me to read. I go back to the

612
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:06,119
people that you probably expect me to go back to, you know, Elmore Leonard, of course, Raymond

613
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:12,079
Chandler, Charles Willifer, the McDonald's, you know, maybe the people that you'd expect me to.

614
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:21,659
But I also go back to George Eliot, you know, and those folks. And I get a lot out of that. And,

615
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:27,460
you know, when it's a Sunday afternoon and it's raining and I just want to lay on the couch,

616
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:30,380
I'll often just pick up the collected works of Shakespeare.

617
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,320
Open it at random and read for a while.

618
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:40,460
Yeah. Fascinating insight into where your passion comes from. But asking these questions of

619
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:46,280
everyone that I've spoken to, as I said, through the lens of leadership,

620
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,559
who's been the greatest leader in your life?

621
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:54,960
I'm unclear whether you mean sort of political leaders that have been in everyone's life

622
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,139
and that I particularly admire or specific people in my life.

623
00:52:59,139 --> 00:53:00,780
Well, I like that there was a pause there, Don.

624
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:07,440
And because it's really what that question means to you. I mean, it could be around home. It could

625
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:13,719
be from, we've had people talk about exactly that, great political influences, but also people talk

626
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:20,360
about within their own family. So a bit of think music, but yeah, where did your mind go instinctively?

627
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:28,000
Well, it went to Bobby Kennedy. Bobby Kennedy's murder was childhood's end for me.

628
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,599
I thought about Nelson,

629
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:36,519
Mandela, because I've spent a lot of time in Africa and in South Africa during the bad old

630
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:48,960
days. Personally in my life, man, I've had such great teachers. My junior year in high school

631
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,420
English teacher who threw me out of her English class, but made me come and have tutorials with

632
00:53:54,420 --> 00:54:00,719
her at lunch every day. She really taught me how to read. And by the way,

633
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:11,679
she ate my lunch every day. A biology teacher, Bill McEnany, with whom I'm still dear, dear friends,

634
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:19,659
80 something, who also taught jazz and introduced me to jazz, which has been a major influence in my

635
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:26,139
life. In college, a guy named Pete Maslovsky, I eventually wrote a nonfiction book with him,

636
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,239
you know, who taught me so much. So,

637
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:35,179
again, you know, I've been very lucky, very blessed in my life to have those people.

638
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:40,280
I love the range. I love you celebrating teachers and educators. It's something that we've tried to

639
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:45,739
do a lot. We think it's underappreciated, the life-changing moments, isn't it? Just as you said,

640
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:50,920
you know, an English teacher at that young age has taught you how to read. As someone who's

641
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,619
gone on to do what you do, that is life-changing. I've got to go back. I'm going to ask you about

642
00:54:54,619 --> 00:54:59,900
Bobby Kennedy. You described it as the end of your childhood, and my history won't be anywhere near

643
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:00,679
as good as yours.

644
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:06,880
How many years after JFK was Bobby murdered, and why was that so impactful?

645
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:10,599
Well, let me see. It would have been, what, five years?

646
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,679
Five years later, yeah.

647
00:55:12,139 --> 00:55:16,000
You know, I was a small child when John Kennedy was assassinated. I certainly

648
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,099
remembered it as being traumatic. I grew up in an Irish Catholic neighborhood,

649
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:28,840
and I mean, people were out in the streets sobbing, you know, when John Kennedy was killed.

650
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,679
I was a bit too young to understand it.

651
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:37,480
But by the time Bobby came around, you know, we'd already, we were in Vietnam. I was in high

652
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:44,079
school. We were pretty much waiting to be drafted to go to Vietnam. Martin Luther King had been

653
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:51,880
assassinated. We had riots in the streets, and Bobby Kennedy was out there, you know,

654
00:55:52,460 --> 00:56:00,059
leading in a very personal kind of a way, in a very risky, obviously, sadly, risky

655
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:06,239
kind of a way. And so it was sort of the first awareness I had of being political

656
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:14,679
and supporting someone like that and admiring someone like that. And I actually was with the

657
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:20,320
daughter of one of his campaign managers. I was working at a theater far from my home and

658
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:26,679
staying with this actor and actress. And her father was one of Bobby's campaign managers

659
00:56:26,679 --> 00:56:30,599
in California, was present at all of that. And I remember waking up in the morning,

660
00:56:30,739 --> 00:56:30,840
hearing Bobby's voice, and I was like, oh, my God, I'm going to die. I'm going to die.

661
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:36,820
And I remember hearing screaming. And it was about Bobby being shot. This woman was concerned

662
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:44,059
whether her father was safe or not. And it was, it was the end of innocence, you know. And I think

663
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:50,079
that I entered into a phase of my life that was very cynical, you know, and it took a long time

664
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:55,440
to shed that. It's interesting, isn't it? We always think our time is the most tumultuous and

665
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,719
clearly, you know, what's happening in the world, in your part of the world is unprecedented and

666
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:04,940
new types of challenges. But, you know, as you described that, again, you think of,

667
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:09,380
you know, President Kennedy assassinated and then what Bobby Kennedy was doing.

668
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:15,460
No doubt you can imagine what that would have been like in your world at that particular stage.

669
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:19,519
We're really big, Don, in this world of collaboration and collaborating with different

670
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:25,179
people and the coming together of ideas. If you could collaborate with one person in the world,

671
00:57:25,179 --> 00:57:30,699
and you mentioned a love of jazz music, you mentioned clearly, you know, from a writer's

672
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:33,500
perspective, but is there any name that springs to mind?

673
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:40,059
Well, listen, I mean, Bruce Springsteen, you know, I think the greatest American poet since Walt

674
00:57:40,059 --> 00:57:47,440
Whitman, who wrote and writes songs that are very evocative for me in my life. I came from a,

675
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:52,099
if you will, a Springsteen sort of beach town, you know, that's where I come from and where I

676
00:57:52,099 --> 00:58:00,280
live now half the year and where City of Fire is set. Now, it would be a total fantasy, you know,

677
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:00,699
to collect. But I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great idea.

678
00:58:00,699 --> 00:58:04,260
With Springsteen, I don't see that happen, but that's certainly one name.

679
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:11,820
Well, you already have, Don. So many people are so humble, they even overlook that. I mean,

680
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:16,760
what was that process like? I mean, one of the videos, it was the streets of Philadelphia and

681
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:20,980
you have to get approval, don't you? I mean, for Springsteen's work. I mean,

682
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:24,860
how hard was that to get the boss on board with that?

683
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,840
Remarkably easy. I mean, I was amazed. I was shocked.

684
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:37,599
But, you know, we got to some of his people, as they say, and then they showed him the rough

685
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:43,800
footage of the video and the text of the video. And he said right away, yep, I'm on board and

686
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:48,840
here you can use Philadelphia. Hey, Don, it's been a great pleasure,

687
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,840
great insight. For those listening, I'm holding a copy of Don's book, City of Fire,

688
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:59,699
his latest work, A Master, it says, superb, Stephen King, beautifully written, propulsive,

689
00:58:59,699 --> 00:59:05,219
authentic page turner. I hope you've got an insight into the person Don Winslow is by listening

690
00:59:05,219 --> 00:59:11,900
to this and see the integrity, see the sense of purpose, but you'll be overjoyed, I think,

691
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:18,940
when you read his work because it is a masterpiece. His words are incredible. And Don, I've loved

692
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:23,380
catching up with you. Thanks for sharing some time with us today and look forward to following

693
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:29,079
you with great interest. Thank you, man. I really enjoyed it. And yeah, the next time you come to

694
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:29,539
the States.

695
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:31,519
Look us up. We'll hang out.

696
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:35,280
Love to do that. I reckon that'd be a lot of fun, Don. I'll be looking over my shoulder in an

697
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:42,260
alleyway, I think. But I'd love to experience that. Thanks again. It's been awesome.

698
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:43,940
Thank you very much.
