00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:06,209
I'm sure you're going to enjoy this week's episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast

2
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:08,410
with the remarkable Donna Urquhart.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,970
She's not a professional athlete.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:15,529
She simply started walking her child in a pram that turned into a deep love of running

5
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:22,089
that now sees her attempting to complete a world record ultra marathon across Antarctica.

6
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:26,969
Donna is also a professor and expert in the world of pain research.

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,289
And she explains in this chat, the way we think about pain is being looked at

8
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:33,890
in a completely different way.

9
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:39,229
Donna explains that we now know the brain makes choices around how we interpret pain.

10
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:45,390
Donna has a huge passion to inspire the next generation of young females to stay in sport.

11
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:49,229
She believes that we need to teach our young girls the mental skills

12
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:53,530
and the resilience that will help more of them stay in sport for longer.

13
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,170
A really inspiring story.

14
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:58,969
People like Donna Urquhart who inspire the work we do at Alita,

15
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,329
in particular, our Alita Connect program.

16
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:07,450
And we're super passionate about facilitating groups of five to six people around the globe.

17
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,269
You don't have to be attempting a Guinness World Record like Donna to be part of Alita Connect.

18
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,430
Head to alitacollective.com to check out our programs.

19
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,310
Huge thanks to the team at Temper, a mattress like no other.

20
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:21,510
We know success leaves clues.

21
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,450
And one of the key elements to that is having a good night's sleep.

22
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:29,549
And people like Donna Urquhart who are attempting world records like this

23
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,310
understand the value of great sleep.

24
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,969
So thank you as always to the team at Temper.

25
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:45,859
Donna Urquhart is an ultramarathon runner, physiotherapist and pain scientist

26
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:49,420
aiming to set a polar ultramarathon record in December this year

27
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,620
at Union Glacier in Antarctica by running 1,300 kilometres over 30 days.

28
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,719
Donna and her team are leaving for Antarctica on the 11th of December 2023.

29
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,060
See Donna take a deep breath. It's not far away.

30
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,920
Her mission is to show what humans are capable of while raising $1.5 million

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,580
to support the next generation of young females

32
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,120
who are alarmingly dropping out of sport at a rate of 50%

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,800
in the age bracket of 15 to 19 years of age.

34
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,139
We know this then leads to a range of health issues,

35
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,099
increase in stress, lack of confidence, anxiety,

36
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,360
many body image related challenges and more.

37
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,199
Run Antarctica is a world first Guinness World Records attempt

38
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:35,659
by Donna Urquhart to complete the longest ultramarathon in polar region history.

39
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:37,580
Donna, great to see you.

40
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,020
Hi Luke, thank you very much for having me on.

41
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,979
What a huge effort you're about to undertake.

42
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:48,860
You're an associate professor at Monash University specialising in pain management.

43
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,819
What you're about to do is pretty crazy and there's some pain coming your way.

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,159
What are you hoping to teach us?

45
00:02:55,539 --> 00:03:00,020
Well, I'm certainly a pain specialist and I will certainly be

46
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,840
experiencing a little bit of pain in the next month.

47
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,199
Look, I'm really keen to get over to Antarctica.

48
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:13,300
Attempt this record and really learn myself about what's involved physically

49
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,719
and mentally going through an endurance challenge like this.

50
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:20,639
You know, I've never experienced something like this before

51
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,680
and this is a huge dream for me.

52
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,280
So really to experience it and learn it and then come back here

53
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,199
and I guess impart those physical and mental skills that I've learnt,

54
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,520
particularly to young girls who tend to drop out of sport in their

55
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,419
teenage years.

56
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,560
Donna, a lot of us spend a lot of time trying to avoid pain.

57
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,419
Is learning to deal with a bit of pain in your mind a healthy thing for us?

58
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,460
Yeah, I think so.

59
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,560
Look, I have certainly experienced, I've been running ultra marathons now

60
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,039
for 10 years and when I first started, I was really fearful of pain

61
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,139
and I started with small amounts of running and gradually built up

62
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,500
and I still remember I went and did.

63
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:13,199
I did a 100 kilometre event and at the end of that 100 kilometres,

64
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,060
I was like, oh my gosh, I couldn't actually take another step.

65
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,220
I am so sore and so exhausted and I found myself six months later

66
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,620
rocking up to a 24-hour event and thinking, my gosh,

67
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,800
that 100 kilometres will take me halfway through that 24-hour event.

68
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,860
How am I possibly going to go on after that?

69
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,439
And it was incredible.

70
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,240
I stopped.

71
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,519
I was incredibly sore and what I found was that I saw other people

72
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,939
on the track and I saw other people still continuing,

73
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,720
whether they were walking or running and I thought, well, look,

74
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,040
maybe I can go a little bit further and I did and I learnt that I could

75
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,199
actually still function and still do things with that discomfort

76
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,660
and we actually find that with our pain research and I'm a physio

77
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,560
and I work with patients and what we do find,

78
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:11,819
is that pain is not necessarily a message to stop,

79
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:16,060
that we can actually do a hell of a lot still when we're in discomfort.

80
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:18,040
You did an interesting study, I read, Donna,

81
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,079
with ultramarathon runners and putting your hand in a freezing bucket of ice.

82
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:22,740
Tell us about that.

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,740
Yeah, so we did a really interesting study where we took 20 ultramarathon runners

84
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,699
and 20 controls and we asked them to do what's called a cold presser test.

85
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:37,040
So they needed to put their hand in icy cold water,

86
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,399
which I can tell you, Luke, as soon as you put your hand in,

87
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,720
you want to take it out of it, out of that water as quickly as you can

88
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,759
and, yeah, we asked them to rate their pain during the time.

89
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,259
At the end, we found that the ultramarathon runners

90
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,819
could actually keep their hand in longer and they rated their pain less as well

91
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:02,459
compared to the healthy controls and essentially that says

92
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:06,379
that the ultramarathon runners had a greater pain tolerance.

93
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:06,720
They could...

94
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,519
They could manage the pain better.

95
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,800
But we also asked the question,

96
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,279
could psychological factors have an influence there?

97
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,819
And we found that, in fact,

98
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,259
the ultramarathon runners had less fear and anxiety around the pain.

99
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:24,439
That was what we call a cross-sectional study.

100
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,620
So we just took the measures at one point in time.

101
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,620
So we can't necessarily talk about what's the chicken or the egg.

102
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,639
You know, do they have less anxiety and fear to begin with?

103
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,360
Or is it potentially something they develop?

104
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:44,740
But there are certainly studies that show that if you take athletes

105
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,540
and you take them and measure them across a season of training,

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,199
that their pain tolerance does improve.

107
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,019
So it's suggesting that you can actually improve your pain tolerance over time.

108
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,040
And I have certainly experienced that anecdotally

109
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,180
with my experience in ultramarathon running

110
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,019
is that I feel like I have less fear and anxiety around that.

111
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:12,279
And I certainly have been able to increase the distances

112
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:15,740
and the challenges I set myself because of that.

113
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,500
Oh, I think we'd all relate to that, isn't it?

114
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,759
That once you find that capacity within yourself,

115
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,100
you are less fearful next time and you can potentially go further

116
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,379
in whatever discipline it could be.

117
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:27,379
And I think of the parenting lens in this, Donna, to me,

118
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,779
I feel like, you know, in 2023, we've got a generation as parents,

119
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:34,660
I'm a parent of four, where we want to try and avoid

120
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,860
any form of pain or discomfort for our kids.

121
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,920
It's because it breaks our heart.

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,139
We don't want them to be sad or don't want them to not get invited

123
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:44,519
to a party at school, or we don't want them to miss out on something.

124
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:49,120
And so we climb all over the top of them to avoid that pain.

125
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:52,779
It's well-meaning, but I feel like we're teaching a whole generation

126
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:56,019
that, do you know what, don't push through at all.

127
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:58,740
Is that something that you see as well?

128
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,259
Yeah, like the helicopter parenting that you're talking about.

129
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,740
And look, I think that feeds into part of our Run Antarctic approach,

130
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:13,360
that sport is such an incredible medium for young people

131
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,660
to learn about the challenges of life.

132
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,040
Like, they learn about losing, they learn about their own expectations,

133
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,399
about being part of a team.

134
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:23,959
There's so much that they learn.

135
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,339
So putting them in that environment, I think, is just an incredible way

136
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:32,480
for them to learn that, and we can step back from that.

137
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,299
The only thing that we see through our project

138
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:36,840
and through the Run Antarctic project,

139
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,379
and through the charity that we have established,

140
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:43,100
is that we feel that kids can actually be provided

141
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,600
with the appropriate mental and coping skills.

142
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,279
So they have skills to draw on during those challenges in sport.

143
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,320
And as you know, Donna, and the work you're doing,

144
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,639
I love in this area that the numbers I mentioned in the intro there,

145
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,500
50% of girls 15 to 19 are quitting sport,

146
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,620
and the health outcomes are at a rate of 2 to 1 for boys around the same age.

147
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,620
And we know that girls that compete in sports,

148
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,320
sport, their body image is much healthier than those that don't.

149
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,019
And you can, the list goes on and on.

150
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,820
And you and I both live in a city where, you know,

151
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,120
teenage girls were out of school for two years through the COVID period,

152
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,840
which set off a whole heap of other, you know, dramatic challenges.

153
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,580
And we literally took them away from those things,

154
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,740
whether they wanted to or not.

155
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,460
Are you seeing that even more alarming given what's happened there?

156
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,600
Yeah, absolutely.

157
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,179
Look,

158
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:41,940
that's part of the reason that I'm doing this run is I think doing a run

159
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,559
like this creates a lot of attention and it actually provides us with a

160
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,559
platform to raise awareness of this issue.

161
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,279
And I certainly have seen it personally.

162
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,700
I'm heavily involved in community sport through my family and I've spent,

163
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:02,419
you know, every weekend I'm at basketball courts and at tournaments.

164
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:06,159
And one thing that has struck me over the last five years,

165
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:08,340
is just sitting watching.

166
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,600
And I've been at tournaments where virtually every game a child has come off

167
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,679
and they're either in tears, head in their hands,

168
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,220
banging the bench,

169
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,840
just really emotional or frustrated with something in particular that has

170
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,259
happened.

171
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,580
And it just struck me that we teach them such incredible physical skills,

172
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,580
like, you know,

173
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,879
how to perfect a kick in football,

174
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:39,360
or how to shoot a three-pointer or whatever it might be.

175
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:40,279
But,

176
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,080
you know,

177
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:47,139
there's such a opportunity to teach them coping skills of how to deal with

178
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,620
those various challenges sports provide.

179
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,360
Yeah,

180
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,240
struck on a great passion.

181
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,559
Rod Campbell did this podcast with me.

182
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,779
He's created a learning life through sport.

183
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:57,340
I think it's,

184
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,639
you're doing this in a beautiful way as well.

185
00:10:59,639 --> 00:10:59,940
And I,

186
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,159
you know,

187
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,700
spent a big part of the last 20 years in junior sport with the four kids and

188
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,200
you,

189
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,159
the responsibility,

190
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:11,399
to make it as welcoming and as appropriate for everyone,

191
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,539
whatever ability levels,

192
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,120
it's huge,

193
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,519
isn't it?

194
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,039
If you want kids to be able to see that as their happy and safe place,

195
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:20,240
it's going to be challenging for them at times,

196
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,000
but you know,

197
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,559
we know what happens when they drop out.

198
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,200
We know we train them back to the screens.

199
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,580
And,

200
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:25,860
you know,

201
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,679
particularly as you said,

202
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,299
for young,

203
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:29,679
it seems a lot more complicated in some ways for young girls,

204
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,700
it seems a lot more challenging as the numbers would suggest.

205
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,940
And is that where your passion for this has come from?

206
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,580
Yeah,

207
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,379
I'm shocked that the numbers are that significant.

208
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:40,980
Like,

209
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,279
you know,

210
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,419
I have two nieces,

211
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:45,139
which I adore and they both love their sport.

212
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,360
They're both still in primary school,

213
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:52,460
but the stats show that one of them will not continue sport and will not be

214
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,940
playing sport in their,

215
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,240
you know,

216
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,500
16 and above,

217
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,919
which I think is just really unfortunate.

218
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,480
Like we know the incredible benefits of sport,

219
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:02,960
you know,

220
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,460
you and I have experienced them,

221
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,460
the physical benefit,

222
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,039
just to our mental health,

223
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,960
the friendships and the social connection that you have through your sport.

224
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,259
And for girls to be losing that so young,

225
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:17,440
I think is just,

226
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,340
um,

227
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,860
just really unfortunate.

228
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,500
And,

229
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:20,779
you know,

230
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:22,360
I also speak from myself,

231
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,620
sport has been such an incredible vehicle for my life.

232
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,220
And yeah,

233
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,580
if we can keep girls in sport,

234
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,659
if they can feel valued in a sporting environment,

235
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:35,279
and you probably,

236
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,279
no doubt through your sporting background,

237
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:43,019
have experienced perhaps support from mental skills,

238
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,460
coaches or sports psychologists of,

239
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,080
you know,

240
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,240
how you can incorporate mental imagery and self-talk and,

241
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,320
and all those skills that help you deal with challenges on the sporting field.

242
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:55,799
You know,

243
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,019
imagine if girl,

244
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:01,559
young girls and potentially young boys who there is also a high dropout rate,

245
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,320
if they can be taught those at a young age,

246
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,399
they go along to training,

247
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,419
they learn how to kick a football,

248
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:17,279
but a component of their training session is about how to incorporate visualisation or how to learn their value in a team.

249
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,440
Imagine how incredible that would be for them to learn those in a sporting environment.

250
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:22,919
Yeah.

251
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,220
And they're not difficult to teach and you can incorporate them.

252
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,059
Absolutely.

253
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:27,840
If that's your,

254
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,220
your mission to do it,

255
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,519
you know,

256
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,600
the hyper competitiveness,

257
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,139
sometimes a junior sport takes over the desire to actually make it healthy for kids.

258
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:35,340
And I,

259
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,620
I'm thinking of Sienna,

260
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,559
our daughter is 18 now,

261
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,419
but you know,

262
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,639
what was she 14,

263
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,059
15 in the lockdown period?

264
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:47,440
And she was a rower and they were doing ergos on the screen and she hated it,

265
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,659
hated it because the part that she loved was the team part,

266
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:52,480
being on the water,

267
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,360
being in a boat.

268
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,879
And you took all that away and only got the pain part,

269
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,019
ergos of pain and none of the connection.

270
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:03,120
And you could just see how delicate that was around.

271
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,019
I may quit.

272
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:05,080
I may not do this.

273
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,019
And fortunately,

274
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:06,580
luckily,

275
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:07,460
you know,

276
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,399
she did and life changing,

277
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,320
life changing to go back and have that discipline to get up.

278
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,700
And,

279
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:13,659
but we've lost,

280
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,440
I feel like a generation who didn't quite get through and,

281
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,259
and we're not talking about it because it's uncomfortable to talk about.

282
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,399
No one wants to say,

283
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,320
you know,

284
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,940
the last weeks of lockdown in the city,

285
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,460
600 teenage girls a week were getting diagnosed with an eating disorder.

286
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,019
It was a perfect storm for all this.

287
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:30,159
So again,

288
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,600
great credit to you for,

289
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,840
for going to put yourself through extreme pain and run 30,

290
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,759
1300 kilometers and a Guinness world record.

291
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,759
I couldn't be more supportive.

292
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:41,259
I think people listen to this and they say,

293
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,440
look,

294
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,460
Donna's a bit of a freak.

295
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:42,779
Like,

296
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,039
you know,

297
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:43,440
seriously,

298
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,440
no one's going to sign up for 60 Ks a day on Antarctica in freezing conditions.

299
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:52,940
People won't think that's attainable for them.

300
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,159
What are some practical ways you can teach us as a pain specialist to push

301
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:59,500
through that discomfort that we all feel?

302
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:00,340
Luke,

303
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,799
the first thing I would say is,

304
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,620
you know,

305
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:04,299
people may think that I'm crazy,

306
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:04,820
but,

307
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,720
but I just see myself as the lady that lives down the road.

308
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:10,679
Who's a neighbor or a friend,

309
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:11,460
you know,

310
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,399
I'm a mom.

311
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,559
I work in pain science and I just love running and I've loved running for,

312
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,720
for many years,

313
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,360
but really just took up running as a mom.

314
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:24,759
My son had just come along.

315
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:27,399
It was hard to get out the door to do other sports.

316
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,779
So I just threw on my runners and started walking with the pram and then jogging

317
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:32,919
and that turned into running.

318
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,580
And 10 years later,

319
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:34,960
you know,

320
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,080
I'm where I am now running ultra marathons.

321
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,639
And so I guess the first thing would be is,

322
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,059
you know,

323
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,360
I'm not a professional athlete and I don't think there's anything particularly

324
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,399
special that I bring to the table that other people don't.

325
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:54,580
I think it's just the dedication and the discipline from a pain science

326
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,120
perspective.

327
00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:00,159
I think probably my understanding of pain assists me.

328
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,500
So many years ago with respect to pain,

329
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,419
we essentially thought pain was a message from the tissues.

330
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:13,419
Like if you'd sprained your ankle and your ligament was torn,

331
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,740
a message would come from your ligament up to your brain and your brain would go,

332
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:18,980
Oh,

333
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,279
I'm feeling pain.

334
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,679
And now we understand that is very different.

335
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,259
It's not so simple.

336
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,759
It's much more complex.

337
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,779
And what happens when that message comes to the brain is that the brain pulls on

338
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:34,419
a whole lot of information from other areas,

339
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,500
so your past experiences,

340
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,559
your mood at the time,

341
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,519
what you're thinking,

342
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,779
your emotions,

343
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,320
a whole range of things go into interpreting that experience.

344
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,399
So you actually have a lot of control over how you experience pain.

345
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,179
And I think that's one of the key things that I'll be taking with me,

346
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:57,919
that I can actually have a control.

347
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,600
I have control over my experience.

348
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,420
And some people just naturally have a high threshold for pain.

349
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,779
Is that a DNA trait,

350
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,319
do you think?

351
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,599
Our oldest son,

352
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:09,779
you know,

353
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,779
maybe his brain's not fully formed,

354
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,539
I'm not sure,

355
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:16,400
but he seems to be able to cope with extreme pain,

356
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,099
you know,

357
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,619
seeing him break ankles and then continue to,

358
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,000
you know,

359
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,980
where he shouldn't be able to walk and walk home.

360
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,099
And you just don't see him complain about pain ever.

361
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,140
Part of me thinks the neuron's not working,

362
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:32,319
but he seems to just be able to cope.

363
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,500
Is that inherent in him or is it learned?

364
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:35,960
Well, good question.

365
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:41,079
Like, I guess it's that nature-nurture question again, isn't it?

366
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:45,119
And yeah, look, I think it's probably a combination of the two.

367
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,700
You might be able to speak to that in terms of the nurture aspect

368
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,059
and how you've essentially, you know,

369
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:54,160
when he's come to you with discomfort,

370
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,960
how you've responded to that,

371
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,759
because there's certainly a component of that

372
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:01,859
in how young people perceive pain.

373
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:03,099
His mother's pretty tough, though.

374
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:04,359
I'm going to put it on.

375
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:08,220
I think Bex, she likes them to get on with things.

376
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:10,619
So maybe they didn't get the reception around.

377
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,920
I think you can push on.

378
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,900
That's a good self bit of reflection there for sure.

379
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,019
I love the idea in my mind now, Donna,

380
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,859
about delayed gratification for the sense of Akita happiness.

381
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,859
It's, you know, the snooze button in the morning is always there, isn't it?

382
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:29,880
Not to get up and train for Run Antarctica or, you know,

383
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,799
you see a donut and you think that looks good.

384
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,240
I might, but no, I won't,

385
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,559
because I know it makes me feel,

386
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:37,880
shit afterwards or I could quit sport

387
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,500
because it's uncomfortable at the moment,

388
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,339
but I'm not going to.

389
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,299
I'm going to push through and go to another session

390
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:43,099
and another session.

391
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,880
Does that resonate with you that we really find freedom

392
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,000
in the discipline of delayed gratification at times?

393
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:54,019
I very much love the opportunity

394
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:57,240
and thrive in the opportunity to set a challenge

395
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,940
and especially something that scares the hell out of me,

396
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:03,180
but also excites me.

397
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,539
And I think if you've got a goal like that

398
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:08,480
and it's long-term and you're committed to that,

399
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,519
you will delay gratification for that.

400
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,240
And look, I think everyone's human

401
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,720
and that can wax and wane as you go along.

402
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,400
You know, I certainly have days where, you know,

403
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,299
I just don't want to go out for that run

404
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:25,000
and I'll procrastinate and I'll do everything under the sun

405
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,440
to stop walking out the door.

406
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:28,660
And I'll find that even though I was supposed to go

407
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,759
for a run an hour later,

408
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,119
I'm still sitting around answering emails.

409
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,200
Or you're responding to messages.

410
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,380
I'm sure, you know, when you open the door

411
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,500
to the cold storage container and truck a niner

412
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,740
in the outer suburbs of Melbourne

413
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,240
and dial it down to minus 10,

414
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,599
there must be some moments where,

415
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,380
as part of your training for this,

416
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,579
you've thought about maybe getting a second coffee.

417
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:50,240
But I love your story.

418
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:50,859
I think it's brilliant.

419
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:53,579
A pain professor, you know,

420
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,400
who's now taking on an ultramarathon record in Antarctica

421
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,440
to inspire a generation of young females

422
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,599
to live a better life.

423
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,740
It's such a brilliant thing you're undertaking.

424
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,579
In lots of ways, it's the ultimate leadership story,

425
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,819
which I'm really passionate about.

426
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,839
Have you always seen yourself as a leader?

427
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,720
Look, it's funny you ask that, Luke,

428
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:15,319
because when I started this project a year ago,

429
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:17,400
I was essentially working on my own.

430
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,740
I was tapping away at my computer,

431
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,859
researching things and very insular.

432
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:27,779
You know, I'm not an extrovert and, you know,

433
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,920
to some extent I'm a little bit shy.

434
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,920
And so it took me a long while to actually reach,

435
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,839
reach out to people and say,

436
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,640
look, this is what I want to do.

437
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,559
And to begin with, it actually started,

438
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:40,220
you know, I'd be running with a friend

439
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,140
and they'd be like, what's your next goal?

440
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:45,000
And I'd go, oh, I'm thinking about Antarctica.

441
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,460
And they'd go, oh, really?

442
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:48,980
You're going to do the marathon there,

443
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,220
which they have a 42.2K marathon in Antarctica.

444
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,180
And I'd sort of go, oh yeah, that's, that's it.

445
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:58,799
And so, yeah, look, it just, for me,

446
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,039
it was a process of starting to talk to people.

447
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,299
And I was working on my own.

448
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:08,640
It's just been incredible by reaching out to people,

449
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,480
both, you know, obviously to begin with,

450
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,640
in my network of friends and family

451
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,380
and getting used to speaking about this big dream,

452
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,900
this big audacious goal.

453
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:23,359
And then they connected me with people that I didn't know

454
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:25,920
and starting to speak to them about it.

455
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,160
And just organically people have come on board

456
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,700
and I'm just really blown away

457
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,859
and I have to pinch myself.

458
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:32,880
Sometimes I'm just like, oh, I'm going to do this.

459
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:32,980
I'm going to do this.

460
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,119
I'm going to do this.

461
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:33,160
I'm going to do this.

462
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,019
There's times that there's 15 people at last count

463
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:39,579
working behind the scenes, which just blows my mind.

464
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,599
And I'm just so grateful for that.

465
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,400
And to be honest, I don't feel like a leader.

466
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,140
I've never come on to this project thinking

467
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,980
I'm going to lead a team and we're going to go

468
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,480
and, you know, smash a world record.

469
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:58,480
It's been about, this is something I'm passionate about.

470
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:01,599
I want to help people by doing this feat.

471
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,119
And I'm going to push myself.

472
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:03,980
I'm going to put it out there.

473
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,660
And then people who that resonates with

474
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,480
have just come on board and been part of the team.

475
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:12,059
That's what I love about what we think leadership looks like

476
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:15,700
in the modern era is you don't have to be an extrovert

477
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,700
or you don't have to be loud.

478
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,839
You can do it in your beautiful way,

479
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,940
which is I want to do this.

480
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,799
And people have naturally followed because we,

481
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,160
and I say we, resonate with the story

482
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,599
and we see what's happening to young girls.

483
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:31,240
And, you know, for someone to go and put yourself

484
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,680
into those conditions, as I said,

485
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:32,920
is incredible.

486
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,480
You've obviously got a teenage daughter in sport.

487
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,240
I'd love to learn just from you for a moment,

488
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,940
like what's your experience been with having her in sport?

489
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,740
You know, is she still playing sport?

490
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:51,079
What's the journey you've had with her and the challenges?

491
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,480
Yeah, well, it's sort of a passionate sporting family

492
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,480
and her three brothers are quite passionate,

493
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,779
obsessive with their sport.

494
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:02,380
And so,

495
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,000
she was very much the same.

496
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:08,460
And can I say this sort of with pride,

497
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:11,180
but quite capable at everything she does.

498
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,319
And I always say parenting Sienna is almost

499
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:16,099
like another category to the three boys.

500
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:18,160
Like it's, I love it more than anything else,

501
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:22,039
but she's, you know, so much smarter and more complex.

502
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:24,019
But yeah, the relationship with her is brilliant.

503
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,259
So for me, it's just that, you know,

504
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:27,220
making sure you're there,

505
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:29,680
making sure when she played footy that, you know,

506
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,819
I did ask her when she was playing footy,

507
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,599
I said, would you like me to get involved in coaching?

508
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:35,660
She said, are you kidding?

509
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,079
That how embarrassing would that be?

510
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:40,299
And I said, oh, there's not a lot of things I can help me with.

511
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,599
This may be one.

512
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,160
And she said, no chance in the world.

513
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,039
And you know, she had great coaches and then she got into a world of rowing.

514
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:47,960
And, and I,

515
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,380
I was so passionate about that two year period where they were really taken away

516
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:53,880
from sport.

517
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,119
I could see the stress that was causing everything that we'd probably try and do

518
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,859
as a family to have that taken away from you.

519
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,619
I found that incredibly stressful and watching her,

520
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,140
on a screen trying to do a sport,

521
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,279
but really unhappy.

522
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:08,079
And as a lot of people were,

523
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,140
and I know that we haven't spoken about this public or not because for whatever

524
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,299
reason, everyone's moved on,

525
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:15,140
but I feel lucky she did.

526
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,440
She ended up becoming a really elite rower at school and had some great

527
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,099
experiences.

528
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:23,819
They were incredible experience to go over to the UK and win the world school

529
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:25,200
girl championship in rowing.

530
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,140
So I think that's in her,

531
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,539
she wants to study sport management,

532
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:29,000
I think.

533
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,759
And so I,

534
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,799
but delicate,

535
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:32,200
isn't it?

536
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,839
Because if,

537
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:35,019
if you had have gone the other way,

538
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:38,240
I could see the outcomes could be significantly worse.

539
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,400
So I hope her mother and I've just given her this sort of

540
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,900
base where they see everyone in our house exercises,

541
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:44,599
you know,

542
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:48,019
her mum's a yoga teacher and Pilates instructor.

543
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:50,680
So they probably see it in the house every day.

544
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:53,019
So I think that's going to be part of her for life.

545
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:55,339
And I think probably the thing that's going to keep her more healthy than

546
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:55,819
anything else,

547
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:56,240
hopefully.

548
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:56,660
So,

549
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,079
yeah,

550
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,579
I guess it comes back to that,

551
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,819
learning the benefits of sport and learning that,

552
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,819
through the family.

553
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:05,119
Yeah.

554
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:11,599
Through parents are role modeling that and through brothers also being involved.

555
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,380
And I think then,

556
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:12,799
you know,

557
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,519
don't you don't know that how you feel when you don't do it.

558
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:15,920
Yes.

559
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,240
And so it's easier to sort of,

560
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:18,200
Hey,

561
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,160
lecture and say,

562
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,119
you should be doing this.

563
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,740
But if you've got the experience of how that makes you feel like you go for a

564
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,180
run or,

565
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:25,420
you know,

566
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,759
you get that joy of being in a team and it,

567
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:28,339
you know,

568
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,519
and all the lessons you learn when it doesn't go well,

569
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:31,119
as you said,

570
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:31,619
it's a,

571
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:32,380
but yeah,

572
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,079
she was the one I was worried about in lockdown.

573
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,220
I just thought that that's tough for that,

574
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,299
that bracket.

575
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:39,160
So we're really grateful that she,

576
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,859
she stuck through and she pushed through the pain.

577
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:43,599
Like rowing is a painful sport.

578
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,000
I look at it and go,

579
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,680
I don't think I would have enjoyed that,

580
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,119
but they push themselves.

581
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:49,960
And through that,

582
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,579
you can see that has helped her and will help her in the discipline and so many

583
00:25:54,579 --> 00:25:55,759
other parts of her life.

584
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:01,059
So has there been periods where either your sons or your daughter have

585
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,339
considered stopping?

586
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:07,220
Sport or do you think it's been so inherently involved in your family that,

587
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:08,519
uh,

588
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:10,740
that hasn't really come up as such?

589
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,960
I think that lockdown period was the one where you're not getting the joy of

590
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,099
being with the team.

591
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:19,319
You're only getting the sitting in the gym on your own.

592
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:19,680
That,

593
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,960
that was the closest.

594
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,380
And then I was,

595
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,099
what do you do?

596
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:23,880
What do you say?

597
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:28,319
I never experienced that before because if you push too hard and said,

598
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:28,680
Hey,

599
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,519
go and stick it out,

600
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:30,480
get on the ergo,

601
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:32,279
she would have given me some pretty,

602
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,599
pretty quick feedback as she does have that you get out of the way.

603
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,339
Um,

604
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:39,000
so I felt really helpless.

605
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,519
It's just like,

606
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:40,619
I hope she stays at it.

607
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:42,420
I hope she doesn't lose her passion for it.

608
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,200
Hope she,

609
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,220
yeah.

610
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,400
That,

611
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,779
and maybe you're seeing again,

612
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:49,019
the example of everyone else still sticking at it and training,

613
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:50,099
but yeah,

614
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:53,519
you hope whatever level it is recreationally or,

615
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,619
um,

616
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,960
there's a routine that it's part of their life for good with a bit of luck.

617
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,559
Yeah.

618
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:58,859
Yeah.

619
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:02,160
And I think it comes back to also being valued.

620
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,079
In a sporting environment.

621
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:04,799
I think,

622
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,059
you know,

623
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:11,019
you just look at some of the reasons why kids drop out of sport and one is

624
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:14,819
around that value piece of not necessarily feeling valued.

625
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:19,819
And I think our Australian sporting infrastructure can be driven to sort of

626
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,000
funnel into a high performance,

627
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:26,480
sporting pathway.

628
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,160
And so if you're not necessarily on that pathway,

629
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,720
there can be the sense of,

630
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,200
Oh,

631
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,680
I'm just Lucy or Johnny that are paying domestic Saturday afternoon basketball.

632
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,279
Do you know what I mean?

633
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:43,140
And you've struck on one of the great passions of my life at the moment is

634
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,319
watching exactly that at junior sport and alarmingly for me,

635
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:49,500
that we've turned it in.

636
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:50,099
Yeah.

637
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:55,579
My dad played sport for a living and never once ever said to me anything

638
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:56,519
negative ever,

639
00:27:56,819 --> 00:27:57,839
or really just left,

640
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,380
you know,

641
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,000
the support was always there,

642
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,079
but he had all the,

643
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,279
all the expertise in the world,

644
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,819
but he would never for the chance of our relationship changing,

645
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:08,039
be anything apart from just supportive in the,

646
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,019
in the background.

647
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:14,460
I see so many parents at the under nines think they're going for Olympic gold or a

648
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,440
Guinness world record,

649
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,759
and they can become so hyper competitive through their own.

650
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:21,119
So,

651
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:21,779
so,

652
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:22,319
you know,

653
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,160
little,

654
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,579
you know,

655
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:27,640
Johnny is just finding his way that we need to nurture a little bit more.

656
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,640
And it's so easy to look after,

657
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,059
cause you can find a role.

658
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:33,779
It doesn't matter what ability they are,

659
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:38,579
but because it's the parents who are living through something they didn't achieve

660
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:39,220
themselves,

661
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:43,000
creating this hyper competitive yelling at the umpires,

662
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,380
and then we're losing kids everywhere for it.

663
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,599
So I don't often refer back,

664
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,319
but you know,

665
00:28:48,339 --> 00:28:48,960
Rod Campbell,

666
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,119
I spoke with for an hour and a half about this,

667
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,400
about learning life through sport.

668
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,539
People then say,

669
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:53,759
Oh,

670
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:54,140
you know,

671
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,940
everyone wins a prize.

672
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:55,799
And that's what I say to me.

673
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:55,940
Oh,

674
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,160
it's,

675
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,339
you know,

676
00:28:56,339 --> 00:28:57,079
it's past the parcel.

677
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,640
Now everyone wins.

678
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,720
It's bullshit.

679
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,059
Like the one kid who's going to win a prize,

680
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:04,059
an Olympic gold isn't diminished by the kid who's still learning.

681
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,440
In fact,

682
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,759
it's the opposite because you put too many in one team together,

683
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:08,920
which is what everyone does.

684
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:14,660
And I think I'm going to win the under 12 Yarra League grand final and have a look at how great that's going to be.

685
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,039
And I think,

686
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,640
are you going to go back and have a reunion in 20 years time?

687
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,920
That no one gives a shit.

688
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,299
But we care about how,

689
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,279
what if that's your kid who's maybe teetering and you put your arms around them and you make them happy.

690
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:29,160
That actually supports the one Chris Judd,

691
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,400
who's the superstar.

692
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:30,960
He's,

693
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:33,700
he's actually enhanced by it or she's enhanced by it.

694
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,599
So we need to get that right.

695
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,200
We've got that horribly wrong all around the globe.

696
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,539
Got to get back to teaching life through sport and,

697
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:41,819
but just,

698
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,319
and you're,

699
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,339
and you still compete.

700
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,700
You still be your best,

701
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:46,039
still try and win,

702
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,220
but you can do it and look after the other kids.

703
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:48,960
Yeah.

704
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,819
I think back to my son playing in under eights.

705
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,960
So these kids are six or seven and we,

706
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:00,299
my husband and I pulled together a basketball team from school.

707
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,559
And just any kid that put his hand up and it was incredible.

708
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,839
There were kids on the team that were obviously quite talented and gifted and could dribble up and down the court.

709
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:15,500
And there were other kids that virtually could not catch a ball,

710
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,519
like couldn't catch a ball.

711
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,759
And they just had the best time.

712
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,819
And three seasons later,

713
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:24,099
we were still asking,

714
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:27,279
does anyone want to play for the following season?

715
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,000
Everyone would put up their hand.

716
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,200
But what was incredible,

717
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:31,579
incredible about that team.

718
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:37,799
And you could see it standing back was each player bought something quite different to the team.

719
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,920
So there was obviously a very talented player that was very skilled,

720
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:48,799
but I remember one particular boy who couldn't catch the ball,

721
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:55,220
but he was really the carer and the social connected piece of the team.

722
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:58,500
So if someone fell over or if someone was hurt,

723
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,180
he would be there going,

724
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,160
are you okay?

725
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:02,519
Can I do anything for you?

726
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:03,700
Had a heart of gold.

727
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,059
And yeah,

728
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:07,640
I just think with every team you have,

729
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:08,799
perhaps the performer,

730
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,539
the leader,

731
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:11,259
the social connected piece,

732
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,119
you know,

733
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,779
there's people that fill all different roles.

734
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:15,920
Couldn't agree with you more.

735
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:16,240
Don,

736
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:20,640
I first time I coached my oldest and I was reluctant because I was like my dad.

737
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:20,980
I thought,

738
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:21,619
you know,

739
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,079
I've played this game and,

740
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:23,460
and,

741
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:23,920
you know,

742
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:29,359
with a profile and it's been nice to stay out of his way so that he doesn't have to have me in his space.

743
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:29,640
You know,

744
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,220
there's plenty of other,

745
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,319
the dad got sick the week before the first game and rang me and said,

746
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,279
can you fill in as coach of the under 10s?

747
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:36,339
And so he had to say no.

748
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:37,400
And,

749
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:38,140
and then I,

750
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,660
I got the series of phone calls going,

751
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,980
you got to take one little boy out of the team because he can't catch the ball.

752
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:44,940
And I remember thinking,

753
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,700
that's the craziest thing.

754
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,539
They're not,

755
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:48,539
I don't know any of the kids.

756
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,460
And I remember saying to Beck,

757
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:50,819
I said,

758
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,259
I don't know who this kid is yet,

759
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,200
but I promise you,

760
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,740
he's going to have the best year.

761
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,539
I'm going to make sure this kid has the best year.

762
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,759
And he couldn't catch the ball,

763
00:31:58,259 --> 00:31:59,799
but he was a beautiful kid.

764
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:00,200
And so,

765
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:02,200
we went to his mom and I said,

766
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,339
look,

767
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,859
I might just play him in one role.

768
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,779
I'm going to teach him how to tackle and how to defend and how to spoil.

769
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:07,960
And his team,

770
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:11,740
the kids loved him because he played a role that others didn't want to play.

771
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:14,500
And he was a great defender and a great spoiler and a great tackle.

772
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,500
That team ended up winning the grand final this year,

773
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,799
but in the grand final,

774
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:20,559
he laid this tackle that I still remember to this day.

775
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,640
It was out of,

776
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,259
and the joy of the kids,

777
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,500
it wasn't fake because they loved him because you know what?

778
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,720
It was a great role to play.

779
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:29,180
I'm not saying this is,

780
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:30,000
I did anything,

781
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:31,000
the heroic,

782
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:31,720
but I mean,

783
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:34,779
his mom was saying like his confidence at school went through the roof and his

784
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:35,140
friendships.

785
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,400
And then he ended up,

786
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:36,579
you know,

787
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,180
he was never going to go on and play,

788
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:41,660
but it didn't need to probably play another six or seven years.

789
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,720
And it was all authentic.

790
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:44,500
Like the kids,

791
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,960
it was the parents who thought we couldn't win unless we kick this kid out of

792
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,259
the side.

793
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:48,740
It's like,

794
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,519
what is going on?

795
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:51,960
Bizarre.

796
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:52,559
So we,

797
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,799
we use the term success leaves clues in this a lot because I love hearing from

798
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:57,420
Donna Urquhart,

799
00:32:57,579 --> 00:32:59,859
who's a mom who started pushing the pram.

800
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:00,140
And,

801
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:01,960
and now going to have a crack at a,

802
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,980
at a world record on Antarctica to leading sports people or different people

803
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,740
around what the dimensions of great leadership looks like.

804
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:12,859
And we think it's hard to do anything in the leadership space if you don't

805
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:13,440
know yourself.

806
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,079
And the idea of self-leadership is where it all starts.

807
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,779
How would you describe that for you?

808
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:18,400
Self-leadership?

809
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,900
Self-leadership for me is really about being true to myself.

810
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:26,140
So being me and not trying to be someone else,

811
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:26,900
you know,

812
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,039
I think it can be very easy to look at great,

813
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:30,680
great leaders.

814
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,720
And,

815
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:38,440
and I think that's important to see how they behave and what they value and

816
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,940
what they are striving for.

817
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,319
But what I try not to do is to emulate that.

818
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:48,559
And instead I step back from that and go,

819
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:48,960
well,

820
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:51,460
who am I authentically and who,

821
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:56,880
what do I value and trying to hold those values true to myself?

822
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,319
Because I think that then attracts people,

823
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:03,359
who are the right people to the team.

824
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,119
And,

825
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:04,579
you know,

826
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:06,420
our team is a team of 15,

827
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,119
but it's essentially a,

828
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:12,679
a voluntary team coming together to support this world record and,

829
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,800
and to build a not-for-profit organization.

830
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:17,400
I think someone said to me on this podcast,

831
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:18,599
everyone else is taken.

832
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,199
You may as well be yourself.

833
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:25,320
We spend a lot of time trying to be all these things for other people.

834
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,920
It's incredibly tiring.

835
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:29,980
And the closer we get to our authentic self,

836
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,239
it sounds easy to say it,

837
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:31,860
but it's,

838
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:32,380
you know,

839
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,179
not necessarily something a lot of people can do.

840
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,699
And so clearly that is,

841
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,760
it's a great description of self leadership.

842
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,880
The idea of positively impacting people on a daily basis in what we do is

843
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,579
another dimension.

844
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:45,440
We see a lot that,

845
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:45,800
you know,

846
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,960
people are really conscious of that.

847
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:52,559
You're having a huge impact on a whole range of young females in particular,

848
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:53,760
but on a daily basis,

849
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,780
do you think about that positive impact on people?

850
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:56,440
Absolutely.

851
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,239
Yeah.

852
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,980
I actually asked my team,

853
00:34:59,179 --> 00:34:59,880
um,

854
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:02,019
in advance of coming on the podcast,

855
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:02,380
Luke,

856
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:06,940
just what characteristics they saw in me as a leader.

857
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,579
And one that came out was being particularly positive.

858
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:15,920
But one thing that I think I really try to do is,

859
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,199
you know,

860
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,059
on one hand,

861
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,420
if an issue comes up,

862
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,179
you know,

863
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:22,639
it's important to acknowledge that issue,

864
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:25,539
that that issue is frustrating or disappointing,

865
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:27,199
or it's not,

866
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:27,480
you know,

867
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:29,440
not how we wanted it to work out.

868
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,340
And acknowledging that,

869
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:33,219
but then moving on to go,

870
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:33,800
okay,

871
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:35,920
it wasn't what we want to happen,

872
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:41,940
but what are the steps we can now take to move through that and to move on to the next step?

873
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,360
And I just think we always have a choice,

874
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:44,820
don't we?

875
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,260
We always have a choice.

876
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:46,659
There's,

877
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:55,440
there's a Y shaped sort of pathway and we can choose to go down the pathway of negativity or unhelpful thoughts,

878
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,380
or we can choose,

879
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:57,719
choose the alternative.

880
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:58,219
Yeah.

881
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:58,639
Brilliantly,

882
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,900
brilliantly said.

883
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:00,219
Again,

884
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,099
it's a practice though,

885
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:01,460
isn't it?

886
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:01,619
To,

887
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,320
to do it.

888
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,460
The mind tends to go to the negative a bit more easily for,

889
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:06,380
for a lot of us.

890
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:06,719
It's,

891
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,199
you know,

892
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,099
the vision to break a,

893
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:10,599
an ultra marathon record is,

894
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:11,460
is a big one.

895
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:11,760
And you,

896
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,300
you shared a little bit about quietly doing that on your runs and then starting to,

897
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,280
to step it up,

898
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,659
but to,

899
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,719
to now,

900
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:19,659
you know,

901
00:36:19,659 --> 00:36:20,780
raising a million and a half dollars,

902
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,179
you've got to do more of this,

903
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:22,519
you know,

904
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:25,199
you've got to get the story out there and create and share that vision.

905
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,400
Tell us about how you've gone about that.

906
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,059
Wow.

907
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,039
That's a big question.

908
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:29,679
Uh,

909
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:32,480
in terms of creating the vision and,

910
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:36,519
and I guess spreading the word again,

911
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:38,320
it's just started from,

912
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,179
you know,

913
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:47,039
very small steps of just speaking to people within our networks and then those

914
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,940
people speaking to people within their networks.

915
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:52,179
And yeah,

916
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,139
look,

917
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:58,880
I think really sharing that message amongst the team.

918
00:36:59,480 --> 00:36:59,619
So,

919
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:01,059
for me,

920
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:02,760
I often talk about,

921
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,619
we are attempting a world record and my team say to me,

922
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:08,440
it's not we Donna,

923
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:09,599
you're doing it.

924
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:10,579
It's not a baton.

925
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:12,860
It's not a baton change halfway through.

926
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:14,079
We're not coming in at,

927
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,239
at a hundred kilometers and taking the baton.

928
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,719
But I honestly believe that any one of those people could take the baton at any

929
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,139
time.

930
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,480
So we very much approach this as a team.

931
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:29,519
And so everyone in their particular domains,

932
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,099
whether it be social media,

933
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:31,539
media,

934
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,119
marketing,

935
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:32,800
fundraising,

936
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:36,440
all the different components of our project,

937
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,440
uh,

938
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,320
then spreading the message and,

939
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,059
um,

940
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,420
then really passionate and dedicated in their particular roles to get the

941
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,079
message out.

942
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:46,739
Yeah.

943
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,280
Incredible.

944
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:47,760
Uh,

945
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,139
to hear you talk about it.

946
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,719
I want to ask you a bit more about the time in a mile.

947
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,280
We still,

948
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,579
there's a really curious Donna and they use that curiosity constantly to get

949
00:37:55,579 --> 00:37:57,639
better and to grow and develop themselves.

950
00:37:58,199 --> 00:37:59,019
Are you curious?

951
00:37:59,019 --> 00:37:59,579
I'm curious.

952
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,159
Yeah.

953
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:00,980
Very curious.

954
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,920
And it was really interesting.

955
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:03,320
Luke,

956
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,179
I was preparing for another interview a few weeks ago and I knew that one of

957
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:12,760
the lead questions for the interview was what were you like as a child?

958
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,300
And I in fact reached out to my mom and I said,

959
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:17,780
mom,

960
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:18,480
you know,

961
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,699
I can remember bits and pieces,

962
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,360
but can you tell me,

963
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:24,500
and I didn't preempt it at all.

964
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:25,159
I just said,

965
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:25,960
what,

966
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:27,920
how would you describe me as a child?

967
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,000
And she said,

968
00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:29,579
look,

969
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:30,639
Donna,

970
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:33,719
you're a team player and various other things.

971
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,860
But then she said,

972
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:45,440
you were willing to give things a go and you are looking to find out more and be on that sort of cutting edge.

973
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,300
And look,

974
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,179
I look,

975
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,340
that's why I got into research because I wanted to find out new information,

976
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:52,860
be on that cutting edge,

977
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,179
learn more about humans that could then,

978
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,119
I guess,

979
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:58,860
help people,

980
00:38:59,019 --> 00:38:59,579
you know,

981
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:00,820
help people going forwards.

982
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,380
Brilliant answer.

983
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:04,380
And communicating with clarity is another dimension,

984
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,079
you know,

985
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:05,500
we see.

986
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:06,639
And it's interesting is,

987
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:10,119
and I get the feeling you're going to be more comfortable minus 40,

988
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,199
800 Ks in than potentially on the speaking circuit afterwards as,

989
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,659
as an,

990
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:16,500
as an introvert,

991
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:17,320
but you've had to,

992
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:23,760
and you're communicating with great clarity and your message is getting across and your stories resonating with all of us.

993
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,039
We want to hear more about it.

994
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:27,719
How have you thought about that communication part of it?

995
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:28,340
Yeah,

996
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:28,619
look,

997
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:29,900
within the team,

998
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,420
I'm very much,

999
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:39,960
I hold highly that the team communicates freely and that I'm available to speak to the team.

1000
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:43,039
Like everyone is looking after their particular domains,

1001
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:49,599
but I'm very aware that sometimes I can be the stopping block if they're waiting for something for me to get back to them about.

1002
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:54,440
So we very much have an understanding that there's that freedom of communication,

1003
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,480
but their communication is equally important.

1004
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,239
And I think it's equally as important as mine.

1005
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:00,699
You know,

1006
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:01,460
if there's an issue,

1007
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,820
we both talk about it.

1008
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,780
We pull our ideas together.

1009
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,019
And to a certain extent,

1010
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:07,960
you know,

1011
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,340
if it's about media or if it's about social media,

1012
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:11,579
they have the expertise.

1013
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:18,039
And so I really like to hand it over to them in terms of their expertise going forwards.

1014
00:40:18,699 --> 00:40:20,199
In terms of communication,

1015
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:23,119
in terms of the message of,

1016
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,280
of getting that out.

1017
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:25,340
Look,

1018
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:25,719
that's,

1019
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:26,980
that's a work in progress.

1020
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,239
As I said to you,

1021
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:28,780
you know,

1022
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,860
it's not something that comes naturally for me.

1023
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:35,440
I've been a scientist where it's publish or perish.

1024
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:43,420
So it's about being behind your computer and really generating medical publications that are published in journals.

1025
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:49,639
So I don't spend a lot of time speaking about what I'm doing necessarily.

1026
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,280
We obviously have scientific conferences,

1027
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:55,800
but very keen to learn in that space.

1028
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,340
I'm actually,

1029
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:58,099
as I'm getting used to it,

1030
00:40:58,179 --> 00:40:58,420
starting,

1031
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,239
to enjoy it more and more and look,

1032
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:04,039
if I can have an impact through delivering my message,

1033
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:06,159
then that's really special to me.

1034
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,019
And I feel like,

1035
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:08,679
you know,

1036
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:14,739
we're essentially meeting our outcomes and having an impact.

1037
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:16,119
Publish or perish.

1038
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:17,760
That's a good line.

1039
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,619
And I think it's what I love when you take on something like this,

1040
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:24,579
it's challenging you in ways that for whatever we do,

1041
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:25,079
isn't it?

1042
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:28,280
You're now finding a set of skills that you need to have,

1043
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,599
potentially before,

1044
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,400
but yeah,

1045
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,480
you're incredibly good at it very early and getting your story across really well.

1046
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:36,559
You mentioned the collaboration,

1047
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:37,059
isn't it?

1048
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:39,099
It's brilliant for again,

1049
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:45,380
someone who had this idea and now you've got 15 people pro bono donating their time to support you.

1050
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,039
And I love the humility.

1051
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:48,039
It's we,

1052
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:51,159
it's not I out there on the ice in Antarctica.

1053
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:52,880
How important is collaboration been?

1054
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,059
I wouldn't have been able to do this without the collaboration.

1055
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:56,900
Full stop.

1056
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,159
Yeah.

1057
00:41:58,159 --> 00:41:58,519
Look,

1058
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:04,940
every person has had such an integral input into this whole project.

1059
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,179
You know,

1060
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:15,159
I think of just the beginning where it started in covert in 2021 and I was listening to an adventure podcast and Eric Phillips who was being interviewed,

1061
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:22,159
who's a polar Explorer has decades of experience in polar regions was talking about his experiences.

1062
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:24,380
I was just captivated by that.

1063
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,920
And he was Pat farmer's guide.

1064
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,559
Pat farmer.

1065
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:29,119
He currently has the world record.

1066
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,739
And I reached out to Eric and I said to him,

1067
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:32,960
look,

1068
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,420
would you be available to chat?

1069
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,739
And we jumped on a call and I explained to him what I would like to do.

1070
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,219
And he said,

1071
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:40,599
Donna.

1072
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:41,639
Yeah.

1073
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,320
No,

1074
00:42:43,179 --> 00:42:44,320
that's not possible.

1075
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:47,800
Which was a hurdle for you to jump Donna.

1076
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:48,500
Yeah.

1077
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,440
And he just said,

1078
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:50,719
look,

1079
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:57,500
with the incredible expense involved with having a vehicle in Antarctica and petrol,

1080
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:06,500
it's just it's just mind blowing the expense associated with that because you can't just go and run in the in Antarctica on the snow.

1081
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,780
You just fall through the snow.

1082
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,940
So you need a vehicle to pack that down.

1083
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:13,119
But Eric has been an incredible support.

1084
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,320
He opened a window to that and said,

1085
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,539
but what you could do.

1086
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:22,800
And then that led to essentially our project opening up and developing.

1087
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,900
And that's just one example of someone that's had such a crucial.

1088
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,199
Yeah.

1089
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:30,579
Crucial aspect or component to this project.

1090
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,659
When he said,

1091
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,099
no,

1092
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:40,760
do that rock your back and think I'm in trouble here or we're aware of some of how big it was or did that sort of open your mind even more?

1093
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:43,139
Look,

1094
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,860
I was really aware of how audacious it was to begin with.

1095
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,579
And he was one of the first people I reached out to.

1096
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,619
So when he said,

1097
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:53,019
no,

1098
00:43:53,659 --> 00:43:54,420
I was like,

1099
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:54,719
oh,

1100
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:56,239
maybe it's not possible.

1101
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:57,179
But very quickly,

1102
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:03,440
he then came in with hope and the possibility that there was an alternative to that.

1103
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,099
Who has been the greatest leader in your life?

1104
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:07,880
My mum.

1105
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,019
She has been the greatest role model.

1106
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:12,699
And I've only just realised that recently,

1107
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,119
Luke,

1108
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,440
just over the last sort of five to 10 years,

1109
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:18,420
having more conversations with her.

1110
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:20,280
Now being a mum,

1111
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:24,300
I've learnt just what she has taught me.

1112
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,260
I think when you're younger,

1113
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,440
you don't necessarily realise,

1114
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:28,119
there's that,

1115
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:30,860
you know,

1116
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,420
what you learn from your parents and how that sort of washes over you.

1117
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,699
But just stories she's told me,

1118
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,280
I've really thought,

1119
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:39,860
yes,

1120
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,360
that part of me that is prepared to step out and have a go.

1121
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:52,059
And that curiosity to be on that cutting edge and find out new information that has really come from her.

1122
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:56,739
Because she tells me about how she had my brother and I,

1123
00:44:57,199 --> 00:44:59,360
and she was in her thirties.

1124
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:02,940
She hadn't particularly had the support to do well at school.

1125
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,400
And,

1126
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:04,980
you know,

1127
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:10,860
you can imagine back in that day for a mother with two young children to then go to university,

1128
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,619
do a psychology degree and become a psychology teacher.

1129
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,699
It was quite a unique step for her.

1130
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,460
And I know she's talked about people around her,

1131
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,119
her neighbours,

1132
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:23,880
her friends,

1133
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,820
really raising eyebrows about that.

1134
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:26,920
And it wasn't the thing to do.

1135
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,099
It wasn't the thing to do as a mother back then.

1136
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,960
So I think that's just one example of the example she's set that I've then,

1137
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,719
that's washed over me and helped me then step forward into areas that are quite unique,

1138
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,739
like running in Antarctica,

1139
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,460
1300 kilometres.

1140
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:47,400
I think that's given me the courage to do that.

1141
00:45:47,659 --> 00:45:51,480
And she has been incredibly supportive all the way through.

1142
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:54,840
She has had concerns.

1143
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,380
We have talked about it.

1144
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:04,099
She actually did say to me at one point very early on when she didn't know really the intricacies of what I was doing.

1145
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:05,900
She did say to me,

1146
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:07,320
do you know,

1147
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:07,619
Donna,

1148
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,219
if something's to happen to you,

1149
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:17,860
that could have quite a significant impact on your husband and your son.

1150
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:22,519
And I think the word destroy was in there mixed in.

1151
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:24,099
I can't remember the exact words,

1152
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:24,480
but,

1153
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,079
yeah,

1154
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:27,420
she was quite concerned to begin with.

1155
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:30,480
And as her daughter,

1156
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,559
I didn't quite understand that.

1157
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:34,940
Like I found that really hard.

1158
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,519
I was like,

1159
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:36,860
where's that full support?

1160
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,800
I knew it was coming from a place of love and concern.

1161
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:43,619
But now as a mother,

1162
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,619
I know exactly where that comes from.

1163
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:47,960
Because if my son told me he was doing that,

1164
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:50,360
it would be a different story.

1165
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:52,260
But in fact,

1166
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,460
I have spoken to my team about that.

1167
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,199
And they have explained how pivotal that comment has been for them,

1168
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:03,760
how that's really driven them to tick off all the risks

1169
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,760
and be really honed in on the incredible dangers

1170
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,400
that we can face when we're in Antarctica.

1171
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:12,500
Yeah,

1172
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:13,039
incredible.

1173
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,480
In the spirit of collaboration,

1174
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,159
and we love that in the world,

1175
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,980
that we're in connecting different leaders around the globe.

1176
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,679
And as a research scientist,

1177
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:24,219
as an ultramarathon runner,

1178
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:25,059
or a mum,

1179
00:47:25,539 --> 00:47:29,920
have you thought of a particular collaboration in any of your passions that

1180
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,659
you think I'd love to connect with that person to collaborate with?

1181
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:34,699
Is there a name that springs to mind?

1182
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,579
Oh gosh,

1183
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:38,019
you've caught me off the hop there,

1184
00:47:38,019 --> 00:47:38,519
Luke.

1185
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,500
Collaboration.

1186
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:42,239
Oh,

1187
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,539
Luke Darcy.

1188
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:46,599
She's just set the bar low there.

1189
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:49,340
I wasn't expecting that answer,

1190
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:49,840
Don.

1191
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,300
I'd love to jump on the team.

1192
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,840
Can I get a late ticket over to Antarctica?

1193
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,880
I'm not sure what my skillset would be,

1194
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:56,179
Donna,

1195
00:47:56,179 --> 00:47:56,599
but I'd,

1196
00:47:56,599 --> 00:47:56,880
uh,

1197
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,079
Oh,

1198
00:47:57,079 --> 00:47:59,460
there's still a support crew position available,

1199
00:47:59,460 --> 00:47:59,960
Luke.

1200
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,599
I've got no skills at all,

1201
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:05,599
apart from a passion for seeing you do it.

1202
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:05,960
It's,

1203
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,320
uh,

1204
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,519
it's incredible.

1205
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:07,820
Look,

1206
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,300
I,

1207
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,079
I'm,

1208
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:14,239
I've certainly followed your podcast and listened to all the incredible guests you've had.

1209
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:14,900
And yeah,

1210
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,719
hats off to you.

1211
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:19,119
I've learned a lot about leadership through that podcast.

1212
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,139
And yeah,

1213
00:48:20,139 --> 00:48:21,920
when I got the invite to come on,

1214
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,719
that was certainly a collaboration.

1215
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:26,159
That was one that I wasn't expecting.

1216
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:28,059
Very kind of you to say that.

1217
00:48:28,059 --> 00:48:29,659
And I've learned a lot today.

1218
00:48:29,659 --> 00:48:31,099
I just love it.

1219
00:48:31,099 --> 00:48:31,599
I love,

1220
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:32,500
uh,

1221
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,300
as a father of a teenage daughter,

1222
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:34,679
still,

1223
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:37,400
I know how important it is that,

1224
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:37,699
you know,

1225
00:48:37,699 --> 00:48:41,840
we show great examples and someone has spent their life in sport.

1226
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,219
The idea that we try and keep more of our kids,

1227
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:46,440
boys and girls in sport more often,

1228
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,880
I'm alarmed at how often they're dropping out more than ever.

1229
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,119
And we know there are other passions as well.

1230
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:51,980
They're equally important,

1231
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:52,880
but yeah,

1232
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,539
for you to do,

1233
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:56,239
what you're doing is incredible.

1234
00:48:56,239 --> 00:48:57,679
I wish you all the best.

1235
00:48:57,679 --> 00:48:58,519
Good luck.

1236
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:00,820
And I'd love to see you on the other side.

1237
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:01,579
Yeah.

1238
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:02,000
Thank you,

1239
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,219
Luke.

1240
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:03,320
Appreciate you having me on.

1241
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:07,460
Thank you for listening to the empowering leaders podcast powered by temper,

1242
00:49:07,539 --> 00:49:09,079
a mattress like no other.
