00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:12,210
Our next guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is Dr. Anna Rubenstein,

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,890
the CEO and founder of the Rites of Passage Institute.

3
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:19,550
A conversation I think every parent needs to hear,

4
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,030
the idea of how we impact our kids in the most positive way,

5
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,329
particularly through the challenging teenage years.

6
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:31,429
And Anna is a world expert in bringing back the thousands of years of knowledge

7
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:33,450
that has been lost in recent times.

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,310
As he has sat down with hundreds of thousands of kids around the world

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,950
on how to guide them through those challenging years

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,130
into being the best version of themselves.

11
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:46,829
I found it personally inspiring and a bit challenging too,

12
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,909
as a parent myself, on how to raise our kids in the best possible way.

13
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:54,649
From the moment they're born, find something you can both do together.

14
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,350
I've got a friend who's just had a baby.

15
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,549
He straps the baby to his chest and goes for a walk every morning.

16
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:02,609
And he said it's the most special, beautiful time of his day.

17
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,810
It creates that safe space where if our child wants to ask us something

18
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,890
or tell us something, they know that we're there,

19
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,269
they feel safe enough and they can come to us.

20
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:26,269
Very closely linked as these conversations are to the work

21
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:29,150
that I'm super passionate about, a business we started called Alita.

22
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,549
Love you to check out our Alita Connect signature program.

23
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:37,450
We're bringing leaders together from sport, industry, social venture and the arts

24
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,909
that has, we think, created a great impact.

25
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:41,909
Bespoke facilitators.

26
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:44,450
Facilitated forums that can be life-changing,

27
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,430
where leaders come together to connect, to learn and to share.

28
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,250
What a great honour it was to record this conversation

29
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,829
with Dr. Arne Rubenstein on his property just out of Mullumbimby,

30
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,030
150 acres of beautiful rainforest.

31
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:59,189
It's a conversation I think every parent needs to hear.

32
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,109
Arne, I'm really appreciative of you inviting my wife, Bec, and I

33
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:08,030
out to your extraordinary property outside of Mullumbimby near Byron Bay.

34
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,949
We've just had a tour of Mullumbimby.

35
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,530
It's a piece of paradise, really, Arne.

36
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,009
I really appreciate you inviting us today.

37
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,750
Very happy to have you out here.

38
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:18,169
It's been great.

39
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:19,409
Well, it's been beautiful.

40
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,430
And I think I need to start with, you run Rites of Passage.

41
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:24,449
I want to talk about that.

42
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,469
But to have Bec here with me was really special.

43
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:31,469
And she sat in a special chair and that was a magic moment for me

44
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:33,729
because you said, okay, that's part of what happens out here.

45
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,210
And I hope I'm not giving away any of the secrets.

46
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:37,669
But you said now you need to acknowledge your part.

47
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:38,629
Shall we start with that?

48
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,990
Yeah.

49
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:39,610
Shall we?

50
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:40,469
Let's start with that.

51
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:41,830
So, you know,

52
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,349
one of the fundamental principles of our work,

53
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:48,689
which is based off, you know, Indigenous traditional communities,

54
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,449
but the belief is that every child is different

55
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:53,370
and every person is different

56
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,710
and each person has their own unique gifts and talents,

57
00:02:57,169 --> 00:02:58,689
their own genius, their own spirit.

58
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,250
And all of our children have, you know,

59
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,090
their special things that we as parents and carers see in them,

60
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,189
but often they either don't recognise their own gifts and talents

61
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:11,969
or they don't value them.

62
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:16,629
So one of the things that we do in our work towards the end of our programs

63
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,110
is something we call honouring,

64
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:23,009
which is where we get the young ones to sit in front of everybody

65
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:24,590
who's on the program that we're running

66
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,710
and then their father or their mother or whoever's brought them on the camp

67
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,169
comes up and in front of everyone tells their, you know,

68
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,069
their son or their daughter what they admire about them,

69
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:37,550
what they love about them, the gifts they see they have,

70
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:39,370
the talents, the genius, the spirit.

71
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:41,969
And then we get, you know,

72
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,969
another adult who's on the program can tell them

73
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:47,669
and sometimes one of the facilitators will say something

74
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:50,069
or some of their peers and, you know,

75
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,189
it's a life-changing experience for them.

76
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:56,370
And we believe that every young person needs to be acknowledged

77
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,669
and, you know, we need to be sharing with them what we see in them,

78
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,210
the gifts that we see they have, the beauty in them.

79
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,169
We have a lot of children who say to us, you know,

80
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,870
no one ever says nice things about me.

81
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:11,689
They tell me all the shit stuff, if you'll excuse the expression.

82
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:12,990
They tell me what I do wrong.

83
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:16,569
But when they actually just get honoured and we're basically saying to them,

84
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:18,930
we love you for who you are,

85
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,509
that can be a life-changing experience for them.

86
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:26,750
And to see your beautiful wife back in that chair and you, you know,

87
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:30,910
acknowledging her and thanking her for being the beautiful mother

88
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,889
and woman and partner and, you know, other things that she is,

89
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,610
that's a special thing.

90
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,069
So I love that.

91
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,029
Well, thank you.

92
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,910
And it's something we should do more often,

93
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,350
but we don't often take the time, even with our own partners.

94
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:45,170
So that was a pretty special moment.

95
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,350
And then for you, having just met Bec, to do the same,

96
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:49,350
acknowledge her as a mother.

97
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,769
And, again, I don't think it's something we do enough,

98
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,970
is acknowledge our mothers and the incredible contribution.

99
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:57,009
And so it's already been a joyful day.

100
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:59,329
I want to come back a step, if I can, Anna,

101
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:01,389
and then head back to the rites of passage.

102
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,389
But in 2000, you're running a successful medical practice.

103
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:05,889
It's a brave decision.

104
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:08,829
It's an incredible leadership decision, I think,

105
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:10,589
to take this path.

106
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,649
And, you know, it's not for commercial gain, clearly.

107
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,269
It's all about a sense of purpose.

108
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:16,009
What motivated that decision?

109
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:22,029
Well, I'd been working as a general practitioner for, yeah, 12 years.

110
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:26,930
And I could see that a lot of the issues that I was dealing with

111
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,970
in older people had actually started when they were teenagers,

112
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:36,629
you know, like self-esteem or things that happened with their fathers

113
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:40,829
and that a lot of their behaviours were addiction-based,

114
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,250
that compensations, and that were now affecting them.

115
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:48,009
And I was supposed to give them a tablet or some medication

116
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:51,410
to fix things up, whereas I'm like, well, actually,

117
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:52,790
this all started when you were a teenager.

118
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,350
What a shame we didn't deal with it then.

119
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:58,810
And I also had started doing work in emergency medicine,

120
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,290
and I was seeing all these teenagers coming through the emergency department,

121
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:06,589
boys and girls, who'd done basically the stupidest thing

122
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:10,430
you could think of, you know, to try and make themselves feel

123
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:10,889
like a teenager.

124
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:12,769
And I was a grown-up, and I was like, wow,

125
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:14,509
there's something really going on here.

126
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,250
And we'd started running some rites of passage camps a few years earlier,

127
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,670
and I was just seeing how those programs were changing the lives

128
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,629
of these young ones.

129
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:26,350
And I could see that by changing their lives as teenagers,

130
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:29,709
we would impact on the entire rest of their lives.

131
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,850
And whilst I also loved being a doctor, to be honest,

132
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,449
I had some serious issues with the system.

133
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,910
And the system for me was more and more about making money

134
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:40,410
and making money.

135
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:45,069
And less, you know, in my experience around what I felt medicine,

136
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:48,129
which is a noble profession, should really be about.

137
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:51,730
Anyway, this window opened up, this window of opportunity opened,

138
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:52,810
and I just jumped.

139
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:55,990
And I just made this decision, I'm going to sell my, I'm going to,

140
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,990
well, basically give away my practice and go full-time

141
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,350
into starting rites of passage and trying to scale it initially

142
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,290
around the country and now globally.

143
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:07,750
Which takes courage, doesn't it, to leave that security

144
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,730
and understanding.

145
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,990
You come from a medical family.

146
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,769
Just talking to you, you know, your dad was an anaesthetist

147
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:16,269
and your mum, I think you shared with me, was a biochemist.

148
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:18,089
You've got a brother who's a plastic surgeon.

149
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:23,490
And so that's a big call, isn't it, to say into this uncharted territory.

150
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,730
And, you know, I think the words, you know, reading your book

151
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,610
in recent times, you felt like you're still a doctor

152
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,009
but more in the preventative space.

153
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:30,829
Is that how it still feels?

154
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:31,430
Yeah, absolutely.

155
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:33,310
I feel like it's exactly how I feel.

156
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,209
I'm a doctor doing preventative medicine.

157
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:39,149
And, you know, I love what we're doing.

158
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,389
And whilst, yeah.

159
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,829
I guess it was a courageous decision for me.

160
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,589
It was also just a key moment in life.

161
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:51,329
And when I was honest with myself, I knew that that was what I wanted to do.

162
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,970
I wanted to set up these programs.

163
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:54,290
I wanted to create rites of passage.

164
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:56,649
I wanted to find ways to scale them.

165
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:58,670
And I heard the calling.

166
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:03,410
So whilst I know a lot of people say it took courage, for me it was a no-brainer

167
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,670
because I felt if I don't follow my heart, if I don't follow my passion,

168
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,009
if I don't follow what I know is true,

169
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,629
then what's left?

170
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:14,910
And so, like, I jumped.

171
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,949
I jumped hard.

172
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,050
And sitting out here and seeing what you've created,

173
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,610
you can tell that that is a lifetime of success.

174
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,089
And the impact you've had on thousands and thousands of teenagers

175
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,230
around the world is profound.

176
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,269
We hear parents all the time, and as a parent myself,

177
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:33,830
we want our kids to be happy and successful.

178
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,549
But, again, reading some of your work, the media portrayal of that

179
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,809
and sometimes the world portrayal of that is, you know,

180
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,389
for boys.

181
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:43,990
It's about being rich and having a big house and driving an expensive car

182
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,289
and having their supermodel girlfriend.

183
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:48,769
Do we need to redefine what that looks like?

184
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,649
And do you think perhaps as parents we are overlaying a little bit of that

185
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:54,509
onto our kids without even knowing it?

186
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,049
Yeah.

187
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:57,649
Look, I personally think we've got a major problem.

188
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:05,629
And I think our values have been really messed with.

189
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,950
And exactly as you described, you know, need to be rich,

190
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,389
for boys and have the big car and for girls to have to look a certain way.

191
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,990
And I think that's actually incredibly damaging.

192
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,450
And we need to review all of those things.

193
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,450
And I feel like a lot of – and technology, by the way,

194
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,690
has just made it all worse.

195
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,149
Technology hasn't caused the problems, but it's now greatly exacerbated them.

196
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:31,950
And, you know, some of the work that we get involved with is when we give boys

197
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:38,509
and girls an opportunity to discuss how they're told they're supposed to be

198
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:39,389
and then to look at it.

199
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:42,570
And to look at, but how do you want to be?

200
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,669
Forget about what you're being told for a bit.

201
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,649
What sort of adult do you want to be?

202
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,129
What's actually important for you?

203
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:52,570
And it's quite extraordinary for them when they see the difference between

204
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:58,490
what their own values are as opposed to what they're being told by media,

205
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,990
the internet, Instagram, Facebook, all of those things.

206
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:07,789
So, you know, our work is an opportunity for people to just review the story

207
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:09,070
that they've been told.

208
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:09,129
And that's what we're doing.

209
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:09,370
And that's what we're doing.

210
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:09,389
And that's what we're doing.

211
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:12,750
And go, well, actually, is that the story that I want running my life

212
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,190
or do I want to create my own?

213
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:16,570
So, let me ask you this question.

214
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,750
What's the key then to being a good parent?

215
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,450
I think there are a number of keys to being a good parent.

216
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:26,269
I think that, you know, parenting is an ongoing journey.

217
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,129
There's no perfect parent.

218
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,950
So, it's about recognising it is a journey and we're always learning.

219
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:35,289
But some of the key things that we recommend to parents,

220
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:39,370
if I was going to name three, is that we make sure we have one

221
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:44,090
on one time with all of our children so that we actually form

222
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:48,529
a genuine relationship with all of them, doing things that we both enjoy

223
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:51,889
and being present and, you know, you've got four children, Luke,

224
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,730
so that's a big call.

225
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:55,450
But it's even more important when you have more children

226
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,389
that you get some one-on-one time with them regularly.

227
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:04,509
The second thing is that we practise acknowledging what they do well

228
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:08,450
and recognising, you know, that they are different from us,

229
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,269
that they all do have.

230
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,929
They all have their own gifts and a big role for us as parents

231
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:15,350
is to help them find their gifts, their passion, their genius

232
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,210
and their purpose.

233
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:21,490
And then the third one is that when our children muck up, and they will,

234
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,330
they are going to do things they shouldn't do,

235
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:25,710
they are going to do things that fail and are not okay,

236
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:30,529
that we don't shame them but we actually use it as a learning opportunity

237
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:31,690
and we support them.

238
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,370
We support them to learn and grow from their mistakes rather

239
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,690
than shaming them, which unfortunately happens a lot

240
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,370
and has...

241
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:40,830
some really negative impact on them.

242
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,929
A lot of the research suggests that the time part,

243
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,009
I'm not surprised you went there first, that fathers and sons

244
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:49,889
and parents that genuinely spend proper time,

245
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,289
I think on average we're now seeing, you know,

246
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,269
parents are spending less than an hour a day, you know, with a child.

247
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:58,110
But the research will say that the more time,

248
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,950
the better the outcomes education-wise, socially, health-wise.

249
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,269
Rob Sitch, I've been lucky enough to interview on this podcast

250
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:06,889
as a genius from Working Dog and father of five

251
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:08,990
and I love talking parenting with Rob.

252
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:09,090
I love talking parenting with Rob.

253
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:09,250
I love talking parenting with Rob.

254
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,149
And he goes there as well.

255
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:11,450
It's like you can't fake time.

256
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,629
That's the only thing that you can't.

257
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,710
Is that a really good lesson to learn for us

258
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,029
that you just have to put the time in?

259
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,149
Yeah, it's incredibly important.

260
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:21,669
You know, I grew up with a father who, you know,

261
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,529
was a good man and he just worked.

262
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,889
He was at work, you know, basically before we got up in the morning

263
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:29,070
he was off and gone and he'd come home late

264
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,610
and he was on call on the weekends and, you know,

265
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:34,889
and he was doing what he thought was the best thing for the family

266
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:37,850
but actually we just wanted time with him, you know,

267
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,230
and I still remember the time.

268
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,070
I remember the times we would go away or do something together

269
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,129
as some of the most special times of my life with my father

270
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:47,110
was when we got our one-on-one time together

271
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,149
and we recommend to all fathers and, look, often it's the, you know,

272
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,210
that hour that you're talking about, probably 52 minutes of that

273
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,029
is the mother's and about eight minutes of it is the father's

274
00:12:57,029 --> 00:12:59,490
and mothers tend to, not always,

275
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:02,990
but tend to more naturally spend time with their children

276
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,250
and a lot of fathers are incredibly busy

277
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,629
and the kids are incredibly busy

278
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:09,129
and then all of a sudden we,

279
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,570
don't spend time and they're 14, 15 and something goes wrong

280
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,129
and dad thinks he can just step in

281
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:16,389
and tell his son or his daughter what to do

282
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:17,509
and it doesn't work.

283
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,870
So we say, you know, to all parents,

284
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,809
from the moment they're born,

285
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:24,269
find something you can both do together.

286
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:25,990
I've got a friend who's just had a baby.

287
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,169
He straps the baby to his chest and goes for a walk every morning

288
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:32,250
and he said it's the most special, beautiful time of his day

289
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,049
and it's just so important that we create

290
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,129
this individual relationship with them

291
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:39,090
and hopefully we'll be able to do that.

292
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:39,230
And hopefully we'll be able to do that.

293
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,330
And hopefully turn off our mobile phone when we're doing it.

294
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,230
And it also creates that safe space

295
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,570
where if our child wants to ask us something

296
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,389
or tell us something, that they will do it.

297
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,809
And that is so important that we are there

298
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:54,669
and if there's something our child's not sure about,

299
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,809
a question they have or a problem that's happening,

300
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,470
that they know that we're there, they feel safe enough

301
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,850
and they can come to us.

302
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,490
It's that gift you get occasionally, isn't it,

303
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,889
when you're driving one-on-one in the car

304
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:06,269
and they might have been silent for a long period of time

305
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:08,750
but if you're not there, you don't get that chance

306
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,070
and they come to you.

307
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,190
They come occasionally where you do get

308
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,730
those beautiful moments which we will cherish

309
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,590
but as we said, you can't be there without time.

310
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:17,590
Then a change happens in the teenage years

311
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,370
and this is what you've probably become a world expert in

312
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,649
and we'll talk rites of passage in a moment.

313
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,210
But so what's the nuance?

314
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,590
What changes for us as parents at teenage years?

315
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:29,549
What's your advice there?

316
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:32,590
Well, everything changes, actually.

317
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:33,950
No nuance, just everything.

318
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,289
And we have to have, you know,

319
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,169
an almost completely different relationship with them.

320
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:38,929
You know,

321
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,730
and we talk about the move from boy psychology

322
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,009
and boy behaviour into adult psychology and behaviour

323
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,330
and hopefully we'll get to talk about that.

324
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,429
But basically when they're little, you know,

325
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,230
they need to be mothered and they need to be told what to do

326
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,789
and when to go to bed and, you know, those things.

327
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,789
But then they reach a point, you know,

328
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:59,190
around puberty where that has to shift

329
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,490
and we have to give them space

330
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,090
but also we still have to set appropriate boundaries

331
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,470
and so it moves much more into a mentoring,

332
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,990
supportive type of relationship.

333
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,350
And what we say to mothers is, you know,

334
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,929
we need to let them go but we need to be available

335
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:20,509
so that when they want to come to us,

336
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,929
they can and they will.

337
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,549
But if, you know, if we try and hold on to them

338
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,289
and still know everything that they're doing

339
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:31,190
and control everything and they're 15, 16, 17 years of age,

340
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,669
it's just not going to go well and they'll push us away.

341
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,610
And we talk about with fathers, you know,

342
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,370
you can't keep,

343
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,990
telling them how to live their lives once they become teenagers.

344
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,750
It's about asking them what they think and what they want to do

345
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,730
and, you know, hopefully being able to discuss it

346
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,269
and supporting them and when something goes wrong,

347
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,029
talking about it and saying, well, what do you learn?

348
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:53,509
What could we have done differently?

349
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,350
Sharing our stories.

350
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:59,009
You know, they want to know what it is to be an adult

351
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:02,950
but they don't want to be told how they have to be as an adult.

352
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,750
So, you know, there's, you know, they,

353
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,169
they're now young adults

354
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,129
and we have to treat them as young adults rather than as children.

355
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,330
And the thing about it is that we're not taught that as parents.

356
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,809
It's not around.

357
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:20,470
I mean, the language you use makes perfect sense when you say it.

358
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:23,009
It's the practice of being able to put that in place.

359
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,850
You mentioned your language around boy psychology

360
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,029
to healthy men psychology, healthy adult psychology

361
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:34,929
and talking to you before we started about almost a crisis in the world

362
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:38,090
that those boys aren't growing into healthy men

363
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,029
and that's some of the leaders we're seeing on a global scale.

364
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:44,210
Can you explain what you mean by that and what needs to shift?

365
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,929
Yeah, so my first work was with boys and men

366
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:50,250
and now we do a lot of work with girls and women

367
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,710
but the first model we wrote was about just between a boy and a man

368
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,409
because we're creating a rite of passage to move from boy to man.

369
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,110
So someone said, okay, well, what's the difference between a boy and a man?

370
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,029
And I wrote this model where boy behaviour is what you typically see

371
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:05,190
in a six to ten-year-old.

372
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,990
I'm the centre of the universe.

373
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:07,990
I want consistency.

374
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,890
I want constant acknowledgement and attention.

375
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,230
I'm never wrong.

376
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,670
It's always someone else's fault.

377
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,410
I can't handle my emotions.

378
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,630
If I don't get what I want, I have a temper tantrum.

379
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:22,190
I'm going to live forever and I want a mother to do everything for me,

380
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,269
to be my servant, to always be there.

381
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:26,809
And, yeah, that's fine in a six to ten-year-old

382
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:31,730
but when you end up with a grown man who still thinks he's the centre of the universe,

383
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:34,130
can still never admit when he's wrong,

384
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,410
still wants to be constantly acknowledged

385
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,450
and told how wonderful he is,

386
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:42,029
if he doesn't get what he wants, he has a temper tantrum

387
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:46,230
and wants a mother and thinks that women are there to serve him

388
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,009
and look after him.

389
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,250
That's a big problem.

390
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:53,410
And I believe that we have a world that's predominantly run by a lot of boys.

391
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,890
And so we're trying to create a shift for the boys

392
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,269
to what we call healthy man behaviour,

393
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,029
which is I'm part of the universe.

394
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,670
My actions affect others.

395
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:06,710
I have to be able to admit when I'm wrong.

396
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,849
If something doesn't work out the way I want,

397
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,849
I can't have a temper tantrum or punch someone

398
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:16,589
or start throwing bombs across the border at another country or stuff like that.

399
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,450
And also I don't want a mother.

400
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:21,789
I want genuine relationship.

401
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,809
And same with girls.

402
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,730
There's a model around girls moving from girl behaviour,

403
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:31,369
of which unfortunately a lot of it is based on external validation,

404
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:36,130
being told how beautiful and pretty and good and, you know,

405
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,670
superficial compliments.

406
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,390
To, you know, we need good men and powerful women.

407
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:45,769
You know, we need women in positions of leadership

408
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:50,549
who can hold that space and for women to know that, you know,

409
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:54,170
validation doesn't have to just come from what people say to you.

410
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,930
It actually comes from within, knowing that you are who you are

411
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,910
and why, you know, and what's important to you.

412
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:05,109
And so, yes, there's a whole model around the girl to woman behaviour as well.

413
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:06,269
And that is huge.

414
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,650
That's a huge passion of yours, isn't it?

415
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:12,309
What the Indigenous cultures we read about understood for thousands of years

416
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:14,970
that, you know, from a men point, and I'm talking male dominated

417
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,130
because your first book is about that around,

418
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:20,190
they worked out pretty quickly that for the security

419
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,829
and the future of their tribes, they needed the right type of leader.

420
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,029
So they put lots and lots of time into exactly the processes

421
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:29,690
you're trying to bring back.

422
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,809
Can you firstly explain what is a rite of passage?

423
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,049
Why have we become the only generation that have lost that?

424
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:36,690
And what is the right of passage?

425
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,970
And how are you going about bringing it back?

426
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:39,509
Sure.

427
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,329
And even just before that, you know, having worked in

428
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:44,250
and spent time with Indigenous communities,

429
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,410
one of the things I notice is the kids are really allowed to be kids.

430
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,569
They run a mark.

431
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:51,569
They're, you know, they're all over the place.

432
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,410
They're creative.

433
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:53,529
They explore.

434
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:58,089
But there's a time when they go, okay, now you're moving to become,

435
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,950
you know, a young adult and we need you as a young adult.

436
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,950
And so they recognise that that process doesn't happen necessarily

437
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:10,589
naturally and every Indigenous and traditional community

438
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:13,190
around the world created rites of passage.

439
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:16,950
And basically a rite of passage is a transformation.

440
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,930
It's something that changes you from one stage in life to the next.

441
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:26,069
And the one we're talking about today is a child becoming a young adult.

442
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:28,890
But there are actually many rites of passage that we go through.

443
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:32,390
There's a rite of passage for some of getting married,

444
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,869
of becoming a parent.

445
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:35,650
That's a transformation.

446
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,230
Once you become a parent, becoming an elder.

447
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,990
And the Indigenous communities had rites of passage

448
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,910
at all these different stages.

449
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,930
And I look at it like we're on a, life is like a staircase.

450
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:51,029
And we move up the staircase and at each step it's a rite of passage

451
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:54,049
and they would have acknowledged and created a process for that.

452
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:56,130
You know, you became a footballer.

453
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,869
So that's a rite of passage when you join the team.

454
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,970
It's also a rite of passage when you retire.

455
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:04,230
You know, it's a rite of passage when you go into a new stage.

456
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:09,390
And what I found in my study is that the rites of passage

457
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,049
were always done in the same way.

458
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:14,930
So they would always take whoever's going through the rite of passage

459
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:18,910
and create a process, which we call a transformation,

460
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:21,809
and then that person would come back into the community

461
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:26,730
in a different way and would act and function in a different way.

462
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,589
And my work has been around what does it take to create a transformation?

463
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,769
A lot of people say, oh, I want to do a transformation.

464
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:34,589
I want to change.

465
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,990
But what does it actually take?

466
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,130
And what I've found is that the four things that were always in there

467
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,630
is, first of all, sharing of stories.

468
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:47,349
And we hear so much now about how important it is to share stories

469
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:50,670
and stories build communities and create a sense of belonging.

470
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:53,250
They're also the way to pass on wisdom and knowledge.

471
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:56,430
If you want to teach your kids how to be good adults,

472
00:21:57,069 --> 00:21:59,930
once they're teenagers, it's not about telling them what to do.

473
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:03,210
It's about sharing your stories and the things you did well

474
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:03,690
and also the...

475
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:05,170
the times when you failed.

476
00:22:05,869 --> 00:22:06,950
That's as important.

477
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:08,549
So that's the first element.

478
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,670
There's always sharing of stories in a rite of passage.

479
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:13,869
There's always some sort of challenge or ordeal.

480
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,730
Like, they want challenges.

481
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:16,809
They want to be stretched.

482
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,490
They want their boundaries to be pushed.

483
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:21,809
So there's always a challenge or an ordeal.

484
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:25,369
There's always a creation of a vision for the future.

485
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:27,670
You know, who do I want to be as a young adult?

486
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:29,529
How do I want to be in the world?

487
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:32,410
What do I need to let go of that doesn't serve me anymore?

488
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,529
So that's...

489
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,970
that's the... the third element, creating a vision.

490
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,250
And then the final one is this recognition of who they are or the honouring.

491
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:46,609
When they, you know, or we really find ways to help them see what their gifts are,

492
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:49,170
what their genius is, what they can bring to the world.

493
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:52,769
And by the way, a gift is only a gift if you give it away.

494
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,490
Otherwise, it's a possession.

495
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,730
So to get them to realise that they have gifts and that those gifts are needed

496
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:02,250
and can help their families, their communities and the world.

497
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,470
And as you saw,

498
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,950
you know, profoundly, and we still see if we don't formally do that,

499
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,789
like we did for thousands and thousands of years,

500
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:14,910
then the kids themselves make it up and they often take on all types of risk taking behaviour.

501
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:18,269
We go back to our own teenage years and we think, God, how did I get through?

502
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,869
I did some stupid, crazy things.

503
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:22,349
Well, not everyone does get through.

504
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:23,150
We know that.

505
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:26,990
And I know having been an emergency medicine doctor, not everyone does get through.

506
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,109
And they either make it up and do it themselves.

507
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:33,269
And you see that in gangs, you see it in boarding houses, you see it

508
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:39,069
in frat fraternities, you see it in early university years when they actually do

509
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:43,509
really inappropriate things to each other, trying to create a rite of passage.

510
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:45,910
And most of the elements of the rite of passage are in there,

511
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:49,950
but they're not facilitated and they're not healthy and they create a wound.

512
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:54,789
So they either make it up or life does it to them.

513
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,069
And that can be very traumatic.

514
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,990
They, you know, accidents or failures or abuse.

515
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,430
They're not the rites of passage.

516
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,710
We want our children to have.

517
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,230
Then we have things like schoolies,

518
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,029
which is when they finish year 12 and they come to Byron or the Gold Coast or

519
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:15,470
Bali or Fiji and do the, you know, they get into as much alcohol,

520
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,109
drugs and inappropriate behaviours as they can.

521
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:21,630
Once again, that's not the rite of passage I want for my children.

522
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:24,029
Or they don't do it at all.

523
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:28,349
And then they end up as adults, but still feeling and acting like children.

524
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:33,109
So our thing is about creating responsible

525
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:37,950
and facilitated, appropriate, powerful rites of passage for young people

526
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,750
to really acknowledge and celebrate that they're becoming young adults.

527
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,470
And I'm sitting here in this incredible

528
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,750
place that you've called home for over 20 years.

529
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,470
It's surrounded by forest, you know, mango trees.

530
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,269
And as I said, it is magical.

531
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,269
You feel this calmness and this energy just sitting here now.

532
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:01,750
And you have for many years now brought groups together, diverse groups and parents

533
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,990
and mothers and daughters and sons.

534
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,150
Can you share some of the stories of what

535
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:09,549
happens when you do it right, the transformation that happens?

536
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,589
Sure, I'm happy to.

537
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:14,029
Well, so we do a lot of story sharing.

538
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:18,710
So every night we'll sit in a circle, adult child, adult child, adult child,

539
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,910
around a fire, hopefully, because we love fires.

540
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:25,430
And we get the adults to talk about, you know, what was it like for them when they

541
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,670
were the age of the child they brought on the program?

542
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:31,589
And what was their relationship like with their father or their mother?

543
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,630
And, you know, we just hear the most

544
00:25:34,829 --> 00:25:38,670
incredible stories and often very difficult stories.

545
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:41,990
And especially, unfortunately, I talk about their fathers,

546
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,309
often very disappointing, emotional stories.

547
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:49,069
And then at the end, we say to the to the to the boys or girls who are on the

548
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:53,710
program, you know, if you become a parent, what would you like your son or daughter

549
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:58,029
to say about you? And the answers that we get are so profound.

550
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:01,589
You know, they've been listening the whole way through and they want to be good

551
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:04,829
parents. And we hear them say, I'll be present for my child.

552
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:06,230
I'll spend time with my child.

553
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,230
I'll go and watch my child play footy or basketball.

554
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,789
And, you know, many ways they're talking

555
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:14,390
to their own parents when they say it, but they're consciously thinking.

556
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:16,470
And I believe

557
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:22,430
those who come on the program will be better parents because of coming on our work.

558
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:27,430
And, you know, I also see that often when they arrive, you know, their relationship

559
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:31,269
with their parent, you can see in the body language that there's some issues and

560
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:32,950
they're sort of standing close to each other.

561
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:36,150
But it's not a great look and all the rest.

562
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:40,150
And then, you know, a few days into the camp, you see a dad and his son sitting

563
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:44,309
there and the boy's got his hand draped over his dad's shoulder or his dad's got

564
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:49,349
his arm around him or, you know, the girls and their moms are cuddling.

565
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:53,109
And, you know, it has a huge impact

566
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:55,910
on the relationship between the parent and the child.

567
00:26:56,109 --> 00:27:00,750
And also, don't forget, we're coming into the highest risk factor for these young

568
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:06,349
people because those years between 14 and 18 are the time when they're most at risk

569
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:13,150
for mental health issues, suicide, drug use, risk taking behavior and family breakdown.

570
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:16,430
And by reestablishing and getting them to

571
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:20,109
think about the relationship they want to have as teenagers.

572
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:21,670
And we even get them to do a visioning

573
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:25,910
process when they think about what sort of relationship they want to have

574
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:30,869
with their parent or what sort of relationship the parent want to have with their child over the next five

575
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:33,990
or so years. And they talk about it with each other.

576
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:38,109
And, you know, I think that has a major impact on their lives.

577
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:40,630
And I'm lucky because we've been doing it for 25 years.

578
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:44,349
I'm seeing kids have been on these programs 20 years ago.

579
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:45,990
In fact, one of them is our program

580
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,990
manager and he's in charge of running the programs.

581
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:52,390
And I get phone calls from kids who are like, oh, I've had a child and he's

582
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:55,150
or she's six, seven, eight years old. I want to bring him on camp.

583
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,829
So I want to come back and get involved.

584
00:27:57,029 --> 00:27:58,829
And it was a change my life.

585
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:01,190
And, you know, we see it and we

586
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:05,750
hear about it. And I am convinced that which you don't

587
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,069
need, that that is such a profound thing that you're bringing back to the mainstream

588
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:12,750
world and what a legacy, isn't it, to give up the certainty of what

589
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,549
you studied into this is such an incredible story of leadership.

590
00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:19,150
And check out Rites of Passage.

591
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,349
We'll get all the details together if you are interested.

592
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:25,269
And what I love also, you read your book, which is brilliant around, you know,

593
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,069
teaching others to create Rites of Passage and do it.

594
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:31,069
Clearly, there's an unbelievable amount of experience and knowledge that

595
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:36,069
you bring. We want every kid to go through a Rite of Passage and a healthy Rite of Passage.

596
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:40,150
And, you know, like we talked about putting back in the honouring chair.

597
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:42,750
We want every child to go in an honouring

598
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,309
chair and be told what's special and what people love about them.

599
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:48,069
And same for adults.

600
00:28:48,069 --> 00:28:49,869
But, you know, we're talking mainly about children.

601
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:55,150
But, you know, as I said before, it has a profound and life changing effect on them.

602
00:28:55,349 --> 00:29:03,799
We see it.

603
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,880
And we've been I've been really fortunate to sit down with diverse

604
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,240
leaders, whether it be from sport or from industry or social venture or

605
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,599
now Rites of Passage.

606
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,720
It's such a I love the experience.

607
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,559
You learn so much.

608
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,680
And I'm reflecting a lot on our own parenting.

609
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,200
I know Bec and I have walking through your property today.

610
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,680
But we're seeing these dimensions of what

611
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,039
we think make great leadership in the 21st century, whether you're a sporting coach

612
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,240
or Dr. Arne Rubinstein. So please reflect on these and give me as much or as little

613
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,400
as you feel. But we feel all leaders understand this idea of self leadership first.

614
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,359
That it starts there.

615
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,839
What does that term mean to you?

616
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:42,599
Well, I think leadership has changed a lot.

617
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,400
You know, leadership used to be about getting people to do what you wanted.

618
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,599
And then it used to be about finding out

619
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,240
what you think they're good at and making them do that.

620
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,720
And, you know, I definitely agree with you.

621
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,079
It has to start with the self.

622
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,440
So, you know, I believe that, you know, if my theory is that every child is

623
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,759
different, every person is different, have different spirits.

624
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,519
Big thing for me is, well, what are mine and how can I use mine in the best way?

625
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:09,000
And I am a doctor.

626
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,400
But I think, you know, true medicine is also about making people as healthy as

627
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:18,799
they can and helping them find what they really love.

628
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,160
And I know and the research shows that when someone is healthy and when someone's

629
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:25,680
doing what they love, they actually shine.

630
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:32,079
And not only that, they perform best and they also make healthy life decisions.

631
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:36,200
And when someone's doing something they don't like, they're more likely to make

632
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:39,119
healthy life decisions. They're more likely to come home and drink,

633
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:41,680
do drugs, find ways to escape.

634
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:49,039
And, you know, so there's a real medical side to helping people do what they love.

635
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,319
And for me, it's been about, well, how do I want to live?

636
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,240
And, you know, I live here on 150 acres in the forest.

637
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,880
I think I have a beautiful house, even though I call it my shed.

638
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:05,839
But, you know, it's right for me and the work I do is right for me.

639
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:10,440
And even though, you know, I haven't met other people who just do rites of passage

640
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,960
in the modern world, you know, it's very different from the medical experience

641
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,960
that I had, but I know it's what I'm supposed to be doing.

642
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,960
So that's sort of my definition

643
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,559
of spirit leadership is to think about not only in my work, but in my

644
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:29,759
exercise and well-being and relationships to really do it in the best way that I can.

645
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,599
The ultimate form of self-leadership, you can tell everything you do is about purpose.

646
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:40,279
You know, listening to what you're saying before about finding that sense of purpose.

647
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,440
And I've heard one of your lines to say

648
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,519
depression, you see as a sickness of the soul and that if you are living a life

649
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,200
of purpose, it's almost impossible, very, very hard to be depressed.

650
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,119
It's it's it makes sense.

651
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,119
But it feels like that message has been

652
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:59,680
lost a bit in this overmedicated world that we want to fix with a pill every single time.

653
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:00,079
Yeah.

654
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:04,799
And when we look at the fact that something like one in three of our teenagers are on

655
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,640
medication,

656
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,880
it might be one in four, it might be a bit less.

657
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,039
It might actually even be a bit more.

658
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:09,519
We don't know.

659
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,400
You can't find out from the schools what percentage of children are on medication.

660
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,400
But it's way too high.

661
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:20,039
How is it that we are medicating, you know, between 20 and 40 percent of our

662
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,720
children every day just so they can go to school and get through?

663
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,799
There's got to be something wrong.

664
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,359
And, you know, finally, we're starting to realize that, you know,

665
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:35,319
we need to look at well-being, we need to look at helping them find

666
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:38,519
their passion, their purpose, find what's important for them.

667
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,119
We need to teach them 21st century life skills.

668
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:43,319
You know, we need to give them a holistic

669
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:50,000
journey and that school is not just about academic results and maths and science

670
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,279
and English, you know, it's got to be about the journey

671
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:00,200
from the child who comes into the school to the future ready young adult who leaves

672
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,240
and is capable of surviving out in the world and actually wants to make a positive

673
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,200
impact on the world.

674
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,640
Yeah, incredibly well said.

675
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:10,039
We see leaders, another common dimension of their leadership is they're really

676
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,359
conscious about how they go about positively impacting others in their environment.

677
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,599
I mean, that's your life. That's what you do.

678
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,119
I mean, how have you gone about thinking

679
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:21,680
about that day to day, positively impacting others?

680
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,119
Well, I think the greatest gift and the

681
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:29,519
greatest impact we can have on any person is to help them find out who they are,

682
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:35,119
what they love doing, what's, you know, what's true for them and as much to

683
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:39,480
help them find what's not right for them, because I see a lot of people, I saw this

684
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,319
as a doctor, I still see it, who just do today what they do because it's what they

685
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,279
did yesterday. They're on the wrong train in life.

686
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,240
They know they're on the wrong train, but they don't know how to get off and they

687
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,920
don't even want to admit publicly or whatever.

688
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:56,160
Most people know, you know, what's right for them and what's not.

689
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,960
So if we can support and what I love doing, support people to find out what do you

690
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,720
really want to do and what do you need to let go of, what's just not serving you for

691
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,199
the want of a better expression. And when people do that stuff,

692
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:15,960
you know, I believe that creates an incredibly positive and and and, you know,

693
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,880
worthwhile shift for them and for everyone around them.

694
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:23,519
So that's a big thing for me, working with people just to get them to be honest about

695
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,679
what they really want to do and what they, you know, shouldn't be doing anymore.

696
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,679
Yeah, I find that, you know, incredibly sad when you see adults working in

697
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,679
an environment you know that they don't really love when they look really,

698
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,280
you know, unhappy in that space, but they feel wedded to it because of income or

699
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,880
they can't make a change and we feed them the story that more money is going to make

700
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,480
them more happy. Sure, we need a baseline amount of money.

701
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,760
But, you know, this thing that if we have that more will create happiness,

702
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,239
I think that's a very, very dangerous assumption.

703
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,119
I love your vision, which is bringing rites of passage back to the mainstream.

704
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,440
You might give me a more clearer version of that.

705
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,320
But we see the great leaders we work with are really clear on creating and sharing

706
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,960
their vision and how they go about it.

707
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:12,719
Can you share with us, is that the vision

708
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:15,000
that wakes you up every day and how have you gone about sharing it?

709
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:17,159
Well, it's about health and wellbeing.

710
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,719
And I think a rite of passage is just such a critical part, because if we stay,

711
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,360
for example, in child behaviour and we're teenagers or in our 20s, 30s or 40s,

712
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,719
it just doesn't work because people are not going to acknowledge us all the time.

713
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:32,599
They're not going to tell us how tremendous they are.

714
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,079
The world is not

715
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,800
set up for, you know, someone who thinks that it's not it's not there to serve us.

716
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,679
We're actually there to serve the world and the community.

717
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,840
And and so, you know, a big part of my vision comes into

718
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:53,519
education and awareness, you know, talking to people about rites of passage,

719
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:57,920
about what we can be doing for our children, because I'm incredibly not OK

720
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:02,719
with the mental health levels that we're seeing, about building communities,

721
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,119
healthy communities, about

722
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,519
building well, we actually have something called transformational education,

723
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:12,199
which is about for children building strong communities, teaching them critical

724
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,400
21st century life skills like resilience and emotional intelligence and creating

725
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:23,320
healthy rites of passage for them rather than them creating their own potentially

726
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,280
disastrous rites of passage. And I believe we can do those three things.

727
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,119
Communities, 21st century life skills and healthy rites of passage.

728
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,239
We have an impact on those children and we have an impact on those

729
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,440
children's children down the track.

730
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:39,199
And we want to see it mainstream.

731
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,280
So it's about normalising it, bringing it into schools, bringing it into communities,

732
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:49,280
bringing it into families, you know, using it into sporting teams, all of those different places.

733
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,599
Yeah, it's incredible legacy that you've created and continue to do.

734
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,159
The idea of curiosity is something that we

735
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,280
see as a common trait with leaders that we're talking to.

736
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,119
And they approach their own growth and learning through curiosity.

737
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,320
And is that

738
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,800
something that resonates with you?

739
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,320
I love it.

740
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:10,079
You know, the National University of Singapore did this big piece of research

741
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:15,199
in 2017 and they were the first ones to stand up and say a child's academic

742
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,239
results at the end of year 12 are not the major determinant of their future success.

743
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,239
So what your kid gets when they finish school is not the main thing that's going

744
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,039
to determine their future success, which is pretty revolutionary comment.

745
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:33,440
And they identified nine critical 21st century life skills and curiosity was one of them.

746
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,440
So I love hearing that.

747
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:36,559
And it's interesting.

748
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,719
I got approached by a group from China who wanted me to do some work over there.

749
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,440
And I was telling them about this curiosity being a life skill.

750
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:47,559
And they said, wow, we don't do a lot of curiosity in our schools.

751
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,039
It's about how good you are at maths, how fast you can run, how skillful you are at

752
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:55,559
piano and everything you're doing is to try and get your score up.

753
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,039
So there's not a lot of room for curiosity because that's taking away from your ability

754
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:03,440
to get your score up in these things that you're being judged.

755
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:08,440
On whereas when you go to some of the progressive companies, you know,

756
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,840
some of the ones like Google give their staff, you can have one day a week to do

757
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:15,760
anything you want if you're curious about it.

758
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,840
And we're introducing into schools,

759
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:22,840
curiosity projects where a child can do a project on anything that they're curious on.

760
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,199
They might do it on bees.

761
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,159
They might do it on the pyramids.

762
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,159
They might do it on candles.

763
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:30,280
They might do it on orchids. Doesn't matter.

764
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,320
Just if there's something you're curious about, we'll give you time to

765
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:36,519
explore that. Spoke to Michael Hewitt Gleason,

766
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,480
Edward de Bono's business partner on this podcast.

767
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:44,239
And really, the two of them, that's where Google time emanated from.

768
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,519
And Jack Welsh was a big devotee of, you know, X10 thinking is Michael's language

769
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:51,559
where you spend time thinking about getting better.

770
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,760
And again, it's, you know, if it's good enough for Google and the success

771
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,760
that the Google AdWords came out of that think time, it's been the single biggest

772
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,440
commercial, you know, idea that's ever been.

773
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,599
Created in mankind.

774
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,920
You would think that we would understand

775
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,239
that more, but it still feels like an uncommon gift to share.

776
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,519
We see ladies are really conscious of how they communicate with clarity.

777
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:20,199
Is that how have you gone about communicating your message?

778
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,400
Well, I'm trying to get more and more clarity.

779
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,039
I did write a book called The Making

780
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,760
of Men Raising Boys to be Happy, Healthy and Successful.

781
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,800
Can I recommend that? Just it is brilliant.

782
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,360
And I found it really, you know, Bex here with

783
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,239
us today and I was on the plane, I was reading it on the way up and you wanted

784
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,159
to pass the page back to her, then she passed one back to me.

785
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:42,960
There's a few tears there as well around as a parent.

786
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:44,599
It's confronting sometimes.

787
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:47,639
And so I recommend if you haven't read Arnie's book, go and do it.

788
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:49,519
It's brilliant. Yeah. Thank you.

789
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:51,559
Thank you. Yes, I agree with you.

790
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,840
And we have sold twenty five thousand copies around Australia and around the world.

791
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,639
So that, you know, it's had a good impact.

792
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:01,360
But I'm writing another book and it's about,

793
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:03,360
you know, you could call it rights of passage.

794
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:05,840
It's for dummies, even though that's not what the book would be called.

795
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:11,199
But really explain I want to explain to people clearly about why rights of passage

796
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,679
are important, how we can bring them in, how we can create them.

797
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,679
And this idea of having a transformational mindset.

798
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,360
And what I mean by that, we've heard about, you know, having everyone has

799
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:25,039
a mindset and we have we can get to peak mindset.

800
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:26,679
And we talk about a growth mindset.

801
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,960
But a transformational mindset is like it's that ability to find the next thing

802
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,360
in our lives. But that's not necessarily just

803
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,880
a development from the thing that we're doing.

804
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:41,239
It's a you know, it's another step.

805
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,119
And in order to do that, we have to actually periodically remove

806
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:52,039
ourselves from our normal life space and have time, you know, time out.

807
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:54,199
We actually, you know, time to think about things.

808
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,599
And that's why going out into nature is so powerful or, you know,

809
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,199
on a well-run workshop or things like that, where we can leave everything else

810
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,280
behind and actually look at, well, hang on, let's take some time out.

811
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,559
Who am I? What's really important to me?

812
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,280
What do I want to be doing?

813
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,760
What do I want to not be doing?

814
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,320
You know,

815
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:22,679
everybody needs to periodically get those opportunities so that we can keep growing.

816
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,760
Yeah, I love it. I love the way that you think about those things.

817
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,440
It's a profound message to share.

818
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:31,679
We see leaders are really passionate about collaboration now more than ever.

819
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,360
How important is collaboration?

820
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:34,159
Been to you?

821
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,400
Oh, look, I think it's more and more important all the time.

822
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,519
I mean, when I first got involved in Rites of Passage was 1993 when we first ran

823
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:46,840
the our father son or men and boys program for twenty seven people.

824
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,000
And it was just life changing for me and I started running one a year up here.

825
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,280
And then we discovered that there were

826
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,760
other men around Australia running programs who was doing similar stuff.

827
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,280
And so we all got together and then we

828
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,960
formed a company together, which was back then called the Pathways Foundation.

829
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:03,280
And then

830
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:08,960
and now we work, you know, not only with men, we work with women and we're talking

831
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:13,440
to the to the man cave and Hunter Johnson, who they're doing incredible work in

832
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:16,559
Victoria, New South Wales about, you know, how could we collaborate?

833
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,400
You know, they're super young, super keen and they're young and ambitious and got

834
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,719
all these great facilitators and we've got lots of experience and knowledge

835
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:28,679
in different ways and what would happen if we actually collaborated.

836
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,360
And I think, you know, finding good collaborations.

837
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,519
That's that is a really incredible way to create a step change and a transformation.

838
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:40,639
Yeah, I look forward to hopefully catching up with with Hunter Johnson.

839
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,440
And I know there's a close connection there around the work that he does.

840
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:49,960
And so it sounds the power of the man cave and hopefully get to share that story

841
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,119
at some stage as well, but asking these two questions, any of all the leaders we

842
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:59,719
spoke to around who has been firstly the greatest leader in your life.

843
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,320
Who has been the greatest leader in my

844
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:03,920
life?

845
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:10,320
Well, what comes up for me is I had a mentor when I was growing up, a man named

846
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:15,199
Rene, and it was my mother's best friend's husband.

847
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,320
And he used to take me fishing and

848
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,079
on the bay in Victoria and even better was when he take me fishing at night.

849
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,400
That was like super exciting.

850
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,159
And he just talked to me and he'd share stories and he had a very colourful life.

851
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,559
And I could ask him any questions that I wanted.

852
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,280
And he treated me like.

853
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,639
He treated me like a friend.

854
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:39,599
And he was a mentor, I guess, more than a leader.

855
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,280
But he had a profound effect on my life.

856
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,039
And then there's people like Michael Trail, who was, you know, one of the he

857
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:54,239
started Macquarie Banks, one of their big departments.

858
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,199
And then he left and he set up Social Ventures Australia to set up and support

859
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,239
non-profit organisations around the country who are doing good work.

860
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:08,360
And, you know, I became very close with him and men like that who had the

861
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:13,920
opportunity to make big amounts of money, but got to a point saying, you know, it's enough.

862
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:15,119
I want to do good.

863
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,280
I want to really do good and I want to do good in the best way that I can.

864
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,440
So I've been fortunate to be around men

865
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:26,199
like Michael and other men and women who I know.

866
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,480
Someone like Jan Owen, who ran Foundation for Young Australians for so many years.

867
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:35,599
Yeah. And then I see leadership, I'll just say this in small ways.

868
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,760
I see amazing, well, not small, but leaders who are not out there on the world stage

869
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,719
doing it, but who are just good parents and soccer coaches and who are really there

870
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:50,360
and present. And I go, well, if that's not leadership, you know, what is?

871
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,199
Can I go back to Renee?

872
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,719
Was that something you think your mum set up formally to have that influence?

873
00:44:56,719 --> 00:44:57,880
Or did it happen naturally?

874
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,960
And then part two of that, I know you're concerned that we're losing

875
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,559
people's particularly for males because of, you know, you know, there's a link

876
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,480
to the horrific pedophilia that went through a generation.

877
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,639
And there's this sort of, you know,

878
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,199
an older man with a young boy now is perceived in the wrong way,

879
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:16,800
which is a bit of a tragedy. Yeah.

880
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,440
So, look, I don't think it was set up deliberately,

881
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:22,360
but I think that Renee was just a good man.

882
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,000
And the interesting thing with mentoring is that there's as much benefit for the boy

883
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:29,920
as there is so for the man as there is for the boy.

884
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:31,920
And I set up a program with the Penrith

885
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,360
Panthers in outside, well, in Penrith, outside of Sydney.

886
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:38,239
And they wanted to do a program called

887
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,000
From Boys to Men for Boys at Risk in Penrith.

888
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:44,159
And they got 16 boys and they put an ad

889
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:47,639
in the paper to see if they could get 16 mentors in the local community.

890
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:48,800
And they were targeting, you know,

891
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,239
businessmen and ex footballers and things like that.

892
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,079
And on this on the particular evening, when they were hoping 16 men would rock

893
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:00,360
up so they could match them with the 16 boys, 67 men arrived.

894
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:01,760
And there are many,

895
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,880
many men out there who want to mentor, who are good men, who want to support

896
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,679
boys and girls growing up.

897
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:14,000
And it is a tragedy because that because of the disastrous and so not OK actions

898
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:17,599
of a few that we are losing a generation of mentors.

899
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,119
And I believe that's something we need to turn around.

900
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,440
And, you know, the the role of mentors in my life has been huge.

901
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:26,719
And it's something that I actively seek

902
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,639
to go out and do and mentor boys and I have for many, many years.

903
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,760
And I continue to do.

904
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,960
Another great message to pass on.

905
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:37,320
We are passionate about collaboration and

906
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,119
what we're doing in the space I was sharing with you before at A Leader.

907
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,320
We're connecting leaders together in different diverse backgrounds and getting

908
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:49,199
them to share and support each other is a passion project through the world

909
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,400
of A Leader and part of the reason why we wanted to catch up with you so keenly today.

910
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,360
If you could collaborate with anyone on any part of your life, is there

911
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,679
someone that springs to mind?

912
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,719
Oh, well, I'm currently searching for older men

913
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:14,119
who are kind of like further down the track than I am and who I, you know, I still want mentors.

914
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:18,679
I'm 58 years old and I still want mentors, older men or older women.

915
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,519
You know, I've had some fabulous old aunties in my life who I just valued so

916
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:25,920
incredibly deeply and unfortunately, most of them are past.

917
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:28,360
I had one old auntie who she went through the war.

918
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,880
She was in a concentration camp.

919
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,880
She had the tattoo on her arm.

920
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,840
And, you know, she was the most incredible woman.

921
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:39,239
And I would spend hours and hours with her and talking about all sorts of things.

922
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,920
So I would collaborate with some older men

923
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,280
or older women who have been down the journey.

924
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,400
And I feel like the leadership I need now

925
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:55,000
and the mentoring I need is into the next stage of my life, which is sort of eldership.

926
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:58,480
I don't think it's my role to build another empire.

927
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:01,719
I think it's my role to learn how to really be

928
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,039
a good elder and I'm very interested in the elder space because I think,

929
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:10,119
you know, we've kind of lost eldering, which is so important.

930
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,159
And that's a whole nother podcast.

931
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:17,239
But yeah, so the collaborators I would be looking for are probably ones,

932
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,320
once again, who are in normal houses and look quite normal,

933
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,519
but actually have a lot of worldly experience.

934
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:27,360
And I love that you've still got that mindset, isn't it?

935
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,840
That you give so much knowledge, you've got so much to share, you mentor other people,

936
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:31,880
but you're constantly.

937
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:35,800
On that self-improvement, self-learning journey, which is the great passion that

938
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,400
we see people with that never stops, it never ends.

939
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:41,039
And that search for wisdom is there.

940
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:44,119
I feel like I've learnt an incredible amount again today.

941
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:46,079
You want to come away and you want to be a better parent.

942
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,559
I, you know, the rites of passage just resonate so strongly.

943
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,639
I feel like I need to apologise to Sam and Sienna at 19 and 17, didn't find you quick

944
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,880
enough, but look out Will and Max, our two youngest.

945
00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:00,840
I couldn't think of anything more worthwhile than coming up here and and

946
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,440
benefiting from the great thing that you've brought back, hopefully to mainstream.

947
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,199
It's been a great pleasure to spend some time with you.

948
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:07,280
Thanks again. Thank you.

949
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:12,360
Thanks for coming. And thanks for interviewing me.

950
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,199
