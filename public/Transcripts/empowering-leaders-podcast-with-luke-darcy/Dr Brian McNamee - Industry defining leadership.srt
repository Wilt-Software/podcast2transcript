1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:11,240
How do you take over a business that many experts have said has no future

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,580
and turn it into a global powerhouse?

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,359
What are the tangible traits that make one leader different from another?

4
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,899
My predecessor was very unhappy that he had been pushed out by the shareholder.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,719
He announced to the staff on my appointment that I was the worst choice imaginable.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,600
And so to some degree, my leadership style at that stage was just trying to encourage

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,320
an organisation to have belief in the future.

8
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:39,439
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,240
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field has been a lifelong

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,100
passion of mine.

11
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:49,140
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective and have had the privilege

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,700
of working with thousands of leaders in education, sport, industry and the arts that have helped

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,359
shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership where everyone has a voice.

14
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:03,939
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

15
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:24,700
For over 20 years, Dr. Brian McNamee was the CEO of CSL.

16
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:30,879
In 1999, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories was a small government-owned business valued

17
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,560
at little more than the buildings and land they were located on.

18
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:38,680
Incredibly, under Brian's leadership, it has been transformed into Australia's biggest

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,219
company with 25,000 employees in more than 35 countries.

20
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,939
Regarded by many as an outlier in corporate Australia for his unique thinking, Brian has

21
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:53,340
been at the head of CSL's decision-making and continues to be a leader in one of the

22
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,739
world's most important industries.

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,519
Well, Brian McNamee is without question one of Australia's most successful and revered

24
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,019
CEOs.

25
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,319
Having graduated with a degree in medicine, Brian initially looked to be following brother

26
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,000
Paul, who many know as an Australian Davis Cup legend, former world number one doubles

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,159
player on the professional tennis circuit.

28
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,259
Instead, Brian turned his attention to the world of commercial medicine, working initially

29
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:20,960
in Australia for folding, then the startup with Pacific Biotech.

30
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:25,520
Before being headhunted at 33 years of age to run the government-owned Commonwealth

31
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,099
Serum Laboratories that dealt mainly in flu vaccines, antibiotics, and plasma products.

32
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:36,500
On his retirement as CEO 23 years later, CSL had remarkably grown to a valuation of $28.5

33
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:42,539
billion, was bringing in revenue in excess of $5 billion a year, employing 11,000 staff

34
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:43,759
in 27 countries.

35
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:48,879
Brian is currently the chairman of CSL, which has now gone past the Commonwealth Bank as

36
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,219
Australia's biggest company.

37
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:50,960
Brian, thank you so much for joining us.

38
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:52,599
It's great to catch up with you today.

39
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,580
It's an extraordinary story of success.

40
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:59,000
When you look back at that long list of achievements, what's the overriding emotion for you?

41
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:03,259
Well, look, I think there's one little thing you missed in the introduction, which I'd

42
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:07,560
like to just highlight, was how tennis helped create me in the opportunity.

43
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:12,259
Because when I'd finished medicine and I practiced for a couple of years and my wife, we'd met

44
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:16,039
at medical school, we decided to have a gap year and I actually went overseas playing

45
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:16,360
tennis.

46
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,960
And during that time, I met people who were the president.

47
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:24,159
I met people who were the president of the club and they wanted me to come back the following

48
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:24,800
year to play.

49
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,520
And Cologne was a very big pharmaceutical centre.

50
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,879
So I actually joined the pharmaceutical industry, partly to play club tennis.

51
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,620
So that's a sliding door moment in life, Brian, clearly, that you wanted to continue living

52
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,960
overseas and playing tennis.

53
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:41,580
And so there was no draw to that world.

54
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,780
It was literally, hey, we've got an opportunity for you work-wise and that's where it started.

55
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:46,560
Look, it is interesting.

56
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,520
I mean, I did medicine.

57
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,840
I did medicine.

58
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,699
I did medicine at that time.

59
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,219
And for me, it was a course I got into.

60
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,419
I loved being a medical student.

61
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,699
I had great friends in medicine.

62
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,800
I'm not sure I was a great, I believe there's more to the world than merely just doing medicine.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,960
And so I had a couple of friends who are entrepreneurs who we used to play intervarsity tennis together.

64
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,139
And I saw their entrepreneurial life and how business could be interesting.

65
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,699
I came from a very non-business family.

66
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:16,720
My dad was a fireman.

67
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,079
Mum was a schoolteacher.

68
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,699
And I thought, look, that's interesting.

69
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,680
I wonder what's on the other side of the fence.

70
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:28,060
And so when the opportunity in Germany came up, I saw it as a low-risk option, something

71
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,740
interesting to do, and to some degree haven't looked back.

72
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,860
But it was very much a sliding door moment, uncharted territory, and really got there

73
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,420
through tennis.

74
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:42,959
The CSL story is one of Australia's greatest ever success stories.

75
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,100
And it's fascinating to think 33 years of age is a pretty young leader.

76
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,639
And when you look back, I mean, was your vision as big?

77
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,899
Because it's turned out to be.

78
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,360
And what sort of leader were you at that age taking over a government business?

79
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,139
So there are really a couple of things in that.

80
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,939
I mean, if I look back, when I first joined Foldings, that was a big opportunity in Adelaide

81
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:09,560
because I went from managing no staff to running a large group and then manufacturing.

82
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,339
So I ended up with 300 staff, and I was still only 28 at the time.

83
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:20,620
And really, I guess I learned from the Foldings experience, and they sent me to a six-week,

84
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,600
six-week management course to sort of do an MBA, which originally I was thinking of

85
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,300
doing a more full-time MBA.

86
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,660
But I was asked during that course, you know, what are you here for?

87
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,839
And I said, well, really, I'm here to try and create a great Australian pharmaceutical

88
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,379
company.

89
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,480
I said, we don't have one.

90
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:38,540
I'm not really sure how we're going to do it, but to some degree, that's really what

91
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,199
I'd like to do.

92
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,720
And so if you look at the CSL opportunity in that prism of what I thought was an interesting

93
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
opportunity, to some degree...

94
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,660
CSL had the ingredients for success, but its ownership structure, its culture, and

95
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,100
its history held it back incredibly.

96
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,500
I mean, a government bureaucracy, federal ministers who really tried to dominate the

97
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,839
company and tell it what to do, poor prices for products because we had very little negotiating

98
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,540
power with the Commonwealth.

99
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,180
So to some degree, we were just a downtrodden organization that probably peaked in the 50s

100
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,819
and 60s.

101
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,579
And thereafter was really managed.

102
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:27,100
To help the Federal Department of Health manage their budget by controlling prices,

103
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:29,680
not by trying to be successful.

104
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:35,540
So to some degree, John Button, you know, some of you listeners may not know John, but

105
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:41,160
he was arguably one of our great Australian industry ministers who had a vision for many

106
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,800
industries, car industry included, but also the pharmaceutical industry.

107
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,699
It was John who tapped me on the shoulder and said, look, you know, come and have a

108
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,420
look at this job.

109
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,519
So we had to...

110
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:57,120
We had to try and turn the whole organization's thinking about what we can do now to try and

111
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,579
be a competitive company looking forward, rather than think about, weren't we great

112
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:03,259
because we delivered polio and insulin?

113
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,500
And they were great things.

114
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:07,500
Vaccination, plasma proteins originally.

115
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:14,639
Our problem was, like many Australian companies though, we were a completely technologically

116
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,579
dependent company.

117
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,259
We hadn't invented a product ourselves in 80 years.

118
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,579
So we'd cap in hand.

119
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,860
We'd have to go overseas and try and plead with big companies, Merck, Baxter, or whomever.

120
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,240
Can we license your product for the Australian market?

121
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,980
That was the card we played.

122
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:35,420
And I, you know, talked to John Button a lot and said, look, we have to get past that.

123
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,920
We have to actually develop our own products.

124
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,680
We have to have manufacturing plants of a sufficient scale.

125
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,939
We have to narrow the company down.

126
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,279
We have to invest more in R&D to have a chance.

127
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,240
And to some degree, I mean, the company was truly not well regarded.

128
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,319
At the time I took over, Anderson Consulting did a report for the government valuing the

129
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,680
entire company at $23 million, including the Parkville land.

130
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,959
They hadn't had positive cash flow, I think, for 10 to 12 years when I arrived.

131
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,459
So this was a difficult time.

132
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,139
But there was some really competent, true believers inside the company that these are

133
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,120
the people you've got to find.

134
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,339
I mean, when you're new in a job, most people are going to sit on the sidelines and watch

135
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:22,220
how you behave and what you're doing.

136
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,439
And, you know, does this person really make a difference?

137
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,519
So most people are really what I call passive and independent.

138
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:31,680
You'll have a few that are throwing grenades from the sidelines and you just have to have

139
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,299
to learn to catch them and throw them back.

140
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,919
But occasionally you'll feel nuggets of gold.

141
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,279
The people who do want to sign up and believe in the new vision and the new ideas and the

142
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:42,720
opportunity.

143
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,720
And you've got to try and win them over and you've got to find those people.

144
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,500
And they're not always your direct reports, I can assure you.

145
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,220
So it's a matter of trying.

146
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,500
You have to do that in such a way that the organization doesn't tear itself apart, but

147
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,320
in fact, reorients itself for the future.

148
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:02,620
I understand that the Anderson Report recommended the company fold and sell off the assets.

149
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,620
And that valuation, as you said, was probably the equivalent of the land.

150
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,840
Your former outgoing CEO says you're the worst possible appointment.

151
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,840
It's a lot on your plate from day one.

152
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,539
There's so much to unpack from what you said, but you said finding those little nuggets

153
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:19,840
of support.

154
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,740
And they weren't necessarily coming from the leadership team.

155
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,940
And how did you go about doing that?

156
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,899
Can you explain that a bit more?

157
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,320
Well, it is interesting.

158
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,799
I mean, I'm always a great believer that it's great to meet a lot of people and wander around

159
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,580
and talk to a lot of people.

160
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,860
I try to be very mobile.

161
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,440
Previously, CSO had been a very bureaucratic, or Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, very bureaucratic

162
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,539
government organization.

163
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,639
You'd have paperwork would shuffle up and the answer would shuffle down the organization.

164
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,460
So obviously, I was young.

165
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,919
And, you know, fresh air, really, at the company.

166
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:56,759
So I would always try and find the most expert person on a topic and ask them what they thought.

167
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,740
What do you think we should be doing?

168
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,399
And part of it was, we should be stopped doing some of the things that they were doing today.

169
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:10,580
So I think one of the best things I did early on was there was an alternative research group

170
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,259
out at Monash University that the company had put a lot of money into, but it was unclear

171
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:17,440
it was actually going anywhere.

172
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,360
And so I took the decision.

173
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,639
We'd sell the company and my first best deal at CSO was to sell that company for a dollar

174
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,580
because it saved me like a four or five million dollar shutdown costs.

175
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,320
So I gave the company away to Kyron, a US biotech company, a dollar.

176
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:33,820
Wow.

177
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,399
So we framed that.

178
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,039
That was our first big deal, selling a company for a dollar.

179
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,340
Well, one of the quotes I've heard, there's many attributed to you.

180
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,000
The success of CSO was under the stewardship of Brian McNamee was in no small part due

181
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
to his exemplary strategic and collaborative skills.

182
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,720
So I think it's important to have a collaborative leadership style.

183
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,879
I hear you talking about that, actually asking people, finding out what they thought and

184
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,320
in some ways what was needed and what was needed to stop.

185
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,940
I mean, was that collaborative leadership style come naturally to you or did you think

186
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,179
that was just the best way forward?

187
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,840
Look, I think it does come naturally to me.

188
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:12,500
I mean, I try to have as little hierarchy and bureaucracy in the company and try to

189
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:18,279
encourage the people that they had the answers.

190
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,320
I didn't have all.

191
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,100
And that took a while for people to sort of accept.

192
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,820
When I first joined the company, people would say, well, tell me what you want me to do.

193
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:28,259
I'd say, I don't know.

194
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,940
You tell me, what do you think you should be doing?

195
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,600
I don't have all the answers.

196
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,960
It's my job to try and draw out of you.

197
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,039
You're the experts.

198
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,639
Many of you were technical experts.

199
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:40,460
What do you think are our best opportunities and how do we set that up?

200
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:42,799
So it was a very different change.

201
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,799
And of course, not everyone in the old government-owned Commonwealth Serum Labs could cope with that.

202
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,220
So we ended up with resignation.

203
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,980
We had, obviously, a big redundancy program early on, trying to clean the place out a little bit.

204
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:05,580
But the ones who wanted to succeed, because to some degree, these people I'd identified,

205
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:10,299
they were almost embarrassed by what Commonwealth Serum Laboratories had become.

206
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,120
It was originally in the 60s and 50s, 60s, a great organization.

207
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:16,919
But it really had declined materially.

208
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:23,539
And if the card they were only playing was either a begging bowl, where they'd go to

209
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:27,580
Canberra to ask for more money, or they'd go to the US or Europe and beg for a license

210
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,460
for a product, really what I'd call a demoralizing business plan.

211
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,340
And so I said, no, we're stopping all that.

212
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:39,519
We're going to fund our own future ourselves by saving money in lots of places.

213
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:41,480
And we're going to reinvest in the future.

214
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:42,940
And we're going to make our own products.

215
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,279
We're going to make our own products.

216
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,779
And we're going to go.

217
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:52,860
To the US market, which completely spooked the government as well, because they were

218
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,559
fearful of liability laws in the US, et cetera.

219
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,399
So one of the other things we were able to do was to persuade the government they could

220
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,139
not hold a share once we were once privatized.

221
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,620
Do not own a single share in the company, because to some degree, you will hold us back.

222
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,679
Give us our freedom.

223
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,879
Give us our opportunity.

224
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,720
And we negotiated a particular deal at Broadmeadows to achieve.

225
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:21,320
But in essence, we had to persuade the staff.

226
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,919
We were standing on our own two feet.

227
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,179
There was no going back to Canberra for money.

228
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:33,840
And I think if nothing else, I'd say I'm a great believer in competition to instill that

229
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,279
fear as well as motivation into an organization to improve.

230
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:42,519
If you take that away, it's actually very hard.

231
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,580
You can't subsidize yourself to success, I don't think.

232
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:46,700
Well, the title.

233
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:48,519
The title of this is Empowering Leadership, Brian.

234
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,820
And clearly, you're ahead of your time in that.

235
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,379
I've worked in the TV industry for a long period of time.

236
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:57,700
Some of the best ideas that I've heard come from the cameramen and the crew that work

237
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,379
behind the scenes.

238
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
They're TV fanatics.

239
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,440
They know the industry inside out, but no one tends to ask them their thoughts.

240
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:08,860
And so there's a wasted opportunity in expertise in my mind when you sort of centralize the

241
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,279
good ideas can only come from a handful of people.

242
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:12,659
Yeah, and it's dangerous, isn't it?

243
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,559
You get a group think.

244
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,440
And to some degree.

245
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:18,500
And that's the challenge.

246
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,559
And it's really, it's that having the antenna up.

247
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:24,759
I mean, I'm a great believer in this, having an antenna when you walk around an organization.

248
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,440
Like, people are always amazed.

249
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,779
I mean, I used to have free days often at the company.

250
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,240
I'd have no meetings organized.

251
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,480
I mean, previously at CSL, everyone had rigid, you know, there were meetings all the time.

252
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,639
And I'd say, no, no, I don't.

253
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:41,620
I just wander around, talk to people, see what they're doing in the lab, understand what they're

254
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,000
up to.

255
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,639
And so just try to, and then just by talking to people about what they're doing and what they're doing,

256
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:50,799
why they're doing it, how they're doing it, could we do it better or could we do it faster?

257
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,080
You learn a lot.

258
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,200
And after a while, you really start learning who the really smart people are.

259
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,679
They may not be the most educated.

260
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,580
Sometimes they are.

261
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,279
But I call them the pickers.

262
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,100
Who are the people with the smarts?

263
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,360
This combination of insight, education, and cunning.

264
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,639
And all business needs cunning, by the way.

265
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,360
You know, it's not a negative term.

266
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,279
You need to be smart.

267
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,639
And so it's finding those people who could.

268
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:21,419
Help us in all our divisions, because we're a multi-divisional company at the time,

269
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,820
try and create a pathway for growth and opportunity.

270
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,159
Why the pickers?

271
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,299
Why do they turn the pickers?

272
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:28,639
Yeah.

273
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:34,039
Well, because they're really good at picking the right products, the right market to enter,

274
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,259
the right opportunity.

275
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,559
Because in our industry, like many industries, often strategy is as much about deciding what

276
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,980
not to do as it is deciding what to do.

277
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,720
Because sometimes you can have too many things.

278
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,779
You can have too many things in front of you, and you'll get lost.

279
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:53,659
And what I see is many organizations just, they sort of embark on so many different initiatives

280
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:57,120
that it's unclear what the important ones are.

281
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,500
And I've tried to simplify CSL.

282
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:06,639
So when I first joined the company, they had a big TQM, total quality management program,

283
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,539
which I said, that's great, but I don't know, who put quality first at the company?

284
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:12,539
Why is that?

285
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:13,539
What happened to new products?

286
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,539
What happened to customers?

287
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:15,539
What happened to patients?

288
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:16,539
So, yeah.

289
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:19,620
So I said, look, can we just turn this around?

290
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,899
I think quality is given.

291
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:29,299
The question is, it's more about what are we going to do and which markets, which products,

292
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:31,539
which technologies, they're the key questions.

293
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:37,039
And you need so-called pickers, and it's often a very small number, who can integrate all

294
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,000
those things and actually help you make the best choices.

295
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,419
And so you look at CSL and that you're currently the chairman of, it now employs 25,000 people,

296
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:46,419
35 countries.

297
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:50,860
There'll be Australian leaders listening to this who want to try and compete on the

298
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,860
world stage.

299
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:57,179
How did you get to that level where not only compete, but you're a market leader worldwide?

300
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:58,179
Yeah.

301
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:02,220
Well, I mean, to some degree, you try not to get ahead of yourself.

302
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:08,799
I mean, looking back, it does look remarkable, but each of them were just steps, rational

303
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,500
steps, where we try to de-risk each important step.

304
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
We had a belief though, that you have to be...

305
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,380
Yeah.

306
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,420
Yeah.

307
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,940
To be successful in our industry, you need to have...

308
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,859
You need to operate in US and Europe and be successful in that scale.

309
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:28,980
So the challenge for many Australian companies is that may not be possible.

310
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:35,640
I mean, many of the larger Australian companies, their predominant job is extracting margin

311
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,039
from the Australian public.

312
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,039
That's what they're good at.

313
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,400
Do I think the telcos here are very good?

314
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Probably not.

315
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,660
They're not bad at charging.

316
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,859
It's probably their core skill.

317
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:45,859
I mean, they do some other decent things.

318
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:48,099
But do I think they could be global telco companies?

319
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:49,099
No, not a chance.

320
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:50,099
Not a chance in hell.

321
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:53,279
Could an Australian telco have a global impact if it had a different vision?

322
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,500
I don't think so.

323
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,759
It would surprise me.

324
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:57,759
Whereas I think that...

325
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,720
See, the features I'm looking for in companies that can be global is you really need to have...

326
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,859
You need to be in a sector where you have a lot of competition domestically.

327
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:12,779
So you've honed your skills against competition, true global competition.

328
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:14,700
You need to have high regulatory standards.

329
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,720
Because you can't discount your way to success globally, I don't think.

330
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
You've got to have...

331
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:25,319
So we in healthcare and other industries, we have high regulatory standards so that

332
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:29,539
we have products and processes, if we can compete with Merck and other companies who

333
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:33,880
can import product very cheaply, we at least have a chance.

334
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,240
And then you've got to work out, and in what areas can we be competitive?

335
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,259
Because you don't want to go head to head with Roche and the other huge companies.

336
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:43,940
So what niches can you operate?

337
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,480
You think that you can expand sufficiently in that will create value for you and your

338
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,539
shareholders and create a competitive moat.

339
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:58,519
So all great businesses have competitive moats and they're always looking for ways to make

340
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:05,559
them deeper and broader and make the competitive challenge for new entrants harder and harder.

341
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:07,500
And that's how you have to think about your business.

342
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,960
And so again, going back to many of the Australian companies, their moat is Australia.

343
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:21,440
And their access to the Australian retail public and the wires or the bank branches,

344
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,200
that is their card.

345
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,519
Their card isn't something that is exactly able to be globalized.

346
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:28,680
And so what happens when they go overseas?

347
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,680
They blow up.

348
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
They lose money.

349
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,900
Well, that's partly because if you look back, actually what makes them successful here is

350
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,720
not what would make them easily to take that offshore.

351
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,559
So you look at their story of growth and I love that term.

352
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:48,000
You used about building a moat and deepening that around, but the scale, and we've mentioned

353
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,220
a number of times from a company that was effectively about to be wound up or advised

354
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,799
to be to a market cap now of 150 billion or thereabouts.

355
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:00,339
So from a growth and scale point of view, a lot of people want to achieve that, that

356
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:02,880
are listening and trying to grow their business.

357
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,599
What sort of advice would you give?

358
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:09,839
The scoreboard is the result of what you've done and the success you've embedded in the

359
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:10,839
business.

360
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:11,839
It's not the ambition.

361
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,119
The scoreboard is not the ambition.

362
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,259
It's a bit like, you're not a tennis player walking out the court saying, I really want

363
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:18,079
to win six, three, six, four today.

364
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,079
You don't.

365
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,079
You try and win every point.

366
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:23,339
If you win more points, you win more games, you win more games, you win more sets.

367
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:27,559
So to some degree, and if I want to improve, I work on my backhand and you might ask me

368
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,359
what was wrong with my tennis was my backhand, a really weak backhand.

369
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,440
So it was pretty clear.

370
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:39,279
So to some degree, the scoreboard will look after itself if you have a winning game plan

371
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,279
that you can actually then take.

372
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,279
So that's the mindset.

373
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:58,740
It's about creating a company and having a skill base that is superb, that the world

374
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,680
wants to a degree.

375
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,279
So you can't just merely go overseas because you're fat and happy here.

376
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:10,519
Well, it's a great leadership story on so many levels and so much intrigue.

377
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:15,059
Intrigue for me and lessons to learn from what you've done over a long period of time.

378
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:18,200
I want to change tack, Ryan, I'm fascinated to talk to you about this.

379
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,759
We both live in the city of Melbourne that's unfortunately got the record as the most locked

380
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:27,140
down city in the world and the challenges that came with that in the COVID period.

381
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,380
And I thought your leadership through this time, you have been prepared with your platform

382
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,880
to stand up and question the mainstream narrative and ask, and in fact, I think you were quoted

383
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,880
along these lines.

384
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,519
Where are the checks and balances?

385
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,140
The expert, independent advice, the data, the scientific explanation, including objectives

386
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,279
and finally the pivotal role of parliament.

387
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:49,920
I had a lot of admiration to hear you talk out in this time.

388
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,759
What compelled you to do that?

389
00:21:51,759 --> 00:22:01,099
Well, look, I think it was a degree of frustration that I could see that many of our civil liberties

390
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:08,359
and our rights had been significantly eroded and you'd want to believe that it was done

391
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,359
in a coherent.

392
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:11,119
In a coherent and reasonable way.

393
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:17,400
And I just felt at that time, probably it was not unreasonable to question as an example,

394
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,940
I would say the curfew.

395
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,140
If we just use the curfew as an example, probably as a curfew that tipped me over, I could see

396
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,660
very little medical rationale for the curfew.

397
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:29,180
For those that don't understand, Melbourne lived through a long extended period where

398
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:34,019
you went to let out of your house after 9pm and there didn't seem to be a medical reason

399
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,019
for it.

400
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:37,359
Well, I tried to understand where was the medical advice.

401
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:46,400
And in fact, I was talking to somebody who said, look, there was no medical advice.

402
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,039
It was for police rostering reasons.

403
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:50,599
It was the police commissioner who requested.

404
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:53,839
So I then got on the front foot because I think the police commissioner is a really

405
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,839
good guy.

406
00:22:54,839 --> 00:23:00,019
And I said, look, if the police commissioner is willing to lock up his fellow citizens

407
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:04,599
on the basis of a rostering benefit, I think that's completely unreasonable and he should

408
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,900
resign.

409
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,119
So he then went onto the radio station.

410
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,359
The next morning, apparently, on Neil Mitchell and said, wasn't me.

411
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,000
I wasn't the one who requested this.

412
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,680
And then the chief medical officer came out and said, well, it wasn't me either.

413
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,799
Now I'm not saying anyone else has put up their hand, but in essence, that's a good

414
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:31,460
example where there was something that was initiated that was not on medical or scientific

415
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,140
basis.

416
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,039
And the police, I think reluctantly in essence, have been asked to do it.

417
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,279
They do a lot of difficult things.

418
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:39,279
They've done difficult things.

419
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,240
Children's playgrounds, forget the curfew, children's playgrounds, stopping children.

420
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,839
I mean, I think I feel for the place.

421
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,440
So I would say you, we will all look back and think there was some remarkable things

422
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:57,500
asked of our police officers and others that don't really stand reasonable scrutiny.

423
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,799
And Brian, it felt to me through that time and for me, other people in other states of

424
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:05,799
Australia, very hard to live through and understand the experience that wasn't yours because most

425
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:06,799
of the other states effectively.

426
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:12,319
We had nothing like the challenges that Melbourne faced and how onerous it was and healthy people.

427
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:17,680
For me, the lack of discussion around the social and economic impacts of what it is

428
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,680
to lock down a community.

429
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,519
And we saw some of the numbers coming out in mental health issues and particularly young

430
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:26,539
kids who missed two years of school, for them there not to be debate in that, Brian, I found

431
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:27,539
that very challenging.

432
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:31,099
Look, there's no doubt there was a lot of difficult decisions had to be made.

433
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:35,319
I certainly accept that there wasn't an easy, but look, to some degree, many of us would

434
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,319
have preferred.

435
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,880
I mean, you and I, I'm sure lived very well, relatively speaking through that.

436
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,839
So it's not about us.

437
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:46,000
It's just about, you know, I know a lot of small business people and others.

438
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,660
It's been very difficult for them, very difficult for them.

439
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,539
So I just think we need to be careful.

440
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:59,359
You know, people have fought and died for the rights that we have, and we've got to

441
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:04,680
be very mindful not to try and erode those quickly.

442
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,680
Although I'm recognizing that it was a very nasty.

443
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:06,720
Yeah.

444
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,599
Very nasty virus and a very nasty pandemic.

445
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:14,299
So no one's not saying that there were a number of appropriate policies also.

446
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:15,299
Yeah.

447
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:19,039
I just, I think many of us would prefer there was better checks and balances.

448
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,039
Yeah.

449
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:23,880
And the idea of we're talking collaborative leadership and getting experts and a range

450
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,500
of opinions, people like you who've clearly got a history in these areas.

451
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,180
Can I go to another controversial area, Brian, one that's caused a lot of debate is the biggest

452
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,920
vaccine manufacturer in Australia.

453
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,680
There's a lot of angst around.

454
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,319
I think it's just a big bubble.

455
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,319
In this country.

456
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:40,779
It's a little too much.

457
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:42,759
I think we need to be more version of ourselves.

458
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:43,759
I think we need to be out there.

459
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,140
We need to be able to we're you know, we've run a lot of try and get our women into the

460
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,140
oligarchy, we need to be able to do more of the commercialised work.

461
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,140
And I think, you know, when we think about the pandemic, it's the mostthing that I think

462
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,140
has saved a lot of people.

463
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,140
It's the colony.

464
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,140
It's the way that we've lived in.

465
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,140
I think that we're expecting that by the end of the pandemic, we'll be more sort of

466
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,140
of a global leader in the economic world.

467
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,140
It's one of the big things, it's part of the life of our society.

468
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,140
Right.

469
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,839
to do brave things. We ask our police to do brave things. We ask many people to do brave things

470
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:06,660
for the community. So mandatory vaccine is really about asking fellow citizens to

471
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:14,039
protect their fellow citizens. That's really what they're asking. So the point of the mandatory is

472
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:20,480
not, it shouldn't be about you. It's about, is it reasonable for me to be a member of this society

473
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,319
and accepting my responsibility to try and help protect my fellow citizens? So in that context,

474
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:35,359
I don't think it's reasonable to say, I'm so special. I'm so special. I don't need to be,

475
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:42,619
I don't need to do that. I'm happy for the rest of you to carry the load. So on balance,

476
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:46,799
it's very difficult, but on balance, I think it's not unreasonable policy. And I think,

477
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,460
I think the Andrews government's done a good job making it mandatory.

478
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,799
Because it's actually clearly has increased vaccination rates.

479
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:01,539
Is there a concern that those things aren't, the medical products effectively don't become a choice

480
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:06,579
and that opens the door? Then we're talking about, I understand your point. And I also understand the

481
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:13,599
idea that it increases the rate. For me, the concept that individuals have, what is a private

482
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:20,460
medical discussion effectively taken out of their hands, seems like a huge response to the issue.

483
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,079
Look, you might, but I'm not going to agree with that. I think I've accepted I wear a seatbelt

484
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:30,960
when I drive a car. Is a seatbelt annoying sometimes? Sure it is. It's hot days, it's

485
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,619
annoying. Why we don't, because the data is pretty clear. Drink driving. I mean,

486
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,380
we have drink driving rules, which are relatively strict. Why do we have them? Because

487
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:48,920
the societal benefit is greater than the individual's right to get drunk. So I'm not

488
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,460
really sure there's much difference. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

489
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,119
know. There's a difference here that where I'm saying mandatory vaccination is about your

490
00:27:54,119 --> 00:28:00,039
collective responsibility to your fellow citizens. And you will also get a benefit as well. It's a

491
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:07,720
dual benefit. But I don't think that, I don't, I don't find this much evidence to say that I'm so

492
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:14,759
special. I'm so special that I don't need to do that. Well, what I appreciate, and this is what I

493
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:18,059
think has been a lost art in this time, is that people are nervous to have these conversations,

494
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,240
that if you even ask the question I ask,

495
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,519
can get categorized and you, you know, it seems to me that we're in a, in a, in a position getting

496
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:31,539
back to leadership where we're not able to, you know, have this conversation or other conversations

497
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:34,940
like you have in terms of the lockdown, the response to this. It seems as though we've

498
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,859
decamped. You're either in or out, hero or zero. Well, you can say I'm in both, you know,

499
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:44,819
because I try to be reasonable. I mean, I, I think many things they've done was quite acceptable.

500
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,720
And there are the edges, there are things that I wasn't happy with, which I spoke out about, but

501
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:56,160
on mandatory vaccination, look on balance. I mean, it's a bit like, is it reasonable to ask

502
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:02,900
parents to vaccinate their children? Yes, it is. Because, you know, vaccination is fundamentally

503
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:08,079
important for a number of diseases and the evidence is so compelling. There's probably

504
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:15,799
been no better medical innovation than vaccination for the last hundred years. So to some degree,

505
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:19,279
I think it's got lost.

506
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,039
The benefit of vaccination has been lost in the other debate. And I think we need to separate

507
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:30,079
the two. And I'd really encourage anyone who hears this, please get vaccinated. I don't think

508
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:42,670
there's any medical rational reason for you not to be vaccinated. Changing gear again, slightly,

509
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:49,450
Brian, I did read an anecdote where at one point you actually were in hospital yourself and that

510
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:54,269
you were running CSL from the hospital bed and you're still able to, to, to do your job effectively.

511
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,490
Can I ask you the question?

512
00:29:56,089 --> 00:29:58,750
In terms of being as successful you are as you've been in business,

513
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,250
can you do that with life balance at the same time?

514
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:07,569
Running, running a company? Look, I think, well, I think you have to, by the way, I think you have

515
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:11,029
to have a degree of balance. It doesn't mean you're going to be, not going to be really busy

516
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:18,569
and, and manage your time. But I, I always wanted to have balanced people running the company

517
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:24,470
because they, they imbue the right values. So I, I took a view that to some degree CSL is a factory.

518
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:28,609
I would get to work early. We're all, we're all, we're all at work or catching up by 6.30,

519
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:34,069
7 in the morning. But I always wanted people to be home for dinner. So we didn't have a culture

520
00:30:34,069 --> 00:30:38,710
where people would stay late at night. I don't like that culture in a workplace. I think I want

521
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:43,670
people to get to work, do your work and go home. That's what society, now, of course, now we've got

522
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:50,089
remotes, but put that to one side. I think you want people to have balance. And, and I think,

523
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:53,950
of course, we all had to travel a lot. And so we'd ask a lot of families that,

524
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:58,990
that obviously people were away a lot of weekends, but, but you're trying to get that

525
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:06,529
balance right. I, I, I mean, I don't, it's hard to trust someone completely in my view,

526
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:12,349
if they're so monodimensional, that's, that's, that's all they can see. At the end of the day,

527
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:18,630
you want an organization that understands they have a social license of what they're doing.

528
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:24,390
They have responsibility to the staff and to the families. And, and, uh, you,

529
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:29,730
you cannot be unreasonable what you ask. I want to go, uh, back to where we started a

530
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:34,609
little bit. The McNamee name, uh, is a synonymous with Australian sport and, uh, and clearly,

531
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:38,549
you know, Paul's achievements in, in tennis, extraordinary, but, um, people might know

532
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:44,450
there is an amazing DNA, uh, in the McNamee family on your mother's side, uh, your uncle,

533
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:48,190
Dick Reynolds, uh, many regard as one of Australian rules football's finest ever players,

534
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:52,569
a triple Brownlow medalist. Uh, your father, I understand was an extraordinarily talented

535
00:31:52,569 --> 00:31:54,250
sportsman. Can you give us a little bit of that history?

536
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:59,130
Maybe the overlap for you on what sports done for you in your leadership and your business

537
00:31:59,130 --> 00:31:59,710
life as well.

538
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:03,750
I mean, there's no, we're very fortunate in Australia with the Australian culture and

539
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:09,750
the opportunity to play sport, team sports, individual sports, um, I think is, is, is,

540
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:14,990
is a wonderful thing we have as part of our society. So yeah, dad, uh, uncle Dick, uh,

541
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:19,089
mum's older brother. And by the way, mum's turning a hundred on Thursday. So it's a big,

542
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:20,569
a big, big week for us this week.

543
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:22,670
Happy birthday. What an extraordinary day.

544
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,490
Yeah, so mum's turning a hundred.

545
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:24,069
How is she?

546
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:28,589
Great. She's great. So we're, we're having it at my sister's place and, uh, you know,

547
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:33,109
mum's really sharp on the ball. Um, so that's very sweet. But, uh, so mum was the younger

548
00:32:33,109 --> 00:32:38,269
sister of Dick. Um, obviously we found some footage, that wonderful footage that Essendon

549
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:44,950
showing, uh, of, uh, on Fox of the various, um, Essendon, um, uh, series. There's actually

550
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:50,190
some footage of mum standing in the, uh, as a young girl, uh, watching uncle Dick run

551
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:54,269
out in the ground. It was fantastic for all of us to see. So, I mean, that was great.

552
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:59,410
Uh, but you're right. Dad was, uh, you know, country boy came to the city late, but a great

553
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:05,549
athlete, uh, in tennis, cricket, football, uh, golf. Uh, when people tell me, you know,

554
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:09,569
they're too old to take up golf. And I said, well, look, dad took it up at 51. He was off

555
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:15,190
six at 53. So, you know, that's the standard you have to meet, you know, no excuses, you

556
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:19,390
know? So yeah, dad was, uh, dad loved his sport. Mum and dad loved their sport. Big

557
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:24,450
part of our lives. Um, and, uh, it, it takes you to other places. You know, it's, it's,

558
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:28,609
you meet other people, you learn about winning and losing. You learn about improving. You

559
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:33,650
learn about yourself, you know, tennis courts. Funnily enough, it's quite a lonely place

560
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:37,690
to tennis court when you're playing badly, I can assure you. And I obviously had that,

561
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:42,009
did that too often. But, uh, look, I, you know, I think, yeah, so sport's wonderful.

562
00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:45,990
Yeah. Yeah. Your dad's golfing achievement out of all the stories, we're talking about

563
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:50,910
the great Dick Reynolds, but that is extraordinary at 51 to take it up and be off six, uh, two

564
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:54,410
years later is, uh, is quite remarkable. Brian, I had the great privilege to speak

565
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:58,289
to a range of different leaders, different backgrounds, different, uh, uh, areas of

566
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:03,430
expertise and, and your story resonates, uh, on so many levels. And we're seeing in our

567
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:08,190
world of leadership, uh, a number of different dimensions of different leaders that we think

568
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,789
is common to great leaders like yourself. And I wanted to ask you about some of those

569
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:15,849
dimensions. When I ask you about self-leadership, what does that mean to you?

570
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,809
Ooh, that's not a term I'd use really. Um, I mean, I think, uh.

571
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,650
Why not? Why not self-leadership?

572
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:24,389
I'm not sure what that, uh, well, you have to,

573
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:25,110
define it for me.

574
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:29,489
Well, for me, it's that your sense of self as a, as a person and how you lead yourself

575
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:30,670
and where that starts. And.

576
00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:34,909
There's no doubt. I mean, you have to be happy in your own skin. There's no doubt. If we,

577
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:40,489
if we use that as the same analogy. Yeah. You have to be, I mean, you have, people have

578
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:46,829
to believe in you and your judgment and your behavior and, and the way that you did deal

579
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:51,909
fairly with people the whole time, your insights. People want to believe that they're, that

580
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:54,389
the people working for are smart and not, not naive.

581
00:34:54,409 --> 00:35:01,730
I think. And really they, they can trust them. They can trust them. So it's all those

582
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:07,050
things. So, um, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm lucky. Same wife, same, yeah, four kids. That's all

583
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:07,230
good.

584
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:11,829
Do you have any daily things that you do in your life that sort of allow you to, to, to

585
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:12,429
be at your best?

586
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:19,150
I think you got to stay healthy if you can. Um, so I, I think, I think being healthy is

587
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:24,389
critical and, and, uh, and trying to look after yourself. Uh, I mean, I'm, I mean, people

588
00:35:24,409 --> 00:35:31,969
will know I, I, I was probably the most, uh, I decline a lot of invitations. I don't

589
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:35,989
go out to lunch. I don't go, we never did work dinners really. I didn't, I mean, why

590
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:41,409
would I want to be away from the family? So to some degree it's a matter of, um, I think

591
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:46,949
doing a job well and then, and then compartmentalizing the work and then, and then going home and

592
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:51,570
being, you know, a dad and, and, and, and whatever is what I tried to do. And I tried

593
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:54,389
to play sport on the weekends if I had time, which, uh, which is good.

594
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:58,289
You seem pretty positive and pretty happy, uh, in every sense. Uh, Brian, uh, we talk

595
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:02,510
about, uh, leaders who consciously think about how they positively impact others in

596
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:07,150
their environment. We've heard you going around and, uh, taking days just to engage with,

597
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:09,210
with your team. How did you think about that?

598
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:15,269
Uh, look, I mean, I think that, I think the big change I tried to always say, explain

599
00:36:15,269 --> 00:36:19,869
to people, and it's not always that easy, is that our job, the more senior you get,

600
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,570
your job is to help people below you do their job better.

601
00:36:24,409 --> 00:36:28,309
Not the other way around. A lot of people, unfortunately, seem to think when they get

602
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:32,789
promoted, it's the job of the people below them to make them look good and do their job

603
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:36,889
better. I go, no, no, no, you've, you've, you've misunderstood. Our job is to make them

604
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:40,949
do a better job and feel better about the work they're doing. And so it's turning the

605
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:44,610
organization upside down and understanding that my job is to support the rest of the

606
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,730
organization, not the other way around.

607
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:49,269
And what's the examples of how, how you would do that?

608
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:52,570
Well, it's sort of interesting. I mean, I think it's just, it's, it's often, it's often

609
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,389
the little things. I mean, I think I, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

610
00:36:54,389 --> 00:37:00,389
it's, it's really important. It's really important. It's noticed when you go to a site

611
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:06,210
or when you go to meet staff, it's just the important to not just talk to the people that

612
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:09,349
are important. You know, the important people always come up to you. They always come up

613
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:13,010
to you, you know, and the challenge is to try and find the other folk, you know, who

614
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:17,070
are doing a good job and try to reach out to them, try to, try to be very welcoming

615
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:23,010
to them as well. It's, it's something that, that I think that we tried to do as we became

616
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,369
a global company in particular.

617
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:29,210
We were never trying to make the Germans non-German or the Swiss non-Swiss, but we

618
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:34,590
did try to get them to understand that, you know, our, we saw our job to really help the

619
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:39,469
German or the Swiss subsidiary do as well as it could and support them. And, and a lot

620
00:37:39,469 --> 00:37:43,150
of my American colleagues always said when the Australians went into the room, they found

621
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:47,429
it unusual that they couldn't work out who the boss was. The way we spoke to each other,

622
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:51,909
they were amazed, you know, that if I wasn't the most knowledgeable person, I'd be happy

623
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:54,150
to listen to whoever's in the room.

624
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,769
And so, I mean, that was our style and that's what's really, I think, held us in good stead

625
00:37:58,769 --> 00:38:06,789
as an organization. I think that we're, we are good listeners and we try to make sure

626
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:12,489
that the best people always get an opportunity to tell us what the most important thing is.

627
00:38:12,889 --> 00:38:18,110
Yeah. Well said. We often see leaders are really clear on creating and sharing the vision,

628
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:22,650
the vision for CSL, quite extraordinary one that you've been able to, to, to create. How

629
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,130
did you go about creating and sharing?

630
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:29,449
Well, look, you know, and, and look, I mean, I might be, I, I'm not a big fan of the charismatic

631
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:33,230
leader, by the way. I, I think that, you know, many a flawed person is trying to, you know,

632
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:38,030
pump themselves up as the great charismatic leader. So I'm a, you know, I think I bring

633
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:44,210
to that very great Australian cynicism. So just understand that, you know, so I'm not,

634
00:38:44,769 --> 00:38:51,809
I think people, people, uh, will follow you when they, when they learn to, they'll watch

635
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:53,949
your behavior and they'll watch your decision making.

636
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:58,809
Not some ridiculous, you know, stumped up speech or presentation, et cetera. I

637
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:04,449
yawn at most of those things, really. I think it, it's, it's much more granular than that.

638
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:10,829
You know, people, it's, it's the people want to believe in you and your decision making,

639
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:15,070
your quality of decision making and your, and, and, and why you're doing things, even if it's

640
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:19,710
bad news, you know, we've shut plants, we've done some tough things, but if you're willing

641
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:23,829
to stand up, explain why and why are we doing it and, uh, and, and how we think it's going to

642
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:29,750
strengthen the rest of the organization, people accept that. So, you know, personally, I would

643
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:36,289
down-regulate the great charismatic, you know, leader, uh, up-regulate the, uh, the, the person,

644
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:42,309
the more humble, uh, uh, intelligent listener who, um, who nudges the organization in the

645
00:39:42,309 --> 00:39:47,190
right direction. Yeah. Incredible. I think you might've got a standing ovation that your last

646
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:51,750
AGM, uh, from the shareholders who got incredible value, clearly out of your leadership. So I think

647
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,690
your humble way was, uh, it was pretty,

648
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:59,550
effective. We see curiosity as a real, uh, common trait of leaders who are curious and then

649
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:04,309
curiosity as a way to improve their own learning and development. When I ask you about curiosity,

650
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:09,449
what does, what does that mean to you? To some degree, there's nothing more

651
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:12,969
valuable than management determination or people's determination, whether it be in the

652
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:17,389
sporting field, you know, two, two equivalent footballers, the most determined one seems to

653
00:40:17,389 --> 00:40:21,949
always get the ball. Well, same in business really. So how do you create a culture of determination?

654
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:31,210
And really, uh, cause determination can overcome, you know, the deficiencies as well. All companies

655
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:38,210
have deficiencies. So, you know, we, we tried to, and part of it is having a, um, uh, to some degree,

656
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:44,630
an ambition of what we want to do. Part of it is creating, you know, enemies on the way, you know,

657
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:49,389
you know, we don't like Collingwood, we don't like X, Y, Z, you know? So we had a view, we didn't

658
00:40:49,389 --> 00:40:53,429
like Baxter, you know, now Baxter was a big elephant in the, you know, the big competitor,

659
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:57,190
et cetera. I'm sure there are a lot of really good people at Baxter, don't get me wrong, but,

660
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:01,449
but to some degree, every day of the week, we had a team that said, yeah, okay, how do we,

661
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:06,690
how do we beat them? A hundred little things. What can we do to be better than them? And that

662
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:12,590
was really all we tried to do for, you know, 10 or 15 years, every day thinking about, uh, how do

663
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:18,429
we do it better? How does it serve our patients better? Uh, and, uh, and to some degree, you know,

664
00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:23,690
so if we go back, you know, when I started the company, we were 0.3% of the world market,

665
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:29,610
you know, in plasma therapeutics and Baxter at that stage, 38%. And we got, we ended up being

666
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:35,190
38% and they ended up being like 24%. We got them. It's a win. It's a win. And they got bought.

667
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:41,329
That was the ultimate win for us. They were the giant and we, we brought them down. So I know it

668
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:46,889
sounds odd, but to some degree, you've got to have a bit of mongrel as well. It's not all about

669
00:41:46,889 --> 00:41:49,650
being happy and nice. You've got to be clear on that.

670
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:53,769
I'm with you, Brian. I can see it coming through. And I think to me, coming out of the world of,

671
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:58,949
uh, of AFL football, which was my initial, uh, workplace. And if you said, what was the trait

672
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:03,809
that you would recruit, you know, you saw these beautiful athletes come and some of them ran the

673
00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:09,269
time trial in, in record time. And then it got to being competitive and got to being having to

674
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:13,050
grind it out. And you could tell very quickly the ones that were going to make it. We always felt

675
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:17,650
within the first five or six weeks, you knew who was going purely on how competitive they were and

676
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:21,570
how they could stand up. And so it's a, it's the trade I think that finds a way, isn't it?

677
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,670
It is. It is. Again, we don't talk about it much.

678
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:28,570
In leadership programs and those things, because it's hard to, I mean, we had McKinsey come out

679
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:32,989
the, you know, sorry, not McKinsey, um, Harvard, Harvard business school come out to CSL at one

680
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:38,190
stage, going to do a case study on us. Cause I don't know. Um, so Harvard do a lot of case study

681
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:43,650
work and they looked at the company and they said, look, they really didn't want to do a case study

682
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:49,030
because they said every way they looked at us, we were all strategic disadvantage. We were from a

683
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:53,809
small market was, you know, difficult, you know, poor price market. Um, we had all,

684
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:58,510
all strategic disadvantage. So the only thing they could identify was determination. And, uh,

685
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:03,210
and, uh, and they said, look, very hard to write a case study about it, about determination. So

686
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,789
that's, they didn't, never wrote it.

687
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,949
Well, grit, isn't it? I suppose.

688
00:43:07,309 --> 00:43:11,630
Grit, yeah, that's life. It is life. You know, I, I said to people, you know, when people are

689
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,849
interviewing for people, you know, I said, well, try and look for the dirt under the fingernails.

690
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:19,809
You know, you know me, I mean, obviously not dirt under the fingernails, but people have done hard

691
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:23,650
stuff. You want people who've done hard stuff, have put themselves in

692
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:28,289
comfortable positions. I mean, people like to think their career is going to be mapped out for

693
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:32,449
them. No, it's not. Not if you're going to get to the top, you actually have to be brave and take

694
00:43:32,449 --> 00:43:37,030
on hard things and difficult things and things you don't know about. You got to get dirt under

695
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:43,710
the nails and, and have a go and stumble and, you know, get back up. And, and you can, you can

696
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:47,630
achieve that in your mind, right. With the same values and have integrity along the way.

697
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:53,789
Of course. And you've got to just accept, but that, that is it. You can't, you can't be

698
00:43:53,789 --> 00:43:58,590
so polished. You can't be so polished that you're, that you're going to, it's obvious that you're

699
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:04,070
going to ascend to the top. That's that no one has that divine capability. So, you know, and I think

700
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:08,809
that's what we're, that's what you're going to look for a bit of dirt under the fingernails when

701
00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:13,130
you're trying to promote and promote people and recruit people. I love it. I love it. I'm writing

702
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:18,269
it down. Communication with clarity, Brian, is something we see as a really common trait of

703
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:22,309
leaders. And clearly you're, you're a great communicator. How do you think about, particularly

704
00:44:22,309 --> 00:44:23,730
in the end when you're in,

705
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:28,429
35 countries and, you know, over, you know, coming up to close to 30,000 employees,

706
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:32,190
how do you communicate with clarity? Well, I mean, I think, I think we're,

707
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:36,329
we're big on values, always have been, and purpose, values and purpose. And so we haven't

708
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:41,809
changed those at all. And, and I think that people recognize over time that you're,

709
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:47,869
you have consistency, nothing really upsets, I think, staff, employees, et cetera. If you're

710
00:44:47,869 --> 00:44:53,769
inconsistent or erratic in the application of those behaviors that support the values,

711
00:44:53,789 --> 00:44:59,829
and, and, and, and, and missions of the company. So we've always been very clear on that, but that

712
00:44:59,829 --> 00:45:04,070
doesn't mean we're not commercial as well. You know, we're commercial, we're smart. We try to

713
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:10,889
do intelligent things. We're numerate. We're all those things you've got to be as well. So it's not

714
00:45:10,889 --> 00:45:17,929
just a, you know, pie in the sky ambition. You've got to have, you've got to have that and the staff,

715
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:22,269
you know, recognize it, but it's that consistency that people know what they're signing up for when

716
00:45:22,269 --> 00:45:23,130
they join the company.

717
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:27,710
And you jump on and doing my research to chat to you today, the CSL values, patient-focused,

718
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:32,710
innovation, integrity, collaboration, superior performance. It's everywhere in your, in your,

719
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:37,250
in your website. So clearly you live that every day. Collaboration is one of your values is the

720
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:40,769
next question. It's, it's a common trait we're seeing in great leaders. How important,

721
00:45:41,269 --> 00:45:44,150
clearly you don't get to your scale without collaboration. How did you go about it?

722
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:47,670
Well, I think you, first of all, you've got to believe you're going to be a great partner.

723
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:51,949
So again, collaboration is, is as much about what you're going to contribute to your partner rather

724
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,590
than, you know, ripping their face off or,

725
00:45:53,789 --> 00:45:58,829
sucking the bone marrow out of them and, and moving on. So to some degree, we, we try to be

726
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:03,829
a fine partner for people where we both share in the benefits. We both, both create value.

727
00:46:04,969 --> 00:46:09,510
And, and really it's a skill because the world's got awfully complicated. I mean,

728
00:46:09,929 --> 00:46:13,630
none of us, you know, it's the supply chain is very complicated innovation.

729
00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:18,989
You've got to source it from various places. And so you've got to, you've got to learn to

730
00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:22,369
manage that well. And you've got to, you've got to build the reputation for doing that well.

731
00:46:22,369 --> 00:46:23,730
And again, you don't do it.

732
00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:29,530
In a naive way, but, uh, and, and we have a lot of teams, you know, so we have a lot of global

733
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:35,809
teams at CSL. And so trying to manage the cultural complexity, which takes time, um,

734
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:39,789
time zones are difficult, particularly when you have Europe, Australia, and the U S it's very,

735
00:46:39,889 --> 00:46:44,849
someone has to start late. It's a big ask of anyone. So we're very mindful of that. Um,

736
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:51,329
trying to not be unreasonable on, on that ask, but, uh, but yeah, collaboration's a fundamental

737
00:46:51,329 --> 00:46:53,769
skill of life. I mean, forget, forget.

738
00:46:53,789 --> 00:46:58,469
I mean, if you can't, yeah, it is, it's a fundamental skill of life and whether it be

739
00:46:58,469 --> 00:47:03,590
on the footy field or whether it be on the home front or whatever. So, uh, yeah, I think that

740
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:08,010
that's, uh, that's something you, you, you, you, you look for in people.

741
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:12,730
Yeah. But not all leaders value it the way that you clearly have done. And it's a common trait

742
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:16,469
that we keep reading it about, you know, asking these two final questions. So Brian, of the

743
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:21,809
leaders I'm catching up with, um, I'm intrigued to hear what you say, who is the, who has been

744
00:47:21,809 --> 00:47:23,170
the greatest leader in your life?

745
00:47:23,789 --> 00:47:37,280
Hmm. Well, look, I mean, I think that two people that, that probably have had the most

746
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:44,400
significant impact, I think, I think Muhammad Ali, incredible individual, incredible given

747
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,139
his education, et cetera, what, what he achieved as a person I think was, was, was remarkable.

748
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:54,679
And probably Nelson Mandela, what he achieved in, in South Africa, uh, I think was remarkable

749
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:57,000
the way he turned himself around and the values.

750
00:47:57,219 --> 00:48:02,519
And the integrity that he obviously had embedded in him. I think those two people have, I think

751
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:05,099
would, I'd rate extremely highly.

752
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:10,280
Have you been students of, of those two and, and, and like all of us, I suppose, have,

753
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,659
have, have consumed, uh, uh, enormous amounts of content of both those individuals? Have

754
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:16,340
they, has that been throughout your life? Have you?

755
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:22,280
Uh, look, I'd have, I mean, uh, I hope I don't disappoint you. I'm not, I'm not a great student

756
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:27,199
of these things. I live a relatively simple life. Look, I'm sorry.

757
00:48:27,219 --> 00:48:33,260
You know, I, I, I like, I like my work. I like my family. I like my golf, like my tennis. You

758
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:40,599
know, I don't, I mean, I'm not a deep reader, to be honest. Um, so I haven't read many business

759
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:47,440
books, a few. Um, remember, I mean, I'm a real outlier in business. Uh, and there's, there's.

760
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,739
Why are you an outlier in business? Why would you?

761
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:53,679
Because that's a, that's a term that was used by these people who've said, you know,

762
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,159
very few people reinvent an industry.

763
00:48:56,659 --> 00:48:56,739
Yeah.

764
00:48:57,219 --> 00:49:01,219
Normally if you do, you can't come from the standard accounting or from manufacturing.

765
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,679
So I did medicine. I didn't do, you know, commerce or, you know, et cetera. So I, I never,

766
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:13,320
I brought, I guess, to CSL and the plasma industry, a very different mindset. Um, so in that sense,

767
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:18,300
I'm a real outlier. I brought someone who's educated in medicine, thinking about patients

768
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:24,679
and improving products, et cetera. I mean, obviously, uh, and, and so I've never been

769
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:26,920
a great believer in the school board. You know, the school board,

770
00:49:27,219 --> 00:49:31,400
you know, it tends to look after itself. Um, I mean, the biggest complaint from my shareholders

771
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:37,079
in institutional ones would be they never saw me. I, I never saw a great need to go around

772
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:42,400
getting pats on the back from them. Why? I mean, I didn't feel I needed it. Um, and I didn't, um,

773
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,360
if I was doing a good job, I'm not sure how they could really give me much more advice.

774
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:51,639
I mean, I knew the industry, I'm not sure they did. So I was considered really hard to get to,

775
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:57,199
um, which is okay. I think, you know, you gotta be so private with your time.

776
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:02,260
So, I used to dollop out my time as if it was a pipette, you know, little drops.

777
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:07,099
And because each drop's precious, whether it be a dollar bill inside the company or

778
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:10,800
whether it be an hour of your time, never wait.

779
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:17,500
Don't waste your time going to stuff and dinners and stuff that has no value, you know?

780
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,179
Yeah.

781
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,719
Well, I feel very privileged to have grabbed some of that little drop of your time, Brian.

782
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,659
It has been a great privilege.

783
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:25,119
And I love it.

784
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,559
Your outlier thinking is fascinating to me.

785
00:50:27,619 --> 00:50:32,679
And you can clearly see that there's a happy gene that comes with the way you live your

786
00:50:32,679 --> 00:50:32,820
life.

787
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,460
Final question.

788
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,599
Collaboration, we see, is this incredible common trait that is really sought after.

789
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:43,019
If you could collaborate with anyone in the world on anything, it doesn't have to be CSL.

790
00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:45,019
It could be a game of golf.

791
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:48,599
It could be one person that you've thought you'd like to collaborate with.

792
00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:49,079
Who would that be?

793
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:51,000
Yeah, collaboration.

794
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,400
Well, I mean, I think a tiger's hard to go past.

795
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,619
You know, I mean, tigers, you know, I mean, even post-accident,

796
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:01,840
his swing didn't look bad the other day on the still.

797
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:07,519
So, look, I think that, look, I'm happy in my own skin, honestly.

798
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,900
I don't think about these things.

799
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,860
Was there anyone in the, clearly going through it, you said Baxter was the competitor

800
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,280
and you wanted to knock them off and you did.

801
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:20,139
Was there anyone you thought, God, we could get that person in our world?

802
00:51:20,139 --> 00:51:21,920
I mean, I think that.

803
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:27,019
But I hate to disappoint you.

804
00:51:27,099 --> 00:51:29,000
I haven't thought about it that way.

805
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:33,659
I mean, I think that I'm a great believer that CSL is like a complex organism.

806
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,599
And we have, and so like any organism, you have receptors on the surface

807
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,159
and you're trying to reach out.

808
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:42,000
You're trying to reach out to various things and hopefully you interact

809
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,500
and then you move on.

810
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:47,960
You're living, it's a living, CSL like all kinds, we're living, breathing organisms.

811
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,460
We're not static, monolithic things.

812
00:51:51,920 --> 00:52:00,320
And so the job was to create this nimble, intelligent, dynamic, fascinating, larger organism.

813
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,000
And that's really what we've tried to achieve.

814
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:04,260
That's what we're still trying to achieve.

815
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:11,599
There is no one thing because it's all about doing many things well to create success.

816
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,039
Well, I can't imagine you answering that any other way, Brian,

817
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:15,719
which was authentic and true to yourself.

818
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:18,039
I've loved every moment of catching up with you.

819
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:18,900
Thanks for your time today.

820
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,440
Great history of leadership and success.

821
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,059
In your own very unique style.

822
00:52:24,219 --> 00:52:24,699
Thanks for your time.

823
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,480
Really appreciate it.

824
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:25,880
Thanks, Luke.
