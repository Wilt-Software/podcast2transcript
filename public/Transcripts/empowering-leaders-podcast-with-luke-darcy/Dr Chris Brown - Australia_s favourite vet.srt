00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,410
This week's conversation is with one of Australia's most popular and respected people.

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,630
Dr. Chris Brown is not only a vet, but an Australian television presenter and author.

3
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,149
He's best known for the television series Bondi Vet, The Living Room,

4
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:21,769
and for co-hosting I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here alongside Julia Morris.

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,750
Dr. Chris Brown is an inspiring modern leader

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,109
and he's changing the game in the animal welfare space in this country.

7
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,270
His passion for what he does is one of the fundamentals for the work that we do

8
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,009
at our leadership business, Alita.

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,130
And we feel incredibly privileged to work and collaborate with outstanding people

10
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,329
like Chris at Alita.

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,390

15
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:55,689
and to understand how like Dr. Chris Brown, you're leading in your world.

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,159
Dr. Chris Brown is an Australian veterinarian, television personality and author.

17
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,719
He is well known for his work as the Bondi Vet,

18
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,280
the host of The Living Room and I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here.

19
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,739
Chris grew up in the suburb of Merriweather Heights in Newcastle, New South Wales,

20
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,480
attending Merriweather High School.

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,200
He went on to study at the University of Sydney where he graduated in 2001

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,000
with first class honours in veterinary science.

23
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:32,540
He has a strong family history in animal care with his auntie and father,

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,700
both qualified vets.

25
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,140
And Chris, to me, holds a very unique place in Australian public life

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,620
as one of the country's most loved, respected and trusted people.

27
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,359
Dr. Chris Brown, always great to see you.

28
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:43,659
Das.

29
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,099
Das.

30
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,260
I mean, second to you when it comes to being loved and respected.

31
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,420
The unfortunate part about that statement is that there's data to back up my thoughts on you, Chris.

32
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,340
The research actually comes up every year and, mate, it's true.

33
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,900
I mean, I've been lucky enough to be in your company several times

34
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,560
and it feels like that is your superpower, Chris, to be honest with you.

35
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:08,680
You've got a positive energy in every scenario that I've seen you

36
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,020
whenever we see you on TV.

37
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,759
Is that just you or is that something you've had to work on?

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,520
No, look, I think when you are a vet, you have to have a positive mindset

39
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,159
because I think being a vet, it's a great leveller.

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,879
I always laugh about, you know, the moment I step back into the vet clinic.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,099
I still do work in the vet.

42
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:33,360
A lot of people think I sort of don't do that anymore.

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,800
But you can go in and it's a great example of almost gallows humour

44
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,360
or it's just got a great way of cutting you down a couple of pegs.

45
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:48,500
But I always, if I've been away on a work trip somewhere really interesting

46
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,699
or the classic one is, you know, the morning after the Logies,

47
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,780
like the next shift I do, I always, whether the vet hospital arranges

48
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,599
this for me or not, but they always have this sort of cavalcade of dogs

49
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,740
with various forms of explosive diarrhoea waiting for me.

50
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:07,280
And so you've just got to laugh.

51
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,719
Like animals don't care who you are, what you do,

52
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,520
how you do it.

53
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,340
How your day's going.

54
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,259
They're just there.

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,560
They don't want to be there, but they just judge you according

56
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,840
to how you present yourself, probably how you smell, to be fair.

57
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:24,879
And then, you know, it's up to you to win them over.

58
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,539
So you're no one in the animal world.

59
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,699
And I think I kind of like that judgment-free zone in a way.

60
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,159
See, I think animals have got this great intuition too, though.

61
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:42,039
The family pets especially, they are on to energy in a way that perhaps

62
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,819
humans take a bit longer to catch up on.

63
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:48,120
I think when your dog warms to someone, it's normally a good sense.

64
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:51,939
I mean, are people, when you come out, you know, you're back on the tools,

65
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:57,099
you know, are they sort of surprised that you're still doing what you do?

66
00:03:58,699 --> 00:03:59,139
Yeah.

67
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:05,979
I think it's a big part of why I enjoy being on the tools is really, I mean,

68
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:10,139
just for the reactions of clients when you walk into that waiting room

69
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:11,199
and you're like, oh.

70
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:17,899
I mean, I'm here for Puffin and they're like, you?

71
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,920
And I'm like, yeah, me.

72
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,839
And they're like, are you really a vet?

73
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,980
I'm like, yes.

74
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,100
Like, I'm not an actor.

75
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:28,160
Like, all these years I haven't been pretending to be a vet.

76
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:31,959
I mean, I've gone full method, clearly, for many, many years.

77
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:38,620
I even had one guy a few months ago and I walked him through

78
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,639
and I think his dog was just there for a vaccination.

79
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:40,839
Yeah.

80
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:40,899
Yeah.

81
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:40,959
Yeah.

82
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:40,980
Yeah.

83
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,120
Yeah.

84
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,139
Yeah.

85
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:41,379
Yeah.

86
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:41,399
Yeah.

87
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:41,420
Yeah.

88
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:41,439
Yeah.

89
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:41,459
Yeah.

90
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:41,500
Yeah.

91
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:41,519
Yeah.

92
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:41,579
Yeah.

93
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:41,620
Yeah.

94
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:41,639
Yeah.

95
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:41,699
Yeah.

96
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,480
And he said, mate, I know you.

97
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,720
And I just, I didn't want to say anything because the moment you say,

98
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,819
oh, yeah, I do a bit of TV, they're like, they usually say, no,

99
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,500
I don't watch TV.

100
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,180
That can't be it.

101
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,060
And you just feel like an idiot.

102
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,139
So I just, I just like said, you know, I don't know.

103
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:56,519
I don't know.

104
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,480
I don't know what it might be.

105
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,620
And, and I proceeded to look at his dog and, and, you know,

106
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,860
take the temperature in the conventional veterinary way.

107
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,980
And, and I got to the end of it and he goes, I got it.

108
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,459
I bloody well got it.

109
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,600
And I said, what, what is it?

110
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,980
And he goes, I know who you are.

111
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,000
And I said, who am I?

112
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,199
And he goes, you're the guy who plays that vet on TV.

113
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:19,560
Again, I'm not an actor.

114
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,300
It's a convincing performance, hopefully.

115
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,519
But yeah, a lot of, a lot of study went into that, into that,

116
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:29,819
into that misconception that I'm just an actor that,

117
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:31,819
that plays the role of a vet on TV.

118
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,899
I find that very amusing all around.

119
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:36,860
I think the thing that people, you know,

120
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,759
perhaps one of the reasons why we all connect with you,

121
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,079
you can see when you're around animals,

122
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,220
there is this genuine care and love.

123
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,300
And I mentioned the family history in the intro.

124
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,459
Can you remember at a young age, Chris, was that in your mind,

125
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,519
were you thinking working with animals was going to be a big part of your life?

126
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,019
Yeah, I was, as you say, my dad was the local vet and, and, you know,

127
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:02,699
the earliest memories are of being around a lot, a lot of animals.

128
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,639
Like it was, it was not a normal upbringing.

129
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,699
Like we had, we had the standard dog and, and cats.

130
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,399
But, you know,

131
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:14,160
at different times we'd have like koalas living in the shed,

132
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,279
like in the, in the laundry, we'd have possums.

133
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,040
We had a lot of chickens.

134
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,579
We had a cow, we had sheep.

135
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:25,540
We had like, I had a pet wallaby called Wally,

136
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,620
imaginative name for, for six months.

137
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,420
I had a pet penguin when I was a kid.

138
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,000
So this penguin had washed ashore.

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,279
It was molting and couldn't go back out into the ocean.

140
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,180
And dad brought it home.

141
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,279
And, and, you know,

142
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,139
he, in,

143
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:40,519
in three, I'm one of three boys.

144
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,920
So dad had this sort of very mobile,

145
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,060
very cheap labor force that he could put into,

146
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,079
into any cases,

147
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,759
any animals that needed care overnight.

148
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,319
And, and yeah,

149
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:54,379
for, for a few months I had this penguin and I used

150
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:56,019
to feed this penguin little,

151
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,839
little fish,

152
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:57,079
you know,

153
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,560
little pilchards and, and try to build up at strength.

154
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,980
And the only way to know if it was ready to

155
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,300
go back in the water was to,

156
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,980
to put it in the family swimming pool.

157
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,699
And so I just threw it into the pool and,

158
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:08,579
and, and,

159
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:08,759
you know,

160
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,339
it's it dart around and you couldn't get the bloody

161
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:11,699
thing out.

162
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,620
So when,

163
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:13,860
when,

164
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,779
when it got to the point where you couldn't actually fish

165
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,759
the penguin out with the leaf scoop out of the pool,

166
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,740
you realize this,

167
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,600
this penguin can probably go back to the wild now.

168
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,500
And so it did.

169
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,980
And we took it down to the local beach and it

170
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,300
sort of waddled its way into the water.

171
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,579
So, but my,

172
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,339
my childhood was just full of those.

173
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,379
There's very odd on reflection memories of,

174
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,339
of these different animals and looking after them.

175
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:35,759
And, and I guess all the,

176
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:38,420
all the uplifting sort of,

177
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:42,360
beautiful nurturing learnings that you get from,

178
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,639
from being exposed to lots and lots of different types of

179
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,500
animals, but also the heartbreak,

180
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:49,100
like there's no greater leveler,

181
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,579
I think,

182
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:52,959
than, than witnessing an animal just pass away in your

183
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,000
hands, you know?

184
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,579
And, and it's,

185
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,079
I think as a,

186
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:56,620
as a kid,

187
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,680
that's the first exposure you have to,

188
00:07:59,259 --> 00:07:59,819
to death.

189
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,139
And, and you know,

190
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:02,459
there's, there's a lot of,

191
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,399
a lot of heartbreak as a,

192
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:06,339
as a kid with,

193
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:07,699
with those animals you care for.

194
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:08,579
And, and dad,

195
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:11,279
dad being the matter of fact sort of experienced vet he,

196
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,079
vet he is,

197
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:13,699
you know,

198
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:15,819
he, he used to sort of console me by saying,

199
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:16,079
you know,

200
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,819
when his favorite saying it was when you've got livestock,

201
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:21,899
you've got dead stock.

202
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:23,500
And that,

203
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,240
that really summed up,

204
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,959
it's summed it up in such a beautiful emotive and caring

205
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,199
way, I think.

206
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,579
So I promised myself pretty,

207
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:32,120
so I wasn't going to do what I'm I've done this to

208
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,580
you before.

209
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,240
And I'm sure you want to know you want to,

210
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,980
you want a pet question.

211
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,960
I want an update.

212
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,759
You know,

213
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,340
that's coming.

214
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:37,799
I said,

215
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,340
don't do it.

216
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,840
But it was more of a reflection a bit on what

217
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,620
you were saying there in our house and having the animals

218
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,019
there and seeing like the kids will fight each other as

219
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:49,500
a, as we all do growing up,

220
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,840
but the love they pour into the family pet,

221
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,120
our 14 year old Labrador Leroy,

222
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,940
when he died,

223
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,120
seriously,

224
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,159
the people who don't love animals,

225
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,200
don't quite understand our oldest is 19.

226
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,779
Sam, it was a three year process for him.

227
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,519
He still has pictures of,

228
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,059
you know,

229
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,580
as you said,

230
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,039
you get sort of taught that,

231
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,120
how to deal with grief at a young age.

232
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,559
Don't you?

233
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,059
It's a,

234
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,519
there's a window into the soul.

235
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,779
Did your other brothers,

236
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:16,120
have they got the same love that you've had?

237
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,460
Did that rub off on them as well or not?

238
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:18,539
Yeah.

239
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:18,720
Yeah,

240
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,259
they do.

241
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:19,659
Um,

242
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:19,860
they,

243
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,019
they all working in sciencey fields on the youngest of the

244
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:26,559
three and one works in human health.

245
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,159
Uh,

246
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,059
and the other one is an environmental engineer.

247
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,419
Um,

248
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:30,659
but,

249
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:31,320
but they're,

250
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,379
they're big dog lovers.

251
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:32,580
They've,

252
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,580
they've got dogs and,

253
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,460
and,

254
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,059
and they've always had an eye for wildlife and,

255
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:41,240
and really quite passionate about conservation and,

256
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,379
and all those,

257
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:43,460
all those different messages.

258
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,759
And I think when it's just around you that whole time,

259
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,360
um,

260
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,320
you just,

261
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,039
you do develop,

262
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:49,240
you know,

263
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,340
it's,

264
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,679
it's kind of like the earliest form of training in a way

265
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,139
it just becomes part of you.

266
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:53,360
And you,

267
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,679
you do,

268
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,399
you do develop that eye for,

269
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,940
for what's not quite right.

270
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:57,440
Um,

271
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,740
and,

272
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,639
and how you can,

273
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,799
how you can use that sort of gentle,

274
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,360
caring nature to,

275
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:02,940
to help.

276
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,159
And I think that sort of flow,

277
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:05,279
you never really lose that.

278
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,419
And I think that's why it's so great that the kids are

279
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:08,059
exposed.

280
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:08,899
To,

281
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,700
to pets and,

282
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:09,940
and,

283
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,740
and,

284
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:10,779
um,

285
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:11,379
you know,

286
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:12,220
learn,

287
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,539
learn how to look after them.

288
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:15,500
So sliding door moment is big for you.

289
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,440
2003,

290
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,460
a couple of years out of,

291
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,299
uh,

292
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:19,240
had a vet school.

293
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,500
You're in a pub in Sydney as a,

294
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,580
as legend has it,

295
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:21,919
uh,

296
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,120
telling stories to,

297
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:24,820
from what I understand and what I've read a girl at the

298
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,539
bar about how good you were going as a vet,

299
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:27,720
uh,

300
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,000
Chris,

301
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,720
I can picture it.

302
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,299
And,

303
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:29,840
and,

304
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,259
uh,

305
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:32,120
a guy who works in media over here is,

306
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:34,580
and thinks he can make you the next,

307
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:34,820
uh,

308
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,139
Dr.

309
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:36,320
Harry Cooper was probably the,

310
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,820
the only event we had on TV.

311
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,080
And in those days,

312
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,419
Dr.

313
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:40,259
Harry,

314
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:41,100
you go on and,

315
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,100
and it's a global success story or success story,

316
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,899
you know,

317
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,220
television around the world.

318
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,100
Do you look back and life defining and changing moment from,

319
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,940
you know,

320
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,360
I think your ambition was to be a country vet and look

321
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,320
after farm animals.

322
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,960
And now you've had this incredible pivot in your life.

323
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,000
Do you look back and think my life's much better for it,

324
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,539
or is that hard to quantify?

325
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:06,139
It's an interesting question because I actually do spend

326
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:07,799
probably too much time thinking about that moment.

327
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,799
And,

328
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,799
uh,

329
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,799
and wondering,

330
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,799
you know,

331
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,799
what if I was,

332
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,799
I was,

333
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,799
I'd only been an actual vet for,

334
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,799
for about three years.

335
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,799
And,

336
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,799
and,

337
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,799
you know,

338
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,799
you come out of,

339
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,799
you come out of university pretty green and,

340
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,799
and you,

341
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,799
you learn a lot on the,

342
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,799
on the job in those first few years.

343
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:27,240
So I was only really getting to the stage where I felt like I could handle myself and,

344
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,240
and,

345
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
and manage,

346
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
um,

347
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
manage myself independently.

348
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,399
And I was a week away from giving my notice to go and work in the UK as that sort of mixed

349
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,399
practice,

350
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,399
dog,

351
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,399
cow,

352
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,399
horse kind of vet.

353
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,399
That was always my dream.

354
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,399
You know,

355
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,399
that,

356
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,399
that all creatures,

357
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,399
great and small kind of ideal was,

358
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,399
was,

359
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,399
was very big.

360
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,399
Um,

361
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,399
and,

362
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,399
uh,

363
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,399
I was a week away from,

364
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,399
from doing that when I was in that pub.

365
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,399
And it was a Thursday night.

366
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,399
I,

367
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,399
I didn't,

368
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,399
you know,

369
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,399
probably should point out,

370
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,399
I didn't have to work the Friday.

371
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,399
Um,

372
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,399
and I was,

373
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,399
I was a fair few,

374
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,399
um,

375
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,399
fair few schooners in from memory.

376
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,399
And the stories may have been a little embellished,

377
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,399
but I'd,

378
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,399
I'd had a,

379
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,399
um,

380
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,399
cat that week that had been,

381
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,399
um,

382
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,399
we,

383
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,399
uh,

384
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,399
it was,

385
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,399
it was,

386
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,399
it was quite sad actually.

387
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,399
This cat had been shot,

388
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,399
um,

389
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,399
on the main streets of neutral by in Sydney.

390
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,399
Now,

391
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,399
if,

392
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,399
if anyone knows Sydney,

393
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,399
they'll know that there's the streets of neutral by and not mean,

394
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,399
um,

395
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,399
they're,

396
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,399
they're,

397
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,399
they're not really,

398
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,399
not really straight either.

399
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,399
They're more sort of like tree lined avenues.

400
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,399
Um,

401
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,399
but,

402
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,399
but somehow someone had,

403
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,399
someone had procured,

404
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,399
uh,

405
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,399
I think it was an air rifle and,

406
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,399
and shot his cat.

407
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,399
And,

408
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,399
and when they came on the street,

409
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,399
they'd been doing surgery on him.

410
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,399
And,

411
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,399
and for some reason I taught this girl about this and,

412
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,399
and,

413
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,399
and I,

414
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,399
I,

415
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,399
the drinks were taking a long time to be poured dust.

416
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,840
That's why the story kind of got away from me,

417
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
and all the while,

418
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,360
this guy was there listening and nodding.

419
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
And,

420
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,159
and he thought I was making up being a vet to impress this girl.

421
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,820
And he just wanted to know what I actually did in real life.

422
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,820
And I said,

423
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,820
no,

424
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,820
I'm a really a vet and he said,

425
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,820
and said,

426
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,820
look,

427
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,820
if you really are a vet,

428
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,820
I've got an idea.

429
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,820
I,

430
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,820
I think there's an,

431
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,100
there's a,

432
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,860
the world of animals and vets and get away from sort

433
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,860
of the white lab coat idea and kind of similar

434
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,700
to what Jamie Oliver has done in cooking where

435
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,159
the conventional chef was replaced by someone a bit more

436
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,980
sort of freewheeling and a bit more natural

437
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,179
and a bit more sort of, you know, spur of the moment.

438
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,659
That was kind of the idea and I was all for that

439
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:32,000
because I sort of, I do find that sometimes find

440
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,139
the world of veterinary science can be a bit stuffy

441
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:37,000
and a bit precise and I think it's nice to kind

442
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,080
of freshen it up a little bit.

443
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:44,139
And so, yeah, from being in the pub to doing a screen test

444
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:49,259
was a week and all of a sudden I found myself auditioning

445
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:50,620
for this role I didn't even know existed.

446
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,139
It was at the time when there were a lot of those punked,

447
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,720
like prank TV shows around and it happened so quickly.

448
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,940
I was convinced that I was involved in one of those

449
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,139
and so I used to...

450
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,000
I used to turn up to my first couple...

451
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,519
I got the role in Harry's Practice and it happened

452
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,399
so easily seemingly and so quickly that I used

453
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,240
to turn up 20 minutes early just on the off chance

454
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,360
I might be able to see them setting up the hidden cameras

455
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,899
to catch them out with this prank.

456
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,519
Yeah, yeah.

457
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:20,980
I was that paranoid.

458
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,139
It probably says a lot about me.

459
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,980
And so I was convinced that it wasn't real

460
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,419
and then progressively over those couple of weeks

461
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:32,659
there were no hidden cameras and it was actually a real thing.

462
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:33,620
So, yeah.

463
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,960
And I think if I didn't go to the pub that night,

464
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,720
I went off to the UK, I think I would have loved it.

465
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,100
I think I would have had a great time, a great life.

466
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,299
I probably would have been a bit more settled

467
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:48,960
in the more conventional sense than I probably am now

468
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,279
but I would have found it fulfilling.

469
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,320
I would have loved what I did but this is the path

470
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,879
that I somehow ended up on and I do love it.

471
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,879
And I think I love it because it allows me to be kind of this...

472
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,419
It's sort of almost like a tautology

473
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:09,759
but this scientific creative, you know, backed by science

474
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,279
but able to innovate and do something a little bit different

475
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,960
which in the field of the veterinary world,

476
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,840
you kind of do things a certain way

477
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,720
but it's nice to be able to break that a little bit

478
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,059
and tell stories in a, I guess, a more entertaining,

479
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,340
more free-flowing style.

480
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:30,740
And clearly there's a creative part of your brain

481
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,159
and we know you love your photography.

482
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,379
You surf and clearly you get to use, you know,

483
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:40,080
and still practice the veterinary, you know, skills

484
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,059
and, you know, bring that to all of us in our lounge rooms.

485
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:47,980
As they say, the TV world, Chris, is, you know,

486
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,919
got a fair share of ego and politics attached to it.

487
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,279
From my experience, it can be quite a brutal environment

488
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,080
but when I see you, I see your emotional intelligence

489
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,440
and, you know, the integrity comes out

490
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,100
and I feel like when I watch you on TV,

491
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:03,960
we're barricading for the good guy, you know.

492
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:05,639
We want more of that.

493
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,840
I mean, has that sense of leadership been what you've tried to bring to TV

494
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,039
or is it, again, am I overthinking this?

495
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:13,179
Is this just you being you?

496
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:21,080
No, I think it is a – it's definitely there, that mindset of not –

497
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,519
you know, never want to – there are enough horror stories

498
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,860
and I think you're exposed to enough after, you know,

499
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:32,440
I've been doing TV for – it's almost – I think it's 18, 19 years now,

500
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,399
which is crazy.

501
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,120
You see enough and you're exposed to enough,

502
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,980
especially in your early days when you're just sort of starting out.

503
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,299
You see enough to realise, oh, man, I never want to be like that

504
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:52,340
and I think growing up in Newcastle, very much, you know,

505
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,700
even though it's a big city, it's very much a working class town

506
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:00,179
and you're constantly reminded to never get ahead of yourself

507
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:02,139
because you're not from the big city, you're not from Sydney,

508
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,559
you're from Newcastle.

509
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,319
Newcastle people don't talk about themselves.

510
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:10,180
They don't sort of gloat over their achievements.

511
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,519
They never put anyone down unless you're a tall poppy

512
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,839
and then absolutely cut them to the floor.

513
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,619
And so I think that's kind of how you're brought up

514
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:24,059
and being the youngest of three boys as well, my God,

515
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,880
like there was never any opportunity to get ahead of yourself.

516
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,240
If you had a good game of footy on the weekend or a good game of cricket,

517
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,119
you know, that was – that was – you know, that was – you know,

518
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:38,019
that was kind of squeezed out of you by Saturday afternoon pretty quickly.

519
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:42,339
So, yeah, it's – I think it's just – it's just how I like to –

520
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:43,500
I like to be disarming.

521
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,960
I like to feel like people can, I don't know, trust me

522
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,200
and feel comfortable in my presence because I think starting out in TV,

523
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,500
there are plenty of moments where you're not made to feel comfortable

524
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,920
and that stays – that really stays with you because of that ego

525
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,039
that you're exposed to and that intimidating atmosphere of,

526
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:06,059
you know, almost that protectionist kind of mindset

527
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,339
where people are almost trying to squeeze you out

528
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:10,440
or test you to see what you're really made of.

529
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:12,599
And you see that enough and you think, you know what,

530
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:14,339
I don't really want to put other people through that.

531
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,099
That's just not really entirely fair.

532
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:21,059
My mind, Chris, is going to a story that haunts me to this day

533
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,400
and I get reminded of it.

534
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,559
You know, when you work in the media, you get these things sent back your way

535
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,059
a little bit.

536
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:33,200
But I – it was 2002, I think I was in contention, Chris, let's say,

537
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,000
without being –

538
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:38,660
overdramatic, as one of the handful of favourites to win the Brownlow Medal.

539
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:39,619
So I had a reasonable year.

540
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,539
I didn't have many great years, Chris, but I had a reasonable year.

541
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:42,559
Darcy, come on.

542
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,579
No, no humility.

543
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:44,279
Plenty of good years.

544
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:47,380
And I get the call from the production company saying,

545
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,779
we're broadcasting the Brownlow Medal.

546
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,720
Understand you've opened a new pub.

547
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,119
We'd love to send a camera to your new pub and shoot the family.

548
00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:58,940
And I just said, under no circumstances in the world,

549
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,440
that will look like I'm hosting a party.

550
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,900
Like this is like – and one,

551
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,079
I don't think I'm going to win it.

552
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,619
We didn't win enough games.

553
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,339
So under no circumstances, no.

554
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,559
So I must have got the call back from the –

555
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,200
and you know what it's like.

556
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,160
The producer of that line segment had been told, you need to get that.

557
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,299
And those guys are under their own set of pressures.

558
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,180
He must have called back 10 times.

559
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:20,680
And I just said no every time.

560
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,500
But on I think the 11th time he rang and said, well,

561
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,220
there's nine favourites in the betting market for the Brownlow.

562
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:31,019
You're the only one of the nine that's not doing something, you know,

563
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,140
attached to something they're passionate about.

564
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:33,779
So look,

565
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:35,039
if you still don't want to do it, that's fine.

566
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:37,519
I went, oh, well, just open a new pub.

567
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,299
Good, you know, a little bit of promo.

568
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,220
My dad is the quietest, was the quietest, humblest guy of all time.

569
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:44,960
I've convinced dad, you know, you need to be there.

570
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:45,640
Mum's there.

571
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,140
So Brownlow night.

572
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,519
And Julie, Chris, I don't poll many votes, you know, as –

573
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:53,319
but any time I didn't poll a vote,

574
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,259
they panned to the Angler's Tavern Out pub at the time where it looks like

575
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:00,819
I'm hosting a party for – and I remember sitting there going,

576
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:03,500
this is just an unbelievable nightmare.

577
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:05,920
And I still get texts, Brownlow night.

578
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,539
Are you going to host another party for yourself?

579
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,079
But –

580
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:11,380
Isn't it interesting?

581
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,299
Yeah, and that's – it's such a great example of how you should always trust your gut.

582
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:16,880
Yeah.

583
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,200
And you kind of know who you are and what you represent,

584
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:22,900
I think, better than anyone else.

585
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,099
And you've sort of put your – once you've worked around TV enough,

586
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:31,240
you realise that that producer was just getting orders from someone else

587
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,640
and they were just following up.

588
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:33,759
They were just trying to –

589
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:37,019
tick the box for the day and honour the request

590
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:39,700
and be seen to be doing a thorough job of it.

591
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,559
And if they could get you across the line,

592
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,220
then that was a tick in their column for the week.

593
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,819
But, yeah, it's – once it goes through multiple sets of hands,

594
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:54,019
those sort of situations are out of control.

595
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:01,200
I remember, like, a couple of years ago, an example of a similar thing.

596
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,599
I was asked to give –

597
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,279
a comment on – it was one of those things, you know,

598
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,599
do you have any New Year's resolutions?

599
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:12,359
And, you know, it's one of those common little media call-arounds

600
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,440
where they're like, oh, tell us your New Year's resolution.

601
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:18,759
And I'd done it so many years in a row, I thought, oh, God, I just –

602
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:20,660
I want to provide a bit of extra value.

603
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:24,240
And this is kind of – this sort of sums me up to a T

604
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,839
and probably to a fault as well because I thought,

605
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,640
I'm not just going to say something just boring.

606
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,039
I want to entertain people.

607
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,579
I want to give them something that they'll at least look at

608
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:35,519
and go, oh, yeah, that's a good – that's a good response.

609
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:39,640
And so I said to the – I wrote back to the journal.

610
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:42,579
I said, my New Year's resolution is dot, dot, dot,

611
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:46,259
because everyone always does the opposite of their New Year's resolutions,

612
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:50,079
mine is to work less and party more.

613
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,680
And I thought, that's a good one.

614
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,759
You know, people get that, the fact you always do the opposite.

615
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,019
So it means I'm going to be – have a very productive year.

616
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,460
And then I looked at the newspaper on New Year's Day and it said,

617
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,940
Chris Brown, New Year's resolution.

618
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:04,519
Work less, party more.

619
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:06,319
And that was all it said.

620
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,579
I was like, yeah, right.

621
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,359
Okay.

622
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,880
So I'm the party guy of the Sydney scene and that's fine.

623
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:15,819
That's all right.

624
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:19,480
I think it raised a few eyebrows with the network, but that's –

625
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,259
And sometimes humor doesn't translate, does it?

626
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,359
Things are a lot more literal now than they once were.

627
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,640
It would have thought that there might have been, you know,

628
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,460
a laughing – probably pre-emoji, wasn't it, in those –

629
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,319
Yeah, correct.

630
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,259
In those times.

631
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,319
Hey, Chris, we feel –

632
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,240
I feel really, you know, grateful that you've joined a space

633
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,079
that I'm really passionate about, a world we call Alita Connect.

634
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:42,460
And we love bringing people together from different backgrounds

635
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,460
to share and connect and learn.

636
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:47,259
I've spoken about it a lot in this forum.

637
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,900
And I love the group you're involved in.

638
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,220
I know they're private spaces, but I spoke to you about comfortable

639
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,740
enough to share the group.

640
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,539
And if I could go through them for a start, it's yourself,

641
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,220
Benjamin Northey, who I had the great privilege of talking

642
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,099
to on this podcast.

643
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,019
What an incredible creator.

644
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,480
Creative, brilliant genius.

645
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,119
The conductor of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra

646
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,980
and one of the most revered conductors around the world,

647
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,319
Ben Northey, an Australian legend in his space.

648
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,240
Richard Oppie.

649
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,240
An insightful guy, Ben.

650
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,200
He is remarkable.

651
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,200
He can just floor us with an observation in an instant.

652
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:20,839
He's amazing.

653
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,160
I might get you to share some reflections on it all.

654
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,180
Richard Oppie maybe has the biggest marketing job in the world, Rich.

655
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,619
He's the global head of brands for Budweiser, AB InBev,

656
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,299
for those that aren't aware.

657
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:36,839
I think the biggest consumer goods brand in the world.

658
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,019
And so Rich has an incredible success story in the world of marketing

659
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,759
and what they do at that level.

660
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:45,759
Michael Voss, AFL legend, doing a brilliant job as coach of cart.

661
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:50,259
One of the great leaders in our era, Chris, just an incredible person,

662
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,240
Michael Voss, and fantastic at what he does.

663
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,799
Trent Robinson, likewise.

664
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,279
I know you had some history with Trent before, but legend of his space

665
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,559
with the Sydney Roosters and the NRL.

666
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,319
And Dr. Chris Brown.

667
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:02,880
It's an interesting.

668
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,519
You know, a group getting together.

669
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:05,779
Can you tell us a bit about the experience?

670
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,880
It just has, you know, you think about that group of people and you already can tell

671
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,579
everyone's approaching things from a very, very different angle.

672
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:22,880
You have some real thought leaders in there and some real innovative thinkers.

673
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,480
And I just love, you know, we will bring a little problem into the mix there and a

674
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,019
little hurdle as they're called.

675
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:32,200
And.

676
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,160
And.

677
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,140
It'll just bounce around between the group and everyone will put their own little take, take on it.

678
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:48,599
And then someone from nowhere will just come in with some sort of insightful statement around an experience they've had or a message that they've used at a particular time.

679
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:52,359
And everyone just sits back and goes, whoa, like, what was that?

680
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,859
That is, that's amazing.

681
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,960
And everyone's sort of scribbling it down and writing it down.

682
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,640
And it, there's, it's so equal.

683
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:03,160
Everyone, everyone contributes.

684
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,200
It's in their own unique ways.

685
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:18,500
And, you know, there are, there are weeks where, you know, the, the old imposter syndrome is very easy to kick in when you're surrounded by the experience and, and the, and sort of the leadership qualities of these people.

686
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:25,259
But everyone, everyone finds their space and everyone finds their, their ability to, to, to really add, add value.

687
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:32,500
And, and there've been some, you know, you, you let into these, into these leaders worlds and it's fascinating to hear.

688
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,180
What's, what's actually going on behind the scenes there.

689
00:25:37,180 --> 00:26:02,119
You know, Rich, Rich Oppie, you know, so, so high up in, in, in Anheuser-Busch brewing and, and, and what he does there and, and, you know, he's just been at the World Cup and, and obviously there's been a lot of news around, around the, the serving of beer at the World Cup and, and to be able to, to sort of hear how that all, that all works out and, and how they, they manage the communications around that is, is, that's, that's fascinating.

690
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:04,779
Fascinating, fascinating world and fascinating insight.

691
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:17,940
And, you know, the world of marketing that he, he, he comes from is, is very different to the world of sport or, or the world of, of orchestral music and collaboration in that, in that respect, or, or the world of, of animals.

692
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:30,759
And, and then, you know, I try to add, add some value from my experience working in, in teams of, of, of people trying to, you know, wrangle giraffe on the fields of, of Botswana.

693
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:31,660
Like it's, it's.

694
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,059
Can I ask?

695
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:39,599
That question, I don't, I'm, you've, you've opened that, that door and I, if you, I know these conversations are private, but I find this incredible, isn't it?

696
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:53,460
And I, and I was told that you, you shared a story of, cause you do volunteer in Africa and, and, and get involved, but you literally, you know, how do, how do you tackle a giraffe and, and tell us that story.

697
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,859
So I've always found it interesting in my, in my field.

698
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,299
I don't really have mentors.

699
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:02,099
Like I don't really have strict.

700
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:14,380
Sort of role models, but because there aren't really people who do what I do, where you straddle this, this world of veterinary science and, and media and, and sort of creativity.

701
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:29,720
And, and it's so the, the closest thing I could find to, to a creative thought leader in the world of animals is this, this guy called Pete Morkle and he's a Namibian wildlife vet, which is Nietzsche already.

702
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,819
But this guy, this guy walks with a limp.

703
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:37,279
He's got one ear, he's had, had his legs broken, I think about seven times.

704
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,839
He's been kidnapped three times.

705
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:49,339
He, he looks like he should be in a movie that his character should be portrayed by like Clint Eastwood in, in his sort of defining role of his career.

706
00:27:49,579 --> 00:27:54,920
He's just an icon of African wildlife because there's, there's no animal he'll say no to.

707
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,180
And he's kind of, he's kind of the vet for, you know, you, your local vet is your vet for your suburb.

708
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,559
This guy's a vet for Africa.

709
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,119
And he.

710
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:11,940
He, he works with, with lions one day, he'll work with giraffe the next, rhinos, he's been charged by, you know, rhinos about, about seven times, nearly killed by about three rhinos.

711
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,619
He's just got the roll call of like the coolest scars in the world.

712
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:21,160
And, and I met him at a function in, in Sydney about, about 10 years ago.

713
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:31,700
And, and he's, you know, he's got a pretty good sense of humor and he's like, he goes, you know, you, you look like you're, you know, you, you seem like you're all right as a vet.

714
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:31,839
Yeah.

715
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,420
I reckon we need to toughen you up a bit.

716
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,579
And I was like, right.

717
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:40,299
Then he started to tell me these stories about getting kidnapped in Chad and, and ransoms being paid.

718
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:48,279
And, and I thought, Jesus, okay, this is, this is probably a little step up from, from your local Bondi, Bondi Veterinary Hospital treating, you know, seven poodles in a day.

719
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:54,680
And, and so we, we kept in touch and he was like, he was like, look, it suggests these trips and I'd always be working.

720
00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:02,000
And then finally this, this trip came up and, and we went across and.

721
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:05,900
We went across to, to, to wrangle some some giraffe.

722
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:17,420
And so the, the giraffe that it's been moved, essentially there was going to be a mine built in this giraffe, this prized giraffe habitat.

723
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,900
And so we had to move the giraffe across the Nile river.

724
00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:30,839
And that's not as simple as sort of opening a gate and, and sort of shooing them through these wild giraffe.

725
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:31,759
And giraffe.

726
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:37,960
delicate at the best of times tricky to to manage and so i got over there and had to learn the

727
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:46,319
finer points of how you how you sedate and and move uh giraffe and and basically what you do

728
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,799
if anyone wants to try this at home this is what you do this is your guide to how to catch it

729
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:56,200
you're riding this thing um so you get a tranquilizer dart not readily accessible

730
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:02,339
sure but you get a tranquilizer dart and you dart the giraffe but that's that's just the start

731
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:11,299
because the giraffe then runs and and the the tranquilizer will put them to sleep but it has

732
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:16,799
this period of excitation so it's a stimulant for about a minute and so they take off and they run

733
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,200
and they run themselves almost to the point of death and so you have to once you dart them you

734
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,200
have to take off in these four-wheel drives these sort of jeeps across

735
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:32,339
the african savannah and they're fast are they giraffe so fast yeah yeah so fast and and they'll

736
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:37,380
just go wherever wherever the spirits take them and one time one of them ran into the nile river

737
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,240
and everyone just looked at me and said well mate you're that you're the guy from from the beach you

738
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,839
jump in the water so i'm in the crocodile infested nile river trying to like keep this giraffe's head

739
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:51,920
up while they sort of attach ropes and and tow the giraffe out of the nile that was one that was

740
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,140
one situation but the rest of the time they'll sort of run themselves and they'll they'll

741
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,779
start to slow down but you have to get them on the ground quickly because they've built up so much

742
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:07,660
lactic acid um and it's in so much oxygen debt from this run that they will die they essentially

743
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:13,599
they essentially have a heart attack so you have to get them on the ground and so they then teach

744
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:18,779
you to get this really long rope it looks like a massive skipping rope and you need eight people

745
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:25,140
four on each end of this rope and you run in front of this giraffe and because they're quite

746
00:31:25,339 --> 00:31:26,140
sedated by this

747
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:33,700
stage and stumbling and exhausted you have to use this rope to trip the giraffe over and so it's

748
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,500
still it's still sort of it's jogging by this stage not sprinting jogging and so you run around

749
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:44,559
in front of it and and try to trip it over and you it usually takes three or four goes but the

750
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,059
emphasis is on getting this giraffe on the ground quickly the moment you trip it over someone has to

751
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:55,240
jump on the giraffe's head um because once you're on their head they can't stand up because that's

752
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,140
the pendulum that's

753
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,240
a belief that allows them to sort of swing upwards and and stand up so someone goes on the head and

754
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:08,319
then this was my job someone has to jump on onto their neck and inject about five mils of this

755
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:15,160
reversal agent of this of this sedation to essentially save their life wow um and and

756
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:20,559
allow their heart to sort of pump normally again and get rid of all this this lactic acid and then

757
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:25,660
so that was my job and then there's people on legs there there are people on on the body but

758
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:32,059
the head is kind of your lifeline if he moves you're you're gone um and and then you you wake

759
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:38,839
this giraffe up and with a blindfold on and the rope that the big skipping rope and you steer it

760
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:43,940
um essentially using the rope and pressure on each end of the rope onto a horse float

761
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:49,819
um and the giraffe is fully awake by this stage but blindfolded and then you get into a horse

762
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:56,220
float and then you drive it uh across the Nile River um that is how you catch a giraffe well

763
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:01,680
but it's what a life lesson what a life lesson and it's the ultimate sort of uh collaborative

764
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:06,740
moment isn't it I suppose if the guy on the head is having an off day hasn't listened that well

765
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:11,920
you're in some serious danger and as all animal lovers too I mean the worst scenario for you guys

766
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:17,839
would be that you didn't get it right and the giraffe died too so yeah it's yeah intense

767
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:18,640
that is

768
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,759
that is

769
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:19,799
that is

770
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:25,759
the nature of it that that um you know to borrow my my dad's amazingly comforting and and and

771
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:31,779
conciliatory message when you've got livestock you've got dead stock um and and and sadly you

772
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:36,119
know with with wildlife they're prone to stress and and if you can't catch that giraffe in time

773
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:42,900
um you if it runs away or gets you know becomes lost in in bushland that they they will usually

774
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,420
die um because of the amount of lactic acid they've they've built up they're they're kind of

775
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,740
like darts at the um the first sort of five

776
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:54,720
k time trial of the season um they just blow up they blow up pretty hard and nearly close

777
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,119
and yeah and that's that's that's obviously heartbreaking for everyone because you're there

778
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:04,599
to help them and um you know we we moved 20 20 giraffe in that time and and and pretty much got

779
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:09,300
every single member of that that group away from what was going to be a a mine site and a danger

780
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,320
zone for for poachers and and um and some wildlife track trafficking essentially so

781
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,679
yeah but but as you say that that vet that I mentioned at the start there Pete Morkle he

782
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:26,880
leads this team and and sort of assigns you to your sub team um but he's amazing guy in the way

783
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:32,559
that you can bring together english speakers non-english speakers people of varying degrees

784
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:39,219
of experience um tribal groups um from these areas that that were warring with each other

785
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:46,659
um you know not you know they had they had basically ethnic cleansing um you know not

786
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:56,340
so it's um it's a remarkably sort of difficult process but but one that that has you know

787
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:03,099
remarkable uh remarkable results if if you get it right and and you know that that's that's sort of

788
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:08,159
the nature of that that part of Uganda which is where we were doing the work is is um a very

789
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:13,500
vibrant place but but also um you know has its challenges and Chris that's what I love about you

790
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:19,179
know someone like you is uh as you said in a unique space creativity and uh doing the veterinary work

791
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:25,119
and it's not something that there is many mentors available but uh you know for you to you know to

792
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,800
share that experience and share that leadership and as you said um you know with uh someone who's

793
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,239
marketing beer on a global scale someone who's conducting an orchestra a couple of sporting uh

794
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,800
legends it's fascinating share of life experience and it feels like we've come out of this sort of

795
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,619
hyper individualized time in the world where everyone's a bit focused on self to a bit of

796
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:49,239
a crisis of connection so again it's a you know it's a really uh fascinating thing and we appreciate

797
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,059
joining that space and if you are interested I will give a short plug uh a leader is the space

798
00:35:54,059 --> 00:36:00,320
we're in you don't have to be a superstar tv uh most loved uh tv vet like Chris Brown to join us

799
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,699
you can um you know be in education or running a small business a leader collective.com check it

800
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:11,400
out thanks again Chris for being so open uh to be involved in it no no pleasure and I think um

801
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:19,119
I think what I've I've really found interesting is is that I think through vulnerability in those

802
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:25,739
spaces it comes the greatest the greatest results and and being I guess not not being arrogant enough

803
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:32,159
to think that you you don't have challenges that you face um and and in a collaborative space like

804
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:37,920
that to to be humble enough to go you know this is this is something I'm I'm challenged by or I'm

805
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:44,099
having difficulty with in my particular sphere this week or over the last month what do you guys

806
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:48,539
reckon what would be a good work around for for this little challenge or how can I bring the best

807
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:56,400
um and even just articulating that you'll often make sense of it more in your own mind as well

808
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:04,500
but but to have the gift of these different viewpoints um has been has been such a blessing

809
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:13,380
and and and such a I guess an enriching influence on on my my life to be able to to lean on those

810
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:19,500
on those learnings in in everyday life and and I guess be a better um you'd be a better

811
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:25,320
leader and be a better team member when when you do step into other stressful situations or or

812
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:31,199
unexpected situations which you know uh I think we're all we're all exposed to it at different

813
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:36,900
times and and just to have that have that little have that little nugget in in your uh in your

814
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,380
kit bag you can pull out and think you know what that that might just get me through that situation

815
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,940
and I love your commitment to it Chris I understand you you've been in Iceland and Finland and three

816
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,500
o'clock in the morning in the back of the combi van there's uh there's Dr Chris Brown dialing in

817
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:54,719
to to connect and collaborate it's a it's a great effort um in the middle of the night you must have

818
00:37:54,719 --> 00:38:01,079
been getting some strange looks from the the locals in that part of the world my like already

819
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:06,780
when you um when you're sort of a six foot five sort of Australian driving around in a camper van

820
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:12,000
um you already get you already get some strange looks but you know me me sitting the little glow

821
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,460
of my laptop um in these sort of isolated campsites while everyone's you know a lot of people

822
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,619
are over the age of sort of 75 um

823
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:24,539
who are who are on these camper van adventures and and there's me sort of tapping in and and and

824
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:29,219
chatting with the with the guys uh in the in that group but I I wouldn't I wouldn't miss a session

825
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:34,739
for the world I I just think they're um they're so uh they're so enriching and so and so interesting

826
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:40,559
and you get off you get off those those calls feeling like a like a better person and and and

827
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:45,900
with those sort of mentors and with those um those those guys who who whose problems aren't and

828
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,440
challenges I guess aren't aren't that different to your own they're just in a in a different

829
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:55,739
context and uh Chris it's you know fascinating for you to you know I love how you you're open to

830
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:59,579
uh as you said all of us have challenging moments I think from the outside you know

831
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:03,599
people look at Chris Brown and think wow you know that's the life I'd love to have surfing

832
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:09,059
down at Bondi uh incredible life traveling around the world surfing the best uh breaks

833
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:14,699
and you know being on TV and life seems like it's perfect but I mean I'm assuming yeah everyone has

834
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:19,380
their challenges don't they have their bumps is you you're open to share has there been a regret

835
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:24,960
um or a fail you could share because it does look like you've got the perfect life Chris but I

836
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:33,960
suppose that doesn't exist no I think um no you know far from it I I think uh yeah I I can be my

837
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:42,300
my harshest critic uh often um which which I think is is a is a useful skill but also one that you you

838
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:47,340
need to keep an eye on because uh you probably you're probably doing okay but but you're um

839
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,619
you're in a critic can can sometimes have the

840
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:54,420
loudest voice in the room and I think that's something to be always to be to be mindful of

841
00:39:55,199 --> 00:40:02,519
um look I once got I once got told by a television executive um that I'm a difficult dog to keep on

842
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:07,920
the porch and I appreciated that the animal animal sort of linked to to the to the analogy

843
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,500
um but what what he was trying to say was probably something that is quite relevant I I get bored

844
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:19,440
easily um and I'm always looking for a new challenge and it's kind of that that situation

845
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:26,159
where curiosity is a really useful thing to have and it's sort of guided me through a lot of what

846
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:31,800
I've done because I'm I want to I want to learn more and I want to be better um but but it can

847
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,440
mean that you you I never like to be stuck in one thing for too long and and always want to be want

848
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,980
to be moving on and trying trying something else um so that's that's potentially a a bit of a

849
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:49,019
challenge I'm I'm I I do find it hard to be to stay in one place for for too long which is I'd

850
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,159
has you know flow and effects to you know to relationships i i probably would have thought

851
00:40:54,159 --> 00:41:01,039
that i i'd probably have have kids and and um you know potentially be be married uh by now and and

852
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:06,320
uh but that you know that hasn't happened because i probably prioritized work a little bit um

853
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,480
potentially in hindsight a little bit too much but but that that sort of things

854
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:17,920
barks quite loudly you know to use another animal analogy um it's it can be quite a demanding

855
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,559
a demanding thing to to focus on on work so if you know there is there are probably any regrets

856
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:31,360
i have it's it's probably around not necessarily having enough enough time for for uh for myself

857
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:37,199
and and for the people the people around me funnily enough in iceland i i had this really

858
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:46,000
profound moment i was hiking in the highlands of iceland and and deliberately i was there by

859
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,840
myself and i just was hiking and just

860
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:54,400
going going up and down these these little these volcanoes basically and uh i was just

861
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,440
sort of pondering pondering life and it's a great place to do that because the natural

862
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:06,000
beauty of things there is is just off off the charts and and it just kind of is a really

863
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,639
interesting reminder the fact that when you are driven and when you're when you're determined to

864
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:17,280
always um strive to be better and and curiosity leads you on those paths and and you you invest in

865
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,199
the you know creating a show or doing a working on a production and and you know it's such a

866
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:26,400
privilege to be the front and center of those productions something like i'm a celebrity get

867
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,599
me out he has has 400 crew and you have the honor of standing in front of the camera essentially

868
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:39,840
presenting the work of 400 people um it's it's a reminder that you come sometimes get obsessed with

869
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:45,280
the climb and the climb up that mountain and taking on a show and working a show is like

870
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:54,159
at a base camp if you like you fuel yourself up you get yourself whole you feel like you're ready

871
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:58,400
to take on a challenge you store up all that adrenaline you're ready to go and you start the

872
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:05,920
climb and and creating a show is a lot like that um and and you you take the hits it's hard at

873
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,760
different times but you want to get to the peak of that mountain which which is essentially your

874
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,119
rating success it's it's a it's a show that's well received it's your performance is is something

875
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,599
that is is well regarded and and

876
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:25,280
and you you um you reach those heights and and you come off air in that that final episode of

877
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,639
the series and you're like done what a great high and then and then you kind of look around from the

878
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:36,480
top of that mountain and and realize there's there's about 50 or 60 other mountains um out

879
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,239
in the distance that they're also they're as high if not higher than the one you you're on so you

880
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:47,679
think okay i'll go back down this mountain and go back to my base camp and then you sort of refuel

881
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,880
in and and you realize that everyone in life everyone's climbing mountains you know in their

882
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,719
different fields and uh but but it's kind of the climb's not important the the view from the top's

883
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:02,559
not important it's kind of like it's basically what happens in the base camp is is kind of the

884
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:08,960
most important part of of life and i think that's probably i probably neglect my my base camp a

885
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:16,960
little bit uh too much and and the nurturing sort of refueling um fulfilling aspects of of that i

886
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,760
think it probably

887
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:25,760
um probably something that uh that you know i i probably would look to spend more time

888
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,280
uh working on and and i know i'm not alone in that in that respect in in terms of being able to

889
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:38,559
switch off and and uh and i guess re-engage with the world around you that's not as adrenaline

890
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:44,320
fueled or cortisol fueled as that that world and i'm sure sports people who who get themselves

891
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,440
up for a season it's that's that's their mountain they're climbing

892
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:53,679
um it's it's it's fair it's fairly relevant across a lot of people and and so that's kind

893
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:59,360
of been a really interesting lesson uh for me and something which we talk about in the elit uh

894
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:06,719
collective group a lot is is just that how do we how do we switch off and how do we refuel and how

895
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:12,000
do we reconnect and i think that's been a really interesting one to to to see how shared that that

896
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,760
challenge is of of switching off and of re recharging that's that's probably that's probably

897
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,039
the biggest the biggest one that um that i think is is it is an ongoing challenge for so many of us

898
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:34,090
in doing some preparation for this chris you know get on and do some research and

899
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:40,570
it seems to be an extraordinary fascination chris with uh your uh status in terms of you know one

900
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:44,170
story was which i wanted to you know the fact you broke your arm on a dance floor was a story i

901
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:47,849
thought you might have told at some stage the other story was like you've been apparently been married

902
00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:52,170
eight times from what i read in in uh in preparation chris so maybe someone just has to tell you

903
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:59,449
i've been married at times and and i've i've had five i've i've been my partner's been pregnant

904
00:45:59,449 --> 00:46:03,929
with five different children i haven't seen one of them um so i'm waiting for the knock on the door

905
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:11,289
but but according to new idea the knock will come at some stage i'm quite sure but yeah that that

906
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:18,570
that sort of interest in in my personal life it has always been kind of intriguing and you know

907
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:23,130
a few a few quite a few people tell me it's because i am private that they that they're interested in

908
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:29,849
and but i've just never been someone who's been who's enjoyed um sharing sharing that side of

909
00:46:29,849 --> 00:46:34,329
things it's even before media i was i was always quite private around that that side of things and

910
00:46:34,889 --> 00:46:40,969
um so i've always found the interest quite quite odd um and you know being followed by paparazzi

911
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:48,090
who are trying to get the shot of the my my new wife or new you know mother-to-be um i find it

912
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:53,449
i find it quite odd but but quite it's quite unnerving as well and and and it's it's sort of a

913
00:46:53,610 --> 00:47:01,130
strange thing to have that that camera pointed at you and and uh yeah but but it's it's a hard thing

914
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:07,690
to to explain that that feeling that you get from it um but it's it is part and parcel of of the job

915
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:14,969
and you just have to accept the fact that it is you know we in a weird way it is a compliment that

916
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:21,690
that seemingly people want to know um even though i don't necessarily love to love to share um

917
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:23,130
people kind of want to know but

918
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:30,650
uh you know one year when i was i was in africa i had an african wedding um apparently and but

919
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:34,969
the magazine had photoshopped these photos they had the menu they had the guest list they even

920
00:47:34,969 --> 00:47:40,889
had a wedding photo taken from behind and they'd photoshopped the back of my head and the back of

921
00:47:40,889 --> 00:47:47,050
my partner's head um her her head and and dress and they had a full description of the wedding

922
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:52,650
i had family members like cousins contacting me saying pissed off thanks for the invite yeah

923
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:57,210
and the fact that they would invite us to the wedding and chris i suppose that's you know we

924
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:02,170
can laugh about you know that i i couldn't imagine walking your shoes in that experience but it it's

925
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:07,289
it's it's your mum who calls or the cousins who read it as fact isn't it that's where

926
00:48:07,849 --> 00:48:13,610
the time is spent isn't it trying to tell people no that that hasn't happened is is that a common

927
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:18,730
occurrence for you and and do you just accept that yeah you you do you do and i think the

928
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:23,289
you always take comfort in the fact that the people the people closest to you do know

929
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:30,730
um exactly what's um what's the you know what's actually going on in your life but it is hard when

930
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:37,050
you know you get those messages or or people uh contact you and a little a little bit put out

931
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:40,010
about the fact that you're not they're not seemingly part of your life because they

932
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:46,090
haven't told you that you you've fathered three separate children to three different women in the

933
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:52,650
last year um so it's it's it's it's an it's odd it's odd but you you've got to at some point you

934
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:56,889
just got to laugh and just think you know wow it's going to be a it's going to be a good scrapbook

935
00:48:56,889 --> 00:49:02,409
collection to to show that the kids one day well i was overwhelmed by the stories in uh in in doing

936
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:09,050
some homework uh chris wasn't quite aware of the of the extent of the of the courage when asking

937
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:15,289
these uh dimensions of leadership chris which we see a common we think in in a new form of leader

938
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:21,210
like yourself who are very much open to to learning and improvement and collaborating as you clearly

939
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:27,610
are with your sense of self-leadership chris does that does that term mean something to you being

940
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:35,050
a self-leader yeah i i think so i think it's it's it's all about um you know i try to stay

941
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:43,769
very current and very you know up to up to speed with with these worlds that i i operate in and try

942
00:49:43,769 --> 00:49:51,690
to you know keep across popular culture and and um but also that the world of of animals and and

943
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:52,650
you know challenge myself

944
00:49:53,369 --> 00:50:01,369
in that self-leadership style to to read um and and to uh to engage with um with different things

945
00:50:01,369 --> 00:50:07,929
around me to to constantly keep keep relevant and and stay up to date because god the world of

946
00:50:07,929 --> 00:50:14,090
animals the world of media it moves fast and you never really want to get um never really want to

947
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:22,409
get caught behind uh in in that world and so you know i get these i get these journals delivered to

948
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:30,170
house um you know every every week uh which ironically that the one that i get the most

949
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:36,570
is the journal of veterinary behavior and it's the one that my dog chews up the most um you know

950
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:42,010
trying trying to get some learnings for himself out of it um and just reminding me that you know

951
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:47,769
what do they say about you know dentists always have the worst teeth um and uh and you know the

952
00:50:47,769 --> 00:50:51,769
vet's dog is always the worst behaved one and you know i'm a rescue dog and he's

953
00:50:52,650 --> 00:51:01,210
constantly apologizing uh for him in in the dog park uh and and so it's yeah i think just holding

954
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:07,610
holding yourself to account to be current and relevant and and i guess it's also what makes

955
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:11,530
life interesting what's make what makes you feel interesting is to constantly be innovating and

956
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:16,409
and and challenging the the status quo and that's what i've i guess i've tried to do through my

957
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:22,570
whole whole career is is be a little bit different and and push the push the envelope just that little

958
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:27,769
bit um just just to to surprise you know it you never want to be boring i think it's it's a good

959
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:34,809
life mantra to never be boring or always challenging the norm and and um and and just

960
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:38,409
giving people something a little bit surprising i don't think you're ever going to be accused of

961
00:51:38,409 --> 00:51:44,170
being uh boring chris anytime uh soon we see another dimension is losing really conscious

962
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:48,730
of how they positively impact others in their environment you know people you know won't know

963
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:52,570
when you know i'm a celebrity goes to air that there are 400 people behind

964
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:57,050
that and and you know tv is a small industry and you know you know lots of people have worked on

965
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:03,690
that show with you and they their comment is that it's just you know you're you create an environment

966
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:08,170
where it is a really positive uh environment for everyone that works on the show can you tell us

967
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:12,090
about maybe not that specific example but you can if you like around how you've gone about that

968
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:20,969
positive impact on others look i think um i think a lot of it has to do with um

969
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:26,730
you know obviously doing your job well that that's that's that's why you're there

970
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:32,730
um and in in my roles and responsibilities i feel like you know hosting and doing

971
00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:39,210
doing honor to to the hard work of editors and producers and and the you know the celebrities

972
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:43,849
that are stuck in the jungle eating you know impala anuses um you know everyone's everyone's

973
00:52:43,849 --> 00:52:51,610
putting in for the team dust um and and so i kind of get the the easy job of um of bringing that all

974
00:52:52,650 --> 00:53:00,090
together um but i think these are so um i'm not sure uh i'd like to say i think as a leader

975
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:05,769
i've always been a big believer in the fact that so much of what we bring as a leader is is unspoken

976
00:53:06,409 --> 00:53:13,449
and uh i think animals are such a great great example of this um in the way that you know

977
00:53:13,449 --> 00:53:19,289
your dog doesn't understand much english if any at all um especially not mine in the dog park

978
00:53:19,289 --> 00:53:21,369
um and and so

979
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:21,849
um and and so

980
00:53:21,849 --> 00:53:27,289
we carry ourselves and and your body language and that unspoken language you know i've heard

981
00:53:27,289 --> 00:53:32,250
it described as being half of you know up up to and sometimes more than half of our communication

982
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:39,289
is unspoken and it is that the energy you bring into a room um and it's it's it's you know people

983
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:45,769
talk about your aura or your your vibe or your charisma or your energy it's it's sort of that

984
00:53:45,769 --> 00:53:51,369
that i guess that composure you can bring into a situation that makes that lets everyone know

985
00:53:51,369 --> 00:53:56,090
it's it's everything's going to be okay but more than everything's going to be okay

986
00:53:57,449 --> 00:54:02,809
that encouraging positive energy to contribute and asking people to bring

987
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:08,489
a little bit of themselves out as well and in a creative environment and really every

988
00:54:08,489 --> 00:54:14,409
every work environment every sporting team has a creative element you you want to be

989
00:54:14,409 --> 00:54:20,969
bringing ideas to the fore and doing things differently and so if you can bring calmness

990
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:21,369
if you can bring some real freedom to your writes with the things that you've been doing

991
00:54:21,369 --> 00:54:29,469
bring positivity and through that that energy you bring encourage contributions and collaborations

992
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:34,190
i i think i think that's a huge a huge thing and that's before you even open your mouth

993
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:40,389
um you're already bringing a hell of a lot to the to the table and i think that's that's something

994
00:54:40,389 --> 00:54:48,610
that i i really really relish on on those big productions is is the ability to um to be to be

995
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:57,010
a team player and to engage with different team members um in a really encouraging positive way

996
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:03,730
and make everyone feel like everyone's pushing in this in the same same direction and and we're all

997
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:08,309
we're all part of creating this incredible product at the end and that's that's something

998
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:13,469
that that you know i enjoy that show so much because of of that experience of having so many

999
00:55:13,469 --> 00:55:18,530
people from so many different backgrounds working all sorts of crazy hours to bring this this kind

1000
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:18,590
of

1001
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:24,110
crazy kind of strange tv show to the to the fore but we we kind of love we kind of love that um

1002
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:29,150
that whole process and enjoying just enjoying the process enjoying the privilege of of being in the

1003
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:37,809
middle of africa um and and somehow uh you know calling what we do over there a job um is is kind

1004
00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:41,610
of a bit of an honor in a way and i love the way you describe that isn't it you know your energy

1005
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:48,110
shows up before you speak doesn't it on on so many uh occasions and having you clearly think about

1006
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:48,590
that it is a bit of an honor in a way and i love the way you describe that isn't it you know your

1007
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:55,010
it impacts uh a team of that scale in an incredibly positive way um creating i think it's yeah yeah

1008
00:55:55,010 --> 00:56:01,170
it's just going to say it's you know we we get up at four in the morning and it's very easy to walk

1009
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:06,110
in and be like oh i'm tired or yeah i'm really exhausted and then you sort of look around and

1010
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:13,030
and the writers we use on that show um you know matt and michael these two guys who are incredibly

1011
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:16,510
talented but they've been up since midnight like they've been in there since midnight so

1012
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:18,570
there's always someone more tired than yourself and i think it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's

1013
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:23,730
always someone more stressed than yourself um and and there's always someone who's who's

1014
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:27,809
questioning themselves you know more than you're questioning yourself like you you've got no reason

1015
00:56:27,809 --> 00:56:34,230
to to feel down it's it's all a privilege it's all upside really and and i think it it's it's

1016
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:39,690
all privilege really to to to be there so yeah it's it's a really useful reminder to look around

1017
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:45,070
your your team members and and appreciate the fact that you've you um you're you're in you're

1018
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:48,570
in a good spot thing things are okay it's a it's a great way to articulate it

1019
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:54,650
one of my favorite people in media to work with has been bruce mcavaney um over the journey for

1020
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:58,909
exactly that reason it could be around 16 i always you just feel this incredible privilege

1021
00:56:58,909 --> 00:57:03,389
grew up wanting to play sport for a living and then to be there on a saturday sitting in the

1022
00:57:03,389 --> 00:57:07,349
best seat in the house calling the game in my view every day has to be a good day like that

1023
00:57:07,349 --> 00:57:12,269
is someone's best ever day but you can get you know the rain's coming down middle of winter it's

1024
00:57:12,269 --> 00:57:18,570
16 versus 17 you get a few crusty journos in the media box going what a crap day this is and and

1025
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:23,449
you know terrible game you know i can't believe we're here for this one i often think you know

1026
00:57:23,449 --> 00:57:28,130
what else would you know we all be doing but but you walk into the the seven bot and there's bruce

1027
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:33,090
and and and oh you're not gonna believe how exciting this is you should see this player

1028
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:39,530
that i saw last week from freemantle he went to this school and it's just proper joy and it's

1029
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:44,690
and you go he's been doing it longer than anyone if he's still able to bring that level of

1030
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:48,570
enthusiasm that's something we should all uh have that perspective all the time

1031
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:52,610
and it's infectious you you just immediately want to be good you know you can't help but

1032
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:58,110
you know yeah rub off and and you realize that at different times that

1033
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:04,530
everyone's everyone's job everyone's work everyone's sort of role throws up these these

1034
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:09,710
sort of these bizarre situations every now and then and you you sort of have to have to appreciate

1035
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:18,210
them and you know you know being able to uh you know to go toe-to-toe with someone like freddie

1036
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:23,909
hoff who you know former english cricket art almost australia's cricketing nemesis of the of

1037
00:58:23,909 --> 00:58:30,230
the early 2000s and such a character but so quick with it and and and to measure yourself up against

1038
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:38,650
these guys and and um and you're going to these mental mind games and you realize what makes

1039
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:44,610
sports some of these sports people great isn't their physical attributes it's it's their mindset

1040
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:48,570
and the ability to to to get inside that mind and the ability to to get inside that mindset

1041
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:53,929
and see what makes them tick um and see what entertains them but see their methodical process

1042
00:58:53,929 --> 00:58:59,170
and and you know freddie was one who who before he went to a trial which are like these challenges

1043
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:05,510
where you can they compete essentially to win food he would go around the group and get research

1044
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:13,349
material on me and my life to be able to throw back at me in like who i was dating or or um what

1045
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:18,510
i what i like what i didn't like anything to do with my history he'd research the group so he

1046
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:24,550
had ammunition um to to bring into these trials so if it went if it went we went toe to toe he'd go

1047
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:30,409
shot for shot and and fire back at me and so but he didn't realize i was able to watch the monitor

1048
00:59:30,409 --> 00:59:35,550
so i'm seeing him go around the group and before the trial getting all this information so i'd have

1049
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:42,170
the the counter argument for everything he was going to put forward um and and so similar similar

1050
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:48,170
thing with you know with warny um you know we miss him so much and and what i what i loved about him

1051
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:55,469
in the jungle was it was it was a great example of of what made him so bloody great and it was that

1052
00:59:56,429 --> 01:00:01,469
just that meticulous thought process and the fact that he could he could will himself over

1053
01:00:01,469 --> 01:00:09,710
the line with with mindset alone and you know he he would have to it was one time where it's

1054
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:15,550
it's so bizarre to even talk about but you know a fermented herring milkshake you know and it's

1055
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:21,230
it's one of the most disgusting foods on the planet um and it's a delicacy in sweden but who

1056
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:27,869
would have thought um and he it was just disgusting and he couldn't he couldn't get it down and so i

1057
01:00:27,869 --> 01:00:32,909
thought i'm going to get one over warning here i thought if warning can't do it then if i can get

1058
01:00:32,909 --> 01:00:38,190
if i can do something warning can't then this he'll he'll hate it but but it'll also we'll also

1059
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:43,389
love it because we'll always have that over and uh and i went and thought i'll show warning and and

1060
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:50,829
what he knew best this thing was horrendous and i vomited on the set you know about 10 seconds later

1061
01:00:50,829 --> 01:00:56,670
and just kept on vomiting for about an hour after that and uh and when you know what he was right

1062
01:00:56,670 --> 01:01:01,869
and he never forgot that and every single time i saw him after that he'd bring it up but um the

1063
01:01:01,869 --> 01:01:08,190
the ability of his mind to mind over matter to be able to create a thought process that would allow

1064
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:15,389
him to win against the odds um was was incredible to see and and and that little insight into into

1065
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:21,389
mind of great leaders and great performers um is something that i i really i really treasure out

1066
01:01:21,389 --> 01:01:25,789
of those out of those different moments unique window into the genius isn't it that was a guy

1067
01:01:25,789 --> 01:01:31,789
who ate you know toasted cheese sandwiches and and baked beans only so he was in very uncomfortable

1068
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:37,389
uh territory and and as you have and anyone that had the pleasure of being around you know shane

1069
01:01:37,389 --> 01:01:43,150
the the most generous and and collaborative and bring people together and you know he was

1070
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:44,989
unbelievable on that show

1071
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:49,949
understand with a couple of disclaimers uh chris which may be a story for another time but there

1072
01:01:49,949 --> 01:01:54,670
was a certain things that he needed uh uh wanted to get through that um you know you may or may

1073
01:01:54,670 --> 01:02:00,349
not be able to confirm i just i'm gonna leave that smile on on your face and just the nods

1074
01:02:02,829 --> 01:02:07,070
um creating and sharing a vision is something we see leaves are really

1075
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:10,510
good at these days and conscious of you know doing the homework and looking at what you're

1076
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:15,150
doing with drool you know the integrity quality ingredients in the pet food industry i mean

1077
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:20,670
there's a lot of things that you do that are are unique how have you gone about that creating

1078
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:27,869
and sharing that vision yeah look business has always felt like a a very foreign thing to me i

1079
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:34,750
think if you were to sort of look inside the brain of most vets that sort of the the animal

1080
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:40,110
capabilities takes up sort of 99 of it and then in one little dark deep dark corner is is the

1081
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:44,590
business mind and it's it's sort of suppressed because there are no good vets who are businessmen

1082
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:54,110
aware and um and and so but but this desire to make a difference that i i that kind of guides me

1083
01:02:54,110 --> 01:03:00,030
through everything i do to do things differently and and and make a difference um i just for years

1084
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:08,429
and years i've i just sit in a vet clinic and look at at the the foods and the products that that we

1085
01:03:08,429 --> 01:03:13,949
feed our pets and it's it's it's terrible there's there's no regulation there's no proper regulation

1086
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:21,550
and you can kind of just you know bung a label on on any old thing that you you it can be unfit for

1087
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:26,989
human consumption but it's fine it's fine for animals um and and i just got so sick of seeing

1088
01:03:26,989 --> 01:03:32,110
these products claiming to be able to help and claiming to do this and that and there'd be no

1089
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:36,829
scientific basis to it whatsoever and and um and just thought i'd go in there and shake

1090
01:03:36,829 --> 01:03:40,750
shake things up a little bit with my own brand that actually you know did have the research

1091
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:45,469
behind it and did have the quality behind it and um didn't know what i was getting myself into

1092
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:50,750
um launching a business and and it takes up way more time way more sort of after hours time than

1093
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:57,309
ever i ever thought but but drool is is sort of my expression of um yeah just just this passion to

1094
01:03:57,869 --> 01:04:03,230
to help out animals and and address the the biggest challenges that our pets face um

1095
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:09,469
whether it's anxiety or whether it's joint problems or or um you know whether it's dental

1096
01:04:09,469 --> 01:04:14,030
health or all those gut upsets all those different challenges just by being able to help them through

1097
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:15,469
through proper proper nutrition

1098
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:20,909
um nutrition and supplements that actually do do help you know perish the thought it's um it's

1099
01:04:20,909 --> 01:04:27,230
great and uh you know dust i'm sure those knees are a little dusty um by this stage you can i can

1100
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:31,389
i can hook you up and and you know work i'm sure it works for people as well we can talk

1101
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:36,590
that's uh that's another angle i hadn't thought of that with uh we're looking at the ingredients

1102
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:40,670
but the knees are in trouble so i might uh i might take you up on that i've heard you use

1103
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:45,469
the word curiosity a lot in this conversation already about being incredibly curious which we

1104
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:50,829
see is another common dimension and trait tell us about you know using curiosity for for your

1105
01:04:50,829 --> 01:05:00,110
approach to learning and development yeah it's um i guess i don't like the conventional i i i think

1106
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:05,630
there's there's excitement and there's brilliance in in new ideas and i'm always naturally drawn to

1107
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:14,670
the to the new ideas and and the new ways of uh of doing things and and always trying to find i guess

1108
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:21,710
a better way of of of doing whatever whatever you're doing and and you know that from from

1109
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:26,909
the outset that was always uh that was always something that i was i was keen to do and you

1110
01:05:26,909 --> 01:05:34,269
know i remember you know finally yvette while everyone was sort of buttering up the the

1111
01:05:34,269 --> 01:05:38,750
lecturers to give them good marks and and teach them you know the conventional way of doing

1112
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:44,750
surgery i was trying to do come up with different ways of of doing surgery whilst going off to film

1113
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:50,989
parody videos that mocked the very lecturers i was trying to i was trying to get get information

1114
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:56,429
from which is probably a slightly counterproductive um counterproductive tool and mechanism but but

1115
01:05:56,429 --> 01:06:01,789
that desire to sort of entertain and and be creative in what i did was was always um

1116
01:06:02,429 --> 01:06:09,630
was always there and and then when i graduated i i uh i i learned i learned surgery um

1117
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:15,150
not in the conventional way like i you know most most people sort of do dog and

1118
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:22,349
spays and and castrations and and i did those but i had a client down the road from my very first

1119
01:06:22,349 --> 01:06:32,190
vet practice in neutral bay and he had he had pet mice and and mice uh they're funny little they're

1120
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:37,630
miss they're misjudged pets i i don't think people see them as being cuddly beautiful little creatures

1121
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:42,909
but they're quite funny little little animals and but his mice used to always get these tumors and

1122
01:06:42,909 --> 01:06:44,190
and and so

1123
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:51,469
i um i would go and uh he'd bring these these mice in almost every week with a with a tumor and he

1124
01:06:51,469 --> 01:06:56,429
had about 20 of them so they're always getting these lumps and so i i learned surgical skills by

1125
01:06:56,429 --> 01:07:03,230
performing surgery on mice and and that was sort of my curious mind of like every other every other

1126
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:07,070
vet in the area was saying no just put it down and i was like no i reckon there's a chance here i

1127
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:13,630
reckon we can do something do something and i i worked out a way to operate on mice using these

1128
01:07:14,269 --> 01:07:15,309
tiny little instruments

1129
01:07:15,789 --> 01:07:23,550
and uh and and got quite good at removing tumors um these tumorous growths these cancerous growths

1130
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:29,949
from from mice and and so when it came to operating on dogs and cats or cows or horses that was easy

1131
01:07:29,949 --> 01:07:34,670
like that that was gotta be pretty delicate i'm assuming operating on them i'm sure there's a

1132
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:40,829
margin for error is there with a with a nice thing if if they lose you know a mill of blood

1133
01:07:40,829 --> 01:07:45,530
during the operation it's um it's a meal too much they they they'll they won't wake up and they're

1134
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:49,090
gonna have to do another surgery and then they're going to have to go back out from the surgery so

1135
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:54,190
um that that kind of became a bit of a bit of fun and and and develop those those skills and and

1136
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:58,590
then yeah that curiosity to learn more about different animals and and the way different

1137
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:04,909
animals worked meant that while a lot of the other vets again would say no to a bird um to

1138
01:08:04,909 --> 01:08:11,150
looking after a bird or to looking after a guinea pig or to looking after a you know a kangaroo joey

1139
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:14,989
that someone had been out in the country and found on a country road and decided to bring back to the

1140
01:08:14,989 --> 01:08:21,470
city for no for no apparent reason and so i just developed this name i guess around the local area

1141
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:27,949
for kind of looking after a bit of everything and and i kind of like that that to me is the

1142
01:08:28,510 --> 01:08:33,869
best demonstration of what a vet can be is is someone who who just looks after the entire

1143
01:08:33,869 --> 01:08:40,350
breadth of the animal kingdom um and and so because of that you know one thing led to

1144
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:46,989
another and ended up doing the show bondi vet and then in bondi vet i used to look after lots of

1145
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:55,069
different lots of different animals and then um a few years ago uh i got a i got contacted by this

1146
01:08:55,069 --> 01:09:01,229
production company in the us and they they wanted me to to front this show called vet gone wild

1147
01:09:01,229 --> 01:09:08,189
right and and like the name suggests it was um it was basically the role was as a vet who went into

1148
01:09:09,949 --> 01:09:10,189
any

1149
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:16,909
country in the world and treated any animal they came across in any situation and it sounds very

1150
01:09:16,909 --> 01:09:23,069
exciting until you realize just how bloody daunting that is um and so i signed up for the

1151
01:09:23,069 --> 01:09:27,470
show it was with animal planet in the us and it was a big you know big big job and i was pretty

1152
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:34,510
pretty excited about it and it was a different country every week so you you land in in uh i

1153
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:38,750
think namibia was the first country you went to and i looked after cheetahs and i've done some

1154
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:39,949
i've done lion surgery before

1155
01:09:39,949 --> 01:09:47,310
so cheetahs were fine but we're doing surgeries on cheetahs um then we went out to uh to look after

1156
01:09:47,949 --> 01:09:54,750
some elephants and and yeah that's i had a awkward situation where i had to give a contraceptive

1157
01:09:54,750 --> 01:10:02,750
injection to an elephant a few years before and the biggest biggest danger when you when you when

1158
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:09,550
you dart an elephant is you want them to when they fall asleep they don't run off like the giraffe when

1159
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:13,470
you want them when they fall asleep to fall asleep on their side because then you can stretch their

1160
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:18,829
trunk out because if they fall asleep on their trunk um that's like falling asleep on how they

1161
01:10:18,829 --> 01:10:26,510
breathe and and so they they can suffocate but if you if you dart a male if they fall asleep

1162
01:10:27,149 --> 01:10:31,710
in the dog basically like a dog sits in the same the same sort of dog sitting position

1163
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:39,550
um they sit on their penis and and they cut off the they they can essentially

1164
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:45,149
the look on your face says it all does but you know you're talking about a couple of tons going

1165
01:10:45,149 --> 01:10:51,789
through their their penis and and it can be catastrophic understandably and so the the one

1166
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:56,510
time i darted an elephant before he'd sat on his penis and so you have to run in with a couple of

1167
01:10:56,510 --> 01:11:02,989
people and push this elephant over and free free his his old mate and and otherwise you know he'll

1168
01:11:02,989 --> 01:11:09,310
net he'll never breed again um so i at least brought some experience um of the strangest kind

1169
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:14,989
into working with elephants um on this show and so different country every week but we went to

1170
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:23,710
vietnam we obviously did australia uh namibia south africa but the craziest one we ended up in costa

1171
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:29,390
rica and and this is kind of where where curiosity can can really get the better of you and and can

1172
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:34,189
can really do a job on you sometimes and so we're driving through the mountains of costa rica and we

1173
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:39,229
get this phone call from this local wildlife rescue group who were excited about the fact they had a

1174
01:11:39,229 --> 01:11:39,529
they had a

1175
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:46,670
vet on hand um and they said oh uh and this is most of this is in spanish and my spanish isn't

1176
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:53,789
very good and but i i could hear the word sloth getting getting mentioned and so we went out to

1177
01:11:53,789 --> 01:12:01,310
this um this little farmhouse out in the rainforest and and that that had this that that spotted a

1178
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:07,470
sloth in a tree nearby that had this arm that was hanging down and so we had to shake this tree with

1179
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:09,229
a blanket underneath it to to shake this tree with a blanket underneath it to to shake this tree and

1180
01:12:09,229 --> 01:12:15,789
to shake this sloth out of the tree sloth fell it falls down onto the blanket and i'm i'm leading

1181
01:12:15,789 --> 01:12:24,670
this at this stage a team of of 10 10 television crew uh from this us production um plus this sort

1182
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:30,989
of wildlife rescue team of about five people in broken spanish and i'm presented with a sloth

1183
01:12:31,869 --> 01:12:37,949
with a with a badly injured arm and it at that point it dawns on me that i've never i've never

1184
01:12:37,949 --> 01:12:39,069
seen a sloth before

1185
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:44,350
never like not even in a zoo i've never seen a sloth before and i mean i'm dealing with a

1186
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:50,590
foreign language and and i had to work out a way to uh to to treat this sloth and we worked out

1187
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:56,989
i've worked out very quickly that um all the hair on the the slot's arm was was burnt and and sadly

1188
01:12:56,989 --> 01:13:02,909
this sloth had been climbing through the vines in this rainforest and someone had run an illegal um

1189
01:13:02,909 --> 01:13:08,829
electrical wire through the through the rainforest and he'd zap his arm on this on this electrical

1190
01:13:09,229 --> 01:13:15,789
wire and and you know it was at this moment that i i was grateful that i'd worked with with this

1191
01:13:15,789 --> 01:13:23,149
crazy namibian vet pete morkel this guy that i was telling you about because he always said you know

1192
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:27,949
never get never get overroared by the animal that you that you have in front of you because you've

1193
01:13:27,949 --> 01:13:33,630
always got your your first principles you've always if you don't get fooled by the animal

1194
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:39,069
you're looking at almost every animal works the same way the the infection pro infection

1195
01:13:39,229 --> 01:13:44,590
process works the same way inflammation works the same way um and and the way you stabilize an

1196
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:50,829
animal the way you mend an animal is is all is all basically the same apart from a sloth

1197
01:13:51,949 --> 01:13:56,029
slots slots are quite different you know every pretty much every animal on earth has seven

1198
01:13:56,029 --> 01:14:00,829
vertebrae in their neck um sloths either have five or six depending on the species like they're just

1199
01:14:00,829 --> 01:14:07,869
different like everything's different um and very slow and so i was just sitting there going what am

1200
01:14:09,229 --> 01:14:14,670
this rolling on everything and the americans love the drama and and they're hyping up the fact that

1201
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:19,949
this is going to be you know this is the toughest case this guy's ever ever faced and i just needed

1202
01:14:19,949 --> 01:14:26,829
a moment like i i just so i i i had i used a trick i used to use when i was when i was um

1203
01:14:27,949 --> 01:14:32,590
when i first graduated and i didn't know the answer to something i'd never leave i'd always

1204
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:37,789
leave my thermometer in in the suburban vet clinic i'd always leave my thermometer out of the room

1205
01:14:39,229 --> 01:14:43,630
say to the client i just need to go and grab the thermometer and that would give me thinking time

1206
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:50,829
and so i just told these guys i'm really busting to go to the bathroom in costa rica so i bugger off

1207
01:14:50,829 --> 01:14:55,949
try to find this toilet find a toilet or a tree and so i just get on my phone i start googling

1208
01:14:55,949 --> 01:15:02,109
um thankfully there was reception so i started googling how to look after a sloth i'm like drug

1209
01:15:02,109 --> 01:15:08,829
dosages for a sloth because i knew basically you know the the nabibian vet pete is right the

1210
01:15:09,229 --> 01:15:15,550
nabibians the cows are the same we had infection we had inflammation stabilize that give fluids

1211
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:19,949
get this sloth back to good health and then work out a plan from there just buy yourself some time

1212
01:15:19,949 --> 01:15:26,989
but i needed to know what drugs we could use on this this sloth and so i i i started googling

1213
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:32,189
you know drug dosages for any inflammatories and antibiotics for sloths and thank god some

1214
01:15:32,189 --> 01:15:38,750
a wildlife vet in the us who had had a few in a zoo had written a research paper and i found this

1215
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:45,229
what use the drug dosages he used um so you know dr google got me out of a lot of trouble

1216
01:15:45,229 --> 01:15:51,649
and and once we stabilize this sloth um you know the vital signs start to improve

1217
01:15:51,649 --> 01:15:56,189
ransom fluids through this sloth and and intravenously and and the sloth starts to

1218
01:15:56,189 --> 01:16:03,470
look a bit brighter um and and by the end of the day i ended up in surgery um in a in a local

1219
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:10,649
in a local uh in a local vet hospital um that we borrowed the facilities of and and i performed um

1220
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:16,649
you know one of the very few leg amputations of a sloth that i as far as i know that had ever been

1221
01:16:16,649 --> 01:16:24,829
performed and uh and it was a great example of of how to approach a really challenging problem

1222
01:16:24,829 --> 01:16:30,529
and a really what might be a very overwhelming problem and and by breaking it down to little

1223
01:16:30,529 --> 01:16:33,449
into little parts and and understanding the fact that you

1224
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:37,149
you do actually know how to solve this problem even though it's a sloth and not a dog

1225
01:16:37,149 --> 01:16:45,369
the the same the same approach is is is there and and using those sort of fine surgical skills that

1226
01:16:45,369 --> 01:16:50,869
i learned through operating on mice um you're able to bring all these different strands

1227
01:16:50,869 --> 01:16:58,390
of curiosity and and allow them to pay off in in one very neat little moment of performing a limb

1228
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:03,449
amputation on a sloth in costa rica and and you you think wow that how did i get

1229
01:17:03,449 --> 01:17:10,869
here but but it's all been because of of a i guess a fairly curious mindset um through life

1230
01:17:10,869 --> 01:17:14,970
but that enables you to be able to to even be in that situation and then then be able to get

1231
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:20,689
through it that's a high pressure thing with a film crew of 10 filming live uh you know that's

1232
01:17:20,689 --> 01:17:25,449
um i'm assuming on a plane when someone yells out if there's a doctor uh you're on there's

1233
01:17:25,449 --> 01:17:30,010
no hiding there um you need to put your hand up but that's uh that's a whole new level i like

1234
01:17:30,010 --> 01:17:33,210
halfway through that answer your cat uh jumped uh onto you

1235
01:17:33,449 --> 01:17:39,550
a lap and um and a lot of very comfortably um dispensed with the cat in the kindest possible

1236
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:44,350
way i think there was a brazilian soccer coach who found himself in a lot of trouble where the

1237
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:48,909
world cup i'm not sure if you saw that but uh there was a random cat i saw at a press conference

1238
01:17:48,909 --> 01:17:55,869
here he's back again the cat um that's when you she she's she's got an ability to um the moment

1239
01:17:55,869 --> 01:18:01,369
i'm involved in in anything to uh to she starts tapping tapping on keys on the keyboard to see

1240
01:18:01,369 --> 01:18:03,430
which one you know makes a sound and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and

1241
01:18:03,449 --> 01:18:07,930
and which one turns the screen off which one disconnects the entire the entire recording so

1242
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:12,989
that that was the next step that's why that's why she um she gets politely sort of moved that is a

1243
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:19,590
beautiful looking uh cat because you've got rescue dog cat is that the end of the uh the home yeah

1244
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:28,229
yeah i uh i do spend a lot of time away and and so there are only so many favors you can call upon

1245
01:18:28,229 --> 01:18:33,250
from um from neighbors and and friends and yeah you've got you've got to

1246
01:18:33,449 --> 01:18:39,149
you've got to draw the line because working around animals you have plenty of options to

1247
01:18:39,149 --> 01:18:46,649
to adopt and you either have one or you have a hundred um and so it's uh it's tricky but but

1248
01:18:46,649 --> 01:18:53,069
yeah you can't you can't adopt them all basically uh chris we see uh but communicating with clarity

1249
01:18:53,069 --> 01:19:00,250
is a is a concept that is 21st century style of leaders who we really admire are very uh astute

1250
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:03,289
and it's become your um your life in lots of ways

1251
01:19:03,449 --> 01:19:07,569
the way that you communicate you've got a great art at doing it is it is it something that

1252
01:19:07,569 --> 01:19:14,189
you've consciously thought about how you communicate yeah it is i think um i think when

1253
01:19:14,189 --> 01:19:21,170
you when you have a a mind that's busy and always thinking um the the biggest challenge i guess is

1254
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:30,069
refining all those different ideas um into a into a steady accessible stream of consciousness um

1255
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:32,489
and

1256
01:19:32,489 --> 01:19:33,430
i've i've tried

1257
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:42,270
to over the years reduce just how much i try to communicate in in any one moment uh and very

1258
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:48,109
early on in in tv i there used to be a saying that you know one problem one solution in any story

1259
01:19:48,109 --> 01:19:52,810
don't don't don't give you know three different problems and seven different solutions because

1260
01:19:52,810 --> 01:19:58,350
people just you just lose you just lose people and i think communication has to be simple it

1261
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:03,409
has to be accessible if it's going to be successful and um and so

1262
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:12,029
for me i think just working out what what that what that key message is and but but i guess

1263
01:20:12,029 --> 01:20:18,689
delivering it in in an interesting engaging way you can you can talk as you can talk as much as

1264
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:23,069
you like but unless i think unless you're presenting that with a little bit of sugar on top

1265
01:20:23,069 --> 01:20:30,029
and and something that makes that that little information nugget accessible and interesting

1266
01:20:30,029 --> 01:20:33,229
you kind of lose people and you know with it

1267
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:39,529
i was reading some some incredible stuff around the attention span of of people nowadays and and

1268
01:20:39,529 --> 01:20:45,670
just how how quickly it's it's diminishing and you know it used to be sort of 12 12 seconds

1269
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:51,170
which is which is still sounds remarkably short but but now it's down to sort of one or two or

1270
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:56,149
two seconds and you've got to kind of grab them in amongst all of that in that time otherwise

1271
01:20:56,149 --> 01:21:03,310
you kind of lose them and constantly constantly be giving some sort of stimuli to to keep them

1272
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:07,369
keep them together you know there's a lot of research around the fact you know phones and

1273
01:21:07,369 --> 01:21:11,489
social media responsible for that for the fact that there's there's so much entertainment on tap

1274
01:21:11,489 --> 01:21:18,989
so i i always feel like communication if you can do with some degree of entertainment

1275
01:21:18,989 --> 01:21:25,270
with it with a story attached or or or with something that that keeps them hooked through

1276
01:21:25,270 --> 01:21:31,369
and it's kind of a very tv or radio way of thinking to to hook them through but i think you

1277
01:21:31,369 --> 01:21:33,409
have to um in in

1278
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:39,189
in terms of communication leave them hanging leave them wanting to know more rather than less

1279
01:21:39,189 --> 01:21:47,449
um and don't overwhelm them with with with information so um you know tease tease them

1280
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:52,710
through but but but don't overwhelm essentially yeah it's a common uh theme i i hear a lot in

1281
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:56,770
those interviews sir chris around you know the intelligence of condensing that information in

1282
01:21:56,770 --> 01:22:02,470
a way that uh simplifies something it's much more complex or as you just said then uh the attention

1283
01:22:02,470 --> 01:22:03,409
span uh

1284
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:08,909
we know it's it's you know the tick-tock world is uh hard to compete with uh you know how quick

1285
01:22:08,909 --> 01:22:14,189
that captures the attention of the of the next generation for sure it's it's worrying it's it's

1286
01:22:14,189 --> 01:22:19,550
it's kind of a worrying thing but but you know you see you see yourself doing it i i find myself

1287
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:25,609
um easily being being distracted with all the different different stimuli and and and just being

1288
01:22:25,609 --> 01:22:33,310
being comfortable with with the fact that one message is is better than trying to deliver five

1289
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:38,510
and not landing a single one of them if you can get one message and one clear thought out out there

1290
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:45,369
that's that's a win that's still that's still a successful uh moment of communication but if you

1291
01:22:45,369 --> 01:22:49,649
try to give them three or five you're going to lose them you're going to lose them um before

1292
01:22:49,649 --> 01:22:55,270
you even land one message it's a brilliant way to think about it for sure collaboration is something

1293
01:22:55,270 --> 01:23:01,210
we see leaders are really conscious of now as being something they seek a lot um how have you

1294
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:02,029
approached collaboration

1295
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:10,970
um yeah i i think it's something that that i uh i i enjoy when when you're surrounded by

1296
01:23:10,970 --> 01:23:20,329
like-minded people it's uh it's a very pleasurable uh it's a pleasurable situation to to to feel like

1297
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:27,010
you're yeah you're you're i guess sharing and lessening that that sort of burden of responsibility

1298
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:31,289
that placed wholly and solely on you but but also

1299
01:23:31,289 --> 01:23:32,829
you

1300
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:40,510
i think it's it's a very narrow-minded approach to to think that you're the only carrier of of of ideas

1301
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:46,909
um and and the ability to to seek out other other thoughts and and that diversity of thought i think

1302
01:23:46,909 --> 01:23:52,270
is is a really interesting is a really interesting idea and you never really know unless you unless

1303
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:58,510
you ask um what you're what you're going to um to get out of people and and finding that language

1304
01:23:58,510 --> 01:24:03,310
to encourage people to to bring forward their ideas and their their thoughts and their their

1305
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:13,130
take i think is um is is incredibly is incredibly useful you know you um you know you don't you don't

1306
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:19,090
know what you don't know um it is a very simple statement but it but it is it is very true and

1307
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:25,470
and you can you can go to some quite um special special places with with that collaboration and

1308
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:31,590
and i think i think the best form of collaboration is challenge it's challenging um and and there's

1309
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:33,409
a there's a mate of mine who i i collaborate with and i think it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's

1310
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:39,390
it's it's it's hard to to throw it into uh let's let's we can kind of talk about that for a few

1311
01:24:39,390 --> 01:24:42,810
moments in a finance aspect so um but but the the the the the same as what a gist of quite

1312
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:46,250
the day when you're trying to promote youra the way you Мы often support you know the thing

1313
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:49,310
that we the way that we're trying to lift from it's It's like we like it.

1314
01:24:49,310 --> 01:25:01,970
We've got

1315
01:25:01,970 --> 01:25:02,970
people from z OTânia on the internet all over.

1316
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:03,149
We work on I'm on on tv and, and and show concepts and and he works executive producer of a few shows. The ABC guy called Chris Walker who he's a brilliant mind and I know what works in that collaborative sense is the fact that we were not we have we sat groundwells very early on where no and yeah I mean, yeah, apparently to give a perfect rule, we really are Paul Kirk and what I'm not, because the through without anyедиary effort. Mm hmm.

1317
01:25:03,149 --> 01:25:04,970
of thought was off limits.

1318
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:08,130
And if you don't understand something, say it immediately.

1319
01:25:08,130 --> 01:25:09,649
And if you wanna know more,

1320
01:25:09,649 --> 01:25:12,270
or if you wanna question whether that's a good idea,

1321
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:14,649
it's an open forum and we sort of set the ground rules

1322
01:25:14,649 --> 01:25:18,810
that we're okay with being upfront

1323
01:25:18,810 --> 01:25:20,609
with the fact we don't like that idea,

1324
01:25:20,609 --> 01:25:24,310
or that idea needs work, or that's not the strong one.

1325
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:27,350
Being generous, being kind,

1326
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:31,270
but at the same time being direct and not talking riddles

1327
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:33,949
because you just waste so much time

1328
01:25:33,949 --> 01:25:37,770
trying to accommodate other people's thoughts

1329
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:41,010
if you haven't established those ground rules

1330
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:43,930
and you haven't been honest with each other.

1331
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:47,869
And that language and that form of collaboration

1332
01:25:47,869 --> 01:25:50,649
is unique to any situation, any group.

1333
01:25:50,649 --> 01:25:54,310
And you can't take that sort of very open dialogue

1334
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:55,609
into every situation.

1335
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:58,470
You have to sort of have to read the room in a sense,

1336
01:25:58,470 --> 01:26:00,670
but that's one that works very well for us.

1337
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:04,689
And enables us to take a core idea,

1338
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:08,189
a core concept and build it into something

1339
01:26:08,189 --> 01:26:12,590
that is challengeable because ultimately though,

1340
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:15,029
any idea you have in the real world,

1341
01:26:15,029 --> 01:26:16,130
it's gonna be challenged.

1342
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:17,989
It's gonna encounter turbulence.

1343
01:26:17,989 --> 01:26:20,109
It's gonna have problems.

1344
01:26:20,109 --> 01:26:22,890
It's gonna have moments where you realize,

1345
01:26:22,890 --> 01:26:25,130
oh geez, does this actually work?

1346
01:26:26,569 --> 01:26:29,409
So you're better off troubleshooting that early on

1347
01:26:29,409 --> 01:26:30,989
and coming up with a solution and a plan.

1348
01:26:30,989 --> 01:26:35,670
Because the real world can sometimes be a cruel place

1349
01:26:35,670 --> 01:26:38,829
for new ideas and they can be shot down.

1350
01:26:38,829 --> 01:26:41,909
So stress testing those very early on,

1351
01:26:41,909 --> 01:26:45,489
I think is a very useful process.

1352
01:26:45,489 --> 01:26:47,869
And I love that you set the ground rules at the start

1353
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:49,829
and make that work.

1354
01:26:49,829 --> 01:26:53,340
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1355
01:26:56,500 --> 01:27:01,500
Look, I think there wouldn't be one leader

1356
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:07,399
strong, overarching leader that I think I look to

1357
01:27:08,819 --> 01:27:12,399
and think, you know what, if I can be just like them,

1358
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:13,840
I'd be incredibly grateful.

1359
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,739
But there are certainly a couple of people

1360
01:27:15,739 --> 01:27:20,739
that I borrow knowledge from and share knowledge with

1361
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:24,539
and look to and respect.

1362
01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:27,899
And my old man, I grew up with him, as we said,

1363
01:27:27,899 --> 01:27:32,279
being the local vet and his ability to treat any,

1364
01:27:32,279 --> 01:27:34,619
any animal and not say no,

1365
01:27:34,619 --> 01:27:37,199
is something that I've obviously carried through.

1366
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:39,739
And, you know, he did the world's first

1367
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,600
beak transplant on a Pelican.

1368
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:47,020
You know, had its beak shot off by a fisherman in the 80s.

1369
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:49,779
And that's one of my earliest memories

1370
01:27:49,779 --> 01:27:52,920
is of Percy the Pelican with this,

1371
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:55,600
he got a local surfboard manufacturer in Newcastle

1372
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:00,159
to make an artificial beak using fiberglass,

1373
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:02,260
same fiberglass they use on the surfboard.

1374
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:08,180
surfboards and he got this guy to fashion a beak for this this pelican and then and then between

1375
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:14,260
dad and myself we taught this pelican how to fish again using this fake beak um so that that has a

1376
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:21,300
pretty profound impact um yeah someone like um and then then in the media in the media sense um

1377
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:26,979
look someone i know you work with um closely someone like rob sitch is is is pretty

1378
01:28:26,979 --> 01:28:34,020
inspirational in terms of um you know quite a similar path where he went from being an emergency

1379
01:28:34,659 --> 01:28:41,779
human doctor um dealing in emergency rooms uh and and feeling kind of out of his depth in

1380
01:28:41,779 --> 01:28:48,819
emergency situations to to taking that that natural drama and translating it into drama on on

1381
01:28:48,819 --> 01:28:56,579
on television and and creating creating this this incredibly um timeless content when you think

1382
01:28:56,979 --> 01:29:03,140
you know programs like frontline or the the dish or the castle that those those very observational

1383
01:29:03,779 --> 01:29:10,899
um pieces of of work that that are that's truly stand the test of time um but that that combination

1384
01:29:10,899 --> 01:29:18,420
of science and creativity and process i really i really respect and and and he's a guy that i um

1385
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:25,460
have a hell of a lot of time for and i've had the pleasure of working with on a few occasions um and

1386
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,659
then um

1387
01:29:27,939 --> 01:29:34,500
yeah they say you should never meet your sort of idols or people you really respect and that's

1388
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:41,619
probably no better demonstrator than than someone who i always respected a lot um was nelson mandela

1389
01:29:41,619 --> 01:29:50,500
um and i met nelson mandela one one time you met mandela i'd met mandela so i i i i'm already gonna

1390
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:56,260
start sweating telling this story because i hate i hate it so much because of how it worked out but

1391
01:29:56,979 --> 01:30:01,460
i was at this is so odd but i was at vet school i was in um fourth year vet

1392
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:07,699
and uh and on the campus at sydney university and this is at the time where john howard was

1393
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:14,659
prime minister um and i think there'd been the tampa crisis um that there was a lot of unrest

1394
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:21,060
around around treatment of refugees and john howard had decided he was going to give an honorary

1395
01:30:21,779 --> 01:30:26,899
doctorate to nelson mandela at sydney university on a on a november

1396
01:30:26,979 --> 01:30:35,140
day and at this stage i was i was meant to be in a lecture at vet school and i it was a beautiful

1397
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:41,539
day and i was sitting here i thought you know what i'm going to skip this lecture um and uh and just

1398
01:30:41,539 --> 01:30:47,539
sat outside and just just did some other work and and was just to be honest probably a bit hung over

1399
01:30:47,539 --> 01:30:53,300
and just chatting with mates not planning to meet mandela at this stage not no no and and so the the

1400
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:58,340
presentation to mandela was meant to happen at the great hall at sydney university but all these

1401
01:30:58,340 --> 01:31:02,739
protesters turned up to protest howard because because prime minister howard was going to be

1402
01:31:02,739 --> 01:31:08,340
there and uh and at the last minute they switched it from the prestigious great hall of sydney

1403
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:16,020
university to for some inexplicable reason to the veterinary science conference center and at the

1404
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:21,859
last minute so i'm sitting out i'm sitting outside this this lecture theater and all of a sudden

1405
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:22,819
these

1406
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:30,739
motorbikes and these the armor-plated vehicles start streaming into the vet school and i was

1407
01:31:30,739 --> 01:31:34,819
there i was there with two other mates who i was talking to and we look at each other and go what

1408
01:31:34,819 --> 01:31:40,340
is this what is going on and these guys get out of the vehicles you know talking to their wrists they

1409
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:46,100
were clearly sort of a federal police or secret service style of operatives and we're like this

1410
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:52,579
is interesting so we stood up and started walking over and out of the vehicle the one that sort of

1411
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:58,739
makes it even more interesting is that they parked in front of a truck and they were very

1412
01:31:58,739 --> 01:32:04,579
stressed or scared or they weren't finally getting out please don't worry that's a common lie

1413
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:10,739
well and they uh some of my friends like pohang was born in

1414
01:32:11,539 --> 01:32:19,380
america these guys and one of my Clark上andla hip Mao was born in Ankara and they at that time

1415
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:22,260
had one of the most expensive stretchers on board which was a any size car as well but they've been

1416
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:23,220
around for more than half a century now um we'll continue that later though i hope we get back to him

1417
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:30,100
from me and these two university mates of mine and so we think what better opportunity to to chat to

1418
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:36,659
one of the greatest leaders of our time so we walk over and we just line up and he he walks over to

1419
01:32:36,659 --> 01:32:43,939
us and the first mate of mine says um mr mandela what an honor it is to meet you you've been uh

1420
01:32:43,939 --> 01:32:51,539
you've been an idol of mine my entire life um and and if i can be half the the person you are it'll

1421
01:32:51,539 --> 01:32:56,420
it'll be a it'll be a a dream come true i think that's a pretty good thing to say that's that's

1422
01:32:56,420 --> 01:33:05,220
well said moose and the next guy and he says um mr mandela um uh your your work with human rights is

1423
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:11,859
is inspiring um what you've done for the planet is is is incredible um i just want to say thank you

1424
01:33:12,819 --> 01:33:17,859
and and then you had that split second moment of like okay all the good stuff's been taken

1425
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:21,380
what do you what do you say to nelson mandela and the logical

1426
01:33:21,539 --> 01:33:27,380
person would say something similar just say thank you what a what a great what are you have a great

1427
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:32,020
day you know what an honor to meet you or just say nothing at all just say you know lovely mate

1428
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:37,460
you don't have to entertain but but i i in my mind i think be different be creative be like

1429
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:43,619
step outside of the box make mandela laugh like give give give nelson mandela a moment he doesn't

1430
01:33:43,619 --> 01:33:51,060
expect and so it gets to me the third in the line and i say oh and i couldn't pull these words back

1431
01:33:51,539 --> 01:33:57,539
at back in after they've been said i said um mr mandela it's an honor to meet you um

1432
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:01,779
i know you've always been a massive believer in education and

1433
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:04,899
and you know what you've done for education is incredible but

1434
01:34:05,699 --> 01:34:11,140
just just to contradict that ice just skipped a lecture and look how well it worked out for me

1435
01:34:13,699 --> 01:34:17,300
and he he just looked at me he gave me this sort of look of pity

1436
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:25,479
he shook my hand and did not even say a word and walked off and and my two mates just looked at me

1437
01:34:25,479 --> 01:34:32,260
and said what was that i i i don't know i don't know what that was and i couldn't i couldn't take

1438
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:37,460
it back and that was my only i i had met nelson mandela he's never said he never said a word to

1439
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:42,640
me but we did shake hands and that was that was as far as it got and someone who was imprisoned

1440
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:49,300
on robin island uh chris for 36 years or more i think off the top of my head he broke rocks

1441
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:55,300
like he's been through the hardest of all times and i tried to draw some awful analogy between

1442
01:34:55,300 --> 01:35:00,880
education and and me skipping a lecture and and i've always hated myself so much for that and

1443
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:07,399
that's where that is where trying to step outside of the box can sometimes um sometimes get you in

1444
01:35:07,399 --> 01:35:11,819
trouble um you don't need to to always be different you don't always need to

1445
01:35:11,819 --> 01:35:18,560
to surprise but that is that is me to a t it's a world-class clanger uh chris i love uh i love

1446
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:22,359
that story it's brilliant final question i appreciate how generous you've been with your

1447
01:35:22,359 --> 01:35:27,800
time today in a in a incredibly busy life and schedule if you could collaborate with anyone

1448
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:32,939
on anything chris you've got a diverse range of interests is there anyone that springs to mind

1449
01:35:32,939 --> 01:35:40,680
in the spirit of collaboration um look the the person who i've always wanted to meet um

1450
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:41,359
um

1451
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:50,359
is uh is is probably david attenborough i've never i've never met him um but but someone who who's

1452
01:35:50,359 --> 01:35:55,039
um you know i hate to think what i'd say to him given that example of mandela like that

1453
01:35:55,039 --> 01:36:01,399
that would be an awful an awful thing to um to put on him but um just someone who i i respect

1454
01:36:01,399 --> 01:36:08,600
a lot and and has always sort of just carried themselves with such grace um and and in such

1455
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:11,800
a beautifully measured beautifully measured way and and such a beautiful way and and such a beautiful

1456
01:36:11,819 --> 01:36:18,279
great spokesperson for the the animal kingdom um i would i would probably uh i would probably say

1457
01:36:18,279 --> 01:36:26,199
he'd be um he'd be right up there as someone who i'd love to to collaborate with to to meet and

1458
01:36:26,199 --> 01:36:34,020
and to understand and and get some of those some of those learnings um uh i think would be would

1459
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:41,520
be pretty would be pretty amazing um yeah you know and just to i mean just to talk also talk about the

1460
01:36:41,819 --> 01:36:47,640
the variety of safari suits that he sported sported throughout his you know very impractical

1461
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:53,300
safari suits he sported in in some very remote locations uh how he kept them crease free during

1462
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:59,039
that those those various sort of adventures into the galapagos islands um he always sort of freshly

1463
01:36:59,039 --> 01:37:04,739
pressed safari suit which i you know you've got to you've got to respect but no i i think that um

1464
01:37:04,739 --> 01:37:11,439
there's so much knowledge in in in attenborough and and he leaves such a legacy that uh you've

1465
01:37:11,439 --> 01:37:11,800
got to

1466
01:37:11,819 --> 01:37:17,260
you've got to respect you've got to respect that um yeah i think he'd be right up there

1467
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:22,640
that'd be a a conversation and a collaboration that i'd uh i'd love to be a fly on the wall for

1468
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:27,840
and in in lots of ways because i think the baton uh handed over to you you you know were an

1469
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:33,359
incredible representative of the animal world in your own creative and brilliant way and uh

1475
01:37:50,399 --> 01:37:54,520
to just to pause and and think about this sort of stuff you tend to go through your day just doing

1476
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:59,539
it um but to actually stop and and think about the process and understand what goes into those
