00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:11,710
Our next guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is the remarkable Dr. Dinesh Palapana,

2
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,649
the first ever medical graduate with a spinal cord injury suffering quadriplegia.

3
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:22,030
It was an incredible privilege to catch up with Dinesh and to see someone turn what looks like

4
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:27,750
the ultimate negative into a positive and to look at his disability now as an advantage.

5
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:31,829
Remarkable person who I certainly learned a lot from on the back of this chat.

6
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:36,770
I'm really aligned with the passion that I love talking about, the work we're doing in Alita

7
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,990
with my great friend, Matt Wadowitz.

8
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,289
We started this business several years ago, inspiring connections and celebrating a world

9
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:46,549
of collaboration and what great leadership looks like.

10
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,350
And if you're motivated to start and improve your leadership journey, Alita Connect, our

11
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,030
signature program, I'd love you to have a look at it.

12
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:57,609
We're bringing together some inspiring leaders from sport, from industry, social venture

13
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:00,829
and the arts, people like the remarkable Dinesh Palapana.

14
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:01,810
I hope you enjoy it.

15
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,609
I hope you enjoy this chat as much as I did.

16
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,609
He's an incredible person who's inspiring many people.

17
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:23,549
Dinesh Palapana is a medical doctor working in the busiest emergency department in Australia

18
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,489
at the Gold Coast University Hospital.

19
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,290
Dinesh suffered a spinal cord injury in his third year at medical school in a motor vehicle

20
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:35,030
accident that left him a quadriplegic affecting his fingers and everything below his chest.

21
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,829
Dinesh had initially completed a law degree before finding his passion for helping others

22
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:41,950
as a doctor.

23
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:47,010
Five years post his accident, Dinesh returned to complete his medical degree at Griffith

24
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,549
University, becoming only the second person with quadriplegia to graduate as a doctor

25
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:53,969
in Australia and the first with spinal cord injury.

26
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:56,230
Dinesh, it's an incredible life story.

27
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:58,709
I really appreciate you sharing it with me today.

28
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,349
It's great to meet you.

29
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,810
Hey, thanks a lot for having me.

30
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:02,329
I've been really excited to chat to you.

31
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,689
Hey, Dinesh, you're a third year medical student.

32
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:06,829
Take you back to then your top of your class.

33
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:10,210
You're fresh back, I understand, from snowboarding in Japan.

34
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,189
You've got a girlfriend.

35
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:15,289
Life's going really well for you, and then you have a life-changing moment.

36
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:18,349
Can we start with that night, and can you share with us what happened?

37
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:19,310
Yeah.

38
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,990
I went to visit my parents who lived in Brisbane.

39
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:30,270
I was living in Gold Coast at the time, and I often used to visit my family on weekends

40
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:39,990
just to chill out and eat mom's food and be a bit of a lazy person for the weekend.

41
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:41,990
And it was just wonderful.

42
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:43,509
One of those weekends, you know, it was good.

43
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,689
I got to hang out with everyone at home and relax a bit.

44
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:56,389
And I always think about serendipity and sliding doors moments.

45
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,409
You know, there are certain points in our lives where you just end up at a certain place

46
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:02,449
at a certain time.

47
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:06,490
But that day, it was the 31st of January, 2010.

48
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,169
It was raining through the day.

49
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:16,629
So it was one of those days where it rained and then stopped and rained and stopped.

50
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:19,069
And it was just generally wet.

51
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,129
And I was going to leave pretty early that day.

52
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:26,389
Actually, I wasn't even going to go home that weekend.

53
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,289
I was going to stay down in Gold Coast, but I decided to go.

54
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,509
And then I decided to stay till Sunday.

55
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:35,469
And I was going to leave early that day.

56
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,610
But then I stayed back and I stayed back and I stayed back.

57
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,689
And I ate dinner at home.

58
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:41,870
And then at this particular time,

59
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,069
I ended up leaving the house.

60
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:45,629
So I went to the garage.

61
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:52,409
I gave my mom a hug and hopped in the car, then drove out.

62
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:57,669
And I was driving down the highway and I was going to stop by a friend's house.

63
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:02,930
But I just I missed the turn off and I kept driving.

64
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,650
And there are two ways to get to Gold Coast.

65
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,189
And I was going to go.

66
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,889
A certain way.

67
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,589
But then for some reason, I forgot to take that turn off, too.

68
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,029
So I just kept driving towards Gold Coast.

69
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:23,170
And I ended up in the stretch of highway, which was a bit dark.

70
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:26,810
There were roadworks and it was wet.

71
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,509
And I came up to this.

72
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,569
I don't know what it was.

73
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,329
It looked like a water puddle or some oil on the road.

74
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,430
And as soon as I hit it, my car lost control.

75
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:40,629
I started spinning and spinning and spinning.

76
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,430
And for a second there, I thought I got control back, but I didn't.

77
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:47,870
And I just kept spinning again.

78
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,990
And then the car slid off the road, went up onto the embankment and then turned around

79
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,170
and came back down.

80
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,389
When the car came back off the embankment, the nose just slammed into the road.

81
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:05,629
And then it started flipping through the air, nose to tail.

82
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,970
And I was terrified.

83
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:09,790
Hey, like I was.

84
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,769
I was freaking out.

85
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,430
At that point, because it was so fast, so violent.

86
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:21,089
I could hear so much noise and my body was just being thrown around.

87
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:29,449
But there was this point in time when I think I was hanging upside down in the car and everything

88
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:31,430
seemed to slow down for a bit.

89
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,509
And I just thought there's nothing more I can do now, right?

90
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,610
There is absolutely nothing I can do to get control of this car again.

91
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,430
So I just decided.

92
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:47,310
I decided that I would think about that situation differently, because that's all I can do at

93
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:53,509
that point is to control what my mind thinks and the way I perceive that situation.

94
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:59,209
So I just thought I'm going to have fun and think of this like a roller coaster.

95
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:06,029
So I thought about the thought about the crash like a roller coaster in the last little part

96
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:06,310
of it.

97
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,850
And I was I was actually having fun.

98
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,170
I was just yelling out and laughing and whatever else.

99
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:13,470
Pretty weird when I think about it now.

100
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:18,889
But when the car landed, it landed upright on the side of the road.

101
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:27,470
And I was stunned for a second when I went to get out of the car and I realized that my

102
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,350
fingers couldn't grab the door handle anymore.

103
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:34,250
And I didn't really understand what was happening for a second.

104
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,910
Oh, I don't know what's going on.

105
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:40,829
And then I just rested my hand back on my leg.

106
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:41,750
And I realized I could.

107
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:42,589
I couldn't feel my leg.

108
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:50,689
So that's when I can't explain what that felt like.

109
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:53,209
But I knew I was paralyzed.

110
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:55,870
I knew that my life had changed forever.

111
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,850
I was far enough in medical school to understand that this is a catastrophic injury.

112
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,269
And Luke, I can't even tell you what that feels like.

113
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:11,430
Like it's just a horrifying feeling.

114
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:12,410
And that was it.

115
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:15,689
Yeah, it's an incredible reflection.

116
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:19,610
And I know you have told that story before many times.

117
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:24,329
But hearing it in person with you, you can't help but feel the emotion attached to it.

118
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,449
And as you said, you're in this unique perspective.

119
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:30,910
One, for you to have that presence in a moment is quite an amazing part of the story.

120
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:36,250
But second part, to be a medical student, aware enough to be able to scan your body

121
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,230
and understand almost immediately.

122
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:39,290
Did it hit you?

123
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,949
Did your mind start to say?

124
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:45,110
Oh, I've lost the ability to walk again.

125
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,709
Was your mind able to get to there straight away?

126
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:49,589
Was that the sort of thoughts that were going through?

127
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:49,850
Yeah.

128
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,930
Yeah, it did.

129
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:51,709
It did immediately.

130
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,189
And I knew about spinal cord injuries.

131
00:07:56,189 --> 00:08:03,509
And I knew that it's an irreversible thing, most of the time at least.

132
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:10,069
And I think a couple of years later, it was a few years later actually,

133
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:11,689
I managed to reconnect with the...

134
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:16,129
the fireman that attended the accident scene because they were the first on scene.

135
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:18,790
And there were two things that they mentioned.

136
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:24,629
One was that their fire truck also ran over whatever I ran over and lost control.

137
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,670
Fortunately, they didn't crash, but they were able to reverse back.

138
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,769
And then the second thing they said is they never forgot because they said I was one of

139
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:40,210
the few people that they'd attended to who already had a diagnosis about the injury.

140
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,649
I was telling them not to...

141
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:43,769
not to move me.

142
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:46,169
It's an incredible part of your story.

143
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:51,909
And another beautiful part was there was a driver behind you who stopped and held your

144
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:53,909
head and sat with you.

145
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,470
And I know you ended up reconnecting with him.

146
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,970
He went on a search to find you for many years and had some trouble because of the privacy

147
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:01,970
laws.

148
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,690
And it's a beautiful moment if you see the Australian story on the ABC to watch Dinesh's

149
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,690
story.

150
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,690
It's really worthwhile.

151
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,690
Along with Dinesh's TED Talk.

152
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,690
There's a lot of great stories.

153
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,289
There's some incredible reflection on that moment.

154
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:20,009
But can I shift from there, Dinesh, to the fact that, as you said, you're a third-year

155
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:21,450
medical student.

156
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,590
It's probably thought impossible that you're going to go on unfinished medical school.

157
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:31,370
But you had some great leadership from a number of professors at Griffith University who really...

158
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,529
they were really chasing after you, from what I understand, encouraging you how you can

159
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:37,409
come back and do this.

160
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:38,409
You can get this done.

161
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:39,690
Can you tell us about their leadership?

162
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,690
And also the self-belief?

163
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,690
Yeah.

164
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:47,450
What was the self-belief in you that got you back onto the path of becoming a doctor?

165
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,450
Yeah.

166
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,450
Yeah.

167
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:55,529
I was really lucky to have people in my life that believed that I should have a chance,

168
00:09:55,529 --> 00:10:01,730
believed that it was the right thing to do, and invested in me as well.

169
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,649
So this is something that...

170
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:08,450
Medicine is something that I love, right?

171
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,450
It's...

172
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,450
I found it...

173
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,450
I found medicine through...

174
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:17,409
I never grew up wanting to be a doctor, but I found it actually through depression.

175
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:18,889
I had depression when I...

176
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:24,009
I initially studied law, and I did my law degree, and I had depression then.

177
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:27,389
And it was through that experience that I found medicine, and I loved it ever since.

178
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:30,090
So I never wanted to let it go.

179
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,730
And I always wanted to come back through it.

180
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:38,210
From the moment I had the injury, there wasn't a day that went by when I didn't want to come

181
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,210
back.

182
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,210
But...

183
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:46,169
But over the years, between the accident, between the accident and coming back to medical

184
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:48,529
school, there was a four-year period.

185
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:53,409
And in that four-year period, I was lucky enough to have professors from the medical

186
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:59,289
school who just kept prodding me and encouraging me.

187
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:03,850
And it's not an easy process to come back from something like this, you know?

188
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,850
It takes a...

189
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,210
There's a period of emotional adjustment.

190
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,009
There's a period of becoming strong again.

191
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:18,009
So the nice thing was they persisted over a matter of years.

192
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:25,250
And they kept prodding me, and they kept gradually upping the pressure to the point where, you

193
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,730
know, they're like, okay, you really need to come back now.

194
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:37,330
And from what I heard, there were divergent opinions on whether I could be a medical student

195
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,330
again.

196
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,330
Because...

197
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:45,809
Because even today, right, with disability, there are so many barriers for people with

198
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:48,769
disabilities to pursue whatever else.

199
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:52,769
Just yesterday, actually, I got an email about a nursing student with a disability who's

200
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:53,830
having some issues.

201
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,429
So there are these barriers that people experience.

202
00:11:57,429 --> 00:12:02,649
So there were some divergent opinions about whether I should come back to medical school,

203
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:06,649
whether I could come back to medical school, whether it could be done.

204
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:09,330
But fortunately, I had the leaders that were...

205
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:17,009
Champions, and they really put their neck out, and they really fought for me.

206
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:22,169
And their opinion, fortunately, won out, and I was able to come back to medical school.

207
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:29,789
But I know how much persistence and effort and patience that it took for them to do that.

208
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:35,570
But even me, you know, I had some doubts about how I would examine a patient, how I would

209
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,330
get through medical school, how I would structure life around it with the spinal cord.

210
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,330
And I was like, I don't know.

211
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,330
I don't know.

212
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,330
I don't know.

213
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,330
I was afraid of that.

214
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,330
I was afraid of that injury.

215
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,330
So even I had some, I guess, you know, doubts about how to do it.

216
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:51,509
But in the end, the things that we all thought were going to be challenges weren't challenges

217
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:52,509
at all.

218
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,409
It's an amazing, incredible story.

219
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:55,769
There's so much to touch on.

220
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:59,169
Danelle, I do want to pick up on what you just said a moment ago.

221
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:03,590
You're a law student initially, and you got yourself into a hole in that part of your

222
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:08,210
life to the point where you were depressed and suffering from anxiety.

223
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,210
Before you found that...

224
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:13,809
desire to help others and your passion to pursue being a medical doctor but i read with interest

225
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:19,169
because i think this is a profound statement that you know i think these words are accurate where

226
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:24,590
you said you were more debilitated and more challenged by depression than anything that a

227
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:29,470
wheelchair is thrown at you that the mind can limit you much more than the body can and can

228
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,529
you expand on those thoughts is that is that an accurate reflection of how you felt definitely

229
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:41,789
um definitely i i often think about things that um these days i think about

230
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:47,289
we we embark in a lot of things like the emergency department and medicine and

231
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:51,830
um sport or whatever else there are all these things that are about performance right

232
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:56,090
and i often wonder how much of that is the body and how much of that is the mind

233
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:03,190
because to me i think a lot of it is actually a large part of it is the mind i'd probably say

234
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:13,610
70 80 90 percent um uh so when i had depression my mind was so profoundly affected

235
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:25,210
and i was i was debilitated i was feeling down all the time i was depressed i didn't enjoy things i

236
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:31,289
wasn't connected to friends and society in the community i didn't go out i was feeling anxious

237
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:33,289
all the time uh

238
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:39,190
i was i was having panic attacks so all the time when i was out i'd have a panic attack and i'd

239
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:44,169
want to go home or to hide so it got it got so bad to the point where i was too afraid to go

240
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:50,669
outside the house and when i think back to those days i struggled academically i struggled socially

241
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:54,169
i struggled with relationships i struggled with friendships

242
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:59,190
and i struggled to really do anything in this world and

243
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,490
now i have a spinal cord

244
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:09,190
injury when i woke up in the intensive care unit i felt like a prisoner of my body because i couldn't

245
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:14,809
move i was stuck there i was stuck in bed and even if i wanted to run away from that situation i

246
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:23,029
couldn't physically so i felt like a prisoner but now we're 12 years down the track um i'm having

247
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:29,809
this conversation with you i'm about to go to work i'm about to you know this morning i woke up i

248
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:32,730
looked outside the window and i thought man like life is

249
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:42,450
good and i was happy so i think um being able to compare those two experiences

250
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:50,710
i know with confidence for me that it was far more paralyzing having depression than a spinal

251
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:57,070
cord injury ever has been this year i you know i mean the last few years have been amazing like i

252
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:03,070
work as a doctor i get to do so many interesting things and i get to um

253
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,629
hopefully make a contribution to the community and people with disability

254
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:11,350
i started flying again this year i flew a plane a couple months ago so like

255
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:16,669
it's you know i i feel unlimited but it's because i still got my mind

256
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:22,269
it's an incredible perspective that you've got and you're uniquely placed to have it danesh and

257
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:26,549
and i think you know to have that understanding and empathy that which i think that we're

258
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:33,009
getting better at that mental health issues which we really you know 20 years ago didn't

259
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:38,070
understand and we sort of compartmentalized people and went you know what you need to

260
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:43,029
deal with that we didn't quite understand how debilitating it was we know that it's a modern

261
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:48,830
disease and it's becoming an issue of western society in such a powerful way and the east as

262
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:54,409
well but as you said when you explain it the way you did you know someone that now has to deal with

263
00:16:54,409 --> 00:17:00,070
a spinal cord injury living this brilliant life and and and i wanted to to go there because you

264
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,470
know one of the things i heard uh about which i loved that

265
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:09,470
you know danesh is a great doctor not in spite of his uh wheelchair but because of his wheelchair

266
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:15,869
that there's this magic that happens with you as a doctor that your patients love you and embrace

267
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:20,549
you because they have this incredible respect straight away you've probably dealt with something

268
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:25,569
far more challenging than most people are ever going to deal with is that your experience with

269
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:30,390
patients that when you wheel your wheelchair in there is this connection that is unique

270
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,369
when i before i came back to medical school

271
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:39,349
i had i remember having this conversation with someone and they said um it was a senior doctor

272
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:45,250
actually and they said i don't know if patients would take you seriously and um i even thought

273
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,809
hmm i wonder if i wonder if there's actually going to be a thing because i wonder what they

274
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:55,130
would feel when i i wander into their room in a wheelchair so even i thought about that for a

275
00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:03,089
period of time but now i've seen thousands of patients and you know the thing is luke i even

276
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:10,529
surprised not a single one has ever said oh can you do can you do your job because of your

277
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:18,450
wheelchair not one but um i've had the opposite where i've had so many amazing conversations with

278
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:25,529
my patients um where we've been able to connect and some have said you know i remember this one

279
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:32,809
particular patient one night where it was like 2 a.m it was a busy department and they came in by

280
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:38,390
and they were also a wheelchair user with a significant disability and they

281
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:47,309
when i went into the the cubicle the patient said i'm so glad that you came in here because i know

282
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:57,710
you'll understand so i feel so lucky and privileged and there are many days when i go to work where my

283
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:03,289
heart is warmed um and i just i just feel incredibly

284
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:08,809
lucky to interact with the people that i do danessa as you said earlier you taught yourself

285
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:14,289
post the accident to you know without fingers you can put a needle in a vein as well as anyone you

286
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:19,289
can use a stethoscope you can stitch someone up uh you know with some assistance so you've worked

287
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:24,930
your way through the physical challenges which is a great story in itself but for me the underrated

288
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:30,329
part of medicine is is the empathy when you walk in and the doctor genuinely cares and you know

289
00:19:30,329 --> 00:19:33,410
they care or they've got great bedside manner or

290
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:37,670
they're open-minded enough to collaborate with other professionals to help you get better i mean

291
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:44,690
sometimes that's rare in medicine it's clearly a strength do you think we overlook those parts

292
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:49,470
that may be more important than the the physical parts in some ways and that's the opportunity that

293
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,890
you're you know really showing people every day i've been having this conversation a lot lately

294
00:19:53,890 --> 00:20:03,210
and um this is such a deeply human activity uh and i don't remember who said it it was

295
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:10,170
one of the um old philosophers like hippocrates perhaps or someone but they said that the biggest

296
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:17,369
mistake a physician makes is to try and treat the body without trying to treat the soul

297
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:26,829
so our job i think is to is it's it's a human activity and to to look after another human being

298
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:32,970
and to help them through that process and to work through their goals and support them through that

299
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:42,849
process and it is a collaborative activity with other professionals and if if i think if you are a

300
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:51,549
if you are mean to a patient and if you uh treat them poorly as a human being i think you end up

301
00:20:51,549 --> 00:21:02,509
doing more damage to a person than than helping them um i spent eight months in hospital uh after

302
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:11,990
that i probably spent another cumulative three or four months over the last few years i hate being

303
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:19,309
a patient like i hate it i hate ending up in a hospital i hate um staying in the hospital and i

304
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:26,329
hated that whole experience because it was so disempowering and it was so scary and um there

305
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:33,210
were times when no one listened to me and it was out of control so now when i think about that i

306
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,849
think about how much damage i've done and i think about how much damage i've done and i think about

307
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:43,230
um you can do to a therapeutic relationship between uh a patient and a doctor so i think

308
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:49,369
about that all the time when i see patients and you know i just at the very least i try to be a

309
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:55,230
good human being to them and you can see that comes out in every uh essence of who you are

310
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,710
danesh you know pre and post accident that's something i think that that you know appears

311
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,650
to be just part of your dna being caring and being a good human being and we know

312
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:09,069
that is where you know the opportunities are aren't they to support people in a positive way

313
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:14,970
you know doctor or or not being a doctor i had a story that came to mind uh danesh when i was

314
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,609
thinking about you i caught up with in a very different space a guy called andy cohen on this

315
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:25,670
podcast he's the executive chairman of jp morgan's uh global wealth management um probably one of the

316
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,789
biggest handful of jobs in the world of finance everywhere but a great guy with great empathy and

317
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:33,490
and they have 275 000 employees in that business

318
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:40,569
they live diversity they care about it in a proper way and you can feel it tangibly and he shared

319
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:46,809
with um with me the story of a shish a great friend he called him who was blind at the age of

320
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:53,769
14 grew up in india went to a university in india but had this incredible ability because of his

321
00:22:53,769 --> 00:23:00,190
sense of uh of sound to hear text much quicker than people could read it he became the number

322
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,829
one fx trader in their global business just the the but that opportunity wouldn't

323
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:09,789
have been thought of without businesses having an open mind to see the brilliance like that's

324
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:15,549
a competitive advantage in the end is that where we need to get to danish in some ways to not see

325
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:21,049
we need to do more to lend support we need to see the opportunity of what you're doing every day is

326
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:25,630
actually something that other people can't do and they're they're bits of gold out there we just need

327
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:33,690
to see them more is that is that a possibility oh man i love that yes yeah because you have this

328
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,849
deficit based

329
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:41,569
model about particularly about disability but there are people with so many strengths and like

330
00:23:41,569 --> 00:23:46,930
you said i love that you said there are there are things that you can do that other people can't

331
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:55,930
as well like that that's really cool um and uh i hope we can transition into into that kind of

332
00:23:55,930 --> 00:24:02,690
thinking where we think about what someone can contribute um and and work on those strengths

333
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,849
because i don't think it just applies to me i don't think it just applies to me i don't think

334
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:08,970
it applies to disability i think it applies to everyone right if we can actually support people

335
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:15,690
through their strengths and um and and to help them develop that and to celebrate that i think

336
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:21,609
we end up a much better world um so hopefully we can get there and i definitely think there is

337
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:27,690
opportunity there i'm glad you told me that story i'm gonna i'm gonna use that and it's sort of the

338
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:32,789
essence really this what this podcast is and what i'm really passionate about which is that you know

339
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:34,849
identifying that self-reflective style of leadership and that's what i'm really passionate about

340
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:39,750
you know your strengths and we've all got them we celebrate them and we share them but then the

341
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,470
opportunity to collaborate with other people on the areas that you need to improve now that's

342
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:50,329
disability or not disability for me isn't it like it's it's just a broad spectrum if we understand

343
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:55,210
our blind spots but we know we can get support in them you know perhaps yours is a more extreme

344
00:24:55,210 --> 00:25:01,329
version of that where you definitely need you know some some some support but no no more important or

345
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:04,789
less important than perhaps all of us it's a it's a it's a

346
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:11,710
maybe an interesting way to think about it yeah and i think um on that note too like i have two

347
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:17,589
thoughts about leadership and and performance i think good leaders understand that they're not

348
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:22,670
good at everything um and i read a book about warren buffett a little while ago where he says

349
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:28,809
that what he does is to surround himself with people that are experts on various things so he

350
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:32,910
knows that he's not an expert on everything and it's it's like i just try to put together an

351
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,849
amazing baseball team so we can win the game and i think that's a really good way to think about it

352
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:40,930
yeah so i think um good leaders pick people with different strengths and put the team together

353
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:46,829
but i think the other thing is um for us to grow and want for us to have

354
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:52,789
um for us to perform better uh as individuals too it's about understanding

355
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:59,509
um that we don't know everything and that we have to defer to others and we have to build

356
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:04,849
our knowledge in certain areas and to have that humility um so i think it goes both ways

357
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:11,690
yeah beautifully said uh yeah i think you've um got a great essence of uh of the passion space

358
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:17,009
we're in and and you know so inspired by seeing your smiling face and the life that you're living

359
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:22,890
and the contribution that you're having uh it's just an incredibly inspiring story danesh and you

360
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:27,190
know great privilege to be able to spend some time we're talking i have been talking around

361
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:31,509
different leadership and dimensions of what great leadership looks like and i'm fascinated to get

362
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:34,630
your thoughts on you just shared a bit of it then but we feel like

363
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:39,869
um the leaders that are making a big impact really understand the idea of self-leadership

364
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:45,690
to me your story is all about self-leadership and you're not sitting here today without that

365
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,869
what does that term mean to you when you think about self-leadership oh that's a that's a really

366
00:26:50,869 --> 00:26:58,890
good question i think i've i've just been thrown into this situation um over the years i had to

367
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:03,950
make a lot of sense about what happened and what it means and um to

368
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:04,549
um

369
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:17,450
yeah to i guess think think about how i can make uh something good out of this and um i i spent a

370
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:22,230
lot of time thinking about what this means and what the spinal cord injury you know the thing

371
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:28,589
is initially i would have done anything to have my old life back um over the first couple months

372
00:27:28,589 --> 00:27:34,849
to years and then now today i i wouldn't trade my life for the world but a big part of my life is

373
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:43,910
that i think is um this has been an opportunity for me to make a make a difference for the

374
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:49,250
disability community for the people for the group of people that go through so much um the people

375
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:56,150
that don't have opportunities for education and employment and whatever else so i think um

376
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:03,869
leadership is actually about about that i think it's about um taking what you have and the

377
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:04,849
experiences that you have and the experiences that you have and the experiences that you have and the

378
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:12,150
growing out of it but also using that to give back to the world and using that to give back to the

379
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:18,230
community because that's the other thing that i discovered through after going through depression

380
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:26,349
is that um happiness you know today we we often get distracted by these things like about

381
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:32,950
consuming and what we can get and what we can have or money and goods and whatever else social

382
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,849
status but actually happiness doesn't come from the world it comes from the world and it comes from

383
00:28:34,869 --> 00:28:40,170
from accumulating things for ourselves and happiness comes from looking out into the world

384
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:45,269
and looking at what we can give to the world and how we can leave this world a better place and

385
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:50,869
what we can do for our neighbor and fellow human and colleagues so i think leadership and self

386
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:55,809
leadership is actually about um using the things that you have and using the things that you've

387
00:28:55,809 --> 00:29:01,609
learned to be better but also to use that to give back to the to the world i think leadership is

388
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:04,150
never about us it's it's about

389
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:10,309
everyone else it's about how we can look after other people and how what we can do for our

390
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:24,609
community what a profound uh statement you know danish on every word that uh you're living and

391
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:29,690
expressing there is just it's just so relevant and and it's um you know beautifully said again

392
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:34,109
and i the next dimension i wanted to talk to you about was leaders conscious about how they

393
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:39,829
positively impact others in their environment and i think you sum that up you know beautifully i

394
00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:40,990
know you founded doctors with

395
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:46,809
abilities you know every day every patient every interaction it feels as though you're living

396
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:51,430
exactly what you what you just said is that something you're really conscious of yeah all

397
00:29:51,430 --> 00:30:00,190
the time i i think um we are really put on this in this world not for ourselves but to

398
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:05,849
but to do things for others like and that's that's it's partly selfish in a way as well

399
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:11,230
because it's where happiness comes from you know like those things that you do for others and do

400
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:16,490
for other people is where happiness comes from and i've learned a lot about leadership through some

401
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:23,589
of the people that helped me through this injury um so i had some friends who uh supported me and i

402
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:30,329
had and i had some doctors as well who were who were quite good and some of those doctors are in

403
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:37,690
the emergency department where i work today and they made a massive investment in me um i remember

404
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,109
coming across a lot of different people in my return to medical school

405
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:51,109
and some of them were a bit hesitant some of them were pretty supportive but um i had to go around

406
00:30:51,109 --> 00:30:55,369
and meet all these different specialists right that i was going to be a student under but the

407
00:30:55,369 --> 00:31:03,029
one i remember most clearly is uh the emergency doctor and i met her one day i was with my mom

408
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:09,690
because i was still learning to get around and uh she sat me and my mom down bought us a coffee

409
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:10,970
asked about our life

410
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:18,970
and um then at the end she just said we just can't wait to have you in our department and

411
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:27,029
we'll make it work and i just felt really welcome i felt valued and i felt like a human being

412
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:32,049
and from that point on like every time i worked in the emergency department they just

413
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:37,750
made me feel like a normal person made me feel welcome nothing was a challenge and they always

414
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,250
encouraged me to grow um they not just made me feel like a normal person they just made me feel

415
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:41,670
like a normal person they just made me feel like a normal person they just made me feel like a normal

416
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,470
person they just made me feel like a normal person they just made me feel like a normal person

417
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:48,029
they proactively checked on me and when i struggled to get the job after graduating from

418
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:54,170
medical school some of them actually offered up part of their salary to fund mine they just said

419
00:31:54,170 --> 00:32:01,130
let's let's at least take money off the table so we will offer our salaries so when i think about

420
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:06,809
that and the investment and risk and the the chance that they took on me it's helped me to

421
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:11,250
get where i am but i take that now and what i learned from that is that i'm not going to be

422
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:17,849
i give to other people as well so it creates a snowball effect too i think but to me that that's

423
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:22,569
leadership you know it's it's selflessness and it's it's what they did for me i hope to do for

424
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:28,390
others as well yeah beautifully said once again and that opportunity to impact uh people you know

425
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:32,150
in that moment someone we're going to make this work for you in the emergency department i think

426
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:37,829
your mind would initially think that may be the most challenging sphere to take on but uh an

427
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:41,250
emergency doctor to say you know what's your story and abide by it and i think that's the

428
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:44,890
into you like that as you said and to be able to pass that on we all get that opportunity every

429
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:49,630
day don't mean to pass on positive energy and impact people and i love hearing stories like

430
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:54,049
that in such a profound way we see leaders are really conscious about how they go about

431
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:59,829
creating and sharing their vision you said it to me before you said i wouldn't have my old life

432
00:32:59,829 --> 00:33:05,569
back what i'm doing now is really what i was put on this earth to do is is that how you feel about

433
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:10,450
this vision that you are really creating a pathway for people with disability in a unique way

434
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,250
yeah

435
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:16,970
i would actually love to see a day where we don't need to have these conversations

436
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:21,769
we're just like oh yeah it's just a guy you know you know with the spinal cord injury being a doctor

437
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:29,309
like you know it's not a big deal so i'd love to see a day where where people can just

438
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:35,950
do what they want they're accepted and we just we just have this beautiful inclusive

439
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:41,210
peaceful society where everyone can have all these opportunities and do what they want and

440
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:46,349
we're all thriving together so i'd love to see that and that's definitely a vision but i think um

441
00:33:46,349 --> 00:33:53,950
at the same time like if you if you want to be a leader and apart from things like selflessness and

442
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:58,869
wanting to give back to the community and the people around you know those things but

443
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:07,829
i think one of the most important things is also um being an example and living a good set of values

444
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:10,590
i think those values are really important like things like

445
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:23,429
integrity and honesty all those perseverance so um i think modeling those values and living it

446
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:28,010
and being an example is really important as well like uh like they say you know you're going to be

447
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:33,010
the change you want to see full of incredible wisdom uh danesh and i i love you you know

448
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:37,449
mentioning values don't you without a sense of your own values it's hard to then lead other

449
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:40,809
people isn't it if you if you don't know what you stand for yourself and

450
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:46,869
you know that's something clearly that you have uh in spades we see leaders are really curious it's

451
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:51,489
a word that comes up all the time danesh that they use curiosity as a pathway to constantly

452
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:56,389
want to learn and grow does this curiosity resonate with you i have one of my best friends

453
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:06,909
um he i've known him for now 21 years or 22 years i think and he um he's also a doctor

454
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:11,050
one of the best doctors i know he uh

455
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:16,230
i was having a conversation with him recently and when when he actually finished his specialist

456
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:21,230
training he got like the he topped the state in his exams and whatever else so he he's he's

457
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:28,949
an amazing doctor but one of the things he mentioned to me when we're having a conversation

458
00:35:28,949 --> 00:35:35,869
recently is that you know man i don't really uh i don't really need to know what i'm good at like i

459
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:41,170
don't need people to tell me what i'm good at i really want people to tell me about

460
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:46,789
what i'm not good at i really want people to tell me what i could improve on i really want people

461
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:52,389
to tell me what my weaknesses are because i'm interested in those things because i want to

462
00:35:52,389 --> 00:36:02,949
become better so i think um curiosity um and also humility um to to build that curiosity on knowing

463
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:08,429
that okay actually i'm not not so good at this i need to learn a bit more and to be curious enough

464
00:36:08,429 --> 00:36:11,190
to go and learn more to be curious enough to go and learn more to be curious enough to go and learn

465
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:20,110
enough to learn about things outside our own sphere as well um i read this really interesting

466
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:29,530
book called uh range recently and the book range is about uh how we need a world with more people

467
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:36,150
that are that have a broad set of knowledge outside of their own sphere of expertise as well

468
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:39,150
so if you think about people like leonardo da vinci and

469
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,150
um all those historical

470
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:45,809
greats they actually had a huge range of things that they were curious about

471
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:50,869
and learned and that's what make them amazing leaders you can't be you can't have tunnel vision

472
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:58,769
so i think curiosity um about your own about your own sphere wanting to wanting to learn more

473
00:36:58,769 --> 00:37:04,769
backed by humility but also curiosity about other things outside our spheres is really important

474
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:11,150
it's a great book range dennis i had it given to me over the summer and i love the sort of idea of

475
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:16,889
uh debunking a little bit of malcolm gladwell's you know 10 000 hours that we need to get people

476
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:23,170
really young specialized and you know five-year-old violins uh that were put in their hand by their

477
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:27,230
parents they didn't really have a passion for it but i'm going to turn you into the world's

478
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:32,869
you know greatest uh you know uh concert violinist and you know clearly if you put the hours in early

479
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:39,630
you get some advantage but really the research now and range does a great job of telling that

480
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,130
story around if it's not coming through you know you're not going to be able to do it if you don't

481
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:45,829
or you know tell us a great story of roger fetter isn't he his mom was a tennis coach but wouldn't

482
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:51,750
let him play because he was a bad sport and so he went you know and did uh soccer and badminton

483
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:57,389
and table tennis and everything else and but when he came back to it all those diverse skills made

484
00:37:57,389 --> 00:38:02,130
him arguably the world's greatest ever tennis player it's a it's a it's a fascinating uh read

485
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:08,230
worth uh picking that one up uh you're a great communicator uh danesh i've loved in my research

486
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:11,050
for this listening to you ted talk and i mentioned the

487
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:16,449
story before it's a beautiful story you should go back and and watch danesh tell it himself and

488
00:38:16,449 --> 00:38:19,590
and some of the other great parts to it that we probably won't get to

489
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:25,869
today have you really put some time into how you communicate with clarity no

490
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:33,650
it's the lawyer coming out maybe those skills are yeah i know right i i've thought about this

491
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:38,909
and um uh because mom mom my mom actually asked me the other day

492
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:45,630
how this how this uh i don't actually see myself at that that good a communicator but

493
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:50,510
i think it's been a combination of things law school definitely helped

494
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:57,710
you know i remember um they used to have um moot court which is like the mock cases

495
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:05,469
and i actually remember some of my fellow students crying because it was they were grilled so much

496
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:10,989
by the people so it uh definitely put us through a crash course in communication

497
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:18,750
but medicine too uh one of the things that um we often have to do is like get

498
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:25,969
bits of information across about patients very quickly to whether it be to be a senior person

499
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:31,889
at like 2 a.m when you're on the phone to someone just being able to say things with clarity so it's

500
00:39:31,889 --> 00:39:39,929
probably helped me um some of those things but uh no i'm i never see myself that way well it's uh

501
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:41,130
it's brilliant to hear the way you talk about it and i think it's it's a it's a it's a it's a

502
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:45,050
way that that you have and i think you know the message as you said that you're inspiring

503
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:50,610
you know others who perhaps uh you know facing the adversity that you've gone through and i

504
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:56,170
think it's a profound impact that you're having we see leaders are incredibly passionate about

505
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:02,889
collaboration now um the leaders that inspire us uh how do you feel about collaboration in your

506
00:40:02,889 --> 00:40:10,690
world oh so important like in medicine it's super important but um one of the things that i think

507
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,010
about

508
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:20,150
often in collaboration is uh spinal cord injury research so um i lead um a group of spinal cord

509
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:26,869
injury researchers we have a lab um at our university and i'm trying to kill myself

510
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:34,489
the thing that we learn often is that we need to collaborate with others and we need to collaborate

511
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:40,130
with a diverse set of ideas and the the um

512
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:46,349
idea of having silos and trying to build your own thing and doing it alone like i think that's

513
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:53,250
an outdated concept we need to have different the collaborative effort is far more important

514
00:40:53,250 --> 00:41:00,769
the cause is more important um so when you collaborate you get different ideas you get

515
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:06,789
access to different resources you get you can just grow and it's a it's a combined effort so

516
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:09,769
together you can go faster you can go better you can go harder so

517
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:18,150
it's critically important to collaborate across um across a range of disciplines it's yeah it's a

518
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:23,730
no-brainer and dinesh it's a great part of your story that is unfolding you're working you know

519
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:29,369
as a doctor every day uh in the emergency ward but also going back to griffith university as a

520
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:35,909
researcher and delving into paralysis and spinal cord injury it's a it's an amazing full circle

521
00:41:35,909 --> 00:41:41,130
that uh that has happened for you i mean are you excited about the the the the the the the the the

522
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:45,190
where technology is going and are you hopeful in the future that there's

523
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:51,489
you know a really profound way forward oh yeah when i first had the injury there was

524
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:58,789
since then to now there's been so many developments in spinal cord injury and

525
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:05,869
we've even seen some therapies that have started to give people motor function back um where groups

526
00:42:05,869 --> 00:42:09,210
of people in certain studies have been able to move their limbs again it's not perfect

527
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:10,989
but it's it's

528
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:19,150
starting to happen so um i'm very hopeful that technology and medicine will move forward um

529
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:24,289
you know just this morning too i was reading a medical article about a therapy for certain

530
00:42:24,289 --> 00:42:29,789
cancer that's nearly curative now as well so we're making all these advances and we're making

531
00:42:29,789 --> 00:42:34,909
we're doing good things for humans so similar to that i think spinal cord injury over the next few

532
00:42:34,909 --> 00:42:41,110
years we'll see some amazing things um and uh that that would be pretty

533
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:46,429
cool i think look i love life and i love the life that i have but still that'd be that'd be a pretty

534
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:52,369
cool thing to achieve for humanity it'd be pretty amazing someone who has been on the receiving

535
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:59,230
end of a spinal cord injury to be part of uh the the solution to to find uh a cure effectively

536
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:04,349
would be amazing empowering leaders is the title of this podcast uh dinesh we've asked

537
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:11,130
all of our guests who has been the greatest leader in your life that's easy that's my

538
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:22,469
mom you know my mom is such an incredible woman she um ever since i was a kid um she always taught

539
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:27,489
me that anything is possible right you know when you're growing up sometimes you have people saying

540
00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:32,369
that's really hard or you know you might not be able to be she was never that she was always like

541
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:37,070
you can do that you get you yeah if you want it you can do that you can do that this is how you do

542
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:41,130
them when i was 14 she helped me register for a surgery and i was like oh my god i'm going to be

543
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:48,309
my first business and set up a office out of the garage and all that stuff so she taught me how to

544
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:54,170
drive she taught me how to shave she taught me about uh bank accounts and all these things

545
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:59,949
she and then even when i came back to medicine you know just the other day i heard her telling

546
00:43:59,949 --> 00:44:05,670
someone that when i wanted to come back to medical school after the accident it was just me and her

547
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:09,550
right um we everyone else left us for a period of time but

548
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,130
she said i didn't

549
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:15,250
really know how we were going to do it but i just said i told him that we would

550
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:22,610
and it'll be fine so she's that kind of person but she's taught me everything um and she's

551
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:27,909
taught me about perseverance and uh leadership because she's always been a leader in our family

552
00:44:27,909 --> 00:44:36,250
um so mom for sure i had this feeling you might have uh gone there dinesh and uh she's just a

553
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:40,809
remarkable person your mom and you know you almost can't help but cry when you

554
00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:41,130
when you're

555
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:48,070
watching the stories and her dedication to to you and i love this part of the story too that she

556
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:54,610
then went to griffith university herself and she's completed a degree in rehabilitation and

557
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:59,869
recovery on the back of her support for you and and and people might understand that you know

558
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:06,110
dinesh you know mom literally you know cook for you and feed you and and and was your carer you

559
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:11,110
know and for her and there's a great bit of it we see her the pride when you're a mom and you're a

560
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:16,969
graduate from medical school it's just as magic a moment so it's uh i could see the smile on your

561
00:45:16,969 --> 00:45:21,730
face when i asked that question and and i'm assuming um you know every day she's still a

562
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:30,030
massive part of your life every day yeah um no she's uh we're a team she's she's awesome incredible

563
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:35,730
in in the spirit of collaboration uh dinesh we have been asking this question as well if there's

564
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:40,210
anyone in the world that you could collaborate in any of the areas that you're contributing is

565
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,110
there someone that springs to mind that you could collaborate with in any of the areas that you're

566
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:47,250
that you think god if i could connect with them and and collaborate does that have someone that

567
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:59,489
comes to mind oh that is uh that's an interesting question um i think uh a controversial figure but

568
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:05,349
um he has a lot of technology that's and probably resources too that can make it for but elon musk

569
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:09,150
is uh he's he's been doing that work with neuralink

570
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:17,349
the brain computer interfaces and uh it's probably it's applicable to spinal cord injury as well

571
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:23,710
has some parallels to the work that we're doing uh in our own lab so i think that would that would

572
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:29,789
be a very interesting collaboration hey dinesh you're not the first person to mention elon musk

573
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:34,469
in different categories and different thoughts you know and there it's something isn't it as you said

574
00:46:34,469 --> 00:46:40,329
you know and people pause too and they go there's some controversy there but there is some sense of

575
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:46,349
reason there for you know whatever you you think of elon musk that he's been able to break through

576
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:53,730
in a in a number of different fields hasn't he things that you know car um manufacturers around

577
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:59,769
the world had the opportunity to go into electric cars for decades and didn't and what he's done with

578
00:46:59,769 --> 00:47:07,010
uh the satellites and launching rockets and landing them back on the same takeoff uh facility

579
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:10,989
with which they were initially launched so he's clearly got a way of doing things that other

580
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:16,050
people think aren't possible is that what gravitates you towards him or not yeah i think so and um

581
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:20,750
again like you say like it's he's not been without controversy and he's not been without

582
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:25,670
things but like when you actually objectively look at the different things that he's done it's pretty

583
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:34,730
pretty impressive right like the electric cars and um i think even his work with paypal and

584
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:40,230
it's really changed the world and i think he currently is the richest man in the world right

585
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:50,449
it's like so he's uh he's done a bunch of impressive things and i think uh and i think

586
00:47:50,449 --> 00:47:57,989
it's also when we look at um i think when we look at people from as a society and when we look at

587
00:47:57,989 --> 00:48:05,570
people um i read somewhere that it's very easy to judge the person that's in the arena shedding

588
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:10,710
their blood sweat and tears um but it's a very different thing to be that person

589
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:19,849
in the arena who's actually doing the thing um so uh yeah he's he's in the arena doing the thing

590
00:48:19,849 --> 00:48:25,090
yeah beautifully uh beautifully said dinesh it's been an incredible uh privilege to sit down and

591
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:29,869
and hear more about your story and uh inspired by everything that you're doing and the way that

592
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:34,969
you've approached it and and your mum and her influence as well it was nice to uh to hear that

593
00:48:34,969 --> 00:48:39,090
your description of the two of you being a team there's only one issue that i've got dinesh and

594
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:41,110
i'm looking at your screen and it's thrown me

595
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:46,190
from the very start is that there's a brisbane lions jumper now on the back of your wall there

596
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:50,050
you can't get everything right dinesh you're barracked for the wrong team unfortunately but

597
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:55,329
uh that's uh you can't help bad luck sometimes where did that passion come from

598
00:48:55,329 --> 00:48:58,150
i uh i was going to bring that up actually

599
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:04,329
strategically placed it's in my view the whole the whole time so i had to

600
00:49:04,329 --> 00:49:10,449
to mention it and and then behind you is uh is actually the true uh the true trophy which is

601
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:20,090
titan's uh jersey oh wow yeah wow okay so you've declared your hand exactly no i um i went and uh

602
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:25,570
talked to the lions a few years ago just about the journey because they were going through some

603
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:32,610
hard times as you know as well so um the the team very kindly gifted me that so yeah now i've got

604
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:38,909
it strategically placed dinesh thanks again uh so much for sharing your story and uh hopefully get
