00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:11,740
This week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,699
medical professor who stood up to the narrative of fear that was sweeping the globe at the

3
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,079
very start of the pandemic.

4
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,539
His advocacy for focused protection in opposition to the crippling lockdowns that were imposed

5
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:28,519
by public health officials was a courageous stance that cost him lifelong friends and

6
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,420
criticism from the US medical establishment.

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,899
I found this conversation to be incredibly insightful.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,460
What does trusting the science actually mean?

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,759
His powerful collaboration with medical professionals around the world to rebuild trust in science

10
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,299
to allow open debate and dialogue is inspiring.

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,740
His courage and leadership is a story you really want to hear.

12
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:53,240
A conversation I loved and it ties in very closely with the passion that I have for the

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,359
work that we're doing at Alita.

14
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,859
If you're motivated to improve or start your leadership journey, we'd love you to check

15
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,399
out our Alita Connect signature.

16
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,299
Alita Connect is a program which brings leaders together from sport, industry, social

17
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:09,579
venture, education and the arts into bespoke facilitated forums where leaders are coming

18
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:13,819
together to connect, to learn and to share in what we think is a pretty life-changing

19
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:14,180
way.

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:32,239
Dr. Jay Bhattacharya is a professor of Stanford University Medical School, a physician, epidemiologist,

21
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,439
health economist and public health policy expert focusing on infectious diseases and

22
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,420
vulnerable populations.

23
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:39,420
In October 2020...

24
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,180
At the height of communities being locked down around the world, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya

25
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,299
and his colleagues, Dr. Martin Kuldoff, who's the professor of medicine at Harvard University

26
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:55,620
with expertise in detecting and monitoring infectious disease outbreaks, and Dr. Sunetra

27
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,879
Gupta, professor at Oxford University, also an epidemiologist with expertise in immunology

28
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:06,560
and mathematical modelling of infectious disease, together co-authored the Great Barrington

29
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,180
Declaration.

30
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,139
The declaration received 60,000 signatures.

31
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:15,379
Support from other doctors, nurses and health professionals, and close to a million signatures

32
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:16,319
from the wider community.

33
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,379
The Great Barrington Declaration called for focused protection for those most at risk,

34
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,060
identified as the elderly with underlying health issues, while those in the not vulnerable

35
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:32,080
category should resume life as normal, returning to school, to work, playing sport, etc., with

36
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,919
simple hygiene measures encouraged, like staying at home while sick and washing hands.

37
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:39,800
Jay, it's an incredible leadership story to stand up.

38
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,379
In what was one of the most unique times in human history in the last 100 years, I really

39
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:45,379
appreciate you joining me today.

40
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,780
Oh, my pleasure.

41
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,860
Thank you for having me.

42
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,979
Jay, around 2020, in January, most of us around the world started to hear about this virus,

43
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:57,000
the coronavirus, COVID-19, that was emanating from China.

44
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,900
As one of the world's leading experts in the space, early on, you conducted a couple of

45
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,960
really specific studies to determine how dangerous COVID-19.

46
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:09,199
Can you tell us what you did way back then and what you found so early on?

47
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:17,199
Sure. So the key idea was that, well, let me just, let me step back to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic,

48
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,080
because that's where some of the ideas I had early on came from.

49
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:25,759
So is that the swine flu, Jay? Is that the H1N1 is a swine flu? Yeah.

50
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,740
Exactly. Swine flu. So there, there were very, early on, there were very, very high death rates

51
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:37,139
reported. The key catch there was that they would, identifying patients who were very sick with the

52
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:39,780
swine flu, and then they would like calculate what fraction of them,

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,860
recovered. And, you know, it was, the death rate was high. The problem was that, in fact,

54
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,039
there were a lot of people who had gotten the swine flu that never got really sick and never

55
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:55,319
came to the medical attention. And those were not captured. There were a whole bunch of studies that

56
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:03,099
were done of antibodies to the swine flu later in the pandemic, in that pandemic, which found that

57
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:09,219
a hundred times more people had been infected than actually become severe cases. And so the death

58
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:09,780
rate went from zero to a hundred times more people had been infected than actually become severe cases.

59
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:17,439
From three, four, five, six percent to something like 0.01 percent, 99.99% survival. So I had very

60
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,920
early on the same thought here. I was like, okay, well, maybe what if this is a highly infectious

61
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,540
respiratory virus? What if it's spread really rapidly, even outside of our knowledge, it's

62
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,279
producing some really, really sick patients, but maybe it's also produced some mild disease that

63
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,420
hasn't come to medical attention. And so early on in the pandemic, I ran two studies of antibodies

64
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,560
looking for evidence that people have been infected. And, and,

65
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:44,399
and, but never came to medical attention in Santa Clara County, California, where I live,

66
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:50,060
and in Los Angeles County, just south of where I live. And what we found was that, and that was

67
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,720
true. It was, it was in fact, 50 times more infections than cases. Now it turns out it's

68
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,560
much more deadly than swine flu. So this disease had a death rate in the population at large of

69
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:09,639
about 0.2%, 99.8%, 20 times more deadly than swine flu. But it also had a very steep age

70
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:15,160
gradient. Older people had a very high risk of death from this, four, five, 6%, if you're above

71
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,079
80, 80, 80 years old, whereas children have a vanishingly small risk of death from this,

72
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:29,480
you know, pretty close to zero, you know, on the order of the flu or less. And so that meant that

73
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,160
there was very different risk categories, old people, high risk, young people, much less so.

74
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,560
So that, that was the main study I did early on that. So the death rate was one thing that

75
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:39,620
came out of it. And so I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

76
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:47,560
there's two other lessons really important. If I can be really brief. One is that 3% of the

77
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,019
population in April, 2020 in Santa Clara County in California had the disease, had antibodies to

78
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:58,160
the disease. 3%, doesn't sound like a big number, but it's already too late to go to zero. That

79
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,660
means it's already, the horse is out of the barn. You're not going to be able to stop the disease

80
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:07,319
from spreading. It's a highly infectious disease. So a policy that aimed at zero was going to fail

81
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,480
just based on that study alone. You knew that.

82
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:15,879
And the second thing is 3% is not a lot of the populations. There's still like a very large

83
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:19,459
fraction of the population to go. It was going to be a long epidemic. And we knew that just from

84
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:24,360
that study. And Jay, there, you know, pretty crucial bits of information you would have

85
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,040
thought in terms of setting public policy on the back of that to say, Hey, this isn't a mortality

86
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,360
rate, you know, 3% because that would be alarming and the modeling would be off the charts. And we

87
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,399
were shown a lot of that modeling early days that predicted extraordinary, you know,

88
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:44,300
death rates. And then as you said, to really establish pretty quickly that the idea of

89
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,540
actually trying to chase COVID zero was just an impossibility and not something that was ever

90
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,639
going to be achieved. I suppose what happened, Jay, from there was that the public health message

91
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,399
and the fear went into overdrive. And, you know, I'm talking to you from the city of Melbourne. I

92
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:03,560
know you've been here before and given lectures. You're on your way back to Melbourne, Australia

93
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,300
to give some more lectures on this, but we can't forget some of the language that was

94
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,379
sent our way.

95
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:14,060
In the cities that we live in, I can remember a public health official talking about this virus

96
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,879
will creep in through your window. It will get you at night when you're asleep. Insidious,

97
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,480
virulent, deadly. We had grim-faced public health officials every day telling us of daily

98
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,399
case numbers and really just that the language became incredibly fear-driven.

99
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,000
As you said, if you flip that potentially and use the evidence, and there were hundreds of

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,300
studies done like you did to confirm that your Santa Clara study was accurate. And

101
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:44,180
you know, in fact, that was very quickly established as being what was going on. You could

102
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:50,019
have said and stood in front of people as a public health and said 99.98% of you are going to survive

103
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:54,379
this virus. There was another message to be had. Why did fear win the day in your mind, Jay?

104
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:00,540
Well, so yes, like they could have, I wouldn't have said 99.8. I would have said if you're old,

105
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,019
there's this high risk. It's a deadly disease. Be careful. If you're young,

106
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:09,339
live your life. The virus is the least of your problems or not, you know, not the top of your top,

107
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:13,899
but shouldn't top the list of your problems. But I'll say this, I think the fear-based messaging

108
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:19,540
in around the world was terrible. It was an unethical breach of public health norms. Normally,

109
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:24,939
you provide, the goal of public health is to provide people with tools to cope with that fear,

110
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:31,639
not to stoke it. And I saw in Australia, that was, it was, I mean, it was pretty bad in the U.S.,

111
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:37,679
I have to say, but it was even worse in Australia. I saw some advertisements of, you know,

112
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,179
young person, like a young,

113
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:44,299
active woman in an ICU bed who couldn't breathe, you know, the TV ad that was aired all through

114
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:50,460
Australia from public health. A lot of that, I think, stemmed from this idea that people

115
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,960
weren't going to take the disease seriously enough unless they were scared. That became

116
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:04,919
an official sort of policy of public health. And it, in part, you really did need something

117
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,259
like that if you were going to impose lockdowns on a population. Essentially,

118
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,620
what public health was asking people to do was to put aside all of the other priorities in their

119
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,480
life, their kids' schooling, if they had cancer, don't go get cancer, don't go get treatment,

120
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:23,659
if you have, don't get screened for cancer, put aside your medical priorities, put aside,

121
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:29,620
close your businesses, don't go to church or your synagogue, don't, essentially, to put aside all

122
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,279
the other priorities in your life in order to avoid this single infectious disease.

123
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,379
The only way you can really get compliance with that is if people are really scared

124
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,720
especially for an extended period of time. And it's a powerful weapon, fear, isn't it?

125
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,860
Because it's very hard to reverse once people have established that in their brain. It becomes,

126
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:53,639
even then, when you hear educated and world-renowned experts like you speak in a balanced

127
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,700
way about this with proper evidence and produce it, people then don't really want to hear that

128
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:05,980
message. And I suppose going back to your leadership, you know, to stand up and the

129
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,320
Great Barrington Declaration, can you tell, I suppose, was that your response?

130
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:14,059
To the public fear? Can you tell us about how it emanated and what it was about?

131
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,860
Sure. So if you, just to take you back, in Australia, the lockdowns you all did actually,

132
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:28,139
it actually worked in one sense, like in early, the early lockdowns actually did reduce cases to

133
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:34,639
zero on the island. In the United States, they hadn't worked, but the cases have come down.

134
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,799
And in the summer of 2020, there wasn't the, the fear had started to subside.

135
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,659
There was a sense of maybe we weren't going to need to, to lock down again.

136
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,860
In fact, I remember talking to some colleagues in Australia who were like, look, we've conquered

137
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,100
the disease. Our life is normal. There's no restrictions at all. Although there were still

138
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,759
restrictions over here. In Australia, that was partly because you were in the Southern

139
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:03,539
Hemisphere. The disease arrived in your summer. It's a seasonal disease, very clearly. It arrived

140
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:08,639
in the Northern Hemisphere in the winter. It's more easily, more easily spread in the winter.

141
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:15,200
So it put the Australia and much of the rest of the world on different paths.

142
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:24,620
In the United States, in September, October, there was a lot of concern about kids spreading

143
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:31,679
the disease in schools. It was really becoming clear to me that the summer sense that the disease

144
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,779
was under control had gone away and that people wanted to have lockdowns again. My kids, for

145
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,820
instance, in California, weren't, were, were, were, were, were, were, were, were, were, were,

146
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,320
were, were, were, were, were, were, were, were, were, were, were, were, were, were, were, were,

147
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:46,019
not in person in school for a year and a half. And the idea of the lockdown as a way to control

148
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:52,879
disease, it sort of entrenched itself in public health. But I knew from talking to some of my

149
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,960
colleagues and some of my friends that there was a lot of concern, both about the harms of the

150
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,220
lockdown on young people and also the ability of the lockdowns to actually control the spread of

151
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:11,100
the disease. It wasn't universal. Unlike what some government officials have tried to create

152
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,539
this impression that every credible person thought the lockdown's the only way, I knew for a fact

153
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:23,960
that wasn't true. In October of 2020, I was invited to this small conference in Great Barrington,

154
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:29,919
Massachusetts, where, that's why I've got the Great Barrington name, Martin Kulldorff, who's a

155
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,899
Harvard, as you mentioned, a Harvard epidemiologist and biostatistician,

156
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:39,679
and Sunetra Gupta were both, there was the three of us, and it was a bunch of other scholars who

157
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:47,820
were there to talk about what the right policy ought to be. And what Martin, Sunetra, and I came

158
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,620
up with was it turns out we arrived basically at the same place. You have this age gradient and

159
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,019
risk. Older people are really high risk, younger people much less so. The lockdowns are tremendously

160
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:01,940
harmful to young people, especially. So the right policy is focus protection of the old.

161
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:03,659
That meant,

162
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,639
a whole series of policies that are local in nature, because older people have different

163
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:14,940
living arrangements to impress the world, but with an aim toward reducing the risk of exposure

164
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,200
when there's high community spread for older people. And then for young people, lift the

165
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,600
restrictions. Because the ability to actually stop the disease from spreading had clearly,

166
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,460
there wasn't none. The lockdowns had not worked to stop the disease anywhere outside of,

167
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,620
say, Australia and New Zealand.

168
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,460
Certainly not in the Northern Hemisphere. And so at the same time, we really damaged the lives of

169
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:45,840
children, of other people with other diseases. So the Great Parental Declaration, we wrote a piece

170
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:54,600
in October 4th, 2020, released it and put it on a webpage. Tens of thousands of doctors signed on,

171
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:00,460
tens of thousands of scientists and epidemiologists signed on. It showed the world that there was not

172
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:04,120
a consensus in favor of lockdown. In fact, there was a deep,

173
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,600
unhappiness with lockdown in the scientific community. And then almost a million people

174
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,559
so far, regular people have signed on. And it's an amazing leadership position

175
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:19,480
to take and swimming against the tide, as it were. And the public health machine came after you,

176
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:25,440
Dr. J, in a big way. Anthony Fauci, who's the most high-profile public health official in the

177
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,679
world, would be a reasonable term, I think, to assign to him. The Chief Medical Officer

178
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,919
Advisor to the President of the United States. He's been in his role for five decades.

179
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:39,340
I have to read this quote back to you, because this is what he said when asked about the Great

180
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:44,759
Barrington Declaration. I know you will know it, but he said this. I'll tell you exactly how I feel

181
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,559
about that. If you let infections rip, as it were, and say, let everybody get infected that's going

182
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:53,740
to be able to get infected, and then we'll have herd immunity, quite frankly, that is nonsense.

183
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,740
And anybody who knows anything about epidemiology will tell you that is nonsense, and it's very

184
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,919
dangerous. Now, if you read the one page of the Great Barrington Declaration, you never talked

185
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,840
letting it rip. You spoke about focus protection. I mean, why was that? I think you've referred to

186
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,620
that as propaganda, right? Why was someone in that role so vehemently trying to bring down

187
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:22,480
a logical explanation that you put forward? Well, the strategy of lockdown is an absolutely

188
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,100
extraordinary strategy. It requires extraordinary evidence. And one of the things I think it

189
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:34,039
requires is this sense that no reasonable scientist opposes it. That, in fact, there's this

190
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:40,279
overwhelming consensus in favor of it. The problem that the Great Barrington Declaration

191
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:47,840
posed to Tony Fauci is that the authors of the Great Barrington Declaration come from

192
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,860
reputable universities, Stanford, Harvard, Oxford. I've never in my life cared that I'm

193
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:57,980
a reputable university. I'd rather you judge me on my ideas. But here you had three people

194
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,779
from reputable universities saying that lockdown was a bad idea.

195
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,940
Tens of thousands of doctors signed, including Nobel Prize winners, from top universities around

196
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:14,399
the world. It absolutely shattered the idea that there was a consensus in favor of lockdown.

197
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:21,220
And for Tony Fauci, that posed a real problem. He had to have this idea that there was a consensus

198
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:30,200
in order to create a demand for lockdown. Otherwise, then he's just one voice among many.

199
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,120
And so he used his power as,

200
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:41,580
the world's most prominent public health figure, to essentially mount a propaganda campaign.

201
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:48,700
Instead of engaging with the argument we were making in good faith, he put a straw man in place.

202
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:53,360
He said, oh, they just want to force everyone to get infected. When, in fact, what we were

203
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,399
calling for was policies that would actually protect the old and the vulnerable. During the

204
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,279
first wave in the United States, 80% of the deaths, more than 80% of the deaths, were people over the

205
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,000
age of 65.

206
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,740
The lockdowns had not worked to protect the vulnerable. We were calling for better policies

207
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:15,099
to protect the older populations, not letting the virus rip. In fact, the goal was to protect the

208
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:19,980
people who would die at a highest rate from the virus. That's the idea of focused protection.

209
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,200
So he was creating the straw man, because those words are powerful in the minds of the regular

210
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:30,559
population, of regular people. Let it rip? Oh, you want the policy is just to expose me to the virus?

211
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,700
Oh, you want to kill me? I mean, that is essentially,

212
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,660
the specter that he was raising in the minds of regular people in order to dismiss the idea

213
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,680
that we were putting forward, in order to not actually engage with it. He was trying to shut

214
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:50,599
down debate. And Jay, for context, to understand the power of Tony Fauci, people may not quite get

215
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:55,680
a grasp on that. And I'm sure I don't as well. But in his role, billions and billions and dollars

216
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:01,539
of grants go the way of scientists. And he has complete say over funding. And if you're a

217
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,839
scientist, and you don't get funded by...

218
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,460
The regulatory authorities that he's been in control of for five decades,

219
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:12,359
that can be career ending for a scientist, I'm assuming. So it takes courage and leadership

220
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:17,240
for you and your colleagues to stand up and say, hey, we're going to put that at risk. But a lot

221
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,539
of your other colleagues behind the scenes were supportive, but really felt as though their hands

222
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:27,799
were tied. Is that an accurate reflection of how it plays out? I mean, it's definitely risky. So he

223
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:33,880
sits on top of, as you say, billions of dollars of federal funding. Careers are made based,

224
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,200
not just on the money, but on the risk. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's

225
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,259
a really important thing. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's

226
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:34,319
a really important thing. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's

227
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,420
on the money from getting Tony Fauci, but the fact that the National Institute of Health

228
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:45,180
has awarded you a grant, many top medical institutions will get grant tenure on the

229
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,059
basis of winning those kinds of awards. That's true at Stanford University, where I teach.

230
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:55,259
And so it's really hard to speak up against him, because you're essentially putting your

231
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,819
career at risk. You're saying, okay, well, I'm going to oppose someone who may make or break

232
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:04,200
my career. And there are other sources of funding. So it's really hard to speak up against him.

233
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,819
It's not like he's... But in the areas of infectious disease epidemiology, infectious

234
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:16,160
disease immunology, he is essentially the crown prince, the king, right? You're essentially going

235
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:26,720
against the king. And so, yeah, I mean, it definitely takes some level of... I have to tell

236
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,359
you, I made a decision that I didn't care what happened in my career. I just felt like I had to

237
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,200
speak up, because the policy was harming so many people. And I think that's a really important

238
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:42,240
that I basically had devoted my career to studying and making their lives better,

239
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:49,180
vulnerable people, poor people, children. And I couldn't stay silent. And so I had to make a

240
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:54,059
decision when I signed it that I wasn't... Even if I had to pay for it with my career, I was going

241
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:59,019
to still do it. And that is a great story of courage and leadership, Jane. I'm fascinated

242
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:03,980
by it. And we need people in the world, and we need to celebrate people. We heard a lot of

243
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,380
there was very little debate, but a lot of it was, trust the science, trust the science. And

244
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:17,160
what you actually were offering up was that science is an evolving discussion, and it requires

245
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,480
debate. And then eventually, if it becomes collaborative enough and you get consensus,

246
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,640
then there are times when people do generally agree, don't they, on certain things? I think

247
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,160
people look at smoking now, and we're pretty universal on what happens if you decide to go

248
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,180
down the path of smoking cigarettes. But in this case, we're not going to do that. We're not going

249
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,259
to do that. We're not going to do that. We're not going to do that. We're not going to do that.

250
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:40,519
Because something as new as that, to have debates shut down, it seems the opposite of science. Is

251
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:45,640
that, again, a fair reflection? It's exactly right. It's exactly right. I mean, science

252
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,880
is not an automatic consensus. You have a new situation. It just takes time, right? It takes

253
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,779
a lot of minds. The world is a complicated place. This disease is a complicated thing.

254
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,319
Society is complicated. It's going to take a lot of trial and error with lots of people

255
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:04,180
talking to each other in good faith. And I think that's going to be a big part of the

256
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,299
trying to generate data in order to learn what the right way to deal with this is.

257
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:14,400
And the idea that somehow, minutes after you have this virus in the world at large,

258
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:19,859
that everyone knows exactly what to do, it happens to coincide with exactly what Tony Fauci and other

259
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:26,880
public health authorities wanted to do, that was not true. It was a lot of debate going on,

260
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,059
sub rosa, underneath the public's aegis. They're not privy to it because it's scientists just

261
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:33,839
talking to each other.

262
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:40,000
And a lot of uncertainty. And yet the public was painted this picture of consensus. It was

263
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,440
false. It was a propaganda campaign. I don't know how else to describe it. It was a propaganda

264
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:50,940
campaign. And within the context of science, it's deadly. Science needs an open space where people

265
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:58,740
can make hypotheses that turn out wrong and not be canceled for them. They need to have lots of

266
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,660
people who disagree with each other. That's actually part of the fun of science, frankly.

267
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,079
It's one of the reasons I have always enjoyed being a scientist,

268
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,440
because I learn from that process of discussing with my colleagues. And I'm often wrong. That's

269
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,180
part of how science works. And it's the opportunity to change my mind, which makes science fun.

270
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:20,000
I want to talk to you about great leadership and collaboration. I'm going to come back a bit to the

271
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,160
city of Melbourne, where I live, and just tell a bit of that story again. I know you're acutely

272
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,920
aware of it, Jay. But it was, as I said, with pride, we used to call ourselves, and we were

273
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,900
voted regularly the most livable city in the world here in Melbourne. And it's where my four kids are

274
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,700
now. And we're passionate about it. But what happened in the last two years, I mean, I think

275
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,799
people have to look back with crazy. We had pregnant women being handcuffed and arrested

276
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:48,000
in their homes in Ballarat, a regional town, because they posted on Facebook the idea that

277
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,039
maybe we should peacefully protest around the merit of lockdowns. We had two years of schooling

278
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:59,420
where kids were homeschooled, effectively out of school for that period of time. We had police

279
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,640
tape around our playground. So when kids were allowed out for their hour, they could look at

280
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,940
and then literally have the torment of having that. We had boulders put on skate parks. The

281
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,180
amount of effort and resource that was done to stop kids in their one hour, they were allowed

282
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:18,240
out from home. 5K exclusion zones around your neighborhood. You weren't allowed to go out of

283
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,019
that barrier for fear of being arrested. We had elderly people who were sitting on park benches,

284
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:27,900
moved on from police. I think sometimes we need to actually remind ourselves of what we went through,

285
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:33,759
curfews in your house. You weren't allowed out of your house after 8 p.m. at night or 9 p.m. at

286
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,000
night. Now, what was never debated here in this city was the damage of lockdown. Now, you're one

287
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,259
of the most published researchers in scientific journals all around the world. You were acutely

288
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:49,039
aware of the damage lockdowns were going to do. Can you give us some of the evidence that now

289
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,900
has been produced? Because it's still in my mind, not something people talk about,

290
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,400
the pain of lockdown and what it's continued to do. Can you share with us some of your findings?

291
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:02,119
It's devastating. I mean, it's not just my findings. This is like the work of many,

292
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,279
many people, many scientists.

293
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,740
It was predictable, right? So just for instance, just take kids, right? So I think Melbourne has

294
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,740
had probably the most number of days of lockdown over the past two and a half years of any city

295
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:18,359
in the world, actually. And a lot of kids, as you say, the kids' lives were interrupted.

296
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,740
If you replace regular school with online school, you're not actually giving them schooling. It's

297
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,720
something else. A lot of the benefit of schooling comes from the ability to interact with other

298
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,000
kids. So there's social development that's lost. And also,

299
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,599
there's just learning that's lost. That's going to be true for Melbourne kids, just as it is for

300
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:46,079
American kids who have been kept out of school. Before the pandemic, there was a literature on

301
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:51,299
this that looked at short interruptions in schooling and what consequences it has on the

302
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:57,099
lives of children the rest of their lives. And so they would do these natural experiments where

303
00:24:57,099 --> 00:25:02,480
they compare some location that has mandated schooling until you're age 17 versus age 16,

304
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,180
and then track the kids for the rest of their lives. And so they would do these natural experiments

305
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,920
rest of their life. And it turns out that the children that were required to stay in school

306
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:17,720
for just a short one year longer, that led to longer lives, more healthy lives, and with less

307
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:26,180
unemployment, just more prosperity. In other words, by locking down, we have consigned our

308
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:31,799
children to shorter lives, less healthy lives. One estimate early in the pandemic from just the

309
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:36,559
spring lockdowns in the United States alone estimated that we had shortened our children's

310
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,539
lives just in the United States by five and a half million life years from just the spring lockdown.

311
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:48,720
And this is true all over the world. There are places in poor countries like Bangladesh,

312
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:54,740
Uganda, where kids have never come back. Millions of children missed two years of school and then

313
00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:00,759
never came back to school, lost forever. It's a catastrophic generational theft of the birthright

314
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,299
of our kids.

315
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:07,640
What we did with lockdowns, and that's just on kids. That's on the educational outcomes,

316
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:11,859
never mind the psychological harm we've done to our children and young people.

317
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:20,339
So in the United States, there was a study done by the US CDC in June of 2020 that found that one

318
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:26,740
in four young adults seriously considered suicide the previous month. Can you imagine the depths of

319
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:31,680
psychological despair people were in, especially young people? Young people need interactions with

320
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:31,779
others.

321
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:40,019
I mean, I'm an old guy. I can be a hermit. It's fine. But even old people like me need human

322
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:48,160
connections, right? So there was a big increase in despair and deaths among older people with

323
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:54,319
dementia from loneliness. People with dementia died of loneliness, 20, 30% increase in that.

324
00:26:54,619 --> 00:27:01,240
Everyone needs connection. And so the levels of anxiety, the levels of depression shot through

325
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,680
the roof.

326
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:08,319
And the consequences of that now are a big increase in drug overdoses, big increase in

327
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:14,980
deaths from the kinds of things that happen when you have deep psychological distress at a mass

328
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:23,740
level. There's also problems with other physical health. People stop getting cancer screening.

329
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,259
People actually skip cancer treatment because they're so afraid of COVID, or they were told

330
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:31,779
that they shouldn't come in because they want to preserve the health.

331
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:36,160
Preserve the health care system. Preserve the health care system for what? If you're not using it

332
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:44,200
to treat cancer patients, what's it for? People stay at home with heart attacks. It's mind-boggling

333
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:51,440
because we've made the avoidance of COVID so far above many, many other deadly diseases in poor

334
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,180
countries. I worry about poor countries for lots of reasons. But one of the things that I think is

335
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:01,779
important to understand, when rich countries like Australia, like the United States, lock down,

336
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:09,759
and cut trade ties, essentially reduce the connections with the outside world, a lot of poor

337
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:15,359
countries, they've reorganized their economy to fit into the global economy. And when these kinds

338
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:22,319
of economic connections break, when rich countries undertake these kinds of policies, it has knock-on

339
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:28,960
consequences in poor countries. And a lot of poor countries, there's a lot of people who live on $2

340
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,240
a day of income or less, very, very poor.

341
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:37,319
Even small perturbations in the economy can have enormous deleterious consequences on them.

342
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:43,259
And that's exactly what happened. The UN estimated that somewhere on the order of 80 million people

343
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:48,640
were put on the brink of starvation, dire food insecurity. Hundreds of thousands of children

344
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,859
in March of 2021, a UN report said, died in South Asia alone from starvation.

345
00:28:55,579 --> 00:29:00,339
We have a moral obligation, I think, when we've made promises to the rest of the world about

346
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:01,220
trade and order, and we've made promises to the rest of the world about trade and order,

347
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:07,079
about economic ties, to not break them. Because the consequences are not just that

348
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:13,279
some rich people don't get so rich. It's that the poor face the consequences of that even more

349
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,980
acutely than anyone else, I think. And the poorest of the poor are the worst of all.

350
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:23,059
It's an incredible summation that you just gave. And the social divide that you talk about is

351
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:29,059
horrific. And the consequences are horrific going forward. And coming back a bit micro here in

352
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:31,200
Melbourne in the, as you said, the most locked-down country in the world, it's the most locked-down

353
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:37,079
city in the world or close enough to it. In the final weeks of the final lockdown, a journalist

354
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:41,640
wrote a story. It was very hard to get information out on this, that there were 800 teenage girls

355
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,680
a week being diagnosed with eating disorders in this city alone. That was the perfect storm on

356
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:54,420
that one small. And really to get a consultation with a medical health professional, a mental

357
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,240
health professional in Melbourne, there's an 18-month waiting. There's just no possibility,

358
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,140
the inundation of the demand.

359
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:06,920
On that service, as you said, we spent the whole narrative around protecting from a virus where

360
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:12,099
the evidence was there that young people were close statistically enough to no risk at all. And

361
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:18,160
yet we've created this incredible lifetime of problems on the other side. It was the fascinating

362
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,240
part, Jane, this is why these conversations for me are so important. And your leadership is so

363
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,799
important that through that time, I was co-hosting a breakfast radio show here in Melbourne. We had

364
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:31,200
the premier on regularly to even ask a respectful question. And I think that's a really important

365
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,900
thing to do, to even ask you know, a respectful question about the merit of lockdown created a

366
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:41,299
fire storm of response. You know, in some corners you were considered treacherous for even what I

367
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:47,220
thought was respectfully asking a question. And so, my problem is how do we learn from this going

368
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,940
forward where it seems as though we just want to move on now. We don't want to talk about what's

369
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,700
happened to our young people. We don't want to hear what you just said because it's too painful

370
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,500
to acknowledge. But if you don't acknowledge it, how can we go forward and do anything about it?

371
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:00,900
And how do we start with that? So, this is really key. I think it's important that we start with

372
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:00,940
this. This is the time that we've come into this. We've got that moment and this is really key here.

373
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,200
It's the time to get out of this. It's the time to get out of this. And the point is that people are seeing

374
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:08,079
stop it again is my question to you. Yeah. I mean, I think it's not just that you need to have

375
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:13,660
some political reforms because you're absolutely right. You have to have this conversation. You

376
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:19,380
have to look squarely at ourselves in the eye and say, okay, what did we do wrong? In medicine,

377
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:27,380
we do this. There's a tradition of after a patient has died and a lot of doctors are involved to have

378
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:31,039
a conference called a morbidity and mortality conference where you, without pointing fingers,

379
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,640
discuss what went wrong, what went right, how to, and so with the aim of essentially

380
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,819
instructing everybody and learning from each other so that we don't make the same mistake again.

381
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,200
We need to have a society-wide morbidity and mortality conference around COVID because the

382
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:52,319
response was, I think in many ways, everyone would agree a failure. You know, the COVID spread,

383
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:58,799
we had all these lockdown harms. At the same time, I think it has to be more than just a

384
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,200
formal evaluation.

385
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:09,000
I think there has to be a cultural movement that repudiates lockdown so that lockdown becomes a

386
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,140
dirty word. The same way we talk about nuclear war or chemical weapons, I think lockdown belongs in

387
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:26,599
the same category because it is a violation on a mass scale of basic civil rights, basic promises

388
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:30,779
that we make as a society to the poorest members and most vulnerable members of society.

389
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:39,640
It's a rupture in civilization. And we undertook it on the basis of fear and panic. That's what

390
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:44,059
makes it so hard to talk about. It's why you couldn't ask your premier about it. It's why

391
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:50,220
this censorship regime came up. It's also the reason why, how Tony Fauci was able to get away

392
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:56,119
with this propaganda campaign because of the fear. And we have to come to terms with the fact

393
00:32:56,119 --> 00:33:00,480
that there may be scary things that go on, but how do we as a society,

394
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:06,819
you're asking about leadership, it starts with that. It starts with a commitment by leadership

395
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:14,819
to never use those tactics again, to never create fear, to think about in the future when there is

396
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:21,779
fear, how should we respond courageously, intelligently, compassionately, so that we don't

397
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:28,619
jump to the nearest thing that we think will work, but forget about the poor, the vulnerable,

398
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:31,200
the working class, and all the harms that are caused.

399
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:37,920
By that resort to a strategy that seems fine when you're in a moral panic, but really isn't.

400
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,160
The other part to your world, Jay, you're an MD and a PhD in economics, both

401
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:49,539
gained at Stanford and clearly expertise in that. Well, I can't work out where the economists were

402
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:55,059
in all of this as someone that isn't my sphere either, but to literally print trillions of

403
00:33:55,059 --> 00:34:00,920
dollars here in Australia, we closed down everyone's business and then had to print

404
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:06,039
unprecedented amount of debt to go into when the opportunity was there, as you said,

405
00:34:06,099 --> 00:34:11,159
for focus projection, which would have fraction of the amount of money to look after the real

406
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,480
people who were vulnerable, the elderly, and we could have put so many resources into that

407
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:21,500
narrative and then let business continue and let people go back to school and all of those things.

408
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:25,980
I mean, was there any economists that you looked to and thought there's someone sounding the alarm

409
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:31,119
on how bad that was? There's a select few. I mean,

410
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:34,860
there's an excellent one in Australia, this woman named Gigi Foster, who was very brave,

411
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:41,519
actually spoke up to her great credit, although she got, I think, a lot of flack for it in

412
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:47,519
Australia. There were very few economists that spoke up about these harms early in the pandemic

413
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:52,800
and throughout, in fact, frankly, throughout the pandemic. Public health economics is not

414
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,420
only about the short term. In fact, policy that's aimed at the short term, if it has long-term costs

415
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,199
is bad policy.

416
00:35:01,219 --> 00:35:06,599
The inflation that we're facing, some of the economic problems, the supply chain disruptions

417
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:11,480
and so on they're facing, those are lockdown harms, long-term lockdown harms. Economists

418
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,300
should have been sounding the alarm almost from the beginning, but it was really difficult.

419
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:23,199
I'll tell you, I just kept my medical doctor hat on and my epidemiologist hat on. I didn't have my

420
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:29,500
economist hat on in large part because it was really hard if you're an economist to speak up.

421
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,199
It took moral courage to do that.

422
00:35:31,219 --> 00:35:36,619
It took moral courage to do so, I think, because you were going to be accused of valuing money over

423
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:43,619
lives. Even though what economists really care, I mean, like good economists, what we care about

424
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:48,360
is actually lives. We care about people not starving, people getting good medical care.

425
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:55,079
All of that requires a functioning economy. It's not dollars that were at stake. It wasn't dollars

426
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:00,460
versus lives. That was always not the right, that was a false dichotomy. It was always lives versus

427
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:00,960
lives.

428
00:36:01,219 --> 00:36:06,860
Right? So if we lock down, a certain set of people benefit from it. It's the laptop class,

429
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,559
the people who don't actually get harmed by locking down. But that's only in rich countries,

430
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:18,360
maybe 20, 30% of economies, maybe 20% of the economy. The rest of the people, they have to

431
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:23,659
work. They get exposed to the virus. You can see this enormous rich-poor divide in who got infected.

432
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,639
So you're not protecting all lives. You're only protecting a certain class of life,

433
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:30,780
laptop class is what I call them.

434
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:39,159
At the same time, you have these long-term consequences where if you have economic growth hit,

435
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:48,539
if you have inflation, people are going to die from that. Economic displacement, especially people

436
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,780
on the margin, is the difference between life and death. We already talked about the 80 million

437
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:59,500
people who starved or had dire food insecurities as a consequence of these lockdowns. Hundreds of

438
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,179
millions of people were thrown into lockdowns. They were thrown into lockdowns. They were thrown into

439
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:01,199
lockdowns. Hundreds of millions of people were thrown into lockdowns. They were thrown into

440
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:07,219
poverty worldwide. Even in rich countries, inflation means poor people are going to have

441
00:37:07,219 --> 00:37:13,260
trouble feeding their family, clothing their family. It's not true that we're all so rich

442
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:20,119
that we don't have to worry about these things. So it was always lives versus lives. It was always

443
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:25,960
lives versus lives. We as economists should have been brave enough to speak up, even when we were

444
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,960
being accused of being callous. When in fact, we're speaking for the poor,

445
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,340
the vulnerable, the working class, when we speak up and say, look, there are costs to this.

446
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:46,590
Yeah, the term excess deaths was one that was floated around the time, but you couldn't get

447
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:51,909
real information. As you said, it's lives versus lives. If you pull that lever and lock people down,

448
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:56,710
what is the consequence of lives on the other side? There wasn't a conversation. And I appreciate

449
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:02,510
having you. I want to move on in a moment to some questions around leadership. We're fascinated by

450
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:06,150
people like you who take great, courageous leadership stands and have done all your life.

451
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,250
Before I move on, I just want to say thank you so much for being here. I'm so happy to be here.

452
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:13,769
I just want to ask you, this may be a radical question in some ways, but have we demonized

453
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:19,809
viruses too much? I saw a TED talk the other day. Bill Gates is talking about his hope and

454
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:25,309
possibility to eradicate the flu and to live in a community, in a world where we don't have the flu.

455
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:31,010
I mean, again, no medical background, no scientific background, but to me, is that even a goal worth

456
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:36,210
chasing? I'm assuming we're carrying hundreds of viruses at a time, and that's part of how we

457
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,230
evolve and grow. I'm assuming that's part of how we evolve and grow. I'm assuming that's part of how

458
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:40,889
we grow. Do we need to recalibrate that conversation? And does that even make

459
00:38:40,889 --> 00:38:45,889
sense, the pursuit of not wanting to have a flu season? Well, I mean, I don't think it's not

460
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:52,269
possible. I don't know any way technically to do it because flu is carried by humans and also other

461
00:38:52,269 --> 00:38:58,949
animals. There's a very few set of viruses and pathogens. We have the technology or even the

462
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:03,989
possibility of eradicating. Smallpox is one of them that we actually touched the huge success,

463
00:39:03,989 --> 00:39:06,989
and that was worth doing because it was a deadly disease.

464
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:15,809
If you got it, it was spread very easily. It probably, in 1492, when it spread to the new

465
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:24,090
world, it killed off 95% of the indigenous population living there. So it has this long

466
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:29,050
history, but it only spread from humans to humans. And we had a fantastic vaccine, and still it took

467
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:35,789
almost a century to eradicate it, a concerted effort and work. Here we have viruses that are

468
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:37,230
spread very easily. We have a lot of viruses that are spread very easily. We have a lot of viruses

469
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:43,909
that have a consequence that's deadly for some group of people, but not for others. It spreads

470
00:39:43,909 --> 00:39:50,090
into animal vectors. You have to consider the harms and the benefits, not just simply say,

471
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:56,230
okay, it would be nice to do this. I think a project like Let's Eradicate the Flu or Eradicate

472
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:03,230
COVID would decimate civilization if we actually undertook it the way we did. Because smallpox,

473
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:07,050
it's a very different thing. You have a vaccine that actually stops transmission,

474
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:14,309
we don't have something like that for the flu or for COVID. It spreads to animals. Are you willing

475
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:21,369
to let your pets kill your pets if one of your pets gets COVID? I mean, that's a decision China

476
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:27,829
has made. Are we willing to do that? I mean, are you willing to separate newborns from moms?

477
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:34,389
You're going to have to do that if one of them has COVID. Are you willing to see vast numbers

478
00:40:34,389 --> 00:40:37,230
of poor people starve because of the virus? I think it's a very different thing. I think it's a

479
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:37,289
very different thing. I think it's a very different thing. I think it's a very different thing.

480
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:41,909
The kinds of lockdowns you're doing, who's going to keep society going? I mean, those are the kind

481
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:45,889
of questions you end up, when I think about, when I hear, let's try to eradicate the flu.

482
00:40:46,389 --> 00:40:49,590
And Bill Gates, maybe what he thinks about is, oh, well, we have this new technology,

483
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:59,610
let's use it. But it's not so simple. Society is very complicated. And I think even as a goal,

484
00:40:59,969 --> 00:41:06,750
it's a funny goal. We have a global society. We share germs with each other. That's just part of

485
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:12,429
it. In some ways, it's bad, because you get exposed to germs that could kill you. But in

486
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:19,550
other ways, that creates a less immune, naive population around the world. I can come to

487
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:26,190
Australia, you can come to the United States, and there's no real immunological danger, not truly

488
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:31,489
inherently. We can exchange ideas with each other in person, and we all benefit from it.

489
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:36,670
There's this, like, Sunetra Gupta has this idea that, like, because we have globalization,

490
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:43,070
we become more healthy, even by, even as we expose each other to germs, we teach each other

491
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:48,690
about our immune systems, about the germs that we saw, so that when we don't, when we see it when

492
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:55,050
we're younger, and we don't overreact to it when we're older, we don't have the kind of

493
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:00,530
immunological, naive population that is vulnerable to Christopher Columbus coming over and decimating

494
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:06,650
95% of the population of a vast continent, because of globalization. Do we really want to go backward

495
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,090
on that?

496
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:11,989
It's a complicated question. I mean, there are definitely diseases I would rather that humans

497
00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:17,329
never, never, never experienced, for sure. Polio, for instance, being one of them. We actually do

498
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:21,550
have the technology potentially to eradicate it. But I don't think that that's true for the flu,

499
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:25,510
and I don't think that's true for COVID. It's a great answer, because, as I said,

500
00:42:25,769 --> 00:42:31,710
it plays into that fear narrative, doesn't it? That, you know, a society of germophobes and,

501
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:36,630
you know, not wanting to interact with each other seems a big consequence for the annual flu season,

502
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,210
which we know,

503
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:40,909
people lose their lives. And you can't be flippant about that, because you always get

504
00:42:40,909 --> 00:42:45,809
then accused of being cold-hearted. But there is a logic to your conversation, if you take that

505
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:51,889
further. We're seeing great leaders, Jay, of a series of dimensions of leadership we think are

506
00:42:51,889 --> 00:42:57,070
common. I'd love to ask you about them. So please expand. We think all people who make great leaders

507
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:01,829
in the 21st century, like you, have a sense of self-leadership, first and foremost, before

508
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,789
they lead others. What does self-leadership mean to you?

509
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:07,820
Well, I mean,

510
00:43:08,539 --> 00:43:15,099
when I chose this profession, I invested my time and my energy into it for a reason. It wasn't

511
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:20,219
for self-agreement. I mean, it's fun to have a Stanford professorship, but that's really not

512
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:26,300
the purpose of it. Even if I was not very successful in publishing or whatever, I would

513
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:31,659
still be honored to be able to be in this profession. It means something to me. I chose it

514
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:37,340
for a reason. And if I'm not able to do it,

515
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:44,380
to the best of my ability, then what's my purpose? During the pandemic, it would have been very easy

516
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:53,440
to get grants just to forecast the cases. A lot of people did that. I could have just stayed silent

517
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,039
about the more controversial things, but it would have felt to me like a violation of my own

518
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:05,860
integrity. I didn't get in this business in order just to advance my career. I got in this business

519
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,219
because... I'll tell you, on my...

520
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:14,019
On my medical school application, I wrote about diarrhea in children. Turns out it's one of the

521
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:20,579
most common causes of childhood death. And you can prevent it or treat it with a very simple salt

522
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:26,420
solution. It costs pennies, oral rehydration. And when I first learned about this when I was

523
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:32,579
an undergrad, I was shocked that there were so many kids dying from want of a 3-cent salt solution.

524
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:37,219
I mean, so... I mean, to me,

525
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:43,659
that's the purpose of any career. How do I make the lives of other people better? And

526
00:44:43,659 --> 00:44:49,380
I don't... I just couldn't... I couldn't... I mean, I'd lost a lot of friends over this. I wish I

527
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:55,179
hadn't, but it... over my stance. And I wish I could get them back, or at least reconcile in

528
00:44:55,179 --> 00:44:59,800
some way, but I couldn't stay silent. Jay, so I can hear your values and your

529
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:05,059
purpose just emanating in all your words. If I pick up on that for a moment, it was friendship

530
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:06,900
changing for some of your colleagues. They couldn't...

531
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,739
align, or didn't want to have the conversation. Was that... was that a cost of your stance?

532
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:19,119
It was. So I have... I teach at Stanford University. 100 of my colleagues circulated

533
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:27,980
a secret petition in... about a year ago this time, where they asked the president of the

534
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:35,719
university to censor me. Because I had been in a public roundtable with the governor of Florida,

535
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:37,139
Governor DeSantis of Florida.

536
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:53,340
And he had asked me whether it was a wise idea for children to be masked, children as young as two years old to be masked. And I know the literature on this. There's no randomized evidence that that serves any purpose in reducing the spread of the disease.

537
00:45:53,340 --> 00:46:14,300
And the governor of Florida is asking me this. I'm a scientific advisor of his. It's televised. And just so everyone in Florida can see the advice the governor is getting. And so I told him what I had to say, which is that even though all the public health authorities are saying mask, mask, mask, even children as young as two, I knew that that was not normal.

538
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:23,300
First, there's no scientific evidence for it in terms of like high quality randomized studies, none. And that the World Health Organization has said, no.

539
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:36,179
Don't mask children under the age of six. So that's what I told the governor. Some of my colleagues heard this and thought that I was violating some public health norm by telling the public the fact, the scientific fact.

540
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:43,440
And they circulated a petition. And I looked at the list of signees of that petition. This petition asked the president of the university to censor me.

541
00:46:44,179 --> 00:46:52,860
And I looked on the list, included some friends of mine, really hurt to see. Friends that haven't talked to me in two years.

542
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:53,280
I just.

543
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:59,260
It's just been, it's been heartbreaking. But on the other hand, I have to say, I shouldn't, people shouldn't feel too bad for me.

544
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:06,320
I now have made a tremendous number of really, really amazing, I've met a lot of amazing people, made some deep friendships.

545
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:12,820
And I feel like I've been through a war. And, you know, when you're in a war, the people you're in the trenches with become friends for life.

546
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:15,360
And I've made some friends like that through the pandemic.

547
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:22,139
Thanks for sharing that. It's, you know, you can't imagine, you know, what that's like when you've contributed like you have.

548
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:23,179
But as you said, the.

549
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:29,599
The glass on half full on the other side, I'm sure there's lots of, as you said, connections that have happened as a result of it.

550
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,840
We see leaders are really conscious of how they positively impact others in their environment on a daily basis.

551
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,699
I mean, the Great Barrington Declaration was doing that on a global scale.

552
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:42,880
You can hear in your language that that's something you're conscious about, your sense of purpose.

553
00:47:43,219 --> 00:47:50,000
Have you got any examples, you know, just day to day, Jay, around what you try and do to impact others on a positive, in a positive way?

554
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:53,320
I, well, this has been hard during the pandemic.

555
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,420
Because it's been so isolating.

556
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:55,739
But I love students.

557
00:47:56,519 --> 00:47:58,079
I love talking to students.

558
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:04,079
I love, you know, actually, frankly, what I really like is asking them, why are they making the decisions they're making?

559
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:08,619
I like to push them to, like, think in that way.

560
00:48:08,659 --> 00:48:12,800
Just because what it does for them is then they're making choices that are better informed.

561
00:48:14,539 --> 00:48:18,219
And to me, I'll tell you, during the pandemic, I missed that.

562
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,019
Because a lot of, there was a lot of disconnection around that.

563
00:48:21,019 --> 00:48:22,780
But it was replaced by.

564
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:31,920
I mean, I can't count the number of people who have sent me kind emails of the Great Barrington Declaration when they see me on a podcast like this or a TV show, whatever.

565
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,019
People I've never met.

566
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,199
It's a really unique experience for me.

567
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:40,820
Because before the pandemic, I'd never written an op-ed, never been on TV, never really done a podcast.

568
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:48,739
And mostly I would interact with my students, who I loved, and other academics by writing academic papers.

569
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:53,199
To have the opportunity to touch people and reach people on such.

570
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:58,500
Global scale is really an opera, is a, it's an absolute honor.

571
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:07,800
And I've been mindful to try to use that as best I can to tell people what the evidence is from what I see.

572
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,179
And also to convey to people when I don't know what the evidence is, when we don't know.

573
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:16,559
I think a lot of times in a position like this, you get tempted to overstate.

574
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,900
And I've tried very hard not to do that, to tell people, yeah, here's what we know.

575
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:21,719
Here's what we don't know.

576
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:22,920
Brilliant.

577
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:29,039
It's a here that, uh, we talk about the leaders really conscious of how they create and share their vision.

578
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:37,260
And again, you know what you've done in recent times to get a million people around the world and 60,000, uh, fellow medical professionals.

579
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:44,099
I know that there were a lot that were scared off as well because of, uh, of what happened and the threats that were made.

580
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:50,519
I mean, can you tell us sort of the, what you went through and trying to get that vision out there and how you've gone about creating and sharing it?

581
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,280
Well, I've had to learn some new.

582
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:53,820
Skill set.

583
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:58,079
So like I was, I was love teaching, um, but I've never been on TV before.

584
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:05,780
I'd never written an op-ed before I tended to write before the pandemic, I would write, you know, 5,000 to 10,000 word densely argued with lots of figures.

585
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:12,280
And then, and then, and then I'd sit there arguing with referees who would like talk about the details and I had great fun doing it.

586
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,579
It was really enjoyable.

587
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:23,039
Um, I've learned, I've learned that you have to, uh, how to take arguments like that, get to the essence of it and convey it in a way that everybody can understand it.

588
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:31,139
Um, I've had to do it in context of both, both writing, uh, in, for, for very, very large audiences and newspapers and other places.

589
00:50:31,579 --> 00:50:39,599
Um, but also in the context of TV, like I've never had a three, try to get a professor to do a three minute TV hit.

590
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,619
It's, it's, uh, it's, I, I had to learn by fire.

591
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:50,920
Like the first time I did a three minute hit, I barely cleared my throat and the, you know, all your time's up.

592
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,559
I'm like, what, wait, wait, we just started.

593
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,719
So I've gotten better at that.

594
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,679
I think, uh, still not great at that, I think, but it's been, it's been interesting.

595
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:07,960
Um, but, but I found is that reaches people, it reaches people that you wouldn't otherwise reach and important people to reach, uh, regular people that, so you can help them make decisions in their own life.

596
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:11,139
Um, it's a powerful thing to be able to be able to do.

597
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,699
Uh, uh, I mean, you already know it from your, your experience firsthand.

598
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:17,659
I, I had to learn it, uh, sort of the hard way during the pandemic.

599
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:21,380
And I, it's just, it's been, uh, an honor to be able to be able to do that or learn how to do that.

600
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,179
Soundbite world of mainstream.

601
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,739
I'll come back to that.

602
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:29,340
Uh, curiosity is a word that we see leaders, uh, attribute to them a lot.

603
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,900
They're curious in their day to day world.

604
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:34,639
I mean, I'm sure that resonates with you.

605
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:36,559
How does curiosity show up for you?

606
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,139
And, and then people approach that through learning and development through their curiosity.

607
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,619
How does that word resonate with you?

608
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:47,440
Oh, I mean, I think for me, uh, well, I mean, I, I, I always thought of it as like a, as a, as a negative in my career.

609
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,360
I can't seem to stay on one topic.

610
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,119
Um, and in my career, I was like, I was got, I got normally.

611
00:51:53,280 --> 00:52:03,900
Like for scientists, if you pick one topic and become an expert or you put all your worth into that one topic, that's, that tends to lead to the biggest rewards because you publish in that topic.

612
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,400
Every, you grow your network in that topic.

613
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,019
And then, and then you're like, uh, you're, you know, the world expert for my career.

614
00:52:09,139 --> 00:52:14,780
All I, I would, I would very easily get distracted with other, like a lot of an MD in economic.

615
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:16,480
I have an MD and a PhD in economics.

616
00:52:16,659 --> 00:52:18,840
It doesn't seem like a really, it seems like strange.

617
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,480
I'm just curious about both of them.

618
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,239
Uh, why am I writing my infectious disease?

619
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,019
I've written about infectious disease for 20 years.

620
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:27,400
I just happened to be interested in it.

621
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:36,219
Uh, I, you know, I just, uh, there are like topics through my career and my life where I just, I just, I just got, I'm like, okay, this is, this sounds like a fascinating topic.

622
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:37,599
I had some insight into it.

623
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:39,559
I'd write about it and I'd go to the next topic.

624
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:45,659
And I would always wonder, like, why is it that I can't stay on one thing during the pandemic?

625
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:50,900
What I found was that I could tap into all of those things that seemed like one offs to me.

626
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,559
Like we're just, you know, little birdwalk.

627
00:52:53,280 --> 00:53:02,719
And I was like, okay, well, I've learned about, I wrote about HIV in Africa, uh, wrote a couple of papers in that, um, turned out it was really useful.

628
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:07,119
So I, cause I, cause I learned a lot about what life in Africa was like when I was writing about that.

629
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:18,840
Um, I, you know, I just, they're, they're like parts of my career that where I, I never understood why I worked on them other than curiosity that turned out during the pandemic to be really, really important to my thinking.

630
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,360
Um, I don't know.

631
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,139
I think that's the main thing about curiosity is it allows you.

632
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,500
Even when you don't know exactly why it, it enriches you.

633
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:31,420
It makes you, makes you prepared for things you don't even realize you're preparing for.

634
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:35,219
Uh, it's an amazing, uh, bit of evidence of how it showed up for you, isn't it?

635
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:42,400
To have the understanding, so many diverse areas and to have, uh, studied at the level that you had to bring that together.

636
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,300
It's, it's a great example of, of how curiosity works and then serves the greater community.

637
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,880
Uh, communicating with clarity is a dimension of leadership.

638
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,019
We talk about a lot.

639
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:53,260
And you mentioned having to, you know, from 10,000.

640
00:53:53,280 --> 00:54:00,940
Word pieces and defending them with, uh, with other professors to, to try to get, you know, three minutes and make an impact on that.

641
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,460
I mean, how, how have you gone about sort of your communication strategy?

642
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,860
Uh, it's, it's been a, it's been trial by fire actually.

643
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:14,739
Cause I I've, I've been on TV quite a bit, uh, which has been, um, I mean, like I said, an amazing, amazing privilege.

644
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:23,280
Uh, I think the, the key thing is I have to, I, I realized before it was so easy to get lost in the details that you probably.

645
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,559
You've heard it even in the earlier answers to this question.

646
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:46,739
Um, uh, but when you're doing this kind of large, wide scale communication, you have to find the essential argument and make it in a way so that everyone can understand it while still, I think, holding on to the core bit of it, not being dishonest in any way, not, not being at all trying to show people up.

647
00:54:46,739 --> 00:54:50,659
Like I'm, I know, well, it's something I don't know, being absolutely honest.

648
00:54:50,659 --> 00:54:53,239
Um, so finding the core.

649
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:59,159
A bit, being honest in the delivery of it, and then being clear around both of those, both of the, like what, you know, and don't know.

650
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:02,780
I think that's, that's what I've learned, uh, has been really important during this.

651
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:12,000
I, I don't, I don't really, I frankly, I've kept, I kept thinking people are gonna stop inviting me for, for a podcast and TV and all that, that that'll, that'll, that'll be proof.

652
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,800
The pandemic's over and that can go back to being, uh, being like a quiet professor again.

653
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:20,400
Um, I don't, I don't, I'm not in this to, to gain fame.

654
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,219
I don't, I, I think that's part of why I've, I've been able to.

655
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,659
To maintain my balance around this.

656
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:30,599
I, I, I'm happy when someone invites me to, to do a podcast or to, to be on TV or whatever.

657
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:32,219
It's an opportunity to reach an audience.

658
00:55:32,219 --> 00:55:41,980
I think is really important for me to reach, but it's not about my, you know, making money or I just, I take, I've taken no money at all for any of my TV appearances or podcasts or whatever.

659
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:52,420
I just, this is, this is about my working out my vocation, which for whatever reason happens to coincide with this, like some expertise about this global pandemic.

660
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:52,980
And

661
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:53,239
Jed,

662
00:55:53,239 --> 00:56:12,679
it occurred to me that for all of the people that attacked, uh, you and, and, uh, focus protection, that the idea to debate that, you know, if you really were so sound in, in your wisdom and, and, and that's the thing that's, you know, someone like Tony Fauci, five decades in the job making really big statements.

663
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:17,099
I mean, I'm sure you'd love to debate him around a panel.

664
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:21,900
I'm sure you've got colleagues and other experts that, you know, that to me struck me, someone in mainstream media.

665
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:23,179
Why don't,

666
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:25,539
you put these people together and hear the debate?

667
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:27,179
Let's, let's, let's get that out there.

668
00:56:27,219 --> 00:56:29,380
I mean, it was that offer ever made.

669
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,500
Did you, would you do that if it was there?

670
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,340
I would jump at the chance.

671
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,699
Uh, I've had the opportunity to debate a couple of folks.

672
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:41,500
Uh, uh, like there was a gentleman from Harvard, uh, Mark Lipsitch and some others, but never Tony Fauci.

673
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:47,480
Um, it's been hard actually within my own university to get people on the other side to debate me or discuss, discuss it with me.

674
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:50,480
I think the problem was this propaganda we discussed earlier.

675
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,119
Uh, the idea was that, uh,

676
00:56:53,239 --> 00:56:58,619
that I think Tony Fauci had was that there needed to be like this illusion of consensus.

677
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:09,079
If you allow there to be a debate between reasonable people where there's a disagreement between reasonable people, you can't maintain this illusion of consensus.

678
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:13,619
So the strategy has been to de-platform anyone who disagreed.

679
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,420
That was the purpose of the propaganda campaign.

680
00:57:17,099 --> 00:57:22,699
Um, and I think that that's why you haven't seen those kinds of reasonable disagreements, uh, reasonable debates.

681
00:57:22,699 --> 00:57:22,940
Even,

682
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:23,599
even as you,

683
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:24,500
as you said earlier,

684
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:24,820
when you,

685
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,320
you couldn't,

686
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,079
you couldn't even ask your,

687
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:27,440
your,

688
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,400
you have a very prominent role in trying to be where you have access to a prime minister.

689
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:32,539
You even,

690
00:57:32,539 --> 00:57:34,179
you got trouble asking that question,

691
00:57:34,179 --> 00:57:34,460
right?

692
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:39,800
Because they couldn't be this illusion that there was a legitimate question because if that,

693
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,880
if the legitimate question,

694
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,780
well then now you have to,

695
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,300
now you have to justify why you're doing these lockdowns.

696
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:46,099
You have to talk about the harms.

697
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,699
What if people don't agree with them all of a sudden?

698
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:49,719
They don't then comply.

699
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
What if those protests actually happen anyways?

700
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:52,840
Um,

701
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,659
I think,

702
00:57:53,659 --> 00:57:54,159
uh,

703
00:57:54,159 --> 00:58:00,099
it was a very illiberal kind of approach to communication by governments during the pandemic,

704
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,360
especially scientific bureaucracies during the pandemic and public health bureaucrats during the pandemic.

705
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,360
The idea was to eliminate the possibility of disagreement,

706
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,059
uh,

707
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:12,139
because they were so right that they couldn't possibly be anyone that disagreed with them reasonable.

708
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:12,800
That was,

709
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:13,059
that,

710
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:14,000
that was a problem.

711
00:58:14,059 --> 00:58:15,559
We can't never let that happen again.

712
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:16,099
And Jay,

713
00:58:16,099 --> 00:58:17,039
it's a great lead into that.

714
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:18,840
The final dimension I wanted to ask you about,

715
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,639
which we see leaders are really passionate more than ever about,

716
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:21,760
um,

717
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,760
collaboration.

718
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:27,300
And what happened was the reverse of that key decision makers shrunk cabinet.

719
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:35,820
They shrunk their advisors down to the barest minimum to avoid collaboration or didn't seek out experts like you to,

720
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:38,360
to collaborate with other public health officials.

721
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:38,619
They,

722
00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:40,059
they went the other way.

723
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:40,260
I mean,

724
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,719
how important is collaboration been for you and your work?

725
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,619
And can you give me some examples of how you collaborate?

726
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:45,760
Uh,

727
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,019
so,

728
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:46,300
I mean,

729
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,860
with it in science,

730
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:48,400
uh,

731
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,599
it's the era of like someone,

732
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:51,599
some lone genius,

733
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:56,599
working alone producing a revolution is likely over.

734
00:58:57,059 --> 00:58:58,260
It's too complicated.

735
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:02,199
There's too many fields where the technical expertise and demands are too high.

736
00:59:02,659 --> 00:59:06,760
Every single project of note that I've ever worked on every single project,

737
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:11,059
every single scientific events that I've seen in my scientific career has involved,

738
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:11,960
uh,

739
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:12,559
uh,

740
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:16,239
deep collaboration with people who had skills that I didn't have.

741
00:59:16,739 --> 00:59:18,539
And I sought them out because they were smarter than me.

742
00:59:18,539 --> 00:59:21,400
And I will always want to work with those people who have something to teach.

743
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:21,900
Me.

744
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:22,400
Um,

745
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,159
and that's how science works.

746
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:25,460
That's also how public health works.

747
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,460
The society is too complicated.

748
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:29,400
These diseases are too complicated.

749
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:37,860
You have to have people who know things that you don't know and be open to the fact that you don't know them in order to learn from them in order to make good decisions.

750
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:38,960
You're absolutely right.

751
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,659
What happened here was a small,

752
00:59:40,659 --> 00:59:42,460
relatively small cabal of people,

753
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:47,559
not more than a thousand people decided that they had the wisdom,

754
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:50,000
the collective wisdom to reorder all of society.

755
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:50,539
Um,

756
00:59:50,539 --> 00:59:55,139
in the world health organization and some public health bureaucracies around the world.

757
00:59:55,139 --> 00:59:58,239
And they worked very hard to make,

758
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:01,300
to make people think that they had that collective wisdom when they never did.

759
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:01,900
Uh,

760
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:08,000
it would have been much more productive if they had allowed a discussion with other people who disagreed with them to happen.

761
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,380
That's how science works best.

762
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:10,579
How public health works best.

763
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:11,440
Um,

764
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,840
and that we might have had,

765
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,539
we likely would have had a very different public health response.

766
01:00:15,539 --> 01:00:17,199
And I think we would have had much,

767
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:17,400
uh,

768
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,000
much more effective public health response,

769
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,199
a more compassionate one,

770
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:20,659
uh,

771
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:22,800
that would have ended up with fewer lives lost.

772
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:24,400
Joe,

773
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:24,639
we,

774
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:25,199
uh,

775
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:26,760
just veering off on that for a moment,

776
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:27,440
uh,

777
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,599
Sweden became a bit of an outlier in the global community because,

778
01:00:31,139 --> 01:00:31,360
you know,

779
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,760
you will know better than me,

780
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:36,599
but they seem to go closer to focus protection than anyone else.

781
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:37,699
And then they got attacked,

782
01:00:37,699 --> 01:00:38,400
uh,

783
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,340
globally for,

784
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,099
for this day.

785
01:00:40,099 --> 01:00:40,760
I mean,

786
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,440
if you look back at Sweden's approach,

787
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:42,599
Joe,

788
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:44,300
was it close to what you were,

789
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,900
you were aiming for?

790
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:46,199
I mean,

791
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:46,760
the early days,

792
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:46,900
they,

793
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:47,139
they,

794
01:00:47,139 --> 01:00:49,099
they did the opposite of folks protection.

795
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:49,599
Actually,

796
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:49,840
they,

797
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:50,239
they,

798
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:50,280
uh,

799
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:50,440
they,

800
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:54,500
there was a big outbreak of cases in Swedish nursing homes because they sent,

801
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:54,940
uh,

802
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,099
COVID infected patients to Swedish nursing homes,

803
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,500
a huge amount of reason,

804
01:00:58,539 --> 01:00:59,739
or here's the reason why,

805
01:01:00,039 --> 01:01:00,340
um,

806
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,940
Sweden was seen early on as,

807
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,380
as a failure was because of that.

808
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,239
A lot of older people died in those nursing homes.

809
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:05,780
But,

810
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:06,179
you know,

811
01:01:06,179 --> 01:01:06,380
uh,

812
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:06,739
the,

813
01:01:06,739 --> 01:01:07,039
the,

814
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:11,440
the amazing thing about the Swedish response to me was their flexibility.

815
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:12,579
Yeah.

816
01:01:12,579 --> 01:01:15,539
Cause what they did after that is they realized they had to protect older

817
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:19,239
people and they adopted policies to gain the trust of the

818
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:19,840
population.

819
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,239
Told the population,

820
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:22,639
look,

821
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:23,699
here's who's at risk.

822
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:25,280
They kept schools open,

823
01:01:26,199 --> 01:01:26,800
primary schools,

824
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,280
open the entire pandemic.

825
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,199
Their kids have no learning loss.

826
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,800
And that early loss in life in,

827
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:33,099
in,

828
01:01:33,099 --> 01:01:37,480
in older populations was offset over time as they had a more,

829
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:37,940
I mean,

830
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:38,179
it's not,

831
01:01:38,179 --> 01:01:40,739
they had no restrictions that when the disease was spreading,

832
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:41,039
they had,

833
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:41,980
they actually had,

834
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:42,780
uh,

835
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,139
suggested restrictions in mass gatherings.

836
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:45,699
For instance,

837
01:01:45,699 --> 01:01:48,139
they told people to stay home when they're sick and provided sick leave when

838
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:48,880
that was the case.

839
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:49,539
Um,

840
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,380
they were,

841
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:50,739
uh,

842
01:01:50,739 --> 01:01:50,940
uh,

843
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,139
in very short periods of time,

844
01:01:52,139 --> 01:01:52,599
they kept,

845
01:01:52,599 --> 01:01:52,880
uh,

846
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,039
older people home from,

847
01:01:54,039 --> 01:01:54,639
they think that,

848
01:01:54,639 --> 01:01:54,840
uh,

849
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:55,480
older,

850
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:55,940
older,

851
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:56,139
like,

852
01:01:56,139 --> 01:01:56,440
uh,

853
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,480
like high school kids,

854
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:58,639
I think miss some,

855
01:01:58,639 --> 01:01:59,340
some schooling.

856
01:01:59,679 --> 01:01:59,980
Um,

857
01:02:00,039 --> 01:02:01,239
so it's not that they had no,

858
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:02,139
no mistakes,

859
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:02,579
uh,

860
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:05,280
but they were adapting and they were admitted their mistakes in the

861
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:05,940
population.

862
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,500
They didn't try to create this sense of that.

863
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,079
There was no debate.

864
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:09,840
Um,

865
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:10,539
and,

866
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:10,800
uh,

867
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,000
the population trusted them.

868
01:02:12,179 --> 01:02:13,539
And when the vaccines came,

869
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:14,179
um,

870
01:02:14,179 --> 01:02:14,699
they,

871
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:15,139
you know,

872
01:02:15,139 --> 01:02:18,179
what the Europe actually was somewhat slow in getting the vaccines out

873
01:02:18,179 --> 01:02:19,239
relative to the United States,

874
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:20,679
although much faster than Australia.

875
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:21,340
Um,

876
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:25,940
and they systematically use the vaccines to protect their old population

877
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:26,739
first.

878
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:29,300
So there was a big spring wave in 2021,

879
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:30,880
but they'd already vaccinated their old.

880
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,500
And so there are a lot of cases in Sweden in 20 or in

881
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:34,800
April,

882
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:35,579
2021,

883
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,599
but very few deaths per capita.

884
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,699
They D because of the vaccine.

885
01:02:40,199 --> 01:02:40,539
Um,

886
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,039
and so they use these focus protection ideas to get a much

887
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:43,579
better result.

888
01:02:43,579 --> 01:02:44,679
And through the whole pandemic,

889
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:48,079
they actually have negative excess mortality,

890
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,000
negative,

891
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:49,199
excess mortality,

892
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:49,239
excess mortality,

893
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:50,679
excess mortality through the pandemic.

894
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:51,739
Just think,

895
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,320
imagine that.

896
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:52,579
I mean,

897
01:02:52,659 --> 01:02:53,380
Australia,

898
01:02:53,619 --> 01:02:54,000
actually,

899
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,559
I was looking at the statistics,

900
01:02:56,199 --> 01:02:56,380
uh,

901
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,139
up until,

902
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,099
until maybe,

903
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,099
uh,

904
01:02:59,099 --> 01:02:59,780
let's say,

905
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:00,340
uh,

906
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:01,300
uh,

907
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:02,559
April of 2022,

908
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,260
you had negative excess mortality,

909
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:05,420
but over the last,

910
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:06,619
essentially the,

911
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:07,659
over the last few months,

912
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:11,340
you've had an enormous weight of cases and huge neck of

913
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,440
excess mortality.

914
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,239
In 2021,

915
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,880
Australia had positive excess mortality,

916
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:18,320
even though there was no COVID.

917
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:27,860
I think if the world had followed Sweden's leadership in this,

918
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:30,539
we would have all come out much better off both in terms of

919
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:32,940
COVID and in terms of the harm that we've done to,

920
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:33,280
uh,

921
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,679
to societies as a consequence of the lockdown policies we've

922
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,039
followed.

923
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,900
So Joe to understand just quickly,

924
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,820
the Australian excess mortality,

925
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,599
what's now coming into play is all the people that didn't seek

926
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:44,480
medical treatment,

927
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:44,920
all of,

928
01:03:45,139 --> 01:03:46,579
so that's all cause mortality,

929
01:03:46,579 --> 01:03:46,840
isn't it?

930
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:47,539
People that are losing their lives.

931
01:03:47,539 --> 01:03:47,559
Yeah.

932
01:03:47,559 --> 01:03:47,619
Yeah.

933
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:47,659
Yeah.

934
01:03:47,659 --> 01:03:47,699
Yeah.

935
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:47,719
Yeah.

936
01:03:47,719 --> 01:03:47,780
Yeah.

937
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:47,860
Yeah.

938
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:47,960
Yeah.

939
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:48,019
Yeah.

940
01:03:48,019 --> 01:03:48,039
Yeah.

941
01:03:48,039 --> 01:03:48,059
Yeah.

942
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:48,099
Yeah.

943
01:03:48,099 --> 01:03:48,119
Yeah.

944
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:48,179
Yeah.

945
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:48,719
Yeah.

946
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:48,920
Yeah.

947
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:48,980
Yeah.

948
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:49,039
Yeah.

949
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:49,199
Yeah.

950
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:53,679
Yeah.

951
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:53,719
Yeah.

952
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:55,139
Yeah.

953
01:03:55,139 --> 01:03:55,219
Yeah.

954
01:03:55,219 --> 01:03:55,260
Yeah.

955
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:55,300
Yeah.

956
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:55,400
Yeah.

957
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,840
It's,

958
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:00,039
it's still hard to disentangle.

959
01:04:00,219 --> 01:04:00,280
Uh,

960
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,699
the data are still being developed.

961
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,980
I have not seen a clean study that nails that issue as yet.

962
01:04:05,139 --> 01:04:07,239
So I don't know with any certainty with that,

963
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,900
but if it's like anywhere else in the world,

964
01:04:10,199 --> 01:04:13,579
those kinds of considerations will have consequences in lives

965
01:04:13,579 --> 01:04:14,400
lost in Australia.

966
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:15,440
But at the same time,

967
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,960
like Australia vaccinated a lot of large part of its

968
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:18,000
population.

969
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:25,260
population, a lot of the vaccination happened nine, 10, 11, not nine, you know, quite a long

970
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:32,019
time ago. And so when the virus swept through the population in Australia, you know, Australia has

971
01:04:32,019 --> 01:04:38,099
more cases per capita through the whole pandemic than the United States has. So there was a lot of

972
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:44,619
a lot of people who were exposed to the virus and their vaccines, you know, so the protection

973
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:49,420
of the vaccine provides against disease spread had already expired. That's why you've had such

974
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:55,659
a widespread number of cases. Even the protection against severe disease, it started to wane in some

975
01:04:55,659 --> 01:05:03,400
of the older people. So it's both COVID deaths and also deaths from the lockdowns combining

976
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:09,420
in Australia to produce very high total excess deaths. There's two final questions to ask you,

977
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:14,539
but I've got to ask you one before I do that. And that is, you clearly, you know,

978
01:05:14,539 --> 01:05:14,599
the COVID-19 pandemic has been a big part of the pandemic. And I think it's a big part of

979
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:14,619
the pandemic. I think it's a big part of the pandemic. I think it's a big part of the pandemic.

980
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:20,599
The vaccines are something you're passionate about on a world scale. But the idea of mandating

981
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:26,400
vaccines, where did you sit on that? I think it was an enormous error. When a public health

982
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:31,239
authority mandates a vaccine, that is an admission of failure. It's an admission of failure because

983
01:05:31,239 --> 01:05:36,440
public health, when it works best, it has the trust of the population. And so when it has the

984
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:40,260
population, the public health authorities can say, you know, this is a really good idea. Here's what

985
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:44,599
we know. Here's what we don't know. If you're older, here's what the risks are. But

986
01:05:44,599 --> 01:05:49,800
here's the benefits. They're really good. You should get vaccinated. And then people listen

987
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:55,380
because they trust the public health authorities. When you're doing a mandate, not only is a signal

988
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:59,019
of distrust, like I don't trust the public, therefore I have to force you to do this.

989
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:06,539
It also creates distrust reciprocally. It creates this resistance movement by people who are like

990
01:06:06,539 --> 01:06:09,940
saying, well, you know, I'm not sure it's good for me. Why are you being forcing me to do this

991
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:13,880
if you think it's good for me? Why don't you just explain to me what's going on? It's created this.

992
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:14,480
And so,

993
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:17,500
I think that's what's happened. I've seen in the United States and elsewhere,

994
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:24,599
an expansion in the set of people who distrust public health. And now we're distrusting good

995
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:31,059
advice from public health, a reduction in vaccination of children against really deadly

996
01:06:31,059 --> 01:06:36,539
diseases like polio, like measles. And we're seeing a resurgence of cases, for instance,

997
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:43,360
in polio that actually would make quite a bit of progress toward eradicating. It's a real problem.

998
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:49,360
And I think the mandates, they were premised on the idea that it was necessary to vaccinate

999
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:52,840
80, 90% of the population and then the disease would go away.

1000
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:58,860
We never had the evidence to say that that was going to be true. The vaccine does not stop

1001
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:03,460
disease spread. It's very clear. I mean, why else would Australia, for instance, which is so heavily

1002
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:08,579
vaccinated, have such a large number of cases? I mean, I got the vaccine in April of 2021 and I

1003
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:12,940
got COVID in August of 2021. Which was the opposite of the public health message, Jay,

1004
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:19,079
you take this to save the lives of those around you. So again, the evidence that you're telling

1005
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:26,099
is completely the opposite to the actuality. And again, that just leads to further distrust,

1006
01:07:26,199 --> 01:07:29,900
doesn't it? And the message was there that if you caught coronavirus naturally,

1007
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,000
recovered from it naturally, that your antibodies weren't effective as well. That was another

1008
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:40,860
message that for the first time in history, your own nervous system and immune system wasn't

1009
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:43,340
working. So it's, you know, again, it's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

1010
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:47,000
again, as you said, that creates distrust, doesn't it? It doesn't allow for it in.

1011
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,880
They could have used the vaccine for focus protection, just like Sweden did.

1012
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:54,360
Vaccinate older people who are really at high risk of dying. And then

1013
01:07:54,360 --> 01:08:01,119
to be honest with the public that this is the best we can do, really. Don't try to force people who

1014
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:05,940
have very low benefit from the vaccine to get vaccinated on the false premise that my vaccine

1015
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:09,539
protects you when it doesn't. And the evidence from the world around the world is clear that

1016
01:08:09,539 --> 01:08:13,179
it doesn't. It was manipulative and wrong. It's created distrust that it's going to be

1017
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:20,000
to repair. I see your story as one of the great leadership stories in recent times and, you know,

1018
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:25,600
to stand up and say, I am prepared to give up my working life. I'm prepared for the consequences

1019
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:31,699
because my principles and my values suggest that this is greater than the consequences. It takes

1020
01:08:31,699 --> 01:08:35,579
incredible courage and leadership. And in that context, I want to ask you, who's been the

1021
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:43,130
greatest leader in your life? Oh, there's so many. I mean, I've had mentors that

1022
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:43,670
have been great leaders. I've had mentors that have been great leaders. I've had mentors that

1023
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:45,010
have been great leaders. I've had mentors that have been great leaders. I've had mentors that have been

1024
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:50,529
great in academics. One of them is like now the head of, he's the provost at Harvard now,

1025
01:08:51,069 --> 01:08:59,229
who was a big example to me through my career. But I have to say, in the context of, and of course,

1026
01:08:59,289 --> 01:09:08,010
my parents, I mean, it's impossible to not think of them. But I think during the context of this

1027
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:14,090
pandemic, the two other authors of the Great Barongton Declaration, Sunetra Gupta and Martin

1028
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:14,989
Kuhldorf have paid an important price to be the leaders of theOC. And I think that's a very

1029
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:21,170
enormous price for their leadership, even more than me, I think, in many ways. Martin was let

1030
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:28,489
go from his job at Harvard, actually. He's now on leave, I think. And he was willing to sacrifice

1031
01:09:28,489 --> 01:09:37,489
that. Sinatra also faced tremendous threats to her career, to her personal life, and didn't need to

1032
01:09:37,489 --> 01:09:43,270
speak up, but both did. And I've been absolutely inspired by them. Another colleague of mine at

1033
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:48,710
Stanford is a man named Johnny Yanidis, who is probably the world's most famous scientist,

1034
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:55,770
well, certainly the world's most cited scientist, who, again, spoke up early and has continued to

1035
01:09:55,770 --> 01:10:00,369
do amazing work. I think he's published like 70 papers during the pandemic, much more quiet in

1036
01:10:00,369 --> 01:10:07,970
terms of public presence, but has done tremendous work to do the science that has informed a lot of

1037
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:12,550
the thinking on lockdowns, on a whole range of issues.

1038
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:19,289
And I looked at those folks as tremendous leaders, all in their own different ways,

1039
01:10:19,829 --> 01:10:27,930
in intellectual leadership, in moral leadership. And I'm Christian, too, so I think those

1040
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:34,710
commitments have provided, to me, a real example of what it means to sacrifice and why that kind

1041
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:38,670
of sacrifice is. I've learned it firsthand. I've been more theoretical before the pandemic,

1042
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:43,250
why that kind of sacrifice is important. Yeah, thanks for sharing that again. And we saw lots

1043
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:48,550
of medical professionals here in Australia that were silenced and threatened to be disbarred for

1044
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:53,710
wanting to enter the public debate like you did. And so, again, it's a massive sacrifice of

1045
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:58,890
leadership to do that. Final question, Joe, for me, in the sense of collaboration,

1046
01:10:59,189 --> 01:11:03,149
we're passionate about it and the leadership work that we do. If you could collaborate with

1047
01:11:03,149 --> 01:11:07,229
anyone in the world, and you've done that with your great colleagues in other extraordinary

1048
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:12,229
academic institutions, is there someone you think, God, if I could collaborate with them on any area,

1049
01:11:12,229 --> 01:11:12,989
there's lots of diverse...

1050
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:15,529
Passions that you've got. Is there anyone that springs to mind?

1051
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:21,350
I mean, at this point, I've been now exposed to some incredible scholars.

1052
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:30,529
My passion now is, in addition to the postmortem about the lockdowns and a good discussion about

1053
01:11:30,529 --> 01:11:37,109
that so that we don't do this again, I want to talk about how to reform science. And science

1054
01:11:37,109 --> 01:11:42,829
is broken. What's happened during the pandemic is the normal processes where we can talk to each

1055
01:11:42,829 --> 01:11:42,989
other.

1056
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:48,310
We can talk to scientists and we learn from each other. That's really broken. The trust that's

1057
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:52,229
needed for scientists to have good faith conversations in many ways has been broken.

1058
01:11:52,289 --> 01:11:58,810
I want to help restore that. The other thing is a conversation I'd like to have with many leaders

1059
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:08,989
I've met about what role should science play in society, right? So, do I really have the wisdom

1060
01:12:08,989 --> 01:12:13,149
to order society? I think my view is that scientists should be...

1061
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:20,189
We should be on top, not on top. We should be advising. And so, I want to work with political

1062
01:12:20,189 --> 01:12:27,130
leaders. Ron DeSantis, I think, is an amazing man, actually, the governor of Florida. I've been so

1063
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:32,750
impressed by him in his leadership. I would love to work together with political leaders, with

1064
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:37,130
faith leaders, so that we can have a conversation about what place should science have, and with

1065
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:43,250
scientists, what place should science have in society? Are we willing to replace our liberal

1066
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:49,149
democracies with a technocracy? I mean, that's essentially what we've had. We've had a few

1067
01:12:49,149 --> 01:12:54,069
scientific leaders order society the last two and a half years. Was that a good idea or a bad idea?

1068
01:12:54,409 --> 01:12:59,369
I think that's a conversation I'd love to collaborate with many people I've met in the

1069
01:12:59,369 --> 01:13:03,069
pandemic, and not just scientists, because that's an all-society conversation.

1070
01:13:03,649 --> 01:13:08,229
What a fascinating final answer. And as you said, science is broken, and to be able to have these

1071
01:13:08,229 --> 01:13:13,250
discussions and highlight them, and for you to want to bring that back to the table,

1072
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:17,789
I can't help it. It's always a supplementary question to me. There is an old saying,

1073
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:22,229
when you look at something and you sound a bit like a conspiracy, follow the money. Is science

1074
01:13:22,229 --> 01:13:30,210
broken because of the money, and that people are so incentivized to not want to debate? Is that

1075
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:34,210
something that needs to be overcome, that the institutions that make billions and billions

1076
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:40,270
out of these decisions have got such a stranglehold on science? Or am I being naive? Is that being a

1077
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:42,970
small part of it? No, it's not that I'm an economist. Of course,

1078
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:47,949
money is an important driver of human behavior. So I'm not disagreeing with that, but I don't

1079
01:13:47,949 --> 01:13:53,210
think that's the central problem. I think the central problem is one of power. During the

1080
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:59,890
pandemic, it became clear that if you were an epidemiologist, immunologist, or virologist,

1081
01:13:59,949 --> 01:14:06,250
you have tremendous power over the minds of billions and the fates of billions. And that

1082
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:12,590
created a lot of dysfunction within science itself. It created incentives for climbing

1083
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:13,250
a social ladder. It created incentives for climbing a social ladder. And I think that's

1084
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:16,409
the central problem. And I think that's the central problem within science. I think it's

1085
01:14:16,409 --> 01:14:20,510
like it's the, what is it Lord Atkins said, like power corrupts absolutely, power corrupts

1086
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:26,250
absolutely, right? I think that that is the central problem within science. It's become

1087
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:35,090
such a powerful tool to reorder society that it has undermined the kinds of mechanisms that

1088
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:39,130
would normally allow it to gain that power to begin with. They gain that power because it

1089
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:43,250
produces wisdom. It produces knowledge. And that knowledge and wisdom comes from,

1090
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:49,930
from a liberal willingness and a good faith discussion with other people. But by being so

1091
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:54,470
successful, it created this power that then under has undermined the capacity to have that good faith

1092
01:14:54,470 --> 01:15:02,670
discussion. So there's this like, there's this sort of, sort of, it's, it, the success that it

1093
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:11,210
had in producing vaccines and producing knowledge has itself created the conditions that have

1094
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:13,250
undermined it. So I think it's, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a,

1095
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:18,850
it's worse than just money. It's something deep within science itself that we as scientists need

1096
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:24,810
to come to terms with and, and develop guardrails around. So we don't, don't have this, this, this,

1097
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:30,409
this sort of over overarching hubris that is, that you've seen from scientists, I think during the

1098
01:15:30,409 --> 01:15:36,369
pandemic. Science on tap, not on top is a, is a brilliant message. And your, your, your art of

1099
01:15:36,369 --> 01:15:42,170
condensing your theories is, is clearly becoming a great skill as well. Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, it's

1100
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:43,229
been a, a fascinating talk. Thank you so much. Thank you.

1101
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:47,109
Fascinating. I've got a hundred more questions, but in the interest of time,

1102
01:15:47,229 --> 01:15:51,289
I appreciate you sharing with us some of your wisdom. And thanks again so much for

1103
01:15:51,289 --> 01:15:54,170
an incredible leadership stance and incredible leadership story.

1104
01:15:54,909 --> 01:15:56,729
Thank you. It was a real pleasure to talk with you.
