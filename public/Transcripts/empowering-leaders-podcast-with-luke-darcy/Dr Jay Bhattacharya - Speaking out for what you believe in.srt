00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:11,740
This week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,699
medical professor who stood up to the narrative of fear that was sweeping the globe at the

3
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,079
very start of the pandemic.

4
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,539
His advocacy for focused protection in opposition to the crippling lockdowns that were imposed

5
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:28,519
by public health officials was a courageous stance that cost him lifelong friends and

6
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,420
criticism from the US medical establishment.

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,899
I found this conversation to be incredibly insightful.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,460
What does trusting the science actually mean?

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,759
His powerful collaboration with medical professionals around the world to rebuild trust in science

10
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,299
to allow open debate and dialogue is inspiring.

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,740
His courage and leadership is a story you really want to hear.

12
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:53,240
A conversation I loved and it ties in very closely with the passion that I have for the

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,359
work that we're doing at Alita.

14
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,859
If you're motivated to improve or start your leadership journey, we'd love you to check

15
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,399
out our Alita Connect signature.

16
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,299
Alita Connect is a program which brings leaders together from sport, industry, social

17
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:09,579
venture, education and the arts into bespoke facilitated forums where leaders are coming

18
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:13,819
together to connect, to learn and to share in what we think is a pretty life-changing

19
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:14,180
way.

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:32,239
Dr. Jay Bhattacharya is a professor of Stanford University Medical School, a physician, epidemiologist,

21
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,439
health economist and public health policy expert focusing on infectious diseases and

22
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,420
vulnerable populations.

23
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:39,420
In October 2020...

24
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,180
At the height of communities being locked down around the world, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya

25
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,299
and his colleagues, Dr. Martin Kuldoff, who's the professor of medicine at Harvard University

26
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:55,620
with expertise in detecting and monitoring infectious disease outbreaks, and Dr. Sunetra

27
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,879
Gupta, professor at Oxford University, also an epidemiologist with expertise in immunology

28
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:06,560
and mathematical modelling of infectious disease, together co-authored the Great Barrington

29
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,180
Declaration.

30
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,139
The declaration received 60,000 signatures.

31
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:15,379
Support from other doctors, nurses and health professionals, and close to a million signatures

32
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:16,319
from the wider community.

33
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,379
The Great Barrington Declaration called for focused protection for those most at risk,

34
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,060
identified as the elderly with underlying health issues, while those in the not vulnerable

35
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:32,080
category should resume life as normal, returning to school, to work, playing sport, etc., with

36
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,919
simple hygiene measures encouraged, like staying at home while sick and washing hands.

37
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:39,800
Jay, it's an incredible leadership story to stand up.

38
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,379
In what was one of the most unique times in human history in the last 100 years, I really

39
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:45,379
appreciate you joining me today.

40
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,780
Oh, my pleasure.

41
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,860
Thank you for having me.

42
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,979
Jay, around 2020, in January, most of us around the world started to hear about this virus,

43
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:57,000
the coronavirus, COVID-19, that was emanating from China.

44
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,900
As one of the world's leading experts in the space, early on, you conducted a couple of

45
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,960
really specific studies to determine how dangerous COVID-19.

46
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:09,199
Can you tell us what you did way back then and what you found so early on?

47
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:17,199
Sure. So the key idea was that, well, let me just, let me step back to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic,

48
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,080
because that's where some of the ideas I had early on came from.

49
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:25,759
So is that the swine flu, Jay? Is that the H1N1 is a swine flu? Yeah.

50
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,740
Exactly. Swine flu. So there, there were very, early on, there were very, very high death rates

51
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:37,139
reported. The key catch there was that they would, identifying patients who were very sick with the

52
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:39,780
swine flu, and then they would like calculate what fraction of them,

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,860
recovered. And, you know, it was, the death rate was high. The problem was that, in fact,

54
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,039
there were a lot of people who had gotten the swine flu that never got really sick and never

55
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:55,319
came to the medical attention. And those were not captured. There were a whole bunch of studies that

56
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:03,099
were done of antibodies to the swine flu later in the pandemic, in that pandemic, which found that

57
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:09,219
a hundred times more people had been infected than actually become severe cases. And so the death

58
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:09,780
rate went from zero to a hundred times more people had been infected than actually become severe cases.

59
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:17,439
From three, four, five, six percent to something like 0.01 percent, 99.99% survival. So I had very

60
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,920
early on the same thought here. I was like, okay, well, maybe what if this is a highly infectious

61
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,540
respiratory virus? What if it's spread really rapidly, even outside of our knowledge, it's

62
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,279
producing some really, really sick patients, but maybe it's also produced some mild disease that

63
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,420
hasn't come to medical attention. And so early on in the pandemic, I ran two studies of antibodies

64
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,560
looking for evidence that people have been infected. And, and,

65
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:44,399
and, but never came to medical attention in Santa Clara County, California, where I live,

66
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:50,060
and in Los Angeles County, just south of where I live. And what we found was that, and that was

67
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,720
true. It was, it was in fact, 50 times more infections than cases. Now it turns out it's

68
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,560
much more deadly than swine flu. So this disease had a death rate in the population at large of

69
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:09,639
about 0.2%, 99.8%, 20 times more deadly than swine flu. But it also had a very steep age

70
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:15,160
gradient. Older people had a very high risk of death from this, four, five, 6%, if you're above

71
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,079
80, 80, 80 years old, whereas children have a vanishingly small risk of death from this,

72
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:29,480
you know, pretty close to zero, you know, on the order of the flu or less. And so that meant that

73
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,160
there was very different risk categories, old people, high risk, young people, much less so.

74
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,560
So that, that was the main study I did early on that. So the death rate was one thing that

75
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:39,620
came out of it. And so I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

76
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:47,560
there's two other lessons really important. If I can be really brief. One is that 3% of the

77
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,019
population in April, 2020 in Santa Clara County in California had the disease, had antibodies to

78
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:58,160
the disease. 3%, doesn't sound like a big number, but it's already too late to go to zero. That

79
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,660
means it's already, the horse is out of the barn. You're not going to be able to stop the disease

80
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:07,319
from spreading. It's a highly infectious disease. So a policy that aimed at zero was going to fail

81
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,480
just based on that study alone. You knew that.

82
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:15,879
And the second thing is 3% is not a lot of the populations. There's still like a very large

83
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:19,459
fraction of the population to go. It was going to be a long epidemic. And we knew that just from

84
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:24,360
that study. And Jay, there, you know, pretty crucial bits of information you would have

85
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,040
thought in terms of setting public policy on the back of that to say, Hey, this isn't a mortality

86
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,360
rate, you know, 3% because that would be alarming and the modeling would be off the charts. And we

87
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,399
were shown a lot of that modeling early days that predicted extraordinary, you know,

88
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:44,300
death rates. And then as you said, to really establish pretty quickly that the idea of

89
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,560
actually trying to chase COVID zero was just an impossibility and not something that was ever

90
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,639
going to be achieved. I suppose what happened, Jay, from there was that the public health message

91
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,399
and the fear went into overdrive. And, you know, I'm talking to you from the city of Melbourne. I

92
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:03,560
know you've been here before and given lectures. You're on your way back to Melbourne, Australia

93
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,300
to give some more lectures on this, but we can't forget some of the language that was

94
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,379
sent our way.

95
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:14,060
In the cities that we live in, I can remember a public health official talking about this virus

96
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,879
will creep in through your window. It will get you at night when you're asleep. Insidious,

97
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,480
virulent, deadly. We had grim-faced public health officials every day telling us of daily

98
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,399
case numbers and really just that the language became incredibly fear-driven.

99
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,000
As you said, if you flip that potentially and use the evidence, and there were hundreds of

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,300
studies done like you did to confirm that your Santa Clara study was accurate. And

101
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:44,139
you know, in fact, that was very quickly established as being what was going on. You could

102
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:49,980
have said and stood in front of people as a public health and said 99.98% of you are going to survive

103
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,379
this virus. There was another message to be had. Why did fear win the day in your mind, Jay?

104
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:00,540
Well, so yes, like they could have, I wouldn't have said 99.8. I would have said if you're old,

105
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,019
there's this high risk. It's a deadly disease. Be careful. If you're young,

106
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:09,339
live your life. The virus is the least of your problems or not, you know, not the top of your top,

107
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:13,899
but shouldn't top the list of your problems. But I'll say this, I think the fear-based messaging

108
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:19,540
in around the world was terrible. It was an unethical breach of public health norms. Normally,

109
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:24,939
you provide, the goal of public health is to provide people with tools to cope with that fear,

110
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:31,639
not to stoke it. And I saw in Australia, that was, it was, I mean, it was pretty bad in the U.S.,

111
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:38,120
I have to say, but it was even worse in Australia. I saw some advertisements of, you know, young

112
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,179
person, like a young,

113
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:44,299
active woman in an ICU bed who couldn't breathe, you know, the TV ad that was aired all through

114
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:50,460
Australia from public health. A lot of that, I think, stemmed from this idea that people

115
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,960
weren't going to take the disease seriously enough unless they were scared. That became

116
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:04,919
an official sort of policy of public health. And it, in part, you really did need something

117
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,259
like that if you were going to impose lockdowns on a population. Essentially,

118
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,620
what public health was asking people to do was to put aside all of the other priorities in their

119
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,480
life, their kids' schooling, if they had cancer, don't go get cancer, don't go get treatment,

120
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:23,659
if you have, don't get screened for cancer, put aside your medical priorities, put aside,

121
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:29,620
close your businesses, don't go to church or your synagogue, don't, essentially, to put aside all

122
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,860
the other priorities in your life in order to avoid this single infectious disease. The only

123
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,100
way you can really get compliance with that is if people are really scared for,

124
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,720
especially for an extended period of time. And it's a powerful weapon, fear, isn't it?

125
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,860
Because it's very hard to reverse. Once people have established that in their brain, it becomes,

126
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:53,639
even then, when you hear educated and world-renowned experts like you speak in a balanced

127
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,700
way about this with proper evidence and produce it, people then don't really want to hear that

128
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:06,580
message. And I suppose going back to your leadership, to stand up and the Great Barrington

129
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,320
Declaration, can you tell, I suppose, was that your response?

130
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:14,059
To the public fear? Can you tell us about how it emanated and what it was about?

131
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,860
Sure. So if you, just to take you back, in Australia, the lockdowns you all did actually,

132
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:28,139
it actually worked in one sense, like in early, the early lockdowns actually did reduce cases to

133
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:34,639
zero on the island. In the United States, they hadn't worked, but the cases have come down.

134
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,799
And in the summer of 2020, there wasn't the, the fear had started to subside.

135
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,320
And there was a lot of fear. And there was a lot of fear. And there was a lot of fear.

136
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,659
And there was a sense of maybe we weren't going to need to lock down again.

137
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:47,860
In fact, I remember talking to some colleagues in Australia who were like, look, we've conquered

138
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,100
the disease. Our life is normal. There's no restrictions at all. Although there were still

139
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,759
restrictions over here. In Australia, that was partly because you were in the Southern

140
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:03,539
Hemisphere. The disease arrived in your summer. It's a seasonal disease, very clearly. It arrived

141
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:08,639
in the Northern Hemisphere in the winter. It's more easily, more easily spread in the winter.

142
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:15,179
So it put Australia and much of the rest of the world on different paths.

143
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:24,620
In the United States, in September, October, there was a lot of concern about kids spreading

144
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:31,700
the disease in schools. It was really becoming clear to me that the summer sense that the disease

145
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:38,799
was under control had gone away and that people wanted to have lockdowns again. My kids, for

146
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:45,559
example, were not in person in school for a year and a half. And the idea of the lockdown as a way

147
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:51,919
to control the disease, it sort of entrenched itself in public health. But I knew from talking

148
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:58,179
to some of my colleagues and some of my friends that there was a lot of concern, both about the

149
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:03,779
harms of the lockdown on young people and also the ability of the lockdowns to actually control

150
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:06,740
the spread of the disease. It wasn't universal.

151
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,919
Some government officials have tried to create this impression that every credible person thought

152
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:20,960
the lockdown's the only way. I knew for a fact that wasn't true. In October of 2020, I was invited

153
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,940
to this small conference in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, where, that's why I've got the

154
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:33,419
Great Barrington name, Martin Kulldorff, who's a Harvard, as you mentioned, a Harvard epidemiologist

155
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,360
and biostatistician, and Sunetra Gupta were both, there was the three of us, and it was a bunch of

156
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,399
people. So I was invited to this small conference in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, where I was

157
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:38,779
invited to this small conference in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, where I was invited to this small conference

158
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:43,519
of other scholars who were there to talk about what the right policy ought to be.

159
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,960
And what we, what Martin, Sunetra, and I came up with was it turns out we arrived basically at the

160
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:55,159
same place. You have this age gradient and risk. Older people are really high risk, younger people

161
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:59,620
much less so. The lockdowns are tremendously harmful to young people, especially. So the right

162
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:07,799
policy is focus protection of the old. That meant a whole series of policies that are local in nature

163
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,779
because people, older people, they're not going to be able to do that. So I was invited to this

164
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:12,679
people have different living arrangements to impress the world, but with an aim toward

165
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:17,399
reducing the risk of exposure when there's high community spread for older people.

166
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:20,639
And then for young people, lift the restrictions.

167
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,580
Because the ability to actually stop the disease from spreading had clearly, there wasn't

168
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:25,720
none.

169
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:33,259
The lockdowns had not worked to stop the disease anywhere outside of, say, Australia and New

170
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:35,960
Zealand, certainly not in the Northern Hemisphere.

171
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:42,279
And so at the same time, we really damaged the lives of children, of other people with

172
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,240
other diseases.

173
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:50,240
So the Great Parental Declaration, we wrote a piece in October 4, 2020, released it and

174
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,919
put it on a webpage.

175
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:57,220
Tens of thousands of doctors signed on, tens of thousands of scientists and epidemiologists

176
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:57,840
signed on.

177
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,200
It showed the world that there was not a consensus in favor of lockdown.

178
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,779
In fact, there was deep unhappiness with lockdown.

179
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:06,820
And the scientific community.

180
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,259
And then almost a million people so far, regular people have signed on.

181
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,600
And it's an amazing leadership position to take and swimming against the tide, as it

182
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:16,899
were.

183
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,600
And the public health machine came after you, Dr. J, in a big way.

184
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,720
Anthony Fauci, who's the most high-profile public health official in the world, would

185
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,200
be a reasonable term, I think, to assign to him, the Chief Medical Officer Advisor to

186
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,259
the President of the United States.

187
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:34,460
He's been in his role for five decades.

188
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:35,759
I have to say, I think it's a good thing.

189
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,340
I have to read this quote back to you, because this is what he said when asked about the Great

190
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,059
Barrington Declaration.

191
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,299
I know you will know it, but he said this.

192
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,279
I'll tell you exactly how I feel about that.

193
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,559
If you let infections rip, as it were, and say, let everybody get infected that's going

194
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:53,340
to be able to get infected, and then we'll have herd immunity, quite frankly, that is

195
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:53,820
nonsense.

196
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,740
And anybody who knows anything about epidemiology will tell you that is nonsense, and it's very

197
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,240
dangerous.

198
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,200
Now, if you read the one page of the Great Barrington Declaration, you never talked about

199
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,759
letting it rip.

200
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:05,279
You spoke about it.

201
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,759
You spoke about focus protection.

202
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,940
I mean, why was that?

203
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,720
I think you've referred to that as propaganda.

204
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:17,100
I mean, why was someone in that role so vehemently trying to bring down a logical explanation

205
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,820
that you put forward?

206
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,379
Well, the strategy of lockdown is an absolutely extraordinary strategy.

207
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:26,320
It requires extraordinary evidence.

208
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,360
And one of the things I think it requires is this sense that no reasonable scientist

209
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,320
opposes it.

210
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,320
That, in fact, there's this overwhelming.

211
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,879
There's this overwhelming consensus in favor of it.

212
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:46,379
The problem that the Great Barrington Declaration posed to Tony Fauci is that the authors of

213
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,799
the Great Barrington Declaration come from reputable universities, Stanford, Harvard,

214
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:50,100
Oxford.

215
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,820
I've never in my life cared that I'm a reputable university.

216
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:55,440
I'd rather you judge me on my ideas.

217
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:01,419
But here you had three people from reputable universities saying that lockdown was a bad

218
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:01,779
idea.

219
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:01,879
Yeah.

220
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:03,139
Yeah.

221
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:03,200
Yeah.

00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,259
Yeah.

00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,379
Yeah.

00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:03,419
Yeah.

Yeah.

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:03,460
Yeah.

Yeah.

264
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:05,059
Yeah.

265
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:05,080
Yeah.

266
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,100
Yeah.

267
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,159

276
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:05,740
Yeah.

277
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:05,779
Yeah.

278
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:05,799
Yeah.

279
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:05,860
Yeah.

280
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:05,879
Yeah.

281
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:05,899
Yeah.

282
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:05,940
Yeah.

283
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:05,980
Yeah.

284
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,039
Yeah.

285
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:06,059
Yeah.

286
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:06,100
Yeah.

287
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:22,179
Yeah.

288
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:22,220
Yeah.

289
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:22,320
Yeah.

290
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:22,379
Yeah.

291
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:22,480
Yeah.

292
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,519
Yeah.

293
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,419
Yeah.

294
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:23,500
Yeah.

295
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,480
Yeah.

296
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,539
Yeah.

297
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:33,279
lockdowns or otherwise um then it's just he's just one voice among many and so he used his power

298
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:41,919
as the world's most prominent public health figure to essentially mount a propaganda campaign instead

299
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:48,700
of instead of engaging with the argument we were making in good faith he put a straw man in place

300
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,259
he said oh they just want everyone to force everyone to get infected when in fact what we

301
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:56,980
were calling for was policies that would actually protect the old and the vulnerable

302
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:02,299
during the first wave in the united states 80 percent of the deaths more than 80 percent of

303
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:06,519
the deaths were people over the age of 65 the lockdowns had not worked to protect the vulnerable

304
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:12,640
we were calling for better policies to protect the older populations not letting the virus rip

305
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,099
in fact the the goal was to protect the people who who would die at a highest rate from the virus

306
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:23,180
that was that's the idea of folks protection so he was creating the straw man because those

307
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:28,299
words are powerful in the minds of the regular population of regular people let it rip all you

308
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:33,880
want the policy is just to expose me to the virus oh you want to kill me I mean that is essentially

309
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,559
the the specter that of he was raising in the minds of regular people in order to dismiss the

310
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,839
idea of that we were putting forward in order to not actually engage with it he was trying to shut

311
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:50,440
down debate and uh Jay to the context to understand the power of of Tony fat you people may not quite

312
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,900
get a grasp on that and I'm sure I don't as well but

313
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:59,079
in his role billions and billions and dollars of grants go the way of scientists and he has uh

314
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:04,720
complete say over funding and if you're a scientist and you don't get funded by the

315
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,160
regulatory authorities that he's been in control of for five decades that can be career-ending for

316
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,140
a scientist I'm assuming so so it takes courage and leadership for you and your colleagues to

317
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,519
stand up and say hey we're going to put that at risk but a lot of your other colleagues behind

318
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:22,720
the scenes were supportive but really felt as though their hands were tied is that is that an

319
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:29,440
addiction of of how it plays out I mean it's definitely risky so he he uh he sits on top of

320
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,900
as you say billions of dollars of federal funding uh careers are made based not just on the money

321
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:40,720
from getting Tony Fauci but but the fact that the National Institute of Health has awarded you a

322
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,660
grant many top medical institutions will get Grant tenure on the basis of winning those kinds of

323
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:52,839
awards that's true at Stanford University where I teach um and so it's really hard to speak up against

324
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:57,400
them um because you're essentially putting your career at risk you're saying okay well I'm gonna

325
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,519
I'm gonna oppose someone who may make or break my career um and uh you know it's it's there are other

326
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,420
sources of funding so it's not it's not like he's but in in the areas of infectious disease

327
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:14,440
epidemiology infectious disease immunology he is essentially you know the the Crown Prince the King

328
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:21,400
right you're you're essentially going against the King um and it uh it's so yeah I mean it does it

329
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:28,460
takes some level of, you know, I don't, I should, I have to tell you, I made a decision that I was

330
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,779
not, I didn't care what happened to my career. I just felt like I had to speak up because the

331
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:41,759
policy was harming so many people that I basically had devoted my career to studying and making their

332
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:48,380
lives better, vulnerable people, poor people, children. And I couldn't stay silent. And so I

333
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:53,279
had to make a decision when I signed it that I wasn't doing, even if I had to pay for it with

334
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,779
my career, I was going to still do it. And that is a great story of courage and

335
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:01,400
leadership, Jane. I'm fascinated by it and we need people in the world and we need to celebrate

336
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:07,160
people. You know, we had a lot of, you know, there was very little debate, but a lot of it was

337
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:13,640
trust the science, trust the science. And what you actually were, you know, offering up was that

338
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,079
science is an evolving discussion and it requires debate. And then

339
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:18,359
hopefully-

340
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:23,539
Eventually, if it becomes a collaborative enough and you get consensus, then there are times when

341
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:27,160
people do generally agree, don't they, on certain things. I think people, you know, look at smoking

342
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,700
now and we're pretty universal on what happens if you decide to go down the path of smoking

343
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,400
cigarettes. But on this case, with something as new as that to have debates shut down, you know,

344
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,119
it seems the opposite of science. Is that again, a fair reflection?

345
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,900
It's exactly right. It's exactly right. I mean, science is not an automatic

346
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,059
consensus. It's not an automatic consensus. It's not an automatic consensus. It's not an automatic

347
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:48,339
consensus. It's not an automatic consensus. It's not an automatic consensus. It's not an automatic

348
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:52,940
consensus. You have a new situation. It just takes time, right? It takes, it takes a lot of

349
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,839
minds. The world is a complicated place. This disease is a complicated thing. Society is

350
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:03,500
complicated. It's going to take a lot of trial and error with lots of people talking to each

351
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,859
other in good faith, trying to generate data in order to learn what the right way to deal with

352
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:13,940
this is. And the idea that it's like somehow minutes after you have this virus in the world

353
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,039
at large, that everyone knows exactly what to do. It happens to coincide with exactly the same thing.

354
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:19,240
It happens to coincide with exactly the same thing. It happens to coincide with exactly what Tony

355
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:25,279
Fauci and other public health authorities wanted to do. I was just not true. It was, it was, it was a

356
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:31,000
lot of debate going on sort of sub Rosa underneath the public's public's, you know, Aegis. They're

357
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,160
not, they're not privy to it because it's scientists just talking to each other and a lot

358
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,920
of uncertainty. And yet the public was painted this picture of consensus. It was, it was, it was

359
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:47,740
false. It was a, it was a propaganda campaign. I don't know how else to describe it. It was a

360
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,240
propaganda campaign. I don't know how else to describe it. It was, it was a propaganda campaign.

361
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,279
Right. Science needs an open space where people can be, can make hypotheses that turn out wrong

362
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:59,339
and not be canceled for them. People, they need, they need to have lots of people who disagree

363
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:02,539
with each other. That's actually part of the fun of science. Frankly, it's one of the reasons I

364
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:06,980
have always enjoyed being a scientist because I learned from that process of discussing with my

365
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,660
colleagues and I'm all, I'm often wrong. That's part of, that's part of how science works. And

366
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,180
I, and it's, it's, it's the opportunity to change my mind, which makes science fun.

367
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:17,579
I want to talk to you about, you know, great leadership,

368
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,740
collaboration and moment. I'm going to come back a bit to the city of Melbourne where I live and,

369
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,759
and just tell a bit of that story again. I know you're acutely aware of it, Jay, but it was,

370
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:30,119
you know, as I said, you know, with pride, we used to call ourselves and we were voted

371
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:33,779
regularly the most livable city in the world here in Melbourne. And it's where my four kids

372
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:38,039
were born. We were passionate about it, but what happened in the last two years? I mean,

373
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,460
I think people have to look back with crazy. We had pregnant women being handcuffed and

374
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,720
arrested in their homes in Ballarat, a regional town, because they posted on Facebook, the idea

375
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:53,099
that maybe we should peacefully protest around the, uh, the merit of lockdowns. We had, you know,

376
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,839
two years of schooling where kids were homeschooled, uh, effectively out of school for that,

377
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,920
that a period of time we had police tape around our playground. So when kids were allowed out for

378
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,940
their hour, they could look at a playground and then literally have the torment of having that.

379
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:11,299
We had boulders put on skate parks, the amount of effort and resource that was done to stop kids

380
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:17,140
in their one hour, they were allowed out from home 5k exclusion zones around your neighborhood. You

381
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,019
weren't allowed to go out of that barrier for fear of being arrested. We had elderly people who

382
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:26,339
were sitting on park benches moved on from police. I think sometimes we need to actually remind

383
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:30,839
ourselves of what we went through curfews in your house. You weren't allowed out of your house at,

384
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:36,500
you know, after 8pm at night or 9pm at night. Now what was never debated here in this city

385
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,000
was the damage of lockdown. Now you're one of the most published researchers in scientific

386
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,920
journals all around the world. You were acutely aware of the damage lockdowns were going to do.

387
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,640
Can you give us some of the evidence that now has been produced? Because it's still in my mind,

388
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,640
not something people talk about the pain of lockdown and what it's continued to do. Can

389
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,240
you share with us some of your findings? It's devastating. I mean, it's not just my

390
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,799
findings. This is like the work of many, many people, many scientists. But it was predictable,

391
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:09,539
right? So just for instance, just take kids, right? So I think Melbourne has had probably the

392
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:13,440
most number of days of lockdown over the past two and a half years of any city in the world,

393
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,079
actually. And a lot of kids, as you say, they're kids.

394
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:22,779
The kids' lives were interrupted. If you replace regular school with online school,

395
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:27,599
you're not actually giving them schooling. It's something else. A lot of the benefit of

396
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,960
schooling comes from ability to interact with other kids. So there's social development that's

397
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:39,660
lost. And also, there's just learning that's lost. That's going to be true for Melbourne kids,

398
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:44,640
just as it is for American kids who have been kept out of school. Before the pandemic,

399
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,019
there was a literature on this that looked at

400
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:52,059
short interruptions in schooling and what consequences it has on the lives of children

401
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:57,559
the rest of their lives. And so they would do these natural experiments where they compare

402
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:03,880
some location that has mandated schooling until you're age 17 versus age 16, and then track the

403
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,740
kids for the rest of their life. And it turns out that the children that were required to stay in

404
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:16,940
school for just a short, one year longer, that led to longer lives, more healthy lives, and

405
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:25,900
with less unemployment, just more prosperity. In other words, by locking down, we have consigned

406
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:31,799
our children to shorter lives, less healthy lives. One estimate early in the pandemic from just the

407
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:36,559
spring lockdowns in the United States alone estimated that we had shortened our children's

408
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,519
lives just in the United States by five and a half million life years from just the spring lockdown.

409
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:45,039
And this is true all over the world.

410
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,859
Places in poor countries like Bangladesh, Uganda, where kids have never come back.

411
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,079
Millions of children missed two years of school and then never came back to school,

412
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,339
lost forever. It's a catastrophic generational theft of the birthright of our kids,

413
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:07,640
what we did with lockdowns. And that's just on kids. That's on the educational outcomes,

414
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:11,859
nevermind the psychological harm we've done to our children and young people.

415
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,920
Right? So in the United States, there was a study done by the U.S. CDC,

416
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:23,799
in June of 2020, that found that one in four young adults seriously considered suicide the

417
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:29,019
previous month. Can you imagine the depths of psychological despair people were in,

418
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,299
especially young people? Young people need interactions with other young people. I mean,

419
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:38,799
I'm an old guy. I can be a hermit. It's fine. But even old people need, like me,

420
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:46,019
need human connections, right? So like there was a big increase in despair and deaths among

421
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:52,660
older people with dementia from loneliness. People with dementia died of loneliness,

422
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,039
20, 30% increase in that. Everyone needs connection. And so the levels of anxiety,

423
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:05,259
the levels of depression shot through the roof. And the consequences of that now are a big

424
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:12,480
increase in drug overdoses, big increase in deaths from the kinds of things that happen when you have

425
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,319
deep psychological distress at a mass level.

426
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:24,259
There's also problems with other physical health. People stopped getting cancer screening. People

427
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:29,480
actually skipped cancer treatment because they were so afraid of COVID. Or they were told that

428
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,720
they shouldn't come in because they want to preserve the healthcare system. Preserve the

429
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,059
healthcare system for what? If you're not using it to treat cancer patients, what's it for?

430
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:46,880
People stayed home with heart attacks. It's mind-boggling because we made the avoidance of

431
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,519
COVID so far above many, many other deadly diseases in poor countries. I worry about

432
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:56,960
poor countries for lots of reasons. But one of the things that I think is important to understand,

433
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:04,240
when rich countries like Australia, like the United States, lock down and cut trade ties,

434
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,180
essentially reduce the connections with the outside world, a lot of poor countries,

435
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:15,960
they've reorganized their economy to fit into the global economy. And when these kinds of economic

436
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,740
consequences break, when rich countries undertake these kinds of policies, it has

437
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:27,960
knock-on consequences in poor countries. And a lot of poor countries, there's a lot of people

438
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:34,259
who live on $2 a day of income or less, very, very poor. Even small perturbations in the economy can

439
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:40,420
have enormous deleterious consequences on them. And that's exactly what happened. The UN estimated

440
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:46,279
that somewhere on the order of 80 million people were put on the brink of starvation, dire food

441
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,259
poisoning. Hundreds of thousands of children in March of 2021, a UN report said, died in South

442
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:59,119
Asia alone from starvation. We have a moral obligation, I think, when we've made promises

443
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:05,400
to the rest of the world about trade and all the economic ties, to not break them. Because

444
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:11,099
the consequences are not just that some rich people don't get so rich. It's that the poor

445
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:16,200
face the consequences of that even more acutely than anyone else, I think. And the poorest of the

446
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,859
poor are the worst of all.

447
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:23,039
It's an incredible summation that you just gave. And the social divide that you talk about is

448
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:29,059
horrific. And the consequences are horrific going forward. And coming back a bit micro here in

449
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:33,539
Melbourne in the, as you said, the most locked down city in the world or close enough to it. In

450
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:39,079
the final weeks of the final lockdown, a journalist wrote a story. It was very hard to get information

451
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:44,759
out on this, that there were 800 teenage girls a week being diagnosed with eating disorders in

452
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,859
this city alone. That was the perfect time to get information out on this. And I think that's

453
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:47,519
the key to this.

454
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,019
And I think that's the key to this. I think that's the key to this. And I think that's the key to this.

455
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:49,700
I think that's the key to this. And I think that's the key to this. And I think that's the key to this.

456
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,980
And really to get a consultation with a medical health professional, a mental health professional

457
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,779
in Melbourne, there's an 18-month waiting. There's just no possibility. The inundation of the

458
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:06,599
demand on that service, as you said, we spent the whole narrative around protecting from a virus

459
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:11,960
where the evidence was there that young people were close statistically enough to no risk at all.

460
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,460
And yet we've created this incredible lifetime of problems on the other side.

461
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:21,299
It was the fascinating part, Jane, this is why these conversations for me are so important and

462
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:27,059
your leadership is so important that through that time, I was co-hosting a breakfast radio show here

463
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:33,160
in Melbourne. We had the premier on regularly. To even ask a respectful question about the merit

464
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:40,019
of lockdown created a firestorm of response. In some corners, you were considered treacherous

465
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:46,440
for even what I thought was respectfully asking a question. And so my problem is how do we learn

466
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:52,140
to view this as being nosey, and how do we move forward without recognizing what we're doing?

467
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:58,680
Yeah, I think it's not necessarily the problem of the pandemic. It's the problem of what has happened

468
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,759
to our young people, and the problem of how we're able to say, if you don't want to talk about what

469
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:07,900
you just said, here's the end of this, because we just don't want to hear what you said. And I am

470
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,240
so sorry to hear that. I'm sorry to hear you say that as well. Because it's the same right.

471
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,640
Yeah, I want to see young people say, you know, we're not going to be talking about this. We're

472
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,000
not going to be talking about this. We're just going to be talking about it. Or, you know, I'm not

473
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,480
going to talk about this for the world. We're not going to hear what you just said, because it's too painful to

474
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:21,559
ourselves in the eye and say, okay, what did we do wrong? In medicine, we do this. There's a

475
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:27,839
tradition of after a patient has died, and a lot of doctors are involved, to have a conference

476
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:32,579
called a morbidity and mortality conference, where you, without pointing fingers, discuss what went

477
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:39,559
wrong, what went right, and so with the aim of essentially instructing everybody and learning

478
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:43,759
from each other so that we don't make the same mistake again. We need to have a society-wide

479
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:48,240
morbidity and mortality conference around COVID, because the response was, I think, in many ways,

480
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:53,519
everyone would agree, a failure. You know, the COVID spread, we had all these lockdown harms.

481
00:31:54,339 --> 00:32:02,559
At the same time, I think it has to be more than just a formal evaluation of it by governments,

482
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,920
although that's necessary. I think there has to be a cultural movement that repudiates lockdown,

483
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:13,359
so that lockdown becomes a dirty word. The same way we talk about nuclear war or chemical

484
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:13,740
weapons, we talk about nuclear weapons. We talk about nuclear weapons. We talk about nuclear

485
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:13,759
weapons. We talk about nuclear weapons. We talk about nuclear weapons. We talk about nuclear weapons. We

486
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:22,000
think lockdown belongs in the same category, because it is a violation on a mass scale of

487
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,539
basic civil rights, basic promises that we make as a society to the poorest members and most

488
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:37,480
vulnerable members of society. It's a rupture in civilization, and we undertook it on the basis of

489
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,839
fear and panic. That's what makes it so hard to talk about. It's why you couldn't ask your

490
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:43,740
premier about it. It's why you couldn't ask your premier about it. It's why you couldn't ask your

491
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,180
premier about it. It's why you couldn't ask your premier about it. It's also why this censorship

492
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:51,680
regime came up. It's also how Tony Fauci was able to get away with this propaganda campaign,

493
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:58,200
because of the fear. We have to come to terms with the fact that there may be scary things that go on,

494
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:04,480
but how do we as a society, and you're asking about leadership, it starts with that. It starts

495
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:13,420
with a commitment by leadership to never use those tactics again, to never create fear, to think about

496
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:18,859
in the future when there is fear, how should we respond courageously, intelligently,

497
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:25,859
compassionately, so that we don't jump to the nearest thing that we think will work,

498
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:31,240
but forget about the poor, the vulnerable, the working class, and all the harms that are caused

499
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:37,599
by that resort to a strategy that seems fine when you're in a moral panic, but really isn't.

500
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:43,400
The other part to your world, Jay, you're an MD and a PhD in economics, both gained at the stand,

501
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:50,519
and clearly expertise in that. Well, I can't work out where the economists were in all of this as

502
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:56,960
someone that isn't my sphere either, but to literally print trillions of dollars here in

503
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,619
Australia, we closed down everyone's business and then had to print billions, unprecedented amount

504
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:07,539
of debt to go into when the opportunity was there, as you said, for focus projection, which would

505
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:12,480
have fraction of the amount of money to look after the real people who were vulnerable, the elderly,

506
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:13,400
and we could have done that. But I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question.

507
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:19,340
Put so many resources into that narrative and then let business continue and let people go back

508
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:24,360
to school and all of those things. I mean, was there any economists that you looked to and

509
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:31,139
thought, is someone sounding the alarm on how bad that was? There's a select few. I mean,

510
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,860
there's an excellent one in Australia, this woman named Gigi Foster, who was very brave,

511
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:41,800
actually spoke up to great credit, although she got, I think, a lot of flack for it in Australia.

512
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:48,199
There were very few economists who spoke up about these harms early in the pandemic and

513
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:53,179
throughout, in fact, frankly, throughout the pandemic. Public health economics is not only

514
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:59,420
about the short term. In fact, policy that's aimed at the short term, if it has long-term costs,

515
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:06,099
is bad policy. The inflation that we're facing, some of the economic problems, the supply chain

516
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:10,440
disruptions and so on they're facing, those are lockdown harms, long-term lockdown harms.

517
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,519
Economists should have been sounding the alarm almost from the beginning,

518
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,320
but it was really difficult. I'll tell you, I just kept my medical doctor hat on and my

519
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:27,860
epidemiologist hat on. I didn't have my economist hat on, in large part because it was really hard

520
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:33,679
if you're an economist to speak up. It took moral courage to do so, I think, because you were going

521
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:40,119
to be accused of valuing money over lives, even though what economists,

522
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,760
really care, I mean, like good economists, what we care about is actually lives. We care about

523
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,980
people not starving, people getting good medical care. All of that requires a functioning economy.

524
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,139
It's not dollars that were at stake. It wasn't dollars versus lives. That was always not the

525
00:35:57,139 --> 00:36:03,219
right, that was a false dichotomy. It was always lives versus lives, right? So if we lock down,

526
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:08,039
certain set of people benefit from it. It's the laptop class, the people who don't actually get

527
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:10,360
harmed by locking down. But that's only,

528
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,940
in rich countries, maybe 20, 30% of economies, maybe 20% of the economy. The rest of the

529
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:22,119
people, they have to work. They get exposed to the virus. You can see this enormous rich-poor

530
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:27,679
divide in who got infected. So you're not protecting all lives. You're only protecting

531
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:33,239
a certain class of life, laptop class is what I call them. At the same time, you have these

532
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:40,420
long-term consequences where if you have economic growth hit, if you have inflation,

533
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:47,880
people are going to die from that. Displacement, economic displacement is going, is, is, is for

534
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,239
especially people on the margin, is the difference between life and death. We already talked about

535
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:58,039
the 80 million people who starved or had dire food insecurities as a consequence of these lockdowns.

536
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,119
Hundreds of millions of people were thrown into poverty worldwide. Even in rich countries,

537
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:09,079
inflation means, you know, poor people are going to have trouble feeding their family,

538
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:14,000
clothing their family. It's, it's not true that we're all so rich that we don't have to worry

539
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,679
about these things. I think, so it was always lives versus lives. It was always lives versus

540
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:24,679
lives. We should, we should, we should, we as economists should have been brave enough to speak

541
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:30,019
up even when we were being accused of being callous. When in fact, we're speaking, we're

542
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:33,679
speaking for the poor, the vulnerable, the working class, when we speak up and say, look, there are

543
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:45,389
costs to this. Yeah, the term excess deaths was one that was, was floated around the world.

544
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:49,230
But you couldn't get real information. As you said, it's lives versus lives. If,

545
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:54,070
if you pull that lever and lock people down, what is the consequence of lives on the other side?

546
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,829
There wasn't a conversation. And I appreciate having, I want to move on very, uh, in a moment

547
00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:03,730
to some questions around leadership. We're, we're, we're fascinated by people like you who take great

548
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:07,389
courageous leadership stands and have done all your life. But before I move on, I just want to

549
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:13,250
ask you is, is this may be a, um, you know, uh, a radical question in some ways, but have we

550
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,389
demonized viruses too much? I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

551
00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:21,090
Ted talked the other day, um, Bill Gates is talking about his hope and possibility to eradicate

552
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:25,650
the flu and to live in a community in a, in a world where we don't have the flu. I mean,

553
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:30,750
again, no medical background, no scientific background, but to me, is that even a goal

554
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:35,269
worth chasing? I'm assuming we're carrying hundreds of viruses at a time and that that's

555
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:40,449
part of how we evolve and grow. Do we need to recalibrate that conversation? And does that

556
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:45,389
even make sense? The pursuit of not wanting to have a flu season? Well, I mean, I don't think

557
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:50,090
we, there's not possible. I don't know any way technically to do it because flu is carried by,

558
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:55,969
uh, humans and, and also other animals. Like we don't have a, uh, there's a very few set of

559
00:38:55,969 --> 00:39:00,650
viruses and pathogens. We have the technology or even the possibility of eradicating smallpox is

560
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:05,369
one of them, um, that we actually touched the huge success. And that was worth doing because

561
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:11,590
it was a deadly disease. If you got it, it, it, it, it was, um, it was spread very easily.

562
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:15,369
It probably in 1492, uh, when it spread,

563
00:39:15,389 --> 00:39:21,050
to the new world, it, it, uh, it, it killed off 95% of the indigenous population living there.

564
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:26,750
Uh, in, in, uh, so it has this like long history, but it only spread from humans to humans. And we

565
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:32,449
had a fantastic vaccine and still it took almost a century to eradicate it of concerted effort and

566
00:39:32,449 --> 00:39:39,730
work. Uh, here we have, uh, viruses that are, are spread very easily, have a, have a consequence

567
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:45,190
that's deadly for some group of people, uh, but not, not for others. It spreads into,

568
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:50,309
you have to consider the harms and the benefits, not just simply say, okay,

569
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:56,250
it would be nice to do this. Uh, I think, um, a project like let's eradicate the flu or eradicate

570
00:39:56,250 --> 00:40:02,429
COVID, uh, would decimate civilization if we actually undertook it the way we, that's because

571
00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:06,630
smallpox, uh, it's a very different thing. You have a vaccine that, that actually stops

572
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:11,250
transmission. We don't have something like that for the flu or for, for COVID. Uh, we,

573
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:15,210
we don't have the, the, uh, it's present animals. Are you willing to let your pets,

574
00:40:15,389 --> 00:40:20,510
kill your pets if you if you get uh if it gets if one of your pets gets covid i mean that's i mean

575
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:25,550
that's the decision china has made um are we willing to do that are you i mean are you willing

576
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:31,150
to to separate newborns from moms you're gonna have to do that if one of them has covid are you

577
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:38,090
are you willing to uh see vast numbers of poor people starve because of the kinds of lockdowns

578
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:41,969
you're doing like who's gonna who's gonna keep society going i mean those are the kind of

579
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:46,670
questions you end up when i i think about when i hear let's try to eradicate the flu and bill

580
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:50,849
gates but maybe what he thinks about is oh well we have this new technology let's use it but it's

581
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:59,610
not so simple society is very complicated um and uh i think the uh even um even as a goal

582
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:06,750
it's a funny goal uh we have a global society we share germs with each other that's just part of

583
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:11,849
being human in some ways it's bad because you know you get exposed to germs that could kill

584
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:17,789
you but in other ways that creates a less immune naive population around the world

585
00:41:17,789 --> 00:41:23,570
i can come to australia you can come to the united states and there's no real immunological

586
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:29,369
danger not not not not truly inherently we can exchange ideas with each other in person

587
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:34,590
and we're all we all benefit from it um we there's this like uh sunetra gupta has this idea

588
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:40,650
that like because we have globalization we become more healthy even by by even as we expose each

589
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,949
other to germs we we teach them how to do it and we teach them how to do it and we teach them how to

590
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:47,010
do it and we teach our each other about our our immune systems about the germs that we saw so

591
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:51,630
that when we don't when you know when we see it when we're younger and we don't over over over

592
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:57,449
react to it when we're older we don't have the kind of immunological naive population that is

593
00:41:57,449 --> 00:42:02,909
vulnerable to christopher columbus coming over and decimating 95 of the population of a vast

594
00:42:02,909 --> 00:42:09,090
continent um because of globalization do we really want to go backward on that um it's a complicated

595
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:11,949
question i mean there are definitely diseases i would rather that that human beings are able to

596
00:42:11,969 --> 00:42:22,869
get the flu and i don't think that's true for the flu and i don't think that's true for covid

597
00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:28,610
uh it's a great answer because as i said that's it plays into that fear narrative doesn't it that

598
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:34,090
you know a society of germaphobes and and you know not wanting to interact with each other

599
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:38,909
seems a big consequence for for the annual flu season which we know people lose their lives and

600
00:42:38,909 --> 00:42:41,949
you can't be flipping about that because you always get then accused of being COVID-19 and

601
00:42:41,969 --> 00:42:47,329
cold-hearted but there is a logic to to your conversation if you take that further um we're

602
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:52,289
seeing great leaders uh jay have um a series of dimensions of leadership we think are common i'd

603
00:42:52,289 --> 00:42:57,730
love to ask you about them so please expand we think all people who make uh great leaders in the

604
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:02,750
21st century like you have a sense of self-leadership first and foremost before they lead

605
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:11,840
others what does self-leadership mean to you well i i mean when i chose this profession i i invested

606
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,880
my energy into it for a reason it wasn't for self-agreement i don't i mean it's it's fun to

607
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,599
have a stanford professorship but that's really not the purpose of it even if i was

608
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:28,800
not very successful in publishing or whatever i would still be honored to be able to be in

609
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:37,360
this profession it means something to me i chose it for a reason um and uh if i'm not able to do it

610
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:43,199
to my best of my ability then what's my purpose like i could have during the pandemic it was

611
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:50,239
it would have been very easy to get grants just to forecast the cases like a lot of a lot of people

612
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:54,800
did that i could have i could have just stayed silent about the more controversial things

613
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:00,239
but it would have felt to me like a violation of my own integrity like i didn't get in this

614
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:06,639
business uh in order just to advance my career i i came i got in this business because i'll tell

615
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:12,719
you like on my on my medical school application the the i wrote about diarrhea and children

616
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:19,119
turns out it's one of the most common causes of childhood death and you can prevent it or treat it

617
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:26,000
with a very simple salt solution cost pennies oral rehydration and i was when i first learned about

618
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,519
this when i was an undergrad i was shocked that there were so many kids dying from want of a three

619
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:40,800
cent salt solution um i mean so i mean to me that's the purpose of of of any career how do i

620
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,320
make the lives of other people better

621
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:49,280
and i don't i just couldn't i couldn't i mean i lost a lot of friends over this i wish i wish i

622
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,400
hadn't but it was over over my stance but i and i and i wish i could get them back but or at least

623
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,599
reconcile in some way but i couldn't i couldn't stay silent jade so i can hear your values and

624
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,400
your purpose just emanate in all your words so i mean if i pick up on that for a moment

625
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,880
it was friendship changing for some of your colleagues they couldn't

626
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:13,119
align or didn't want to have the conversation was that was that a cost of of your stance it was

627
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,480
uh so i have uh it's i teach at stanford um university a hundred of my colleagues

628
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:27,199
circulated a secret petition in um in uh about a year ago this time uh at where where they asked

629
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:33,679
the president university to sought to censor me because i had been i'd been in a a public

630
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:39,440
round table with the governor of florida governor desantis of florida uh and he had asked me whether

631
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,199
it was a wise idea for children to be masked children as young as

632
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,480
two years old to be masked um and i know the literature on this there's no randomized

633
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,280
evidence that that serves any purpose in reducing the spread of the disease

634
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,079
the governor of florida is asking me this i'm a scientific advisor of his

635
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:03,519
it's it's televised so i and uh just so everyone in florida can see the advice the governor is

636
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,920
getting and so i told him what i had to say which is that even though like all the public

637
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,199
health authorities saying mask mask mask um even children as young as two i knew that that

638
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:19,039
was not normal first there's no scientific evidence for it in terms of like high quality

639
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:24,000
randomized studies none um and that the world health organization has said no don't mask

640
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,960
children as uh under the age of six so that's what i that's what i told the governor some of

641
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,760
my colleagues heard this and thought that i was violating some public health norm by telling the

642
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,480
public the fact the scientific fact and they circulated a petition and i looked at the list

643
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,199
of signees of that petition this petition asked the president university to to censor me

644
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:49,519
and i looked on the list included some some friends of mine really hurt to see uh uh friends

645
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:55,440
that that uh haven't talked to me in two years i just it's just been it's been heartbreaking

646
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,360
but on the other hand i have to say like i i shouldn't people shouldn't feel too bad for me i

647
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:05,199
now um have made a tremendous number of really really amazing i've met a lot of amazing people

648
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:09,039
made some deep friendships because i feel like i've been through a war and you know when you

649
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,199
when you're a war uh the people you're in the trenches with become friends for life and uh

650
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,679
i've made some friends like that through the pandemic uh thanks for sharing that it's uh you

651
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:21,840
know you can't imagine uh you know what that's that like when you've uh contributed like you

652
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:27,119
have but as you said the the glass on half full on the other side uh i'm sure there's lots of uh

653
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,880
as you said connections that have happened as a result of it uh we see leaders are really

654
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,039
conscious of how they positively impact others in their environment on a daily basis i mean

655
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:40,800
the great barrington declaration was doing that on a global scale you can hear in your language

656
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,039
that that's something you're conscious about your sense of purpose

657
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,000
you've got an example you know just day-to-day jay around what you try and do to impact others

658
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,440
on a positive uh in a positive way i uh well this has been hard during the pandemic because

659
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,880
it's been so isolating but i love students i love i love talking to students i love uh

660
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,519
you know actually frankly what i really like is asking them why are they making the decisions

661
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:09,280
they're making um i like i like to push them to to to like think in that way just because

662
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,800
what it does for them is then then they're making choices that are better informed

663
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:19,199
uh i love uh and it to me uh i'll tell you during the pandemic i missed that because a lot of there

664
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:24,320
was there was a lot of disconnection around that but it was replaced by i mean i can't count the

665
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:28,719
number of people who've sent me kind emails of the great branch declaration when they see me

666
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:35,199
on a podcast like this or a tv show whatever um people i've never met it's it's a really

667
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:38,400
unique experience for me because before the pandemic i'd never written an op-ed never

668
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,039
been on tv never done a really done a podcast um and uh most of the time i've never done a podcast

669
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,679
no i've never written a talk show never daschke would say to me hey this is a big idea but

670
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:51,760
can we actually do an op-ed it sounds good you know with me i've gotten so entscheiden

671
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:57,599
especially i would interact with my students who i loved and other academics by writing academic

672
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:03,280
papers uh to have the opportunity to touch people and reach people on such a global scale is

673
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:09,199
is really an opera is is a is a it's an absolute honor and i've been mindful to try to try to uh

674
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:11,199
uh to to use that as best i can to uh you know to to tell people what the evidence is uh you know from

675
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:13,280
what i see and also to convey to people when i don't know what the evidence is when we when we don't know i think a lot of times that often

676
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:18,420
in a position like this, you get tempted to overstate. And I've tried very hard not to do

677
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:21,739
that, to tell people, yeah, here's what we know, here's what we don't know.

678
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:27,079
Brilliant to hear that. We talk about the leaders really conscious of how they

679
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:32,940
create and share their vision. And again, what you've done in recent times to get a million

680
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:38,539
people around the world and 60,000 fellow medical professionals. I know that there were a lot that

681
00:49:38,539 --> 00:49:44,699
were scared off as well because of what happened and the threats that were made. I mean, can you

682
00:49:44,699 --> 00:49:49,340
tell us what you went through in trying to get that vision out there and how you've gone about

683
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:55,619
creating and sharing it? Well, I've had to learn some new skill sets. So I always loved teaching,

684
00:49:56,039 --> 00:49:59,840
but I've never been on TV before. I'd never written an op-ed before. I tended to write

685
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:05,719
before the pandemic, I would write 5,000 to 10,000 word densely argued with lots of figures.

686
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:08,380
And then I'd sit there arguing,

687
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:12,940
with referees who would talk about the details. And I had great fun doing it. It was really

688
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:20,440
enjoyable. I've learned that you have to, how to take arguments like that, get to the essence of

689
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:25,780
it and convey it in a way that everybody can understand it. I've had to do it in context of

690
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:33,760
both writing for very, very large audiences in newspapers and other places, but also in the

691
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,519
context of TV. Like I've never had a three, try to get a professor to,

692
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:45,119
do a three minute TV hit. So I had to learn by fire. Like the first time I did a three minute hit,

693
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:51,619
I barely cleared my throat. And the announcer said, oh, your time's up. I'm like, what? Wait,

694
00:50:51,699 --> 00:50:56,480
we just started. So I've gotten better at that. I think, still not great at that, I think,

695
00:50:56,539 --> 00:51:01,159
but it's been interesting. But I found is that reaches people. It reaches people that you

696
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:06,320
wouldn't otherwise reach. And they're important people to reach, regular people that, so you can

697
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,980
help them make decisions in their own life.

698
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:13,340
It's a powerful thing to be able to be able to do. I mean, you already know it from your,

699
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,219
your experience firsthand. I had to learn it sort of the hard way during the pandemic. And it's just,

700
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,380
it's been an honor to be able to be able to do that or learn how to do that.

701
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:26,440
Soundbite world of mainstream media. I'll come back to that. Curiosity is a word that we

702
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:32,380
see leaders attribute to them a lot. They're curious in their day-to-day world. I mean,

703
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:37,519
I'm sure that resonates with you. How does curiosity show up for you? And then people

704
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:38,519
approach that through you.

705
00:51:38,539 --> 00:51:41,619
Learning and development through their curiosity. How does that word resonate with you?

706
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,300
Oh, I mean, I think for me, well, I mean, I, I always thought of it as like a, as a,

707
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:51,460
as a negative in my career, I can't seem to stay on one topic. And in my career, I was like,

708
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:56,739
I always got, I got normally like for scientists, if you pick one topic and become an expert or you

709
00:51:56,739 --> 00:52:02,780
put all your worth into that one topic, that's, that tends to lead to the biggest rewards because

710
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:06,440
you publish in that topic, every, you grow your network in that topic. And then, and then you're

711
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,059
like, you're, you know, the world expert.

712
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:13,360
And my career, all I, I would, I would very easily get distracted with other like law.

713
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:17,539
I have an MD in economic, I have an MD and a PhD in economics. It doesn't seem like a

714
00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:23,059
really, it seems like strange. I'm just curious about both of them. Why am I writing my infectious

715
00:52:23,059 --> 00:52:26,860
disease? I've written about infectious disease for 20 years. I just happened to be interested

716
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:32,420
in it. I, you know, I just, there are like topics through my career and my life where

717
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:36,219
I just, I just, I just got, I'm like, okay, this is, this sounds like a fascinating topic.

718
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,340
I had some insight into it as I'd write about it.

719
00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:42,980
And then I go to the next topic and I would always wonder like, why is it that I can't stay

720
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:49,139
on one thing? During the pandemic, what I found was that I could tap into all of those things

721
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:54,460
that seemed like one-offs to me. Like we're just, you know, little bird walks that I'd had. And it

722
00:52:54,460 --> 00:53:00,480
was like, okay, well, I've learned about, I wrote about HIV in Africa. Wrote a couple of papers in

723
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,219
that. Turned out it was really useful. So I, cause I learned a lot about what life in Africa was

724
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:08,440
life and do it when I was writing about that. You know,

725
00:53:08,539 --> 00:53:12,260
it's just, they're, they're like parts of my career that where I, I never understood why I

726
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:17,539
worked on them other than curiosity that turned out during the pandemic to be really, really

727
00:53:17,539 --> 00:53:22,760
important to my thinking. I don't know. I think that's the main thing about curiosity is it allows

728
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:29,480
you, even when you don't know exactly why it, it enriches you. It makes you, makes you prepared

729
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:34,320
for things you don't even realize you're preparing for. It's an amazing bit of evidence of how it

730
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,260
showed up for you, isn't it? To have the understanding, so many diverse areas and,

731
00:53:38,539 --> 00:53:43,860
to have studied them at the level that you had to bring that together. It's, it's a great example of,

732
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:49,159
of how curiosity works and then serves the greater community. Communicating with clarity is a

733
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:53,280
dimension of leadership. We talk about a lot and you mentioned having to, you know, from 10,000

734
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,900
word pieces and defending them with, with other professors to, to try and get, you know, three

735
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:03,780
minutes and make an impact on that. I mean, how, how have you gone about sort of your communication

736
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:08,440
strategy? Uh, it's, it's been a, it's been trial by fire.

737
00:54:08,539 --> 00:54:13,239
Because I, I've, I've been on TV quite a bit, uh, which has been, um, I mean, like I said,

738
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:19,460
an amazing, amazing privilege. Uh, I think that the key thing is I have to, I, I realized before

739
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:24,380
it was so easy to get lost in the details. You probably have heard it even in the earlier

740
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:30,219
answers to this question. Um, uh, but when you're doing this kind of large, wide scale

741
00:54:30,219 --> 00:54:36,619
communication, you have to find the essential argument and make it in a way so that everyone

742
00:54:36,619 --> 00:54:38,119
can understand it while still,

743
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:45,239
I think holding on to the core bit of it, not being dishonest in any way, not, not being at all

744
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:50,199
trying to show people up. Like I'm, I know, well, it's something I don't know being absolutely

745
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:56,679
honest. Um, so finding the core bit, being honest in the delivery of it, and then being clear around

746
00:54:56,679 --> 00:55:00,179
both of those, both of the, like what you know, and don't know. I think that's, that's what I've

747
00:55:00,179 --> 00:55:05,260
learned, uh, has been really important during this. I don't, I don't really, I frankly, I've

748
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,519
kept thinking people are going to stop inviting me for, for, uh,

749
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:12,739
podcasts and TV and all that, that, that'll, that'll, that'll be proof the pandemic's over.

750
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:18,400
And I can go back to being, uh, being like a quiet professor again. Um, I don't, I don't,

751
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,280
I'm not in this to, to gain fame. I don't, I think that's part of why I've been able to,

752
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:29,619
to maintain my balance around this. I I'm happy when someone invites me to do a podcast or to be

753
00:55:29,619 --> 00:55:33,199
on TV or whatever, it's an opportunity to reach an audience. I think it's really important for

754
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:38,420
me to reach, but it's not about my, you know, making money or I just, I take, I've taken,

755
00:55:38,539 --> 00:55:42,860
no money at all for any of my TV appearances or podcasts or whatever. I just, this is, this is

756
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:50,019
about my working out my vocation, which for whatever reason happens to coincide with this,

757
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:55,500
like some expertise about this global pandemic. And it occurred to me that for all of the people

758
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:01,179
that attacked, uh, you and, and, uh, focus protection, that the idea to debate that,

759
00:56:01,179 --> 00:56:07,260
you know, if you really were so sound in, in your wisdom and that's the thing that's, you know,

760
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:13,019
someone like Tony Fauci, five decades in the job making really big statements. I mean,

761
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:18,920
I'm sure you'd love to debate him around a panel. I'm sure you've got colleagues and other experts

762
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:24,320
that, you know, that to me struck me someone in mainstream media. Why don't you put these people

763
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,900
together and hear the debate? Let's, let's, let's get that out there. I mean, it was that

764
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:31,500
offer ever made. Did you, would you do that if it was there?

765
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:36,019
I would jump at the chance. Uh, I've had the opportunity to debate a couple of folks. Uh,

766
00:56:36,019 --> 00:56:41,500
like there was a gentleman from Harvard, uh, Mark Lipsitch and some others, but never Tony Fauci.

767
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,519
Um, it's been hard actually within my own university to get people on the other side

768
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:50,119
to debate me or discuss, discuss it with me. I think the problem was this propaganda we discussed

769
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:56,699
earlier. Uh, the idea was that, uh, that I think Tony Fauci had was that there needed to be like

770
00:56:56,699 --> 00:57:03,119
this illusion of consensus. If you allow there to be a debate between reasonable people,

771
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,900
where there's a disagreement between,

772
00:57:06,019 --> 00:57:11,079
reasonable people, you can't maintain this illusion of consensus. So the strategy has

773
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:16,440
been to de-platform anyone who disagreed. That was the purpose of the propaganda campaign.

774
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,260
Um, and I think that that's why you haven't seen those kinds of reasonable disagreements,

775
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:25,300
uh, reasonable debates, even, even as you, as you said earlier, when you, you couldn't,

776
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:30,079
you couldn't even ask your, your, you have a very prominent role in trying to be where you have

777
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:34,760
access to a prime minister. You, even you got trouble asking that question, right? Because

778
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,960
they couldn't be,

779
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:40,400
this illusion that there was a legitimate question. Because if that, if the legitimate

780
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,340
question, well, then now you have to, now you have to justify why you're doing these lockdowns.

781
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:48,940
You have to talk about the harms. What if people don't agree with them all of a sudden? They don't

782
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:55,059
then comply. What if those protests actually happen anyways? Um, I think, uh, it was a very

783
00:57:55,059 --> 00:58:00,860
illiberal kind of approach to communication by governments during the pandemic, especially

784
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:04,380
scientific bureaucracies during the pandemic and public health bureaucrats during the pandemic.

785
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,960
The idea was to eliminate,

786
00:58:06,019 --> 00:58:11,099
the possibility of disagreement, uh, because they were so right that they couldn't possibly be anyone

787
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:15,059
that disagreed with them reasonable. That was, that, that was a problem. We can't never let that

788
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:18,599
happen again. And Jay, it's a great lead into that. The final dimension I wanted to ask you

789
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:23,380
about, which we see leaders are really passionate more than ever about collaboration. And what

790
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:28,460
happened was the reverse of that key decision makers shrunk cabinet. They shrunk their advisors

791
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:35,820
down to the barest minimum to avoid collaboration or didn't seek out experts like you to,

792
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:40,239
to collaborate with other public health officials. They, they went the other way. I mean,

793
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:43,980
how important has collaboration been for you and your work? And can you give me some examples of

794
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:51,800
how you collaborate? Uh, so, I mean, in science, it's the era of like someone, some lone genius

795
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:59,139
working alone, producing a revolution is likely over. It's too complicated. There's too many

796
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:05,139
fields where the technical expertise and demands are too high. Every single project of note that

797
00:59:05,139 --> 00:59:09,199
I've ever worked on every single project, every single scientific advance that I've seen in my

798
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:15,780
scientific career has involved, uh, uh, deep collaboration with people who had skills that

799
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:19,860
I didn't have. And I sought them out because they were smarter than me. And I always want to work

800
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:25,079
with those people who have something to teach me. Um, and that's how science works. That's also how

801
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:30,519
public health works. The society is too complicated. These diseases are too complicated. You have to

802
00:59:30,519 --> 00:59:35,019
have people who know things that you don't know and be open to the fact that you don't know

803
00:59:35,019 --> 00:59:35,119
them. And you have to have people who know things that you don't know and be open to the fact that

804
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:39,099
you don't know them in order to learn from them in order to make good decisions. You're absolutely

805
00:59:39,099 --> 00:59:44,659
right. What happened here was a small, relatively small cabal of people, not more than a thousand

806
00:59:44,659 --> 00:59:50,320
people decided that they had the wisdom, the collective wisdom to reorder all of society

807
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:55,000
in the World Health Organization and some public health bureaucracies around the world.

808
00:59:55,340 --> 01:00:00,199
And they worked very hard to make, to make people think that they had that collective

809
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:04,340
wisdom when they never did. Uh, it would have been much more productive if they had allowed

810
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:09,019
a discussion with other people who disagreed with them to happen. That's how science works

811
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:13,980
best, how public health works best. Um, and that we might've had, we likely would have had a very

812
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:18,059
different public health response. And I think we would have had much, uh, much more effective

813
01:00:18,059 --> 01:00:22,780
public health response, a more compassionate one, uh, that would have ended up with fewer lives lost.

814
01:00:24,019 --> 01:00:29,019
Joe, we, uh, just veering off on that for a moment, uh, Sweden became a bit of an outlier

815
01:00:29,019 --> 01:00:33,980
in the global community because, you know, you will know better than me, but they seem to go

816
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:39,320
closer to focus protection than anyone else. And then they got attacked, uh, globally for,

817
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:43,920
for this day. I mean, if you look back at Sweden's approach, Joe, was it close to what you were,

818
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:48,659
you were aiming for? I mean, the early days they, they, they did the opposite of folks

819
01:00:48,659 --> 01:00:53,380
protection. Actually, the, the, uh, the, there was a big outbreak of cases in Swedish nursing

820
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:58,500
homes because they sent a COVID infected patients to Swedish nursing homes, a huge amount of reason.

821
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:03,699
Here's the reason why, um, Sweden was seen early on as, as a failure was because of that. A lot of

822
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:07,980
people died in those nursing homes. But, you know, uh, the, the, the amazing thing about the

823
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:14,019
Swedish response to me was their flexibility. Yeah. Cause what they did after that is they

824
01:01:14,019 --> 01:01:19,300
realized they had to protect older people and they adopted policies to gain the trust of the

825
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:26,519
population, told the population, look, here's who's at risk. They kept schools open, primary

826
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:32,760
schools open the entire pandemic. Their kids have no learning loss. And that early loss in life in,

827
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,960
in, in older population,

828
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:39,900
was offset over time as they had a more, I mean, it's not, they had no restrictions that when the

829
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:45,019
disease was spreading, they had, they actually had, uh, suggested restrictions in mass gatherings.

830
01:01:45,019 --> 01:01:48,260
For instance, they told people to stay home when they're sick and provided sick leave when that

831
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:53,500
was the case. Um, they were, uh, very short periods of time. They kept, uh, older people

832
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:58,619
home from, they, they, uh, older, older, like, uh, like high school kids, I think missed some,

833
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:03,460
some schooling. Um, so it's not that they had no, no mistakes, uh, but they were adapting.

834
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:07,239
And they were admitted their mistakes to the population. They didn't try to create this sense

835
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:12,980
of that there was no debate. Um, and, uh, the population trusted them. And when the vaccines

836
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:18,159
came, um, they, you know, what the Europe actually was somewhat slow in getting the vaccines out

837
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:23,139
relative to the United States, although much faster than Australia. Um, and they systematically

838
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:29,119
use the vaccines to protect their old population first. So there was a big spring wave in 2021,

839
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:33,900
but they'd already vaccinated their old. And so there are a lot of cases in Sweden in

840
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:39,960
20 or in April, 2021, but very few deaths per capita. They D because of the vaccine.

841
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,960
Um, and so they use these focus protection ideas to get a much better result. And through

842
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:49,880
the whole pandemic, they actually have negative excess mortality, negative excess mortality

843
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:54,940
through the pandemic. Just think, imagine that. I mean, Australia, actually, I was looking

844
01:02:54,940 --> 01:03:03,119
at the statistics, uh, up until, until maybe, uh, let's say, uh, uh, April of 2022, you

845
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:07,639
had negative excess mortality, but over the last, essentially the, over the last few

846
01:03:07,639 --> 01:03:15,380
months, you've had an enormous weight of cases and huge neck of excess mortality. In 2021,

847
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:21,320
Australia had positive excess mortality, even though there was no COVID because the lockdowns.

848
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:28,659
Um, I think if the world had followed Sweden's, um, uh, leadership in this, we would have

849
01:03:28,659 --> 01:03:32,559
all come out much better off, both in terms of COVID and in terms of the harm to we've

850
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:33,059
done.

851
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,940
to societies as a consequence of the lockdown policies we followed.

852
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,420
So, Jay, to understand just quickly the Australian excess mortality,

853
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:44,300
what's now coming into play is all the people that didn't seek medical treatment,

854
01:03:44,539 --> 01:03:46,840
all of – so that's all cause mortality, isn't it?

855
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:50,000
People that are losing their life to mental health-related issues

856
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,219
or cancers that are undetected.

857
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:56,519
So there is proper data on that now, is it, so you can actually look at –

858
01:03:56,519 --> 01:04:00,039
It's still hard to disentangle.

859
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:01,699
The data are still being developed.

860
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:05,000
I have not seen a clean study that nails that issue as yet.

861
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,219
So I don't know with any certainty with that.

862
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:11,960
But if it's like anywhere else in the world, those kinds of considerations

863
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,400
will have consequences in lives lost in Australia.

864
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,440
But at the same time, like Australia vaccinated a large part of its population.

865
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:25,820
A lot of the vaccination happened 9, 10, 11 – quite a long time ago.

866
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,500
And so when the virus swept through the population in Australia,

867
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,500
Australia –

868
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:31,679
Australia –

869
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:31,699
Australia –

870
01:04:31,699 --> 01:04:34,320
Australia has more cases per capita through the whole pandemic

871
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,780
than the United States has.

872
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:40,579
So there was a lot of – a lot of people who were exposed to the virus

873
01:04:40,579 --> 01:04:45,780
and their vaccines – you know, so the protection the vaccine provides

874
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,760
against disease spread had already expired.

875
01:04:48,099 --> 01:04:51,599
That's why – that's why you've had such a widespread number of cases.

876
01:04:52,619 --> 01:04:55,340
Even the protection against severe disease, it started to wane

877
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:56,360
in some of the older people.

878
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:01,679
So it's both COVID deaths and also deaths from –

879
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:07,179
from the lockdowns, combining in Australia to produce very high total excess deaths.

880
01:05:07,179 --> 01:05:09,300
There's two final questions to ask you.

881
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,920
But I've got to ask you one before I do that.

882
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:20,579
And that is – clearly vaccines are something you're passionate about on a world scale.

883
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:22,599
But the idea of mandating vaccines – where did you sit on that?

884
01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:25,860
I think it was an enormous error.

885
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:28,500
When a public health authority mandates a vaccine, that is an admission of failure.

886
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:29,619
It's an admission of failure.

887
01:05:29,619 --> 01:05:31,360
Because public health authorities were not against the vaccine.

888
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:36,699
public health when it works best it has the trust of the population and so when it has the trust of

889
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:40,159
the population the public health authorities can say you know this is a really good idea here's

890
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:45,039
what we know here's what we don't know uh if you're older here's what the risks are but here's

891
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:50,440
the benefits they're really good you should get vaccinated and then people listen because they

892
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:56,119
trust the public health authorities when you're doing a mandate not only is a signal of distrust

893
01:05:56,119 --> 01:06:01,219
like i don't trust the public therefore i have to force you to do this it also creates distrust

894
01:06:01,219 --> 01:06:06,860
reciprocally it creates this this resistance movement by people who are like saying well

895
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:10,380
you know i'm not sure it's good for me why are you being forcing me to do this if you think it's

896
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:14,940
good for me why just explain to me what's going on it's created this um and so i think that's

897
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:20,760
what's happened i've seen in the united states and elsewhere a an expansion in the set of people

898
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:25,880
who distrust public health and now we're distrusting uh good advice from public health a

899
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:31,079
reduction in um in vaccination of children against really deadly

900
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:31,199
disease

901
01:06:31,219 --> 01:06:37,159
like polio uh like measles um and we're seeing a resurgence of cases for instance in polio that

902
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:43,960
actually made quite a bit of progress in in toward eradicating um it's a real problem and i think the

903
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:48,679
mandates uh it was it was they were premised on the idea that they would it was necessary to

904
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:54,840
vaccinate 80 90 of the population and then the disease would go away we didn't ever have the

905
01:06:54,840 --> 01:07:00,460
evidence to say that that was going to be true the vaccine does not stop disease spread it's very

906
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:01,079
clear i mean we're not going to have the evidence to say that that was going to be true the vaccine

907
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:03,900
does not stop i mean why else would australia for instance which is so heavily vaccinated

908
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:09,440
have such a large number of cases i mean i got the vaccine in april 2021 and i got covid in 20

909
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:13,719
august of 2021 which was the opposite of the public health message jay that was told you

910
01:07:13,719 --> 01:07:19,059
you take this to save the lives of those around you so again the evidence that you're telling

911
01:07:19,059 --> 01:07:25,460
you know is is is completely the opposite to the actuality and again that just leads to to further

912
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:30,940
distrust doesn't and the message was there that if you caught coronavirus naturally recovered from

913
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:35,260
it naturally that your antibodies weren't effective as well that was another message that for the

914
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:40,860
first time in history your your own uh you know when nervous system and immune system wasn't

915
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:46,300
working so it's uh you know again as you said that creates distrust doesn't it it doesn't allow

916
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:51,260
they could have used the vaccine for focus protection just like sweden did

917
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:54,460
vaccinate older people who are really at high risk of dying and then

918
01:07:54,460 --> 01:08:00,780
um to be honest with the public that this is the best we can do really um don't try to force people

919
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:05,940
who have very low benefit of the vaccine to get vaccinated on the false premise that my vaccine

920
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:09,559
protects you when it doesn't uh and the evidence from the world around the world is clear that

921
01:08:09,559 --> 01:08:13,800
doesn't it was manipulative and wrong it's created distrust that it's going to be hard to repair

922
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:20,140
i see your story as one of the great leadership stories in in recent times and and you know to

923
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:25,579
stand up and say i am prepared to give up my working life i'm prepared for the consequences

924
01:08:25,579 --> 01:08:30,859
because my principles and my values suggest that this is greater than uh than the consequences

925
01:08:30,939 --> 01:08:35,500
it takes incredible courage and leadership and in that context i want to ask you who's been the

926
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:43,890
greatest leader in your life oh there's so many um i mean i i've had i had mentors that uh uh

927
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:50,609
in academics um uh one of them was like now the the head of uh he's the provost at harvard now

928
01:08:50,609 --> 01:08:57,649
um who was a a big example to me through my career um but i have to say like that in in

929
01:08:57,649 --> 01:09:02,529
um in the context of and of course my parents i mean i i can't i it's just hard it's impossible

930
01:09:02,609 --> 01:09:09,090
to not not not uh not not think of them um but i think during the context of this pandemic the the

931
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:14,449
two other authors of the great barrington declaration sinatra gupta and martin kuhldorf

932
01:09:14,449 --> 01:09:20,369
have paid enormous price for their leadership even more than me i think in many ways uh martin

933
01:09:20,369 --> 01:09:25,250
um was let go from his job at harvard actually uh uh he's now on leave i think

934
01:09:26,689 --> 01:09:31,970
and he was willing to sacrifice that uh sinatra also faced tremendous like

935
01:09:32,609 --> 01:09:38,609
tremendous threats to her career to her personal life and uh didn't need to speak up but both did

936
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:43,970
and i've been absolutely inspired by them uh another colleague of mine at stanford is a man

937
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:49,649
named johnny anitis who is probably the world's most uh famous um science well certainly world's

938
01:09:49,649 --> 01:09:56,609
most cited scientist um who again spoke up uh early and has continued to do amazing work i think

939
01:09:56,609 --> 01:10:01,569
he's probably like 70 papers during the pandemic much more quiet in terms of like public presence

940
01:10:01,569 --> 01:10:02,130
but he's trying

941
01:10:02,609 --> 01:10:07,409
and tremendous work to inform the the to do the science that has informed

942
01:10:07,409 --> 01:10:13,250
a lot of the the thinking or the on on lockdowns on on on a whole range of issues um

943
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:20,850
i looked at those folks as tremendous leaders all in their own own different ways in in intellectual

944
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:27,810
leadership in moral leadership um and uh i'm christian too so that that i i think uh those

945
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:32,449
those commitments have been provided to me a real example of what what uh what what it means

946
01:10:32,609 --> 01:10:37,890
to sacrifice and why that kind of sacrifices i've learned it firsthand i've been more theoretical

947
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:42,529
before the pandemic why that kind of sacrifice is important yeah thanks for for sharing that again

948
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:47,250
and we saw lots of medical professionals here in uh in australia that uh were silenced and threatened

949
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:52,289
to be disbarred for wanting to enter the public debate like you did and so again it's it's a

950
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:58,289
massive sacrifice of of leadership to do that a final question joe for me in the sense of

951
01:10:58,289 --> 01:11:02,449
collaboration um we're passionate about it and the leadership work that we do if you could collaborate

952
01:11:02,609 --> 01:11:07,489
with anyone in the world and you've done that with your great colleagues and other extraordinary

953
01:11:07,489 --> 01:11:12,130
academic institutions is there someone you think god if i could collaborate with them on any area

954
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:17,489
there's lots of diverse passions that you've got is there anyone that springs to mind i mean at

955
01:11:17,489 --> 01:11:23,569
this point i i've been now exposed to some incredible scholars uh what i my passion now

956
01:11:23,569 --> 01:11:29,729
is uh in addition to in addition to the post-mortem about the lockdowns and uh and a good

957
01:11:29,729 --> 01:11:32,130
discussion about that uh so that we don't do this again

958
01:11:32,609 --> 01:11:39,170
i want i want to talk about how to reform science and uh science is broken like what what's happened

959
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:43,890
during the pandemic is it the the normal processes where we can talk to each other scientists and we

960
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:49,649
learn from each other that's that's really broken like the trust that's needed for scientists to

961
01:11:49,649 --> 01:11:54,210
have good faith conversations in many ways have been broken i want to help restore that the other

962
01:11:54,210 --> 01:12:02,050
thing is a conversation i'd like to have with with uh with many leaders i've met about about uh what

963
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:10,449
should science play in society right so am i really do i really have the wisdom to order society

964
01:12:10,449 --> 01:12:17,649
so i i think my view is that scientists should be on tap not on top we should be advising

965
01:12:17,649 --> 01:12:22,930
um and so i wanna i wanna work with political leaders i'm like ron desantis i think is an

966
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:28,770
amazing man actually the governor of florida uh i've been so impressed by him in his leadership

967
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:31,970
i would love to work together with with political leaders

968
01:12:32,609 --> 01:12:36,649
with faith leaders, so that we can have a conversation about what place should science

969
01:12:36,649 --> 01:12:41,989
have, and with scientists, what place should science have in society? Are we willing to

970
01:12:41,989 --> 01:12:48,550
replace our liberal democracies with a technocracy? I mean, that's essentially what we've had. We've

971
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:53,390
had a few scientific leaders order society the last two and a half years. Was that a good idea

972
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:59,270
or a bad idea? I think that's a conversation I'd love to collaborate with many people I've met in

973
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:03,090
the pandemic, and not just scientists, because that's an all-society conversation.

974
01:13:03,649 --> 01:13:08,229
What a fascinating final answer. And as you said, science is broken, and to be able to have these

975
01:13:08,229 --> 01:13:13,890
discussions and highlight them, and for you to want to bring that back to the table, I can't

976
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:18,989
help it. There's always a supplementary question to me. There is an old saying, when you look at

977
01:13:18,989 --> 01:13:24,130
something and you sound a bit like a conspiracy, follow the money. Is science broken because of

978
01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:29,090
the money and that people are so incentivized to not want to debate?

979
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:33,989
Is that something that needs to be overcome, that the institutions that make billions and

980
01:13:33,989 --> 01:13:39,649
billions out of these decisions have got such a stranglehold on science? Or am I being naive?

981
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:43,930
Is that being a small part? No, it's not that I'm an economist. Of course, I think money is an

982
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:48,369
important driver of human behavior. So I'm not disagreeing with that, but I don't think that's

983
01:13:48,369 --> 01:13:54,170
the central problem. I think the central problem is one of power. During the pandemic, it became

984
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:59,189
clear that if you were an epidemiologist, immunologist,

985
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:05,250
extroverologist, you have tremendous power over the minds of billions and the fates of billions.

986
01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:11,489
And that created a lot of dysfunction within science itself. It created incentives for

987
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:17,989
climbing the social hierarchy within science. I think it's like, what does the Lord Atkins

988
01:14:17,989 --> 01:14:23,430
said? Power corrupts absolutely, power corrupts absolutely, right? I think that that is the

989
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:29,250
central problem within science. It's become such a powerful tool to reorder society,

990
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:37,109
that it has undermined the kinds of mechanisms that would normally allow it to gain that power

991
01:14:37,109 --> 01:14:41,970
to begin with. They gain that power because it produces wisdom. It produces knowledge. And that

992
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:46,789
knowledge and wisdom comes from openness, from a liberal willingness and a good faith discussion

993
01:14:46,789 --> 01:14:53,109
with other people. But by being so successful, it created this power that then has undermined

994
01:14:53,109 --> 01:14:58,750
the capacity to have that good faith discussion. So there's this like, there's this sort of,

995
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:10,329
the success that it had in producing vaccines and producing knowledge has itself created the

996
01:15:10,329 --> 01:15:15,250
conditions that have undermined it. So I think it's worse than just money. It's something

997
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:20,010
deep within science itself that we as scientists need to come to terms with and

998
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:29,109
develop guardrails around. So we don't have this sort of overarching hubris that you've

999
01:15:29,109 --> 01:15:33,670
seen from scientists, I think, during the pandemic. Science on tap, not on top is a

1000
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:41,109
brilliant message. And your art of condensing your theories is clearly becoming a great skill as well.

1001
01:15:41,109 --> 01:15:46,489
Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, it's been fascinating. I've got a hundred more questions, but in the

1002
01:15:46,489 --> 01:15:51,289
interest of time, I appreciate you sharing with us some of your wisdom. And thanks again so much for
