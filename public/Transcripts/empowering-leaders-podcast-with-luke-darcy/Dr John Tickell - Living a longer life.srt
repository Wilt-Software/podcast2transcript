1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,480
a listener production. Dr. John Tickell is someone I have been looking forward to having

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,220
on the podcast for a long time. A remarkable Australian medical doctor who has spent several

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,579
decades traveling the world, studying health and spreading the knowledge of some of the world's

4
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:23,379
longest living people. John is immensely passionate about his work and you'll hear

5
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:27,980
that right throughout the chat, the way he presents his messages, but also walks the walk

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,100
and practices them at the same time is extremely admirable. And if you're wanting to live a

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,520
healthier and longer life, John is someone you should definitely be listening to. Leaders like

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,420
Dr. John Tickell are the type of industry movers that I have been talking to the business, a leader

9
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,520
which was co-founded with my great friend, Matt Waterwitz. It's a place where leaders can

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,179
collaborate and learn from one another. And we've had the privilege of working with some incredible

11
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:57,179
people in the program, like Mike Dunlap, the assistant coach, the Morky Bucks, who's been on

12
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:02,140
this program. Eddie Jones as well from English Rugby, the head coach, Andy Lee from Hamish and

13
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,079
Andy, just to name a few.

14
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,620
You don't have to be a coach or a world-leading comedian to be part of it though. We are equally

15
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,719
passionate about collaborating with small business owners, executives, whatever you do,

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,280
we all bring value to the types of environments we have at Alita. You can find out more about it,

18
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:27,379
program I'm talking about and understand how people like Dr. John Tickell are collaborating

19
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:42,400
and leading in their world. Dr. John Tickell is a medical doctor,

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,219
an international speaker, best-selling author, television personality who has spent several

21
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,599
decades traveling and studying the health, well-being and longevity patterns of people

22
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,579
around the world. He applies his own powerful formula of activity, eating and coping skills,

23
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,620
which draw on his medical experience, extensive international research and the lifestyle patterns

24
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,739
of the longest living people on earth, the Okinawans. John played senior AFL football for

25
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:11,060
the Hawthorne Football Club in the 1960s, has produced a number one top 40 hit record,

26
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,879
created and developed the Hyatt Regency Coolum International Resort and Spa,

27
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,800
the Heritage Golf and Country Club in the Yarra Valley. And John himself is a cancer survivor

28
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,500
and renowned globally as one of the world's most respected voices in health and well-being.

29
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,840
John, it's great to see you again. Thanks for your time today.

30
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:34,319
Luke, you remind me of the Western Oval. I played one game for Hawthorne against the Bulldogs.

31
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:40,699
The whole game was played in one half because of the wind, like one half of the ground.

32
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,919
Oh, I'm happy to take you back. So that would have been 1960-ish, yeah?

33
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,259
65, 66.

34
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,180
The great John Schultz would have been there from the Bulldogs' point of view. My dad wouldn't have

35
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,460
been far away, actually, John. He started in 1962. So I'm glad we remind you of that. The

36
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,919
Witten Oval, as it is now, is a great place. I've got to-

37
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,379
What's the second windiest ground?

38
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,060
Well, Witten Oval would have to be there. It was probably the muddiest ground in history.

39
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:09,400
Glen Ferry Oval was the muddiest. Windy Hill was the second.

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:09,620
Windy Hill.

41
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:09,979
Yeah.

42
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,819
So much to talk to you about, John. And I'll maybe start, I mean, I love reading and listening

43
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:23,419
to, has done for many, many years. I think I met you as an 18 or 19-year-old. But the clear

44
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:28,719
thinking, plain language, easy to understand principles of living a healthy life that have

45
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,020
been your life. Can I start there? Can you give us, what are the keys to living a healthy life?

46
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,500
I call them the A-skills. Now, I have stolen these from the longest living, healthiest people

47
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:40,900
on earth.

48
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,099
You mentioned the Okinawans. They live in islands off the southern ends of Japan. A is

49
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:52,479
activity. So there's no guy on the gate of the fields where they grow their food saying

50
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:57,099
you're 65, go home and watch TV. I mean, you retire. It's a pretty funny word. I mean,

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,400
you're tired. Luke, why would you want to get re-tired? I mean, what do you do when

52
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,800
you're re-tired? What do you do up the back shed and do the garden? Then you go on a cruise

53
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,080
and get fatter and fatter. And then what do you do? You come home and do up the garden

54
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,039
and do up the back shed. I mean, re-tire is one of that Western thing.

55
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,360
It's one of those Western disasters that somebody's invented. So A is activity. You've

56
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:23,720
got to keep active. C is coping. We're talking off air about 20 years ago, you couldn't cope,

57
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:28,019
so you had to get better at it. And then, oh, you're full of stress. Your stress has

58
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:34,839
got you. And now you've got mental health issues. The last three years, some people

59
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:39,800
beyond blue, blah, blah, say the 63% have got mental health issues. It's not. It's 100%.

60
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,279
We've all had mental health issues, anxiety in the last three years, but it's how you

61
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:52,680
cope with it. So A, activity. C, coping. And E, eating. We are one of the top 10 worst

62
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,660
food eaters in the world. Like just one fast food, I won't mention their name, the big

63
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,540
M, is 2 million meals a day we buy. In Australia.

64
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:08,420
That's just one fast food. 2 million a day. Because why? Well, I haven't got time. I'm

65
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:08,660
busy.

66
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:17,120
Well, my mum, my grandma, my wife, my wife's worked all her life. I mean, she used to cook

67
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,279
when our kids were growing up. We had five kids, so I think they're all mine. Luckily

68
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,860
they look like Sue. But yeah, there was six to 10 veggies on their plate every night and

69
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,360
some, whatever you call it, protein, you know, fish and meat and chicken and all that sort

70
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,740
of stuff. But plant food, see, the human being was born not as a carnivore. Carnivores like

71
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,579
dogs and tigers. They have claws, not fingers. They have very short legs. They have very

72
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:43,720
short intestines. We've got intestines that wind all the way down. I mean, do you know

73
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,819
how many people died of bowel cancer last week in Australia?

74
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:47,300
How many?

75
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:47,899
77.

76
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,379
Yeah.

77
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,420
It's 11 a day die of bowel cancer because we eat all this crap. And that's a bad word,

78
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,839
crap, but it's an acronym, commercially refined and processed. So most of our food we eat,

79
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:00,959
our kids are eating crap.

80
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:07,240
And John, I love, in recent times, I find you on LinkedIn and you go after the carnivores

81
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,459
in that space.

82
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:08,920
Yeah.

83
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:08,939
Yeah.

84
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:08,959
Yeah.

85
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:08,980
Yeah.

86
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah.

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,040
Yeah.

88
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,060
Yeah.

89
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,079
Yeah.

90
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,100
Yeah.

91
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,120
Yeah.

92
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,180
Yeah.

93
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,199
Yeah.

94
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,220
Yeah.

95
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:09,279
Yeah.

96
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:09,300
Yeah.

97
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:09,399
Yeah.

98
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:14,079
When you break it down like that, it makes sense, doesn't it? So there's a million diets,

99
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,000
there's a million fads that come through, but yours is very simple, isn't it? Two-thirds

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,259
of your diet should be plant-based foods and the other third, you call them bonus foods.

101
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:26,680
Do you know what a diet is? It's an acronym for did I eat that? And that lasts 14 days

102
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,939
or 21 days. And then you go back to the other stuff and you put all the weight back on.

103
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:35,120
I mean, it's the yo-yo stuff. And the first three letters in the word diet are die. So

104
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,480
if you go on diets all your life, you know, you're more likely to die because of that

105
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,279
swinging weight. You're increasing your percentage of body fat because when you lose

106
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:51,079
weight quickly, you're losing muscle. When you turn 25, Luke, you're more than 25. Do

107
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:56,899
you realise, probably not you, we as a majority lose 1% of our muscle bulk efficiency and

108
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:02,879
power every year. So if you live till you're 125, you'll have no muscle left. But if we

109
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,040
live to 65, 40% of our muscles have gone because we don't use them.

110
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:08,360
Yeah.

111
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:09,459
And we need to.

112
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:13,220
And we need to, as you said, you go back and we're going to jump around a little bit here,

113
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,000
but there's so much to talk to you about. The Okinawans who you studied and you have

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,720
the Blue Zone communities, which I'm fascinated by. You go to Sardinia in Italy or the communities

115
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,019
that you know really well. I mean, they're in the rice fields. They were historically

116
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:31,259
in their 90s, still working, still connected to community. And more revered with age, weren't

117
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,699
they, those communities? The elders were respected in a way because they had more knowledge.

118
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,759
It's another thing we've lost a little bit in the West.

119
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,439
You're on the money there. They have a thing in the Okinawan village.

120
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:45,500
They don't live in 90-storey buildings, apartments on floor 87 with no oven. There's

121
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,779
a microwave, no backyard for the kids to play in. I mean, what are we doing to our kids?

122
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,879
The biggest, I'm getting off the subject here, Luke, the biggest, you've got what, four kids?

123
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:56,480
Four kids, yeah.

124
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,180
So if they're healthy, that means you and your wife have been good role models. But

125
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,540
if a kid sees you eating, you know, there's bags of lollies in the cupboard and all that

126
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,439
sort of stuff, and you're eating chocolates.

127
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,800
Every night and all that sort of stuff. They think that's normal. But if you, if Nan and

128
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,980
Sue goes for a walk around the block, the grandkids are going, yeah, let's go for a

129
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:23,100
walk with Nan and Sue. So it's so much of what you do rubs off. Your kids have got an

130
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,519
85% chance of ending up like you or your wife for a combination of both. Now, what was your

131
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:27,839
question?

132
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,120
About the Okinawans and their ability to keep working, as you said before, that retire.

133
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,120
I love what you said there. My father-in-law is 84, still runs his legal business.

134
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:45,340
Business trains every day. And that inspiration flying through to see a grandparent who's

135
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,639
still strong and still, you know, connected to all of them. I mean, he's never going to

136
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:55,120
retire. The day he does will be the day that he's had enough, I think. And so I'm with

137
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,059
you on that. I feel like we've lost our way, haven't we, a little bit in these conversations

138
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:02,919
in the West around how we eat, how we role model and how we live our life.

139
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:09,419
And the COVID episode, we'll call it an episode, it started.

140
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,200
To distance people and then we cotton onto this thing called, there's a thing called

141
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,159
the internet. Have you ever heard of that? And Zoom and all that sort of stuff. So at

142
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:23,240
least it kept us together. But still, when I speak at a conference, which I'm doing a

143
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:29,039
bit more face-to-face now, to be in the same room as people like the Okinawans at sundown

144
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:34,080
every night, they have a thing called Ayakura, where the elders sit on the lawn in the middle

145
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,159
of the village and all the young kids go and touch them on the back to get the, the Ayakura

146
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:44,980
called goodness flowing. So if you touch somebody who's over the age of 90, because

147
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:50,399
the Okinawans think you're not an elder till you're 90. Now, most people in our society

148
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,299
are dead when they're 90, they're under the ground. And so it's the goodness flowing from,

149
00:09:56,299 --> 00:10:03,259
so you can't buy wisdom and you can't buy experience. So to have a retire age at 65

150
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:07,039
is quite bizarre. And one of the things that I think your message

151
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,000
to me is, there's so many powerful messages, but I think it's important to know that you

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,320
know, you've got all the stats and I'm sitting, I love it. You've brought the deaths with

153
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,360
you and I can see all the numbers. Australia has become, you know, one of the cancer capitals

154
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,539
of the world. We're close to the Americans now for, you know, obesity issues. And as

155
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:25,860
your research will tell you, obese kids become obese adults. And then we have all of these

156
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,179
Western diseases that you call them, the CHADS, the cancers, the heart disease, the Alzheimer's,

157
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:35,000
the diabetes. But all your research and all your history says that so much of that is

158
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,519
our lifestyle and we can control them.

159
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,519
I mean, you don't hear medical professionals say, you know, you're going to die, you're

160
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,899
going to die. You don't hear medical professionals talking like that. Why is that the case?

161
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:51,259
Well, when I grew up in the medical degree studies, you get taught a couple of things.

162
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:57,340
You get called, they call it diagnosis, then they call it therapy. And so when you're diagnosed

163
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:05,460
with something, you've got three options. You prescribe a drug or you say, go and see

164
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,480
the surgeon because if in doubt, cut it out. You know, that was the old man.

165
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,519
Yeah.

166
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,539
So you don't get the answer of the surgeons. That's why they like people lying on a bed

167
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:19,299
with no consciousness because whatever's wrong, they chop it out. Now, I started to wonder

168
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:25,220
in my general practice out in Whittlesea with Dr. Read, who sadly passed on his way through

169
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,320
asbestos cancer.

170
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,919
The great Bruce Read, who was the Essendon footy club doctor for four years plus.

171
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:29,919
Yeah. He was here.

172
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,639
So you two started in practice together, did you?

173
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,039
Yeah. Well, that's an interesting thing. Would you want to go to a lawyer that's still practicing,

174
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,519
or would you want them to be better than that?

175
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,059
So, yeah, we started out practising, then we got perfect.

176
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,600
So, Dr. Reid and I and Ian Reynolds.

177
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,620
But then we started to have a coffee out the back, you know,

178
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,360
half-time, whatever they call it, in the practice.

179
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:56,000
So, why are so many people coming in here, they're sick?

180
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,700
Now, one of the things was the waiting room for the older people,

181
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,100
the pensioners, was a social outing.

182
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,740
So, relating that to the Okinawans, they grow up in villages

183
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,799
where they meet often and they play cards and they go for walks together

184
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:15,460
and play bingo and whatever you do when you're in a village.

185
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,059
I mean, we don't live in villages.

186
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:20,039
They call them retirement villages in Australia,

187
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,879
but I'd call them activity villages.

188
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:27,879
I mean, I reckon instead of frequent flyer points, like, Luke,

189
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:34,419
just say your family had fitness, family fitness points, FF points,

190
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,399
not frequent flyer, family fitness points.

191
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,460
So, on a chart every week,

192
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:37,720
you'd tick the list of family fitness points.

193
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,039
You'd tick off how many stairs you climbed.

194
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:43,980
I mean, I climbed back surgery a year ago because I had something wrong

195
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,019
because I played that stupid game called AFL.

196
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,440
And anyway, so they've sort of fixed me.

197
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,539
But I can't run anymore because I'm getting old,

198
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:54,899
but I climb 500 stairs a day.

199
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:56,779
People say, why?

200
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,340
Because I was born with 600 muscles and 180 joints.

201
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,179
And if you sit them in a chair all day or in front of a computer,

202
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:05,940
they're going to seize up.

203
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,740
They're going to get rusty.

204
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,480
You are going to get...

205
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,019
You're going to get arthritis.

206
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,539
So, at whatever age I am, I'm waiting for a telegram from the Queen.

207
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,519
How old are you?

208
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:14,980
Can I ask that?

209
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,659
Well, if the Queen was around, I'd get a telegram in 22 years.

210
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,059
Yeah.

211
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:23,159
So, but people say...

212
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,620
See, the other thing, we sit at this.

213
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,940
Now, Luke, 93% of everything you do is in front of your body.

214
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,379
So, would you mind if I took five seconds off to lean back

215
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,419
and do some backward shoulder rolls like this?

216
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,460
So, why doesn't everyone do backward shoulder rolls?

217
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,840
Every half hour, you know, to get your spine moving.

218
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,379
So, we don't think of those sort of little things.

219
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,679
So, if you work to a plan that I've stolen,

220
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,679
the ACE plan, activity, coping, eating,

221
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,620
from the longest living, healthiest people on earth,

222
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:55,840
we might start preventing...

223
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,820
I mean, the last lunch I had was with Olivia Newton-John.

224
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,700
I work with the O&J Cancer Wellness Centre.

225
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,559
We're going to start next year a big thing on prevention.

226
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,559
The best way to handle cancer is not...

227
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:07,960
Forget it.

228
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:10,899
Australia is now the cancer capital of the world.

229
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,080
We get more cancers per head than any population on earth.

230
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:14,879
Why?

231
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:17,120
Because governments are useless.

232
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,100
They don't prevent.

233
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,799
They just promise to build more hospitals

234
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:24,279
and get more ambulances on time and all that sort of stuff.

235
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,440
And that's when you're sick.

236
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,000
So, the health department should be called the sick department.

237
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,919
We're going to start...

238
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,299
O&J and I, we're going to start a prevention department

239
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:35,580
to stop people getting the CHAD diseases.

240
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,299
And your latest book...

241
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,539
You know, Your Best Immunity, which is brilliant.

242
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,100
The Build Resistance, The Ace Way.

243
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,720
It's a brilliant guide.

244
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,980
And I can't help, John, in the current world being struck by...

245
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,179
We've just come out of...

246
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,200
You and I both live in Melbourne,

247
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:51,980
a city that has...

248
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,179
The title is the most locked down city in the world

249
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:57,000
through the COVID period of time.

250
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:59,179
Give or take, maybe China's gone past it now.

251
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,039
But we had public health officials standing before us every day.

252
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:04,220
And we got to know these people.

253
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,480
We hadn't heard of them before.

254
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,139
We didn't know Melbourne or Brett Sutton-Wiles.

255
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:07,460
We didn't...

256
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,039
No one in America had heard of Anthony Fauci before.

257
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,259
Or all these people became well-known

258
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:14,259
because they were controlling our lives.

259
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,980
So, we got to know them.

260
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,419
But I didn't hear once anyone talk about the things

261
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:20,559
you can do yourself to get a better immunity.

262
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,340
No talk about the things you're passionate about,

263
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,679
nutrition and exercise and the ace way to living,

264
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,039
community and family.

265
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,399
Why are our public health officials not singing

266
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,620
from the same hymn book you are about looking after your own health?

267
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,100
Because public officials are in one business.

268
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:37,460
It's called winning the next election.

269
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:41,360
So, promising things that you can touch and feel.

270
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,200
So, you can't...

271
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,840
I can promise prevention.

272
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,279
The second most important thing in your body after your brain

273
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,639
is called your immune system,

274
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:52,580
which is made up of spleen, liver, all the little lymph nodes

275
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,519
and all those sort of things.

276
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,799
The reason so many people died with or alongside another illness,

277
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:02,080
associated with COVID,

278
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,919
and don't forget 90% of deaths are in people over 70,

279
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,080
because when you've got a lousy...

280
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,860
If you've got a lousy immune system, which is your fault,

281
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,360
vaccines have got nothing to work on.

282
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:17,100
See, the way vaccines work is to improve your immune system as it is.

283
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:19,759
So, if you've got very bad immunity,

284
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,580
the vaccine's wandering around saying,

285
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,820
yeah, but what am I going to boost?

286
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:23,740
What am I going to work on?

287
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:26,240
So, a magic vaccine doesn't work.

288
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,860
Like, all these anti-vaxxers saying vaccines don't work.

289
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,899
UNICEF, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund,

290
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,299
was founded in 1946.

291
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:36,639
Vaccines were invented in the late 30s.

292
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,940
Vaccines have saved kids' lives $3 million a year for the last 75 years.

293
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,340
So, vaccines do work.

294
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,899
You've got to have an immune system.

295
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,940
And look, this is an interesting conversation, John,

296
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,759
because you can't have conversation around this now.

297
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,679
You're either cancelled or you're out.

298
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,600
And to me, you know, I think you need to be able to have these conversations publicly

299
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,039
so people can educate themselves.

300
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:02,779
The problem I've got is that we're public health officials stand there, John,

301
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:06,619
and say, you need to take this product because you are letting down,

302
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,440
the people around you, and you are going to put at risk other people.

303
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:11,700
And we now know that was a complete falsehood.

304
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,900
The CEO of Pfizer and the executives at the commission hearings in Europe

305
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,200
are now saying, no, that product didn't prevent transmission of the illness.

306
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,960
It was there to try and reduce severity of it.

307
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:28,380
So, when you've got people in leadership roles, John, not telling the truth,

308
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,700
that leads people to question efficacy.

309
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,480
And I think you're right to be able to do that.

310
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,460
You think I'm right?

311
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,420
I mean, the Minister of Housing, on a Friday,

312
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,380
can be the Minister of Health on Monday.

313
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,720
And what do they know about housing except a big bunch of files?

314
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,160
Nothing.

315
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,440
So, do you think that's a failure again in public health, John, around?

316
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,660
And if the graph was trending towards plus 70-year-olds and 80-year-olds

317
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,559
with underlying health issues, perhaps a targeted approach

318
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,740
may have been something to consider as opposed to a mandating response.

319
00:17:58,019 --> 00:17:59,740
So, I'm not questioning the efficacy.

320
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,920
But I think the fact that we can't actually have that conversation

321
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,799
causes people to be sceptical.

322
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,039
Well, I'm very sceptical about the thousands of kids that are vaping.

323
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:13,319
There's a change of tact, isn't there?

324
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,779
I know you're passionate about the world of smoking

325
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:20,259
and the fact that that still kills tens and tens of thousands of people here in Australia.

326
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:22,539
Smoking kills 53 people a day.

327
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,599
But the government doesn't care because the government gets $14 billion in taxes

328
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:29,839
by deliberately allowing people to die from smoking.

329
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,200
And now we've got bubblegum-flavoured vape products aimed at the young.

330
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,180
I can fix vaping in six months.

331
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:36,960
How?

332
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:43,460
I know two school principals who've agreed to put smoke detectors in their dunnies

333
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,140
because that's where most kids smoke.

334
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:49,720
And the kids identified and their parents have fined $2,000

335
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,220
for every time a kid's vaping.

336
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:54,960
So, you take a really punitive approach and just say...

337
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,160
Well, why are you fined if you go through a school zone?

338
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,880
$350 and five points.

339
00:18:59,700 --> 00:18:59,960
Yeah.

340
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,579
Why did Dictator Dan fine $1,650 for being more than five k's from your house, not six?

341
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:06,740
Right?

342
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,599
People say you can't do it.

343
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:08,819
People say you can't do that.

344
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:17,819
Why was Australia the first country in that world to make seatbelts compulsory in 1970?

345
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:26,539
Because war on 1034 with the Herald Sun was, in 1969, 1,034 people died on the Victorian roads.

346
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:31,180
Now, with compulsory seatbelts, which has gone worldwide, it's 250.

347
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:36,400
So, we've brought it down by 80% with seven times as many cars.

348
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:38,519
So, being tough.

349
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:38,960
It works.

350
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,079
Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister, I connected with her the other day on a...

351
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:44,859
Of New Zealand, yeah.

352
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:45,279
Yeah.

353
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,259
In five years' time, selling a cigarette's going to be a criminal offence.

354
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,920
Bill Shelton said, oh, it'll go underground.

355
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:52,619
Good.

356
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:55,980
If you've got a packet of cigarettes, they're 20 times two grand.

357
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:56,940
That's $40,000.

358
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,420
So, if you work for 7-Eleven and dispense...

359
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,759
By the way, the ACCC, Consumer Safety Law No. 1.

360
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,700
I spoke to Josh Frydenberg about this.

361
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:07,940
All products you supply must...

362
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:09,319
Be safe.

363
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:09,960
That's our safe.

364
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,579
So, why are we handing kids cancer sticks?

365
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:16,640
14,000 got addicted to them last year.

366
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:18,440
I mean, are we done?

367
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,559
Yeah, it's a very good point you make, isn't it?

368
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,859
I mean, and again, I refer back to coming out of this period of time where we were locked

369
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:29,319
in our homes for two years on the basis that that was provided to keep you safe.

370
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,599
And then, you know, that overlooks, you know...

371
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,059
And I'm with you.

372
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,180
It's death by a thousand cuts.

373
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:37,880
People that are addicted to smoking now are spending money on something that most of them

374
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,519
can't afford.

375
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:39,640
I mean, I'm with you.

376
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,200
I mean, no.

377
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,200
I mean, that is something there is consensus on.

378
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,660
You're going to get cancer if you smoke.

379
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:45,640
So, why not?

380
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,279
I mean, that is a plausible thing for me to take.

381
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,220
Oh, people call it a nanny state, nanny state.

382
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,579
Don't forget that 90% of chronic smokers start as teenagers.

383
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,940
They don't start when they're 50.

384
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,440
And the evil of, as you said, vaping now has become every...

385
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,279
Causes lung disease.

386
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,660
The CDC, the FDA in America are putting out a monthly report with the number of deaths.

387
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,859
That's called dead from vaping.

388
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:08,500
Yeah.

389
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:09,500
Dead from vaping.

390
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:11,779
Our government are pathetic.

391
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,160
Yeah.

392
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:17,720
And you've spent a lifetime, as I said, standing the world of wisdom that we've lost, haven't

393
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,759
you, by going to these communities that live these brilliant, connected lives, you know,

394
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:23,160
around the globe.

395
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,460
Can we get it back, John?

396
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,339
I mean, can we...

397
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:26,819
And I love you're bringing back...

398
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:31,440
They are simple messages around your attitude to life actually affects your health as well.

399
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,720
And there's so much research on that.

400
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,859
Being around family is equally important.

401
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,900
I mean, it sounds logical, but we've lost our way in all that space.

402
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:38,339
Can we...

403
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,019
Can we get it back?

404
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:47,319
Only if you listen to people like me who step away from commerciality.

405
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,339
I'll give you my biggest rule of nutrition, Luke.

406
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,460
H.I.

407
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,039
Human interference.

408
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,779
So if you took six seconds to look at a food or drink before it went into that little hole

409
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:04,619
in your face and worked out how much a human being had interfered with whatever you're

410
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:05,319
going to eat or drink.

411
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,240
So if it's...

412
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,859
If it's just been picked or grown, it ends up in the greengrocer's shop.

413
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,180
There aren't any greengrocer's shop.

414
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,140
Well, there's a couple, but there's now Woolies and Coles and IGA and Aldi's and all those

415
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:19,640
sort of things.

416
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,799
Now, they have fresh food.

417
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,000
So if you buy low human interfered with food and that fills up 80% of your plate, you're

418
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,759
doing good things.

419
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:29,000
If you're buying...

420
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,420
I'll never forget the Qantas terminal at five o'clock on a Sydney.

421
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:36,759
I'd often be in a Sydney convention on a Friday and you'd line up and in the...

422
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,119
When you arrive at the airport, there's...

423
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,599
There's things to buy.

424
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,119
The biggest line of suits, guilty suits, was at the donut shop.

425
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:46,660
You had to buy...

426
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,400
Were they Dunkin' Donuts or whatever they're called?

427
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,440
You had to buy a minimum of a dozen.

428
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:55,259
So you'd see every suit walk onto the Qantas plane or the Virgin plane with a box of donuts

429
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:56,019
because they're guilty.

430
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:56,940
They haven't been home from work.

431
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:00,640
So they're bringing their kids home a million calories of fat and sugar.

432
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,619
I mean, see, we're conned, aren't we?

433
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:03,240
Yeah.

434
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,200
And that it's a powerful, powerful message, isn't it?

435
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,740
Yeah, we're interfered.

436
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,099
All the advertising and...

437
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,720
And all of the, you know...

438
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,460
And what I'm surprised by, John, the lack of education...

439
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,079
People actually now, it's gone so far, don't understand.

440
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:19,759
If you're doing that and you understand, you know, I'm going to buy, you know, 12 donuts,

441
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,200
it's in the once a month rule, the rest of the time we eat healthily.

442
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,819
I mean, you know, that's a different perspective.

443
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,000
But I think most people don't even understand the damage that that sort of food does to

444
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,079
people's health, you know, as a rule, John.

445
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,079
It's something, again, I think education has been skewed.

446
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,519
Do you agree?

447
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,519
Do we think people have lost their way on that front?

448
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,380
Well, it's interesting.

449
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,640
My wife, when she went to Geelong High School, she was the captain of Geelong High.

450
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,539
She did things like sewing and cooking and stuff in school.

451
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:59,359
But now our daughters don't know how to sew a button back on their kids' dresses out of

452
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:00,599
whatever place.

453
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,720
So it's interesting what we used to get taught into school.

454
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:06,980
But I want to bring in, I've got a thing called the indestructibles.

455
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:12,779
It's all about a fruit and vegetable village where the indestructibles live.

456
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:17,279
And they live next door to a big mountain called Mel Mountain.

457
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,119
And there's all these nasties like Nick O'Teen and Doug Drug and all these sort of things.

458
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,819
And it's a battle that goes inside in your body every day.

459
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:32,460
So the more good things you can do to your body or put in it or move it, activity, cope,

460
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,640
eat, and don't forget your brain plugs into your body.

461
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:41,119
So to make your brain work and vice versa, your body has to work.

462
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,279
So fit people are mentally more efficient.

463
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:49,579
See, I'm doing a little bit of work with the AFL now.

464
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,079
We're calling it physical fitness, mental fitness.

465
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,359
You can't part them.

466
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:57,680
And so your coach, when you're playing for the Bulldogs, would scream at you at three

467
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,319
quarter time, tell you what to do, and then abuse you, and a mix of both.

468
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,880
But if you handle that and absorb that,

469
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,359
see, if you got somebody out of the crowd at the MCG and put them on the grand final,

470
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:16,420
you know, third quarter time against Dusty Martin, like he's got training,

471
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:20,279
he's physically and mentally adaptable to what's going on there.

472
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,579
They've got a plan.

473
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,440
They've got a coach.

474
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:26,220
They're a team, no iron team and all that sort of stuff.

475
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:31,759
But if an individual from the crowd walks, there's no planning, they're physical.

476
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:36,359
Don't forget mental health and physical health can't be parted.

477
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:42,700
So my seminars now on mental health, people actually leave with a smile on their face

478
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:48,220
and said, wow, I can handle this situation better by thinking about this and doing this.

479
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,460
So routine is a big part of that, John.

480
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:55,019
And you've spoken all around the world and, you know, you've had personal consultations

481
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:59,259
with, you know, the likes of Paul McCartney and Jack Nicklaus and, you know, Kerry Packer

482
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:00,599
here in Australia, George Bush.

483
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,359
And Donald Trump.

484
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:01,859
Donald Trump.

485
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,200
Yeah.

486
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:05,859
I'd have to ask you about Donald Trump as well.

487
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:11,339
So you've been speaking about this for a long period of time and the messages are simple

488
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:17,279
around exercise and around healthy living and nutrition, but we're getting sicker in

489
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,980
the Western world and we're getting more obese and we're going backwards.

490
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:23,579
So what's failed in the message?

491
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:25,359
Why is it such a challenge?

492
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:31,809
There is no, let's go back to role modelling.

493
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:36,109
You're going to grow up like your parents, 90% chance.

494
00:26:36,109 --> 00:26:42,789
So if your parents are overweight and get fast food because they're too busy three,

495
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,730
four times a week and feed it to the kids, you know, that's a bonus once a month if you

496
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,769
win the basketball final.

497
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:51,829
So you're open for, people ask this and say, hey, hang on, John, I've got to have some

498
00:26:51,829 --> 00:26:53,670
fun in my life too and I've got to have some balance.

499
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:54,710
Do you have that?

500
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:58,250
I mean, because people look at this message and say, it's just not realistic.

501
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,710
You know, I've got to be able to, you know, but the once a month, the occasional is where

502
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,190
you're at with this to get some balance.

503
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:06,089
Well, my little brother.

504
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:08,990
My little mate, Damien Oliver, whenever he wins a race, I have a beer.

505
00:27:09,349 --> 00:27:11,369
So he's now 51.

506
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,849
There's an interesting example of mental.

507
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:16,569
I mean, he made a huge mistake in his life.

508
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,390
He had a bet on a horse, which is illegal.

509
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,210
And then he came back and he won the next Melbourne Cup.

510
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:28,569
So if that had got to him mentally and crucified the whole of his life psychologically, he

511
00:27:28,569 --> 00:27:30,009
would never have ridden another horse.

512
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:32,250
But he took his medicine.

513
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:32,970
He came back.

514
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,250
He was suspended for whatever number of months.

515
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:36,029
And then he came back.

516
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:40,269
And he won Gaywater House, the first Melbourne Cup on a horse called Fiorente.

517
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,990
I mean, the other one was what he won on Media Puzzle.

518
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,490
His son had died a week before in a race for him.

519
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,130
His brother, yeah.

520
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:48,210
His brother.

521
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:49,329
So his father died.

522
00:27:49,369 --> 00:27:49,609
Yeah.

523
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:52,990
And then his brother died a week before, Jason, over in Perth.

524
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:56,009
And Damien thought and thought and thought.

525
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:58,170
And he thought, what would Jason want me to do?

526
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,769
He'd want me to ride in the Cup.

527
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:01,430
So he wore Jason's silks.

528
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:05,609
And he won the race and waved to Jason upstairs and everything.

529
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:14,369
And so your mental toughness comes from learning, I call it the MICE approach, motivation,

530
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:18,670
inspiration, a challenge, and excitement.

531
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:24,730
So in terms of your mental efficiency or mental health, I've got three things.

532
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:26,369
You can boil it down to three things.

533
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,029
One is optimism.

534
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:33,089
Now, it's the difference between America and Australia.

535
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:35,450
In America, when you land at LAX and you get a newspaper,

536
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:37,789
it's called USA Today, and you flip it on the back,

537
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:39,849
and there are 50 forecasts for 50 states.

538
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,190
A lot of the forecasts are partly sunny.

539
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:45,990
Now, in Australia, there is not one Bureau of Meteorology

540
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,190
that has a computer button that says partly sunny.

541
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,230
It's always partly cloudy.

542
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,130
So it's mindset.

543
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:54,109
It's optimism.

544
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:58,430
I knew when I got brain cancer I was going to beat it because I was optimistic.

545
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,049
I was a new drug child of an immunotherapy drug,

546
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:04,529
and that drug wouldn't have worked if I didn't have a good immune system.

547
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:12,829
So optimism, it's called support system.

548
00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:20,210
Luke, if something goes wrong today, do you go home and talk about it with your partner?

549
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,390
How long have you been married?

550
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:23,170
Twenty years coming up this year.

551
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,470
I've done 50.

552
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,869
I'm hoping to get there, John, at some stage.

553
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:32,670
So if your partner becomes your good friend, you can actually talk to her or talk to,

554
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,710
and that's where the men's cave thing comes in because women can sit

555
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,250
around and have a cup of tea and say, oh, did you hear about something, you know,

556
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:40,829
and they work their way out.

557
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,910
When men go, no, mate, just give me another beer, I'll be right, mate.

558
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:50,789
So men's failing in terms of mental health all comes down to lack of support systems.

559
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:56,450
So in a footy club, if somebody does something, you know,

560
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,170
get pissed one night during the week or something,

561
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:04,170
they'd be scared about fronting their player group or their, what do you call it,

562
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:04,670
the something group?

563
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,190
Leadership group.

564
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,690
Leadership group.

565
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,730
And telling them because they wouldn't want other people to know.

566
00:30:08,829 --> 00:30:10,630
But then there are two sides to that story.

567
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:15,329
If you tell the leadership group and say, I'll never do it again because, as Richard Branson said,

568
00:30:15,369 --> 00:30:19,109
an entrepreneur never succeeds until they've made mistakes.

569
00:30:19,349 --> 00:30:20,710
And you learn from your mistakes.

570
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:24,769
So, and the last thing, I've invented a new pill.

571
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:25,829
What's that?

572
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:27,349
A purpose in life.

573
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:35,670
So my purpose in life for the Olivia Newton-John Foundation is to halve our cancer incidence,

574
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,970
and death, in the next 20 years.

575
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,279
I love your message, John, because it's empowering.

576
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,519
This podcast is called Empowering Leaves.

577
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,940
What you're saying is you can take back control of your own health

578
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,640
and give yourself the best possible chance by these lifestyle choices we make,

579
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,440
by coping better, however you do that, whatever the routines are that you put in place.

580
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,000
As you said, you know, the great Damien Oliver is a great story, isn't it?

581
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,859
Everyone gets hardship.

582
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:09,480
It's how you react to hardship and what you put in place.

583
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,579
And we're not going to have an absence of those challenges.

584
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:12,680
It's how we react.

585
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,420
It's the coping part, the activity part.

586
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,180
There's so many ways, as you said, whether it's 500 steps a day or whatever people choose to do.

587
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:25,240
And then the eating part is you put that together with community and health,

588
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,559
our chances of living a longer, healthy life are exponentially greater, aren't they?

589
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:32,380
Is that too simple a way to describe the message?

590
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,980
You've summed it up really well.

591
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,140
Some people, if they're in a grave depression period, say, I don't want to live, right?

592
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,339
So male suicide is way...

593
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:44,640
It's way above female suicides because women can talk to one another.

594
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,339
Number one killer for men, 24 to 54 in Australia is still suicide.

595
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:48,819
Correct.

596
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:53,880
So once again, getting back to this, I mean, what you've said is a great summary.

597
00:31:54,099 --> 00:31:56,539
Write it down on a piece of paper and we'll read it out every day.

598
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,460
See, that's the other thing.

599
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:02,779
To externalise thing, write it on a piece of paper.

600
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,839
And if you're going to send it to someone to abuse them, don't send it until the next day.

601
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:10,680
Because what's it going to do for them and what's it going to do for you?

602
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,460
Is it going to make you feel...

603
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:11,900
Is it going to make you feel terrific?

604
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,279
Because the next day you're saying, no, I shouldn't be saying that.

605
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:19,140
But if you externalise your thoughts and read them yourself again tomorrow and say, righto,

606
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,180
is there anyone worse off from...

607
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,579
What's happened to me?

608
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Is there somebody worse off?

609
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,880
Okay, I'm going to handle this.

610
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,880
I'm going to be optimistic.

611
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,200
I'm going to have a support system and I'm going to have a purpose in life.

612
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:35,400
I'm going to use this to fix something in the world or about me.

613
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:36,819
So...

614
00:32:36,819 --> 00:32:38,759
I love that little bit of advice, John, isn't it?

615
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:41,400
So I've had that told me, you know, when you...

616
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:46,519
Fire that email off, you know, with the reaction to just pause for a day quite often, just

617
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:49,680
not even hitting send because you've typed it out and...

618
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:55,000
And most people who send an abusive email or a scamming email or whatever email, I can't

619
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,579
even spell.

620
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:04,039
You've had a fascinating life and so much diversity in it and, you know, I'll come back.

621
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,980
I need to ask you about Donald Trump at some stage.

622
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:08,099
But you've also then gone and not...

623
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:10,680
As an entrepreneur and the Hyatt Coulomb...

624
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,019
Is an incredible commercial achievement.

625
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:15,759
Was?

626
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,160
Yeah.

627
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:16,380
Yeah.

628
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,779
Clive Palmer took it over.

629
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:18,420
Well, that's right.

630
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:22,099
Put dinosaurs all across the course and then you built the Heritage Golf Club in the area.

631
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,480
Tell us about using your intellect and your skills in that space.

632
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:30,920
What sort of, you know, from a medical professional and a former AFL player, what drove you into

633
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,279
that world?

634
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,230
Yeah, that's...

635
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,450
It's interesting when you answer a question with, that's a very good question.

636
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,230
It gives you 30 seconds to think.

637
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:41,990
I...

638
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,450
I...

639
00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:46,130
See, the other thing I'm going to ask you, Luke, before I answer the question, have you

640
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,970
got three people in your life that you call heroes?

641
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:50,670
Yes.

642
00:33:50,849 --> 00:33:51,329
Yeah, I have.

643
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:51,650
Yeah.

644
00:33:51,789 --> 00:33:52,329
Name them.

645
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,329
Oh, my dad was definitely a hero of mine.

646
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:57,569
And I would start there.

647
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:02,490
My wife would be the second one, the fortune.

648
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:05,430
And then I felt lucky in sport.

649
00:34:05,589 --> 00:34:10,409
I've had great examples of role models of people who've got great values, who've lived their

650
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:10,769
life.

651
00:34:10,769 --> 00:34:12,289
And that list could go on.

652
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:12,769
You know, the Frenchman...

653
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:17,610
I've got out of that community, who are brilliant because they're good friends to me, because

654
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:20,289
they pull you up when you may be going off the track a little bit.

655
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:20,489
Yeah.

656
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:24,070
But they're always in your corner to support you no matter what goes on.

657
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:27,690
So I feel really lucky to be surrounded by great role models.

658
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:33,670
Yeah, my first role model is a guy called George Burns, the comedian in America that

659
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,949
lived till he was 100.

660
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:40,510
I met him when he was 98 and handed him my book called Laughter, Sex, Vegetables and

661
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:40,829
Fish.

662
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:46,250
And he looked at it and said, Doc, he said, if I do those all together, it'll make a hell

663
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:46,670
of a mess.

664
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,909
He said, three out of four will do me.

665
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,590
And then he said, I said, would you live till you're 100?

666
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,690
He said, yeah, three out of four of these every day.

667
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,070
And I remember reading a report in the New York Times.

668
00:34:58,409 --> 00:35:01,070
He was interviewed on his 100th birthday by a journalist.

669
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:06,949
The journalist said, George, congratulations, but what does your doctor say about you still

670
00:35:06,949 --> 00:35:08,590
puffing away on a cigar now and again?

671
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:10,710
He said, my doctor's dead.

672
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:15,090
So George laughed his way through life till he was 100.

673
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:16,849
And he didn't retire.

674
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,090
He did his last stand up when he was 99.

675
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:23,349
The second one is, coming back to sport, the great Jack Nicklaus.

676
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:27,929
He, on the scoreboard, he's won 18 majors.

677
00:35:28,809 --> 00:35:31,250
He's come second in 19 majors.

678
00:35:31,789 --> 00:35:32,789
Nobody remembers second.

679
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,630
How many seconds did Greg Norman have?

680
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:36,309
Yeah, a few.

681
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:37,309
Did he have a few notable ones?

682
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:37,670
Eight.

683
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:38,889
Eight seconds, yeah.

684
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:39,889
He won two.

685
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:40,730
Jack?

686
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:44,130
He won 19, 18 and came second, 19 and third, nine.

687
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:49,150
So in Jack's first 100 majors, he came first, second and third 47 times.

688
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:54,909
And he kept telling me when I wrote the book with him, which sold a million, was translated

689
00:35:54,909 --> 00:35:58,050
into French, Mandarin, sold more in China than America.

690
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:04,530
He said, Doc, he said, the most important part of equipment in any sport is the stuff

691
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,389
between your ears.

692
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:08,389
So, you know, that hit home to me.

693
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:10,809
And then the third hero in my life is the girl who saved my life.

694
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:12,349
Which is called Sue.

695
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,989
And Sue, we've been married five years and five kids and 11 grandkids.

696
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:16,489
50 years?

697
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:17,469
What did I say?

698
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,010
You said five.

699
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:18,349
Oh, well.

700
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:21,230
I think Sue might want to talk about the other 45.

701
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:22,750
Okay, 50.

702
00:36:22,969 --> 00:36:26,809
And she used to bring my 10 veggies into hospital every night when I was being treated for brain

703
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:27,130
cancer.

704
00:36:27,429 --> 00:36:30,530
And the nurses would say, we've given him his food, he doesn't eat.

705
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:33,429
So it's called immunity.

706
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:34,989
10 veggies every night.

707
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,170
So can I ask this question, John?

708
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,789
If someone lived a healthy life, you got this, you know, intuitively, or you got this, you

709
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:45,750
know, all of your life, and, you know, I've seen and read about that, and then you get

710
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,449
brain cancer.

711
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,829
I mean, do you ask the question, why?

712
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:53,909
I mean, clearly, the way you handled it, and to be as healthy and strong as you are now,

713
00:36:53,989 --> 00:36:58,150
but that must have been incredibly challenging to get, you know, a brain cancer that had

714
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,429
five lesions in your brain.

715
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,670
It was inoperable.

716
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,469
Did you go through that period?

717
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:03,769
Yeah.

718
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:08,730
I mean, there are theoretically five stages of grief, but I didn't have time to read all

719
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:09,389
those sort of things.

720
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:10,389
I don't know.

721
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:15,389
The first thing I did was read Lance Armstrong's book, because my wife brought it in, about

722
00:37:15,389 --> 00:37:22,730
his mental attitude, and I know he was a cheat, and he took certain performance-enhancing

723
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:23,150
drugs.

724
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:29,250
The but is, he survived brain cancer, and he's beaten me by five years, up to 18 years

725
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:29,469
now.

726
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:30,869
I'm at 13.

727
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:39,889
So I read that book, and then I started to think what I could do when I beat the brain

728
00:37:39,889 --> 00:37:40,369
cancer.

729
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:40,650
And I didn't know what to do.

730
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:40,929
I didn't know what to do.

731
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:41,429
And I've got cancer.

732
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:42,610
I've got cancer.

733
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,530
I've got cancer.

734
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,650
And I've worked out now with all my research, cancer is gross.

735
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:48,030
The G is genetics.

736
00:37:48,429 --> 00:37:53,510
There are certain cancers, like ovarian breast, prostate, where you've got to start having

737
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,590
checkups and tests earlier in life.

738
00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:00,269
You know, so you say, see, everyone gets a poo test mailed to them when they're 45 or

739
00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:00,510
something.

740
00:38:00,929 --> 00:38:01,929
Do you know how many are returned?

741
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,369
Less than 40%.

742
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:04,869
And most returned by women.

743
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:08,849
I mean, why wouldn't you send the test back?

744
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:08,969
Right?

745
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:09,070
Why wouldn't you send the test back?

746
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:09,190
Because if you, the earlier you get, the better.

747
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,250
Yeah.

748
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:09,269
Yeah.

749
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:09,329
Yeah.

750
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:09,489
Yeah.

751
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:09,510
Yeah.

752
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,050
Yeah.

753
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:16,610
you pick up a cancer, the more curable it is. So the gross, G is genetics, R is radiation

754
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:21,750
and pollution. I still don't hold my mobile phone against my head because I know the radiation

755
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:27,869
is higher. I hold it out there. Radiation, pollution. If you live in Beijing, it's the

756
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:32,590
equivalent of smoking 30 cigarettes a day. So why would you live in a city full of pollution?

757
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:38,329
Because that causes cancer. The O is overweight. Overweight is associated with 13 different

758
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:44,230
cancers. Now, our kids are the fifth fattest in the OECD countries in the world. Fifth

759
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:54,650
fattest. Why? Like, we've got to do something about that. So, and G-R-O-S, S, too much sunshine,

760
00:38:54,789 --> 00:39:01,630
malignant melanoma, we're best in the world. S, the other S is stress. Now, if you can't

761
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:07,670
cope with life, I couldn't cope with my accountant being in jail, my best friend suing me because

762
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,309
of a business deal.

763
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:11,929
Don't do business with friends. You know, I lost several million dollars, blah, blah.

764
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:18,469
And people say, well, you know, who cares? I said, well, that got to me. And so the hormones

765
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:26,750
you get from can't cope diminish, they crunch your immune system. So this is why this mental

766
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:30,570
health issue, and I'm bloody good at standing on a stage, I do it for companies all over

767
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,530
the world now, about how to handle stuff.

768
00:39:33,929 --> 00:39:34,110
Yeah.

769
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:38,309
Because if you walk into the office and somebody's shaming you or bullying you, you're not going

770
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:44,150
to get the deal done and, you know, you don't meet your KPIs and all that sort of stuff.

771
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:49,030
You've got to increase your resistance and that's called your immune system. Once again,

772
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,269
I can't remember the question. Oh, yeah, when I got cancer.

773
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:56,449
Well, I like the fact that, you know, I hadn't known that part, you know, like for you, there

774
00:39:56,449 --> 00:40:00,449
was a whole heap of factors as well that went into that. Maybe there's some stress in your

775
00:40:00,449 --> 00:40:02,849
life that got to you as well.

776
00:40:03,489 --> 00:40:03,550
Immunity.

777
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,730
I was too busy to die. I had too much left to do.

778
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:06,250
Yeah.

779
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,889
So anyway, I can tell your readers.

780
00:40:07,889 --> 00:40:08,650
What are they called?

781
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:09,070
Listeners.

782
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:10,210
Listeners.

783
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:10,949
Are we on TV?

784
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:11,989
We can do both.

785
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:12,230
Yeah.

786
00:40:12,429 --> 00:40:12,789
Yeah.

787
00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:19,489
Go out to your bookstore and buy your best immunity or go to wilkinsonpublishing.com.au.

788
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:21,769
Luke, this has been an absolute honor, mate.

789
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:26,590
And I recommend you do it because you can hear John's language. He's got a brilliant

790
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,769
way to simplify messages that, you know, it's a trillion dollar industry, the eating and

791
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:34,469
weight loss industry. John simplifies it in a way that is really practical and you can.

792
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:37,869
John, I've been asking these questions to different leaders from different.

793
00:40:37,889 --> 00:40:41,849
From different backgrounds, whether it be sport or industry, health and wellbeing or

794
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:45,809
education or the arts, what we think great leadership looks like.

795
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:53,269
I read something you wrote. You said leadership is not your title or your position. It's action.

796
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:57,730
And we're passionate about that, John. You know, it doesn't require a title to be. And

797
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:00,929
we want everyone to see themselves. You're a leader in your own family. You're a leader

798
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:05,570
in your own classroom. Sometimes that word actually comes with a connotation when people

799
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,849
think it's unattainable, but where it stands.

800
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:11,010
It starts for us. And this is the first dimension I want to talk to you about is self-leadership.

801
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:12,110
The idea of what that is.

802
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,710
Self-management. You're managing self.

803
00:41:13,989 --> 00:41:15,710
So what, explain what that means to you.

804
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:21,550
Well, you wake up in the morning, you look in the mirror. I said this to Kerry Packer

805
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:26,130
once. He rang me. I was on that TV show called, was it Celebrity Overhaul or something? We

806
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:30,590
had sort of C-grade celebrities like Murph Hughes and Ida Buttrose and all those sort

807
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:35,889
of losing weight. But then one of the sessions we had with him is, listen, I'm not going to

808
00:41:35,889 --> 00:41:36,769
do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not

809
00:41:36,769 --> 00:41:42,690
going to do that. And look in the mirror. I said to Kerry Packer once, he rang me, he

810
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:46,949
said, be in my office in Park Street at 12 noon on Monday. I should have said you be

811
00:41:46,949 --> 00:41:51,269
in my offices, but I didn't. So anyway, I walked in and I said, what am I doing here,

812
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:58,849
Kerry? He said, call me Kerry. And every third word started with F. And he said, you've got

813
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:05,250
to organise for me to lose 50 pounds in weight. I said, with all due respect, sir, call me

814
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:05,550
Kerry.

815
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:10,250
I said, it's you who've got to lose the 50 pounds. I'm going to ring your wife. Why?

816
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:15,909
Well, I assume she hasn't cooked an effing meal for 40 years. I said, who cooks? He said,

817
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:21,909
the chefs. I said, chefs, how many have you got? He said, 11. So to have that much money

818
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:28,210
and diabetes, he was killing himself. I said, what did you have for lunch? He said, pretty

819
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:34,090
obvious, isn't it? He had two empty Big Mac packets. He had a half-eaten big thing of fries

820
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,429
and a glass of orange juice.

821
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,070
I said, where did you get the orange juice? He said, how did that? He had a phantom machine

822
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:44,750
in his office. I said, Kerry, you are killing yourself. Tonight, he said, how do I start?

823
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:48,929
You go home tonight, take all your clothes off, stand in front of your bedroom mirror

824
00:42:48,929 --> 00:42:56,070
sideways and say, is this the most magnificent machine I've ever seen? See, we're all born

825
00:42:56,070 --> 00:43:01,949
as magnificent machines. What are you doing to yourself? So you start by looking in the

826
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:05,530
mirror when you get home or get into bed tonight and say, what are you doing to yourself?

827
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:12,010
What have I got to do to self-manage, to help myself? Activity, coping, eating. Go and

828
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:17,150
buy the Doc's books and subscribe to whatever and get your best immunity and start managing

829
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:20,090
yourself because it'll rub off on your partner and your kids.

830
00:43:20,269 --> 00:43:23,650
And I love it, isn't it? Literally, it is looking in the mirror. For us to do that,

831
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:28,750
it's confronting, but effectively, all the choices are ours, aren't they? And your life

832
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:33,909
has been espousing those benefits. And I love the fact that you're generally the link now

833
00:43:33,909 --> 00:43:35,530
to all of these terrible illnesses.

834
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:41,769
So much of that is in our own control as self-leadership. We see leaders are really

835
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:46,150
conscious now, the good ones, around how they positively impact other people now. And they're

836
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:49,989
really conscious around that. I mean, John, I love, I'm sitting at this desk surrounded

837
00:43:49,989 --> 00:43:54,309
by articles and information around how to positively impact others. How have you gone

838
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:57,750
about, how have you thought about your impact on others in a positive way? What have you

839
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:57,889
done?

840
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:04,949
Well, I get pleased when I get emails and LinkedIn, what do you call them? Tweets or

841
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:05,150
something?

842
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:09,389
Saying, you know, thanks for your advice, blah, blah. I had a couple of people yell

843
00:44:09,389 --> 00:44:14,190
at me the other day on LinkedIn saying I didn't respect the 88 people who died in the Bali

844
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:20,030
bombings. And I said, I'm a medical doctor. I respect all human beings. But will you turn

845
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:25,650
up to the memorial we have next year for the half a million people the government have

846
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:31,590
killed from smoking this century? Like, the government has allowed the deaths, preventable

847
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:33,690
deaths of half a million people this century.

848
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:36,599
Like,

849
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:45,099
it's the, I'll make a statement. A cigarette is the biggest single killer ever sold in

850
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:50,880
Australia. Name one thing that's killed more people. Atom bombs? No. Wars? No. Alcohol?

851
00:44:51,139 --> 00:44:57,380
No. Suicide? No. Atom altogether? Smoke is way ahead. We are handing teenagers stuff

852
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:01,460
to get them addicted, to make the government $14 billion a year in tax.

853
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,440
And I find this conversation, coming out of the COVID period, where we've been prepared

854
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:06,739
to,

855
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,739
you know,

856
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:12,579
take that extreme punitive approach to try and protect people. And again, you gotta be,

857
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:15,980
you know, I love you're not careful, John, you're unfiltered, but you can't even have

858
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:20,599
this conversation to say, you know, COVID killed people. That is really sad. But you've

859
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:26,619
got to be able to talk around diabetes kills 10 times more people every year. Totally preventable.

860
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:29,320
Totally lifestyle, you know.

861
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,699
Type two is. Type one is.

862
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:31,699
Type two, let me.

863
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:33,900
Type two is our fault. Type one's not. It's your genetically.

864
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:34,900
So let me make that very clear. So, but I want to, you know, make that clear. So, but I want to, you know, make that clear.

865
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,900
So let me make that very clear. So, but I want to, you know, make that clear. So, but I want to, you know,

866
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,900
cross over a line.

867
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,900
Do you know what type three diabetes is?

868
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,900
What's type three?

869
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,900
It's the half of people with diabetes that don't know it.

870
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,900
Yeah.

871
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:51,900
See, next year there'll be 150,000 new diabetics in Australia. And they've got pre-diabetes

872
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:57,900
and they don't know they've got diabetes. What are you doing to yourself?

873
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:02,900
Yeah. And that's lifestyle, isn't it? That's the role modeling that you've spoken about.

874
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,900
Yeah.

875
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:09,900
I mean, we don't get to take these extreme measures around something that's probably 0.002% mortality.

876
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:16,900
And yet things that are 10 times to more times that are costing lives, we don't take that same sort of measure.

877
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:21,900
And I think that's a conversation that is more pertinent now than ever before.

878
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,900
I mean, you've got a, creating and sharing a vision is another dimension of leadership.

879
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:31,900
We see great leaders. You're a multi-million selling author around the globe and you've connected with people everywhere.

880
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,900
I mean, how have you, you've got a clear vision for the future.

881
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,900
You've got a clear vision for your life. How have you gone about sharing and creating it?

882
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,900
In the past or in the future?

883
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,900
Well, maybe both. Yeah.

884
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:55,900
Well, there's a thing in the world called influences. Some of them share BS on social media and some of them have a vision which is going to help everyone in the world.

885
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:01,900
So I've been to meetings overseas with the World Health Organization and the way they see the world.

886
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:12,900
And at least half our chronic disease, more like 70% of our chronic diseases, Chad, cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes, dementia, are preventable.

887
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,900
We are giving it to ourselves.

888
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:23,900
So the vision is to make it sensible, practical, doable, that people can, activity.

889
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,900
Luke, you're awake for 238 half hours a week. Did you know that?

890
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,900
I didn't know that.

891
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:30,900
Okay.

892
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:35,900
At 238, do you usually choose six or seven that you're moving briskly?

893
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,900
I'd say yes, yeah.

894
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,900
Okay. Well, you're one of 10% of Australians who do.

895
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,900
The other 90% are going towards slob land who said they haven't got time.

896
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:51,900
Get your diary out on a Sunday night and choose six half hours in the next week where you're going to take yourself for a brisk walk.

897
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,900
And if you won't do it, put 10 bucks in a jar and take a mate.

898
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,900
And if he doesn't turn up or she doesn't turn up, they put 10 and at the end of the year, you're going to have a great party.

899
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:00,900
So that's all you need.

900
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:01,900
Six half hours.

901
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,900
A total body movement briskly.

902
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:10,900
You've got to be aerobic as Latin for with oxygen, getting oxygen around your heart, your lungs, and opening up your coronary arteries and all that.

903
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:15,900
Coping, we've got 30 R things, relaxation things.

904
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,900
You've got to do two every day.

905
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,900
People say, what are you talking about?

906
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,900
I say, well, do you take three deep breaths every hour?

907
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,900
And you've got to know how to breathe.

908
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,900
I can show you on a video or something.

909
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,900
Diaphragm breaths, deep breaths, because if you take three deep breaths in a row,

910
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,900
you'll either get dizzy, because you've never done it before,

911
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,900
or your blood pressure will sink 10 points and your pulse rate 10 points.

912
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:41,900
See, half the people on blood pressure pills probably don't need them if they did their three deep breaths every hour.

913
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,900
So there's lots of other R things.

914
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,900
Like, Luke, have you sent a thank you note in the last week?

915
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,900
Yeah, I have.

916
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,900
You sent one to me last night.

917
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:50,900
Yeah.

918
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,900
Yeah.

919
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,900
No, I'm, you know, it's probably the way you were brought up.

920
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,900
Have you watched a sunset or a sunrise in the last week?

921
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:57,900
Yeah, I have.

922
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:58,900
Yeah.

923
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:05,900
Well, I was called smug on a podcast here recently with a beautiful cheerio pit, which made me laugh.

924
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,900
She said, geez, you're smug with your morning routine.

925
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,900
But I'm not.

926
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,900
I am.

927
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:10,900
Maybe I am.

928
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,900
But I'm passionate about this space because, you know, I'm lucky.

929
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,900
I'm married to someone who's a meditation teacher, who's into yoga.

930
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,900
And so that influence rubs off.

931
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:23,900
And then the idea of having kids that are healthy, not perfect, still make plenty of blues.

932
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,900
But I love sharing this conversation because…

933
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,900
Do you hug someone you love every day?

934
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,900
That would happen, too, yeah.

935
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:30,900
What's the cat's name?

936
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,900
Exactly.

937
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:32,900
Oh, do you meditate before sex or after?

938
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:33,900
Well, that's a good question, too, because I feel lucky to have found meditation many,

939
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,900
many years ago.

940
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,900
But again, people, again, they feel like, geez, I'm going to live this boring life.

941
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:36,900
My wife just says, stop talking about it to people because it sounds like you're selling

942
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:37,900
Amway.

943
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,900
And I'm like, or not.

944
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:39,900
It's just something that I know when you…

945
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:40,900
Well, you've got the pill.

946
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:41,900
You've got a purpose in life.

947
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:42,900
And the last thing, E, is eating.

948
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:43,900
I'll give you another rule.

949
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:44,900
Make sure you don't eat too much.

950
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:45,900
Make sure you don't eat too much.

951
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:46,900
Make sure you don't eat too much.

952
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,900
Make sure you don't eat too much.

953
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:48,900
Make sure you don't eat too much.

954
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:49,900
Make sure that 70% of everything you put in your face is plant-based.

955
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:50,900
Yeah.

956
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:51,900
Okay?

957
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:52,900
Less flesh.

958
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:53,900
I've got some work on that one.

959
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:54,900
Okay.

960
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,900
Fantastic to be here, Luke.

961
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,559
Maybe we can do some stuff with the leader and meet each other again?

962
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:58,559
I'd love to.

963
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,059
Before you wrap me up, I've got a couple more for you that I want to continue on with.

964
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:01,059
Yeah.

965
00:50:01,059 --> 00:50:02,059
Good.

966
00:50:02,059 --> 00:50:03,059
Fantastic to be back, Luke.

967
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:04,059
So, you don't eat too much.

968
00:50:04,059 --> 00:50:05,059
You eat talked.

969
00:50:05,059 --> 00:50:06,059
You drink too much.

970
00:50:06,059 --> 00:50:07,059
You eat too little.

971
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:08,059
You eat too much.

972
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:09,059
You eat too little.

973
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:10,059
You eat too little.

974
00:50:10,059 --> 00:50:11,059
It's not a bad thing to keep the flavor in a meal and you keep it for a meal.

975
00:50:11,059 --> 00:50:12,059
Yeah, yeah.

976
00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:13,059
You've got to get full.

977
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:23,539
on. Curiosity is a word we see really attached to people who do great things and they approach

978
00:50:23,539 --> 00:50:32,739
their life through curiosity. Does that resonate with you? Yeah, my first curious thing was why

979
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:41,619
are so many patients coming to see a doctor when a lot of them in aging situations just want to

980
00:50:41,619 --> 00:50:48,880
chat? The but is they expect to get a prescription for something. I mean, we had a party one day when

981
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:54,300
somebody invented a new name for Valium because you could prescribe something different. I mean,

982
00:50:54,320 --> 00:51:02,219
this is really basic, stupid stuff. Nearly half prescriptions written by doctors now are for

983
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:08,340
mind-altering substances like Valium and antidepressants. Our kids have never been

984
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,659
more medicated than ever before.

985
00:51:11,619 --> 00:51:17,699
ADHD and every second child in Australia now it feels is medicated from young age. And again,

986
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:22,519
you're getting into, I love the fact that you're just going to call it as you see it, John. I mean,

987
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:27,039
it's confronting for people to have these conversations. I mean, I find the thing,

988
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:32,360
we're medicating our pets. I mean, I look at our dogs. Dogs are the happiest creature you've ever

989
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:37,719
met in your life. And half of our dogs are being medicated now. How can a dog be sad if that's the

990
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:41,500
case? I'm with you. The other curious thing lately,

991
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:49,460
is how can a human being, like, what's his name? The Russian guy, Putin. How can he literally go

992
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:56,780
next door and slaughter human beings? For what? What is it, power or glory or something?

993
00:51:57,639 --> 00:52:04,199
Why do people go and kill other human beings? It's really curious to me.

994
00:52:04,659 --> 00:52:09,659
It's for greed, isn't it? And greed and power. And it's, you know, I look at that, you know,

995
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:10,699
again, as a...

996
00:52:11,619 --> 00:52:15,019
Why do we stop, you know, read your book? Why do you stop talking to a family member? Why do you

997
00:52:15,019 --> 00:52:20,219
get in a blue with your neighbor? When you think of life, it's not that important, is it? You know,

998
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:26,039
we all have relationships that shift and change, but it feels like that's, you know, maybe the

999
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:31,159
extreme manifestation of where the world's at, isn't it? Where, you know, you can't believe...

1000
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:34,380
Yeah, and the last curious thing is kids. Like, kids, when you're a teenager, you take risks

1001
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:39,659
because you're immortal, you're impenitent, you're bulletproof. But as we age, and see,

1002
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:47,239
the dangerous decade used to be 45 to 55. That's when things called menopause and womanopause,

1003
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:55,480
it's personopause now, happen. And women's hormones dropped dramatically. So they get hot

1004
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:00,679
flushes or flashes and all those sort of things, and they get upset. But men go through menopause,

1005
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:08,139
personopause, as the hormones drift off more slowly. But men go through this stage about,

1006
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,579
you know, what am I doing in life?

1007
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:09,639
Sure.

1008
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:13,960
Should I change my job? Do I need a new wife? Do I go and buy a Porsche or a Maserati,

1009
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,599
you know, to show people that I'm really with it, all this sort of stuff. So

1010
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:24,099
the curiosity is, why don't we look after ourselves more? Why are we getting so sick

1011
00:53:24,099 --> 00:53:29,639
in Australia with the cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes, dementia? Life be in it,

1012
00:53:30,019 --> 00:53:36,500
and had an 80% awareness rate, but the KPIs, it didn't work because the hero was an anti-hero.

1013
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,739
Ah, slob on the safe.

1014
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:39,519
Yeah.

1015
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:45,219
With a beer and a cigarette and all that sort of stuff. And last thing, what can I do to help

1016
00:53:45,219 --> 00:53:50,860
someone else in the next week? I love the messaging, communication with clarity. You've

1017
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:55,039
got a great skill when you read your books around condensing stuff, and you can hear the acronyms

1018
00:53:55,039 --> 00:54:01,880
come out, whether it's ACE or I love your work on the four ACEs in the pack. And, you know,

1019
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:09,039
did you refine that over time? I mean, you've spoken around the world, as we said, to numerous

1020
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:09,440
people.

1021
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,480
How have you thought about your communication?

1022
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:18,800
I get my best ideas on an aeroplane or in a coffee shop or on a beach. When you're on a beach,

1023
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:25,199
you realise how insignificant you are. When you look at the world or a sunset or the rocks or

1024
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:30,179
something and the waves crashing and all those sharks out there, you know, sharks kill 1.7

1025
00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:37,019
Australians a year, and cigarettes kill 20,000 a year. And people say, oh, I'm really scared of

1026
00:54:37,019 --> 00:54:39,420
sharks. And eating fast food, I'm really scared of sharks. And eating fast food, I'm really scared

1027
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,099
of sharks. And eating fast food, I'm really scared of sharks. And eating fast food, you know, causes all

1028
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:47,800
these problems. So how fast do we need to be? Why not some slow food? Go home and cook it for

1029
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:52,739
yourself. Anyway, curiosity killed the cat, and it's not going to kill me, and it's not going to

1030
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:54,760
kill you, Luke. So good to see you, mate.

1031
00:54:54,920 --> 00:55:00,539
John, we talk about collaboration, and Luke, you're really passionate about the idea of

1032
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:04,980
collaborating. I see that as a bit of a superpower. How has that been for you in your life,

1033
00:55:05,059 --> 00:55:05,320
collaboration?

1034
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:09,400
I've been told I have a way to do it. I've been told I have a way to do it. I've been told I have a way to do it.

1035
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:17,840
It's a way of communicating so that people remember. So I was voted in America by the

1036
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:22,400
Million Dollar Roundtable Insurance Conference as the, what do they call it, the best take-home

1037
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:29,099
value. The best testimonial I've ever had was from a leader in the Young Presidents

1038
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:35,500
Organization at an international conference when he said, Dr. John was the best speaker

1039
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,400
at the conference. He said, the way I measure my life, I measure my life, I measure my

1040
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:45,719
future, the worth of a speaker, is how many times you look at your watch. I didn't. So if I can

1041
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:52,179
discuss something in a way that you understand and communicate it in a way that you can go home

1042
00:55:52,179 --> 00:55:58,460
and say, I can do that. So look at your diary on Sunday and make an appointment with yourself for

1043
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:07,460
six half hours next week to move your body. Coping, do a relaxation thing. We'll send you out

1044
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,400
an email. We'll do some relaxation. Do some relaxation. Do some relaxation. Do some relaxation.

1045
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:14,659
You can't do it everyday. And eating, 70% of that food that goes in your face is of

1046
00:56:14,659 --> 00:56:19,619
plant origin and takes six seconds to look at a food or drink and work out how much a

1047
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:25,780
human being has, I can't say the F word, how much a human being has interfered with it.

1048
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,780
Hi.

1049
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,780
They're brilliant takeaways.

1050
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:30,000
And go and buy my book Your Best Immunity.

1051
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,679
Yeah, absolutely. I can highly recommend doing that. I took it away on holiday a week ago

1052
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:39,400
and you write notes. You write notes because they're practical things that reinforce it.

1053
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,300
The other thing is the three by three.

1054
00:56:42,579 --> 00:56:47,880
You have to get out of your environment three days, three times a year.

1055
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,760
People haven't got time.

1056
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,360
So put a day on the end of a long weekend.

1057
00:56:52,059 --> 00:56:52,800
Get out of your environment.

1058
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:53,400
What do you mean, James?

1059
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:55,599
Go somewhere different, change the scenery.

1060
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:58,400
Yeah, you might go by yourself with a mate and go fishing

1061
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,820
or you might go with your best friend if it's your partner

1062
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:05,539
and get a book and, you know, a motel with a palm tree out the front

1063
00:57:05,539 --> 00:57:05,920
or something.

1064
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,119
Just something totally different.

1065
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:11,940
But take a book and no phones and get three times a year,

1066
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:15,599
get out of your environment for three days so you can just think

1067
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,219
about yourself and your best friend and what you're going to do

1068
00:57:19,219 --> 00:57:21,880
for somebody else in the next three months, including yourself.

1069
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:22,920
And that's genius.

1070
00:57:23,059 --> 00:57:26,860
Again, I love the idea of that and making that happen.

1071
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,579
And as you said, it doesn't have to be restrictive.

1072
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,480
You don't have to go far, but you can get away.

1073
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,980
I've said this a few times.

1074
00:57:33,099 --> 00:57:35,099
I've got to ask you about Donald Trump.

1075
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:38,099
You've met and you've coached and you've counselled

1076
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:42,800
fascinating people, but no one on the planet has got more currency

1077
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,980
at the moment, good or bad, however you view it.

1078
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,659
What was your encounter like with Donald Trump?

1079
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:52,280
When I spoke at the same conference as he did and he was in the wings,

1080
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:55,280
obviously, for the last five or ten minutes of my presentation,

1081
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:56,780
as I walked off, he said,

1082
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:59,079
good job, Doc, do you want to come into my room and have a chat

1083
00:57:59,079 --> 00:57:59,719
for five minutes?

1084
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,239
And I looked at him and I said, are you sure?

1085
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:03,880
He said, yeah.

1086
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:07,099
And he showed me into his green room, as they call it.

1087
00:58:07,099 --> 00:58:08,059
Why do they call it a green room?

1088
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:09,099
A green room, I've got no idea.

1089
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:13,019
Anyway, I thought to myself, and I said to him,

1090
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:14,280
what do I call you, like, sir?

1091
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,260
Or he said, you know, just, you know, Donald.

1092
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:20,539
And I realised he was a golf freak, so I said, by the way,

1093
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,099
can you wait 30 seconds?

1094
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:23,219
I've got a gift for you.

1095
00:58:23,219 --> 00:58:26,440
And he looked at me, he said, a gift for me?

1096
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,980
And I ran out and got the book I'd written with Jack Nicklaus,

1097
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,539
Golf and Life, which is not about golf being,

1098
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:37,460
Jack's being the greatest golfer, it's about the attitude,

1099
00:58:38,059 --> 00:58:39,320
the attitude you need to win.

1100
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:43,059
And I ran back in and gave him the book, and he looked at the book

1101
00:58:43,059 --> 00:58:45,280
and he looked at me, and he didn't say thank you,

1102
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,719
he said, oh, next time you see Jack, say hello from me.

1103
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:51,639
So anyway, for the 10 minutes, he seemed like a regular guy,

1104
00:58:51,639 --> 00:58:56,360
chatting away, but as soon as he left me and went on the stage,

1105
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,099
he's a schizophrenic, he's two different people.

1106
00:59:00,619 --> 00:59:04,980
So he talked in his presentation 90% of the time about himself,

1107
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:06,639
but told people...

1108
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:12,119
The word, leadership, how to be a leader, how to get...

1109
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:14,480
A lot of it was what you'd call fake news,

1110
00:59:14,739 --> 00:59:16,260
but he had some threads there.

1111
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:22,159
See, he became the President of the USA with a clever mantra,

1112
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:25,280
let's make America great again.

1113
00:59:26,539 --> 00:59:27,960
Now, that's a reason...

1114
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,199
And his opponent was a chick called Hillary Clinton.

1115
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:36,340
And he cleverly worked his way into a position,

1116
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:39,980
where it's can you trust her?

1117
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,739
I run a business, I've made billions of dollars,

1118
00:59:47,139 --> 00:59:48,440
America is a business,

1119
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:51,400
you need someone who knows how to run a business.

1120
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:57,519
So he cleverly engaged enough people on the collegiate system,

1121
00:59:57,619 --> 01:00:00,460
whatever it's called, to win the presidency,

1122
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:03,579
and I know a lot of my mates, business people in America,

1123
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:05,159
want him back again.

1124
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:07,380
Now, half the country hate him,

1125
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:09,559
and half the country love him.

1126
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:12,260
So he's that sort of...

1127
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,039
He diverts people one way or the other.

1128
01:00:14,199 --> 01:00:16,199
You don't sit on the fence with a Donald Trump.

1129
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:18,900
So I liked him for 10 minutes when we were chatting,

1130
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:21,360
but when he got on the stage, I'm going,

1131
01:00:21,539 --> 01:00:23,039
is this real?

1132
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,059
So have I answered what...

1133
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:27,599
Yeah, I think...

1134
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,639
He's two people, he's a schizophrenic.

1135
01:00:30,019 --> 01:00:32,960
Yeah, I mean, it's a whole other podcast, that one,

1136
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,460
I think, John, isn't it, around...

1137
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,960
Yeah, you know, perhaps...

1138
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:39,900
What happened post-losing the last election

1139
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,699
and riots on the Capitol,

1140
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:43,880
and I think there'll be some strong thought on that,

1141
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,760
but clearly there's some genius there.

1142
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:48,679
There has to be, to be able to get that messaging across.

1143
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:51,380
There's just 74 million people still voted for him last election.

1144
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,119
It's a fascinating...

1145
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,840
Do you think voting should be compulsory or not?

1146
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,760
I'm not big on mandating almost anything,

1147
01:00:59,019 --> 01:01:03,119
but I think in a democracy, you know, over the age of 18,

1148
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,159
to feel like, you know, to take a seat at the table

1149
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:07,500
and have to participate in it,

1150
01:01:07,739 --> 01:01:08,960
I think that's one of the challenges

1151
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,380
with the American system, isn't it,

1152
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,280
is that you only get such a small turnout.

1153
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:15,260
I like the idea you've got to front up and at least...

1154
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:18,980
Do you think we should ban the biggest killer product of all time,

1155
01:01:19,059 --> 01:01:20,320
like Jacinda Ardern's doing?

1156
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,760
Yeah, you make a compelling case on that.

1157
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:23,800
I'm not a smoker.

1158
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:24,719
I don't get it.

1159
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,760
I don't understand it.

1160
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:29,179
You know, again, historically, I'd say banning things

1161
01:01:29,179 --> 01:01:30,559
is not really...

1162
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,480
But this is so overwhelmingly...

1163
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,860
And I think what we're doing effectively is just...

1164
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,860
For those poor people, I think, who actually can't...

1165
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:39,659
really get over the fact that they're addicted to smoking,

1166
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:43,000
we're making life, you know, worse for them

1167
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,320
by, you know, charging whatever the price is now.

1168
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,860
I think it's...

1169
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,260
I'm with you on that.

1170
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:48,880
I think it makes sense.

1171
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,340
The other point that we should mention

1172
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:52,840
is 10% of cigarette deaths is secondhand smoke,

1173
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:55,519
so it's associated with sudden infant death syndrome.

1174
01:01:56,159 --> 01:01:58,860
It's associated with stillbirths.

1175
01:01:59,539 --> 01:02:01,840
You know, as I said, 40% of Aboriginal women

1176
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,840
smoke when they're pregnant.

1177
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:06,619
I mean, the other way to stop it is to ban it

1178
01:02:06,619 --> 01:02:06,840
and...

1179
01:02:07,739 --> 01:02:12,360
Fine people for doing something that is dangerous,

1180
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,900
like speeding through school zones.

1181
01:02:14,619 --> 01:02:17,179
Yeah, it seems like a free hit, that one, you know,

1182
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:19,760
if we're in the business, we're trying to help people and save.

1183
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:22,679
It doesn't seem like a big stretch, you know,

1184
01:02:22,699 --> 01:02:24,579
and I think your other messages around educating people

1185
01:02:24,579 --> 01:02:27,739
on how to eat, how to connect and how to...

1186
01:02:27,739 --> 01:02:28,719
are equally as important.

1187
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,739
Who's been the greatest leader in your life, John?

1188
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:38,309
Sue, my wife.

1189
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:40,650
50 years of marriage?

1190
01:02:41,869 --> 01:02:42,389
51.

1191
01:02:42,989 --> 01:02:44,489
What did you...

1192
01:02:44,489 --> 01:02:47,070
You only get 20 years for murder, don't you?

1193
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:49,690
It's...

1194
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:55,230
Yeah, when you get a soulmate who...

1195
01:02:55,230 --> 01:03:01,599
The thing about Sue is that even daughter-in-laws

1196
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:06,679
who tend not to like their daughter-in-laws, son-in-laws,

1197
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:10,699
and grandkids, you know, when they see Nana Sue,

1198
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:12,300
they run up and hug her and...

1199
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:13,119
Oh, that's the other thing.

1200
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,659
Nana, where's the FP100?

1201
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:15,960
That's the fruit patty.

1202
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:18,719
See, there's always a fruit platter living in our fridge

1203
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:21,760
because kids won't eat an orange because it's too sticky,

1204
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:22,480
but if you chop...

1205
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,079
If you spend 10 minutes every three days

1206
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:26,940
chopping up fruit into bite-sized chunks,

1207
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:28,179
kids will run it.

1208
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,860
They'll eat it after school, you know?

1209
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:31,119
I'm in that bracket.

1210
01:03:31,699 --> 01:03:34,380
You cut it up and I can't stop eating it.

1211
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:35,559
FP100, fruit patty.

1212
01:03:35,659 --> 01:03:36,760
And one more thing.

1213
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:37,320
A bit of gold.

1214
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:39,059
When your kids get home from school,

1215
01:03:39,059 --> 01:03:41,179
my mum used to say, be home by dark.

1216
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:44,000
So I was outside playing footy in the creek,

1217
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,480
in the cricket,

1218
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,280
in the gutter and doing mud pies.

1219
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:51,380
See, 50 years ago, 2% of kids had allergy.

1220
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:54,099
Now it's 40% because they never get dirty.

1221
01:03:55,179 --> 01:03:56,739
And if the baked beans fall on the floor,

1222
01:03:57,239 --> 01:03:57,800
go and eat them.

1223
01:03:58,059 --> 01:04:00,639
Like, oh, don't touch them.

1224
01:04:00,699 --> 01:04:01,500
They've got bacteria.

1225
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:06,119
And then you see ads for this kills 99.9% of bacteria.

1226
01:04:06,739 --> 01:04:08,519
You've got to have a few bacteria around

1227
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:10,380
to develop an immune system.

1228
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,300
That's your immunity.

1229
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:14,039
Well, my fear on that, John, is that, you know,

1230
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:14,880
we're, you know,

1231
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,900
kids in grade two were in master school for the last two years

1232
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:22,099
and, you know, hand sanitiser and I get, you know,

1233
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:23,960
people will go hard on this and say,

1234
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,719
hey, we're at a threatening situation.

1235
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,219
But really, you know, training, you know,

1236
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,239
I know the kids at school now are nervous when they cough

1237
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:34,400
because they've been trained as though that's a, you know,

1238
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:38,699
as you know, your immune system, the spread of microbiome,

1239
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,179
it cannot stop regardless.

1240
01:04:40,179 --> 01:04:43,699
And my fear is we've exacerbated that,

1241
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:44,860
not gone the other way.

1242
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:48,360
Well, if a virus gets inside a live host,

1243
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,659
so if a virus gets inside a human being, a bird or an animal,

1244
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,019
it will mutate.

1245
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,599
It changes its own genetics.

1246
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:58,980
So unless your immune system is spot on and efficient,

1247
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,300
then that virus is going to spread through your body.

1248
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:04,380
So your best bet is to get a great immune system.

1249
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:06,159
Go and buy my book, Your Best Immunity.

1250
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:07,699
I love it.

1251
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:08,719
Final question, John.

1252
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,159
We are passionate about the world of collaboration

1253
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:12,980
and, you know, the work we're doing at Alita

1254
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,719
around inspiring connections.

1255
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,840
And creating a world of collaboration.

1256
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:19,199
If you've caught up with remarkable people

1257
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:20,199
across your life everywhere,

1258
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,280
has there been one person you thought,

1259
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,460
you've collaborated with Jack Nicklaus on a book?

1260
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,179
Has there been someone else you thought,

1261
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,480
God, if I could collaborate with one person in the world

1262
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,420
on any of your passions,

1263
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,519
is there one person that springs to mind?

1264
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:35,639
Apart from Sue and George Burns and Jack Nicklaus,

1265
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:39,719
I would, whoa, that's a tough one.

1266
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:46,880
Peter Hudson, he's become a good friend.

1267
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,760
Jerry Ryan, gives back.

1268
01:05:54,489 --> 01:05:56,449
Ah, there's a whole heap of people.

1269
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:59,289
I'm starting, I don't know whether I mentioned it, Luke,

1270
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:01,590
the great Australian health rescue.

1271
01:06:02,369 --> 01:06:05,690
People who actually get things done,

1272
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:09,829
non-government, not constricted by rules

1273
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:12,230
or Parliament House or anything like that.

1274
01:06:12,309 --> 01:06:13,829
It's people who actually get,

1275
01:06:13,929 --> 01:06:15,670
oh, Serena Russo, have you heard of Serena?

1276
01:06:16,349 --> 01:06:18,070
Brisbane based, yeah, she's,

1277
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:18,130
she's a great person.

1278
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:18,150
She's a great person.

1279
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:18,190
She's a great person.

1280
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:18,250
She's a great person.

1281
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:18,309
She's a great person.

1282
01:06:18,309 --> 01:06:18,369
She's a great person.

1283
01:06:18,369 --> 01:06:18,550
She's a great person.

1284
01:06:18,829 --> 01:06:21,230
She probably runs the biggest recruitment agency in Australia.

1285
01:06:21,789 --> 01:06:22,909
Jeff Slade, he's another one.

1286
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:24,610
There's a lot of people around there.

1287
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:28,550
And see, Jeff Kennett, who stepped down as,

1288
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:33,050
he agreed to become CEO of Beyond Blue for two years

1289
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:34,389
because nobody else would do it.

1290
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:36,269
He did it for 11 years.

1291
01:06:37,469 --> 01:06:39,030
Julia Gillard's just taken over.

1292
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:44,949
So you have to have respect for our first ever woman,

1293
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:47,050
woman Prime Minister who got stabbed in the back

1294
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:48,750
and all that sort of stuff.

1295
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:48,809
She's a great person.

1296
01:06:48,809 --> 01:06:50,190
She's now taken over Beyond Blue

1297
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:52,329
because this mental health thing is,

1298
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:54,130
it's challenging.

1299
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:56,610
Everyone has mental health issues.

1300
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:57,670
It's how you handle it.

1301
01:06:58,869 --> 01:07:01,630
And I can help people with mental health issues

1302
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:03,809
by getting support systems,

1303
01:07:04,769 --> 01:07:07,369
getting optimistic and getting a purpose in life.

1304
01:07:07,769 --> 01:07:09,630
So Luke, I reckon you've got all those three.

1305
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:12,909
And John, it's been a great pleasure to catch up with you again.

1306
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:16,329
It's been a long while and I love the work that you do.

1307
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:18,469
And the projects are brilliant.

1308
01:07:18,469 --> 01:07:20,989
Your best immunity, build resistance, the ACE way.

1309
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:22,489
I couldn't recommend that more highly.

1310
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:25,309
And Australia, the healthiest country by 2020.

1311
01:07:25,409 --> 01:07:27,590
I'm just looking at that project.

1312
01:07:27,969 --> 01:07:29,570
You know, it couldn't be more worthwhile.

1313
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:33,309
As you said, the numbers suggest Australia is going off a cliff

1314
01:07:33,309 --> 01:07:35,550
in terms of health and cancer and obesity.

1315
01:07:36,289 --> 01:07:38,929
So these messages are as important as anything we can do.

1316
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:40,969
John, I thank you for taking the time.

1317
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:41,769
I really appreciate it.

1318
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:42,630
Pleasure, Luke.

1319
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:43,329
You're a good guy.

1320
01:07:46,059 --> 01:07:48,280
