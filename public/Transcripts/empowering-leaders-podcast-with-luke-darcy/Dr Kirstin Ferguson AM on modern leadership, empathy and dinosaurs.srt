00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,230
Thanks for joining me this week on the Empowering Leaders podcast.

2
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,609
Our special guest, Dr. Kirsten Ferguson, is a remarkable leader in every sense.

3
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,250
She talks today about how modern leaders lead with both their head and their heart.

4
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:26,809
And she is full of wisdom and humor.

5
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,730
What a great privilege it has been to catch up with Kirsten.

6
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:30,890

and spent nearly 10 years as an officer in the Royal Australian Air Force.

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,480
Kirsten, it's a great privilege and an honor to meet you.

28
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,120
Thanks for joining me.

29
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:01,340
Yeah, thank you.

30
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,400
I'm thrilled to be here.

31
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:09,360
One of the world's most respected voices on leadership is not an overstatement by any stretch.

32
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,039
Can I ask you, in your words, what does modern leadership mean to you?

33
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,479
I think it means being able to integrate the leader that we are,

34
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,979
across all aspects of our life, everywhere.

35
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:23,659
So, so often you see leaders at work that think they've got to leave their heart at home,

36
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:26,159
and they just focus on KPIs and deliverables.

37
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,740
Whereas, I'm sure if you saw them in their private life,

38
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,300
they're full of empathy and humility, you would hope.

39
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:32,659
Bring it all together.

40
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:36,659
That's what being a modern leader is about, really integrating our head and heart all the time.

41
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:40,960
Yeah, and your book is brilliant, Head and Heart, the Art of Modern Leadership.

42
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,539
And I enjoyed last night in preparation for this, taking the head and heart leadership.

43
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,979
Scale and going through it, and it's fascinating, you know,

44
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:55,659
and I came out that perhaps lead with the heart a little bit more than the head.

45
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:59,580
Can you explain, you know, what it means to lead with both your head and your heart as well?

46
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,979
Yeah, and good on you for taking it.

47
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:05,740
I'm like, I've been blown away since the book came out only a few weeks ago.

48
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,000
More than 10,000 Australians have gone on and taken, and it's totally free.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,240
So anyone can go and do it.

50
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:16,080
Just visit headheartleader.com, but what you've discovered, and I'm sure we'll talk about your

51
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,479
results.

52
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,099
If you're happy to.

53
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,099
Absolutely.

54
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:23,580
This idea of leading with the head and the heart, I didn't want to just make shit up,

55
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,580
frankly.

56
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,919
So I went and I am a researcher, I did a PhD in leadership, and there's 60,000 leadership

57
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,879
books out there on the market, which is pretty scary.

58
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,340
So you know, why on earth would anyone want to write another one?

59
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,259
And so I didn't want to make stuff up.

60
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:42,039
So the research I did with the university was to try and find what are the attributes

61
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:45,000
exactly of leading with the head and the heart, and what it came down to.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Leading with the head.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
There are four of them.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,240
One is curiosity, and we're born curious, but unfortunately, we tend to lose it the

65
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,120
longer we're in a job or the older we get.

66
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,159
Wisdom, which is all about decision making, and you and I are going to talk about wisdom

67
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,780
a little bit, I think, because we both, that's my lowest of the eight attributes, and I noticed

68
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,960
it is yours as well.

69
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,879
So we might do a dive into what we're doing there.

70
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,099
Perspective, which was the most highly correlated with being a modern leader, and that's this

71
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:14,219
ability to read a room.

72
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:15,620
And it might obviously be a physical room.

73
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,699
But it's more likely to be your organization or the industry you work in, your community

74
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:23,259
group, your sporting club, whatever it is.

75
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:27,420
And then capability is that real belief that you are capable at what you do.

76
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:34,139
So those four head-based attributes, that's often what we've been rewarded for at school

77
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:39,300
and at university, or in jobs, you get promoted because you can deliver on whatever it is.

78
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,160
You know, there's really tangible, measurable things.

79
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,620
But they're critically important.

80
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,620
But if it's all you do, you're going to fail as a leader.

81
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,620
Yeah.

82
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,860
And so you need to be able to balance those with leading with the heart.

83
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,899
And the four attributes of those are humility, which is, in this context, really being open

84
00:04:55,899 --> 00:05:00,860
to seeking the contributions of others and being aware that you don't have all the answers,

85
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,560
knowing your limitations, which is harder for some than others.

86
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
Second is self-awareness.

87
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,360
So really being aware of the impact that you're having on others.

88
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,300
The third being courage, which is that real courage to stand up for what you believe in,

89
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,500
even in the face of pressure.

90
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,680
Not to do so.

91
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,579
And then the fourth is empathy.

92
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:23,579
And this is probably the most misunderstood because it's not pity or sympathy or compassion.

93
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:26,100
And too much empathy is a bad thing.

94
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,500
But it is being able to put yourself in the shoes of someone specifically quite different

95
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
to yourself.

96
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,139
So a lived experience outside of your own.

97
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:39,860
And the art of modern leadership is knowing which of those eight attributes are needed

98
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,220
as and when.

99
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,740
Because in any conversation or crisis or situation, you're going to need to know which of those

100
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,740
eight attributes are needed and when.

101
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,740
Because in any conversation or crisis or situation, you're going to need to know which of those

102
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,980
eight attributes are needed and when.

103
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,680
And so you need to maybe have a bucket load of humility and just a little bit of curiosity

104
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,180
to get through it.

105
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,680
Others are going to be all around your capability.

106
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,120
So that's the art of modern leadership.

107
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Yeah, it's brilliant.

108
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,139
And I love the simplistic way that you articulated it.

109
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:01,139
It's great.

110
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,899
My mind was going to, I caught up with Sal Gordon, who's the principal of the Green School

111
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:09,459
in Bali, Kirsten, and they're really revolutionizing education in some ways.

112
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:10,740
And he has this belief that, yeah, we do teach and reward the head stuff really strongly.

113
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,740
And I think that's a really good thing.

114
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,740
And I think that's a really good thing.

115
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,740
And I think that's a really good thing.

116
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,740
Yeah.

117
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,000
If we measure empathy and we measure that, that's what the education system is about.

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,839
But can we also teach empathy?

119
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,319
I think we can for sure.

120
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,779
Can we teach self-reflection?

121
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,839
Can we teach emotional intelligence?

122
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:31,579
Because really we don't open our account in the education system really on those things

123
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:32,579
as a rule.

124
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:35,259
Is that something that you think we should be doing more of?

125
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:36,379
Oh, absolutely.

126
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:40,139
And we can definitely teach empathy and we can practice empathy.

127
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,060
It's like a muscle that you can just...

128
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,000
The more you expose yourself to situations that are different to your own, and I know

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,720
I volunteer at Lifeline on the phones, and every time you do a shift, you are practicing

130
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,379
leading with empathy because you're listening to situations that require nothing from you

131
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:58,779
except a great deal of empathy.

132
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:04,220
I've been really reassured since the books come out, the number of schools that have

133
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,300
got in touch, mainly for their year 11 and 12 students.

134
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,160
I think that's exactly the right time, if not earlier, but it's a good time to really

135
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,399
be showing our future leaders and our kids of today what leadership looks like because

136
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:26,680
what I really wrote about was how ingrained in us it is this notion of leadership being

137
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,980
the most senior person at the top of an org chart with all the power and authority.

138
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,339
If you think back to when we were at school, even in encyclopedias, back in the day, I

139
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:37,279
think you and I are old enough.

140
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,579
We remember having encyclopedias, physical hard copies of encyclopedias.

141
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:49,480
All the people in them were those monarchs or explorers or titans of industry, and generally

142
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,319
men and generally white men at that.

143
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:57,139
That notion of who a leader is, is still something that we're dealing with that legacy of.

144
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:00,420
I think we need to really rethink who our leaders are.

145
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,180
For most people, the first leaders we have are our parents.

146
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:11,180
And so many parents might not see themselves as leaders, but they most certainly are.

147
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,339
And so we really need to be conscious that leaders are everywhere, including amongst

148
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:17,139
our young people.

149
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,439
Old enough, Kirsten, to remember the door-to-door salesman selling the encyclopedias in a beautiful

150
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,579
leather-bound set.

151
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,339
There's so much to follow up on what you just said.

152
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:33,059
I want to come back to, I love your real passion for actually encouraging people to understand

153
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,899
everyone is a leader in their own.

154
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:42,399
But to go back to what your book is about and sounds like what your passion, the head

155
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,399
and heart leaders and just how worthwhile it is for us to create more head and heart

156
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,259
type of leaders.

157
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:50,120
And all the research is just overwhelming.

158
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:55,159
When you look at the dimensions you talk about, if people have more humility, if they're more

159
00:08:55,159 --> 00:09:00,179
empathetic, if they're more self-aware, the capacity to do good in your environment, the

160
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:04,559
capacity to, you know, we know it changes people's lives when they are in an environment

161
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,139
at work.

162
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,039
Where they have a modern leader, like the way you described, with their head and the heart,

163
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,379
their home life is better.

164
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,620
They don't get sick as much.

165
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,419
They're more productive.

166
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,539
It's overwhelming, the research on why this is so important.

167
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,840
Are you still surprised that people don't get that correlation to investing in great

168
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:28,340
leadership becomes such a, you know, one more productive, more financial, but, you know,

169
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:30,720
overwhelmingly, it's probably the most important thing we can do.

170
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm not surprised, unfortunately.

171
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:38,980
I wish, you know, there were a few more braver leaders out there.

172
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:43,220
So, I think what happens is there's a real fear of being a vulnerable leader.

173
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,580
And that is what a head and heart or modern leader does.

174
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,480
They're prepared to say, I don't have all the answers.

175
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,480
I know my limitations.

176
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,539
This is something, you know, I'm not good at, but what do you think?

177
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,899
Like, all of that is requiring quite a different mindset.

178
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,379
And for some people, that is really easy to do.

179
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,259
And they are the most effective leaders.

180
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:05,139
But for people who have been around a long time,

181
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:08,559
and I like to think of them a bit as dinosaurs, and we all know who they are,

182
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,700
they're very comfortable.

183
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:14,419
And they've succeeded, generally, in being that formal kind of leader,

184
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,279
even though outside of work, they might be quite different.

185
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:23,580
So, I think there's a lot of fear that's driving not changing amongst those people.

186
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:31,039
But there's also our organizations that continue to reward head-based outputs.

187
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,799
So, you know, if we continue to give people promotions,

188
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:40,240
and pay rises, and all of that sort of thing, based on the number of sales they have,

189
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,220
or how many KPIs they've ticked off, and we fail to reward those leaders

190
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,139
who are also demonstrating some of those heart-based attributes,

191
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:51,899
we're, of course, going to see more of the same.

192
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:58,179
So, I think progressive organizations that want modern leaders really need to make sure

193
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:00,580
that they're integrating this idea at all aspects.

194
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,779
They're recruiting modern leaders.

195
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,059
They are then promoting modern leaders.

196
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,820
And they're appointing modern leaders at the highest points in their organization.

197
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:14,100
I was thinking of Steve Biddulph, the legendary author,

198
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,519
Raising Boys, Raising Girls.

199
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,179
I had the great privilege on this podcast of sitting down with Steve as well.

200
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,460
And he shared this story, Kirsten, and it feels like a lot of your language.

201
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:26,500
And he's given talks at auditoriums around the world, a bit like you,

202
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:28,340
thousands and thousands of people at a time.

203
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,200
And probably a fairly big female demographic for Steve in a lot of those auditoriums.

204
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,000
And he said he started asking the room,

205
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:37,340
you know, to a lot of the mums that were there,

206
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:38,580
what do you want?

207
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,799
What do you want in a partner?

208
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,779
What sort of leadership do you want?

209
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:45,039
And he said it was a really interesting thing because, you know,

210
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:47,779
you get past the first, you know, Brad Pitt or Harry Styles,

211
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,840
whoever the most, you know, popular, you have a laugh there for a start.

212
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,139
But he said then these answers start coming at him really, really quickly

213
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:56,559
and in two different categories.

214
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,840
I want someone who cares.

215
00:11:58,299 --> 00:11:59,519
I want someone who's got some empathy.

216
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,080
I want a partner who's present.

217
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,080
I want them to be fun.

218
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,159
But at the same time, hey, you know, I need them to be resilient.

219
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:06,419
I don't want them to be soft.

220
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:07,820
I want them to have a go.

221
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,919
And so he describes it as really the balance is heart, your language,

222
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,820
and backbone is what he talks about.

223
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:18,940
And trying to teach particularly, you know,

224
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,320
the males going back on the home front to understand if you don't have that

225
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,740
combination of backbone and heart, can you be effective as a modern leader?

226
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,539
And the wisdom's out there.

227
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,179
You know, it feels like people like you are just sharing it in a really

228
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,460
brilliant way now.

229
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:33,580
Yeah.

230
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,659
And I think it just requires a bit of courage for anyone who's been doing

231
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:38,360
things differently.

232
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,200
But if you look on the world stage, you know, the reason leaders like

233
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,360
Jacinda Ardern and Volodymyr Zelensky stick out is because they are so

234
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,779
different in the way they lead.

235
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,679
But in my opinion, they are exactly the kind of modern leaders we need

236
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,679
on the world stage.

237
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,080
And both of them have perfectly balanced this head and heart.

238
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,059
So there's no question.

239
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:03,179
I mean, one of them's leading a war from a bunker.

240
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,639
Yet he shows great heart.

241
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,039
He communicates beautifully.

242
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:09,799
He empathizes with the Ukrainian people, you know,

243
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,759
in a way that gravitates a whole nation behind him.

244
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,759
He has got head and heart worked out.

245
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,840
Jacinda Ardern was exactly the same.

246
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:21,620
So she, during the Christchurch, in the aftermath of the Christchurch

247
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,179
terrorist attacks, during the pandemic,

248
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:28,340
she was extremely strong and firm about what needed to happen.

249
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:33,379
Yet she was able to then go and do Facebook Lives at home on her sofa with,

250
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,360
you know, a baby vomit on her shoulder and, you know,

251
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:36,500
the toddler running around.

252
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:43,360
And it's that integration for both Zelensky and Ardern that makes us

253
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,379
want to be led by them.

254
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,740
You know, they're the kinds of modern leaders we want to see.

255
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:54,220
And yet too often, if you think of most other formal leaders on the world stage,

256
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,299
they're very polished.

257
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,299
You see a sanitized version of who they might be outside of their public persona.

258
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,360
You know, there's a, I think,

259
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,100
always a question of, do they really believe what they're saying?

260
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,720
We have excellent bullshit meters.

261
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,559
We can, Australians, like, it's like it's in our DNA.

262
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,100
We can sniff bullshit a mile off.

263
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,980
And we just know if we're being bullshitted.

264
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,539
And a modern leader knows that.

265
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:27,100
So they cut the bullshit and just tell it how it is, but in a way that has heart.

266
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,620
You know, so there's examples of people who have had to lay off lots of people

267
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,340
during the pandemic.

268
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,759
Yet we're able to do that in a way that put people at the centre still and certainly

269
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,139
could lead with their head and their heart.

270
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,740
Yeah, they're great examples, aren't they?

271
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:47,919
In real time, as you say, look at Zelensky, who was a comedian and a writer and came from

272
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,700
an acting and a dramatic background.

273
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,379
You know, would people take him seriously as a leader?

274
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:52,899
Yeah, who would have thought?

275
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,620
Who would have thought he would be the leader we need?

276
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,659
The wartime leader, as you said.

277
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,480
I look at all your dimensions, you know, the humility, the courage just to walk through

278
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,000
the square.

279
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,000
It's clearly, you know, the risk to his own family and his own life and perspective and

280
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,220
the huge amount of empathy as well, too, hasn't he, at the same time?

281
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,740
Zelensky is a master at perspective.

282
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,139
So the layman's way of thinking about perspective is reading the room.

283
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:24,360
Zelensky, you know, really tailors his messaging about needing more support for the war or

284
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,779
whatever, depending on who he's talking to brilliantly.

285
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:32,419
So he'll imbue Churchill when he's talking to the House of Lords or House of Commons

286
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:32,980
in the UK.

287
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,799
And then when he's talking to the US Congress, he'll be telling them how they're, you know,

288
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,139
the most amazing world power.

289
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,980
And he just knows how to bring people along.

290
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,740
And that's incredibly important for a leader.

291
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,000
And I love your message, you know, Kirsten, as well.

292
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,779
It's, you know, people listen to this and say that, you know, it's Dr. Kirsten Ferguson.

293
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,480
She's, you know, Air Force and CEO.

294
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,200
And how can I possibly achieve anything along those lines?

295
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:02,559
And, you know, you listen to people who, it just seems so far away.

296
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:03,240
But as you...

297
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,580
You say so often in preparation for this, reading your language, it's, you know, on

298
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,799
your home front, at the dinner table, in your workplace, every single day, you've got an

299
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,600
ability to have a positive impact as a leader on someone else.

300
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,700
And we need people to think that way, don't we?

301
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:21,960
So I genuinely believe that leadership is this series of moments.

302
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,360
And every moment gives us an opportunity to leave a positive legacy.

303
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,299
And at the start of the book, I actually write about a supermarket checkout operator that

304
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:31,679
I watched during the pandemic.

305
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:33,120
And she...

306
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,360
Wouldn't have been older than like 19 or 20, about the age of my daughters at the time.

307
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,460
And she was having to deal with one of the, you know, an older male customer.

308
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,320
I was behind him in the queue.

309
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,559
He was doing all the telltale, you know, he was frustrated and angry and just wanted to

310
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:50,940
get out.

311
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:57,299
And it was the peak of toilet paper madness and masks and all of that in the pandemic.

312
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,100
Anyway, as he stepped forward, he raised his voice quite loudly to her and said,

313
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,619
he was never going to shop there because he had to wear a mask and he wanted to, you know,

314
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,119
go somewhere with personal freedoms.

315
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,559
I stepped forward, as did most of the others around, ready to sort of step in and defend

316
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,319
this young woman.

317
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,779
And I mean, we needn't have worried.

318
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,180
She had far more patience and grace and leadership in the moment than I probably would have had.

319
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,279
And she just calmly explained to him that she also didn't like wearing a mask.

320
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:33,000
And in fact, she had to do it for many hours in a day, but that she did so to keep her

321
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,380
grandmother safe, who lived with her.

322
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,400
And she thanked him for wearing his mask and for helping keep her grandmother safe.

323
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:46,400
It was a moment where that young woman had no position or authority or staff or a business

324
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,640
card.

325
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,839
You couldn't have got a more junior person in that organisation, yet she was leading.

326
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,440
And I think if I, you know, if she was to know now that I have written about that example,

327
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,380
she'd be shocked.

328
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,599
I don't know who she is.

329
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,720
And she certainly probably doesn't even think of herself as a leader.

330
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:02,980
And I think that's a big part of it.

331
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,640
And that's what we need to change.

332
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,299
You don't need to have fancy degrees or have had career in the military or running companies

333
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,160
to be a leader.

334
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:13,480
You know, we're all different.

335
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:15,019
We've all got different responsibilities.

336
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:22,440
But she, in that moment, and for anyone listening who's doing anything where you impact others,

337
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,140
you've got that ability to lead.

338
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:27,299
And Kirsten, we're seeing that everywhere in the work.

339
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:29,200
You know, we're doing this space as well.

340
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,839
For us, it's almost like the shift from, we call it from

341
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:37,240
I to we, like it's a hyper-individualised time we've come out of in the world where

342
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,859
it's the self-help books around this is me and what else can I do to get better.

343
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,339
And that's why I love taking your head and heart scale as well, because there is self-reflection

344
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:49,000
in that around your impact.

345
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,720
And, you know, we feel like, you know, we created our own tool in that space as well,

346
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,359
because we wanted to get away from just, hey, you know, treat me this way and that's it,

347
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:02,500
as opposed to I'm consciously thinking like that beautiful story you just told around how I can

348
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:02,779
impact.

349
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,339
Others on a daily basis.

350
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:07,700
And when you do that, as you said, leadership's that series of moments and you get them

351
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,160
every day, whether you like them or not, don't you?

352
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,940
It's a choice on how you can act.

353
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,559
And if you learn behaviours, as you said, and they are learnt behaviours, you can have

354
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,440
a huge impact, can't you?

355
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:17,759
Oh, totally.

356
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,319
And so if you're a leader, a formal leader at work and you've got team members and you're

357
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:27,400
an arsehole and the way you ask for things to be done, which you might not even think

358
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,039
about, you know, you're just grumpy and ask someone to do something for you straight away.

359
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:32,980
That's a moment.

360
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:37,599
So that moment you have just left a legacy, that's for sure, but it ain't a good one.

361
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,420
Whereas you can be thinking about consciously, well, you know, how can I do this a bit differently?

362
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:46,740
How can I actually coach the person to come up with a solution themselves, not just tell

363
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,619
them what I want done?

364
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,519
I mean, it's endless, but it does take humility to do that.

365
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,359
And it does take that real self-awareness of knowing the impact you're having on others.

366
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:02,019
I remember an example of someone who their peers commented, they never said hello.

367
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:08,119
When they came in in the morning and they were still in an office and that was a legacy

368
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,039
they were leaving every single day.

369
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,140
You're reinforcing that you don't even say hello.

370
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,700
Now, that person who was doing that clearly lacked any self-awareness of the impact they

371
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,660
were having on others.

372
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,039
They obviously didn't have the humility to ask for feedback anytime or create an environment

373
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,400
that was safe to speak up.

374
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,599
And so, I mean, it's the most simple of examples.

375
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:31,400
But it's.

376
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:35,259
It's something that those people remembered and continue to remember.

377
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:39,619
And how powerful, Kirsten, I feel so privileged to have these conversations.

378
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,039
One of them was with Ange Postacoglu, who you might know is coaching Celtic and doing an

379
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:47,000
incredible job in every environment that he's in.

380
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,720
And you hear these sort of life hacks.

381
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:52,440
And one of the things Ange does, if you're the senior coach of a sporting organisation,

382
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,380
as you well know, the whole pulse of the organisation is really taken around the behaviours of

383
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,680
they just are so central to everything, the board, the players, the wellbeing.

384
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:08,619
His practice is every day, on his way in, he walks through and it's a handshake or a

385
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:10,180
fist bump with everyone in.

386
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:15,579
Now, it might cost him five minutes, but everyone in that organisation has touched him and seen

387
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:15,799
him.

388
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:19,559
And sometimes you stop and you have a minute and a half or, you know, clearly your time

389
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,380
is something you've got to manage.

390
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:26,359
But everyone, every day, you think how powerful that is for the most important person.

391
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,220
You've looked in the eye.

392
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:28,940
You've actually had a handshake.

393
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,380
It's learned behaviour, isn't it?

394
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:31,819
It's just.

395
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:36,119
It's something that is free that, but the impact is massive.

396
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:36,599
That's great.

397
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:39,619
I love, you know, the opportunity to share those type of stories because they're really

398
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:40,220
powerful, aren't they?

399
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,400
And the opposite, as you said, someone who's an arsehole in their workspace, the damage

400
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,980
you can do is off the charts as well, isn't it?

401
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:48,339
Yeah.

402
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,900
I want to call my next book Dinosaurs and Dickheads.

403
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,900
We all know who they are and we all have to work with them, but they can have a really

404
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,539
destructive impact.

405
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:01,799
And I think that's when.

406
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:07,960
And, you know, leaders who lead either of those need to be courageous and say, you might

407
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,680
actually be the best coach in the world, but you're having a destructive impact on the

408
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,740
culture of our club or the culture of our team.

409
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:16,759
You've got to go.

410
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:18,460
Dinosaurs and Dickheads.

411
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,440
I think you should.

412
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,119
I want to read that one as well.

413
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:23,740
And we've all been there.

414
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:25,299
We've all still to this day.

415
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,099
It's that hierarchy.

416
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,059
I'm important because I've got the corner office.

417
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:29,660
I've got power now.

418
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,619
And so I'll treat people below me.

419
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:36,440
That's the important point, Luke, is it's easy for us to point out people we think of

420
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,680
those, but frankly, we can all be dinosaurs and dickheads ourselves.

421
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,980
And so it's knowing when you're being a dickhead to really have that self-awareness that is

422
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,880
so critical.

423
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:48,140
So modern leaders aren't perfect.

424
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:50,359
There's no way that they get everything right.

425
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,279
They can absolutely be a dickhead on their worst day, but they know that's what they've

426
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:55,559
done.

427
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:00,980
And they'll either go through and either ask for feedback and, you know, with humility

428
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,799
say, I really.

429
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:03,420
I really missed the mark yesterday.

430
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,500
There's no excuse.

431
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,319
I don't want to do that again.

432
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,000
I really want you to make sure you let me know when I go down that path.

433
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,920
You know, that's the way modern leaders respond to dealing.

434
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,660
And that is a brilliant point, isn't it?

435
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,200
It's always easy pointing out the behavior of someone.

436
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,299
A lot harder when you put the mirror up and you're right.

437
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,579
All of us have been there, you know, and it's a work in progress.

438
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:27,900
We'll have our bad days because it happens a bit too regularly for me.

439
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,940
But I love what you said around the, the,

440
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,799
maybe the superpower.

441
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:33,160
Then putting your hand up, isn't it?

442
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,539
And say, Hey, I had a shocker there.

443
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,680
You know, I talk about it.

444
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,339
Beck and my wife, Beck, and I talk about that for kids doing that on the home front too,

445
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,920
to the, with the kids are saying, I got that wrong.

446
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:45,920
You know, my bad, lost my call there.

447
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,220
You know, I apologize.

448
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:50,420
You know, it's a pretty powerful thing to do, isn't it?

449
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,500
To go back and own your mistakes as well.

450
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,140
Oh, absolutely.

451
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,799
And I, I mean, as a mom of young kids, you're constantly losing your cool and then having

452
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:01,559
to go back and go, you know, look, I, I didn't handle that very well.

453
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:07,140
And I would even practice, you know, I'd ask the kids for feedback and they would, you

454
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,220
know, certainly give it to me.

455
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:13,859
But the fact I was asking, I think helped build that relationship.

456
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,880
And then you can't just ask and ignore it.

457
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,960
And it doesn't mean you have to agree with it either, but you're showing that, you know,

458
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,420
other people have a real voice and that you want to hear it.

459
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,000
And, you know, we all have three triggers when it comes to feedback and the first and

460
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,559
knowing what they are really helps.

461
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:30,880
So.

462
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,839
First is you're wrong and you just sit there thinking, oh my God, you know, I just don't

463
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:36,500
even agree with it.

464
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,980
Now, whenever my husband gives me feedback on packing the dishwasher, that pretty well

465
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,500
comes up.

466
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:45,140
And then so does the next one, which is the second trigger, you're an idiot.

467
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:50,940
And so then the feedback you're hearing is impacted by the relationship that you've got

468
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,519
with the person.

469
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:56,880
And it could be the best feedback in the world, but you're clouded by the audacity of this

470
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,140
person to come and give it to you.

471
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,400
But the third one, which really is the one we need.

472
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,599
To understand is it triggers something in ourself.

473
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:10,960
So, you know, it triggers a sense of shame or anger or embarrassment or whatever it is

474
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,259
that's going on for you.

475
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,960
And I think the more we can be aware of our triggers, that's when obviously that self

476
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,180
awareness really gets practiced.

477
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,500
We've seen you in real time, Kirsten, having to live the words that you speak.

478
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,500
And I think of 2018, you became the chair of the ABC, the Australian Broadcasting

479
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:35,279
Commission, at a fairly tumultuous time, would be reasonable to say.

480
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:40,779
The previous chair, Justin Milne, had resigned and there was accusations that there'd been

481
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:44,039
interference with the editorial independence of the ABC.

482
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,400
And suddenly you're in the chair.

483
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:47,799
And I can remember this really well.

484
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,579
And I'm thinking, this is going to be interesting because the journos aren't going to let you

485
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:52,180
off the hook here.

486
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,380
Your own ABC journos aren't.

487
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,680
And I think you're fronted straight up.

488
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,299
I might have been with Lee Sales or straight into the hot seat.

489
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,480
Tell me about...

490
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,799
Tell me about that moment in time.

491
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,480
But I can see your smiling face now.

492
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:04,099
That's what you did.

493
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,339
You came on...

494
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:09,380
I was smiling now, but it was certainly...

495
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:15,059
I was in the hot seat and it was utterly unexpected and something I hadn't prepared for at all.

496
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:20,720
I had never been on television and my first experience was a 20-minute live interview.

497
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:25,940
And so, I mean, that really tests your ability to stay calm under pressure.

498
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:30,480
And I think, if anything, I drew on my military experience through all of that.

499
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:37,299
Because, you know, I knew what was needed was just a calming influence in what was a very

500
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:38,480
tumultuous time.

501
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:41,960
And that's what I was able to draw on.

502
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:45,960
And I feel really fortunate that I was able to stay calm publicly.

503
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:50,980
It doesn't mean that privately, you know, it's not this enormous pressure that you feel.

504
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,220
And I wasn't used to being papped.

505
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,099
I'd never had people, you know, trying to find where I was.

506
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,619
And that was really quite...

507
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:02,819
You know, confronting for anyone who's not used to that.

508
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,960
But I've always been very focused on duty and, you know, what's needed in the moment.

509
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,900
And that's how I sort of got through that period and got a group of trusted advisors.

510
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,380
Because you have everyone coming out of the woodwork wanting to tell you what you should do.

511
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:26,559
And I think being able to narrow that down to just a very small handful that you truly trust and, you know,

512
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:29,380
have the best interests, in this case, of the organisation.

513
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:32,940
And that was all I could really focus on doing at that time.

514
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,900
And you did it beautifully.

515
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:37,059
You referenced your time in the Air Force there.

516
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,980
You felt that was really helpful in that pressure situation?

517
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:43,140
Yeah, I do, actually.

518
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,539
You never know how you'll react to those kind of situations until you're in them.

519
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,019
Like, you can't practice for it, really.

520
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:56,039
And because nothing's ever going to feel as real as the pressure that is actually happening.

521
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,440
And I know when the announcement was made that I was...

522
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,339
I was acting chair.

523
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,819
I think the Prime Minister did it on live TV at about nine in the morning.

524
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,920
And I hadn't even told my children or anything what was going on.

525
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:12,759
So, you know, there's frantic calls from them as they see their mother's name all over the news.

526
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,720
Like, what is going on?

527
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:21,759
So, yeah, I think the military teaches you a lot about, you know,

528
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:26,640
that leading in a situation where there's serious consequences

529
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,759
and that you need to lead...

530
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,500
lead in a way that brings people along,

531
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,160
that reads the room, again, back to this perspective.

532
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,579
Like, you actually understand what's going to help navigate a situation as best you can.

533
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,339
And, you know, in that particular point in time,

534
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:45,900
it was very hard to know how to navigate.

535
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,259
There were so many things happening in different contexts.

536
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:54,599
But I do think that my military training definitely enabled me to draw on

537
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:59,279
some perhaps long, dormant skills of just leading,

538
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,180
in that moment and prioritising and, you know,

539
00:29:02,259 --> 00:29:04,640
just fighting the fire that's in front of your face,

540
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,440
not the one that's there tomorrow.

541
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,140
You haven't got time to look at that yet.

542
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:10,400
Let's just look at the immediate priority.

543
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:15,400
You've been a really passionate advocate for diversity and women.

544
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:17,640
Your first book, Women Kind,

545
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,700
Unlocking the Power of Women Supporting Women,

546
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:22,500
is another incredible piece of work.

547
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,119
I encourage people to check out all of Kirsten's work.

548
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:26,519
It's really profound.

549
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:29,400
But you do talk about really running away from that.

550
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,839
In your earlier years,

551
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,980
that that wasn't something you saw as being important.

552
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:42,299
And now you've become an incredible, passionate, supportive driver of that.

553
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,759
I mean, I feel even my own world, Kirsten, it's a learning experience.

554
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:47,740
I went to an all-boys school.

555
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,240
I played AFL football in an all-male environment.

556
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,980
Your unconscious bias is just, it's real.

557
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,819
And you really have to learn if you want to have an impact.

558
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,759
And then you see the incredible,

559
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,799
incredible benefit of diversity of thinking around you.

560
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,339
And it's just so dumb.

561
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,339
I know, you think, weren't we idiots?

562
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,359
How dumb were we?

563
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,299
How dumb were we not to even understand that?

564
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:12,660
It still fills ticker box for some people in that space.

565
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:15,079
Is that still there for you?

566
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,980
Well, I think firstly to explain why, yeah, until maybe a decade ago,

567
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,779
I would run from women's events.

568
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,180
I just never wanted to be seen at some women's leadership thing.

569
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,299
And that was because I came through male domination.

570
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:39,299
I didn't want to be seen as a female leader or a female Air Force officer.

571
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:41,599
I just wanted to be one of the guys.

572
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,880
And that unfortunately stuck with me a long way through my career.

573
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:49,539
And it's such a waste now for exactly for you, as you say,

574
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,420
because had I been able to draw on the power of, you know,

575
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,180
other women who are all experiencing the same thing,

576
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,140
we would have had a very different experience.

577
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,500
But I think, yeah, you're right.

578
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:05,579
Some people do not understand the value of diversity and inclusion.

579
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:08,539
And generally, it's those people who have been privileged enough

580
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:13,779
not to have to have ever experienced what it's like to not be in the majority.

581
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,099
I think that's getting better.

582
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,480
And I think women in particular, if we're just talking on gender,

583
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,819
because intersectionality is so important.

584
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,420
So if you imagine women of colour and men of colour

585
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:29,039
have very different experiences to white women and white men.

586
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,059
But I think if we just look at gender,

587
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,359
I think there's a lot of work that is being done,

588
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:36,680
but it just is never enough.

589
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,660
We never seem to, you know, the change is still glacial.

590
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,640
But I think the way women now are able to talk about their experiences

591
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,480
is something that I'm just thrilled about,

592
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,000
because for so long, we would never raise issues at all.

593
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,759
Yeah, and I'm seeing in real time,

594
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,720
because some of the work we're doing in our space,

595
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,299
a leader is the name of the business.

596
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:58,680
And we've...

597
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,319
Forming these groups together, a leader connect of different leaders

598
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,839
from around the world, effectively groups of five or six.

599
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,420
And the brilliance is the diversity.

600
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:10,900
And the brilliance is putting outstanding female, you know,

601
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:14,779
leaders with male leaders or people from the world of the arts,

602
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,339
with sports people, with people from, you know,

603
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,640
and you only know what you know, don't you?

604
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,799
Or you don't know what you don't know.

605
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:25,940
And so for us in real time to see the genius of that unfolding

606
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,799
is a really special thing.

607
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,220
And out of that,

608
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,180
Kirsten, we've seen our own patterns

609
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,839
around what we think great leadership looks like.

610
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:35,579
And I think there's a lot of intersection in your world here.

611
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,799
I've been looking forward to asking these questions to you,

612
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:40,940
because I think you're going to have a very profound understanding of it.

613
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:44,700
And we see self-leadership really as the sort of cornerstone.

614
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,119
And perhaps that is a language you use with self-awareness.

615
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:51,059
But effectively, we don't feel like you can lead someone else

616
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:52,779
unless you've got a sense of being able to lead yourself.

617
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
When you think of self-leadership, what does that mean to you?

618
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,119
I think it's firstly a mindset.

619
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,940
That you are aware that you are a leader.

620
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,720
And again, we're talking about in that sphere

621
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,839
of whatever your life might look like.

622
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,519
So you could be a single mum at home with a few kids

623
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,819
thinking about starting a jewellery-making business online.

624
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,900
You are leading in that moment.

625
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,579
As soon as you start to have those ideas,

626
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,960
the influence you're having on your kids as a role model,

627
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:22,079
the choices you're making,

628
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:24,480
how you're going to bring them up or how you're going to support them.

629
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,140
All of that is leadership.

630
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:29,400
And I think until you actually understand that you are leading,

631
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,440
and you are a role model,

632
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:35,039
it's hard to then think about what that self-leadership looks like.

633
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,700
But then for me, it comes back to those moments.

634
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,980
It's knowing that in every single moment,

635
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:45,579
you've got that ability to not only leave a legacy to someone else,

636
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:46,559
but for yourself.

637
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,460
Because each moment that you lead in a way that you're proud of

638
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,940
reinforces what works well and you'll do more of

639
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,920
and be braver about in the future.

640
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,119
Can I drill into that a little bit more?

641
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,299
And for someone, you know, a mother, a CEO,

642
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:06,859
you know, so many different areas that you've taken on.

643
00:34:06,859 --> 00:34:09,340
I mean, practically on a daily basis, you know,

644
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:13,119
what are the things that have served you well to be able to manage?

645
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,880
You know, we're all trying to do that,

646
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,059
but are there some practical things?

647
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:16,960
You know, that's my day.

648
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,539
And when I do that, I'm at my absolute best.

649
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:20,760
Yeah.

650
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,940
Like, I am a pretty good balance of head and hearts.

651
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,860
And the way that looks practically is I'm very task-focused.

652
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,079
Like, in a default sense, you know,

653
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,400
I'm very disciplined in the work that I do

654
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,219
and I know what I need to do in any given day

655
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:42,400
and I'm never late and I'm very professional

656
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,760
and all of those sorts of things.

657
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:47,860
That, to me, is incredibly important for my sense of self-efficacy

658
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,420
or self-leadership in a different way of thinking about it.

659
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:54,940
But then the heart side for me is I'm very aware

660
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:58,460
of when I'm getting burnt out or when I'm tired

661
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,239
or when I'm stressed.

662
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:05,260
Or when I am feeling that I've lost that courage

663
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,219
to sort of, you know, having, you might feel a day

664
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:11,280
where you just, my kids and I call it a blah day,

665
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,920
where you just feel a bit blah.

666
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,280
You know, you just haven't got the same energy.

667
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:18,980
I'm pretty good at knowing what's going on with that.

668
00:35:19,179 --> 00:35:22,059
And so, you know, that balance for me comes

669
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:24,820
from understanding that both are important.

670
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:29,039
So, even though that drive is there to,

671
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,860
you know, get everything done and be perfect,

672
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:34,719
I'm really aware of what it means to need to take a day

673
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:36,440
or more as well.

674
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,119
And so, I'm not sure if that answers your question,

675
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:44,179
but for me, that is the holistic way that I self-lead

676
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:48,159
because I achieve, yet I regulate

677
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,280
and hopefully together they work.

678
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:54,400
That's a brilliant way to explain it.

679
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:55,659
I love it.

680
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,719
It's, you know, clearly comes out in all your writing

681
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:58,300
and all your work.

682
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:58,960
But yeah, it is.

683
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:01,199
It's useful to hear someone talk about your life.

684
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:03,039
And we all know those days, don't you?

685
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:04,760
Where you just cannot, for whatever reason,

686
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:07,179
function and focus and...

687
00:36:07,179 --> 00:36:08,559
Well, there's nothing wrong with you.

688
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:09,679
You're just human.

689
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:11,300
You're just human.

690
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:12,440
Having a crap day.

691
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:14,079
Yeah, being kind to yourself.

692
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:16,039
But it took me a long time to get that.

693
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:19,260
You know, perfectionism was definitely a driving feature.

694
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:21,420
Ambition when I was younger, you know,

695
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,199
just wanting to achieve and achieve and achieve.

696
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:25,760
And I think I got the balance wrong.

697
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,199
And so, it's taken confidence over time.

698
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:31,000
And to understand that if you get the balance right,

699
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:33,559
it actually will help you be more successful.

700
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,840
Can I just add one other thing that I think is really important

701
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,099
is being yourself in all contexts.

702
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,599
So, the way I'm talking with you now is the way I am

703
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,480
when I'm in board meetings or when I'm giving speeches

704
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,599
or when I'm with my family or when I'm at the pub with my friends.

705
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:55,800
You know, that consistency of who we are and removing that armour.

706
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,079
And I think for many of us going to work in particular,

707
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:00,860
you know, you can't be yourself.

708
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,039
And some of that could be self-imposed.

709
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:05,699
Some of it could be cultural.

710
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:09,300
But if it is self-imposed, realising that, in fact,

711
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,420
everyone around you just wants to see the person you are

712
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,360
because it's going to make you a much more authentic leader too.

713
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:18,500
It's tiring trying to be someone else all the time.

714
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:18,699
Yeah, it's exhausting.

715
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,300
Yeah, hard to keep that up.

716
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,320
But also, you know, important to understand that as well.

717
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,119
We see leaders are really modern leaders in our version,

718
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,179
really conscious about how they go about impacting people.

719
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:31,139
And their environment in a positive way.

720
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:33,920
I mean, I'm sure that's what you do.

721
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:36,559
How do you think about that impact on people positively?

722
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:39,340
Well, I think, firstly,

723
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:45,960
our sense of self-awareness is much greater than it actually is.

724
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:47,760
So that's something to be aware of.

725
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,059
And research shows 95% of us think we're self-aware

726
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:55,219
and only 10% to 15% of those that we lead agree.

727
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,219
So that's a pretty scary statistic.

728
00:37:58,559 --> 00:37:58,639
Yeah.

729
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:58,699
Yeah.

730
00:37:58,699 --> 00:37:58,719
Yeah.

731
00:37:58,719 --> 00:37:58,739
Yeah.

732
00:37:58,739 --> 00:37:58,760
Yeah.

733
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:58,780
Yeah.

734
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:58,800
Yeah.

735
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:58,880
Yeah.

736
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:58,940
Yeah.

737
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:58,960
Yeah.

738
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:58,980
Yeah.

739
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:01,780
When you say having a positive impact,

740
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,579
I guess my first thought is how do you know it's positive?

741
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,119
Because we may have a sense that, oh,

742
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:12,179
they love it when I fist pump them every day

743
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:13,340
when I come into the office.

744
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,639
There could also be a situation where everyone dreads

745
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:19,159
that they've got to do that every morning

746
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:22,199
because you do that as a perfunctory thing.

747
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,079
But then for the rest of the day, you're the dickhead.

748
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,780
So there's this whole sense of understanding

749
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:33,280
how you're impacting people, but only through feedback.

750
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:39,940
Like unless you're actually checking how that impact is being measured,

751
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,019
I think it's hard for us to judge.

752
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,780
Sorry, that feels like a complicated way to answer your question.

753
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,579
But whenever we say a positive impact, how do you know?

754
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,599
How do you know?

755
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:55,159
That's a great thought and one that is challenging in some ways, isn't it?

756
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,260
Because you're right.

757
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,159
I mean, that's that, isn't it?

758
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:58,400
You think you're self-aware.

759
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,900
But if you're not measuring it and asking people

760
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,059
and not reflecting constantly, then how do you actually know?

761
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,659
Can I give you an example?

762
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,420
During the pandemic at the start when we were all at home,

763
00:39:09,659 --> 00:39:12,179
there were a lot of leaders who thought they needed to check in

764
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:16,840
with their teams online like every hour, every day or whatever.

765
00:39:17,019 --> 00:39:20,300
And there were team members just going, can you just back off?

766
00:39:20,539 --> 00:39:23,599
Like, I know you care, but this is now really irritating

767
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,380
because I don't need you to check in.

768
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,380
So, I mean, that's so simple.

769
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,800
But it's that idea that we must get feedback

770
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,980
and we must create a feedback culture where people feel they can say,

771
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:42,059
mate, the fist pumps, we love the intention, but let's focus on this instead.

772
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:42,900
Maybe once a week.

773
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:43,940
Yeah.

774
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:45,659
Wind it back, dude.

775
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,400
Wind it back.

776
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,599
Well, yeah, no, it is a great point, isn't it?

777
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,699
And not many of us take that time out in our environments to actually ask, do we?

778
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:57,539
We don't actually think of, hey, that's 20 people I interact with every day.

779
00:39:57,539 --> 00:39:57,940
Right.

780
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,380
Am I prepared?

781
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,440
Because there's courage in it, isn't it, too, to actually, do you really want to hear it?

782
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:06,300
Or, you know, are you going to pretend that you're self-aware?

783
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:08,599
So, no, it's a great point.

784
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,320
Creating and sharing a vision is something we see leaders are really conscious of,

785
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,139
modern leaders, about how they create, how they share that vision,

786
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:17,800
how they get a team involved in that vision.

787
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,480
Does that resonate with you?

788
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,940
Yes, unless it's the modern leader thinking, A, they need to create the vision

789
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,900
and, B, they need to drive it.

790
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,880
So, I would see a vision very much as a collective thing.

791
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:37,500
And so, modern leaders, yes, will realize that a vision is important for bringing everyone

792
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,420
along on the same journey, but they won't ever think that they're responsible for it.

793
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:48,880
You know, they're a guide to help bring together the views of everyone else.

794
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,599
But there's a lot of leaders who think that if they write the vision, everyone else is,

795
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:56,059
you know, going to be, woohoo, that's fantastic.

796
00:40:56,059 --> 00:40:57,000
I'm following you.

797
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,380
And that's probably lip service, really, unless you've brought them along from the beginning.

798
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,340
And there's an art in that too, isn't there?

799
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,460
Clearly, to get a group of people to want to achieve together and manage all of that.

800
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:12,039
And, you know, we've seen a big shift in sport, Kirsten, around, you know,

801
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:17,460
it was very hierarchical era the year I played and you didn't have any say at all in your environment.

802
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,400
Even if you're 15 years in with more experience than the coach,

803
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:25,699
sometimes you weren't, you know, collaborated with in any way, shape or form.

804
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:26,699
So, that ownership.

805
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,880
That ownership of your own space.

806
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,920
Feeling like you've got a voice in your own space, isn't it?

807
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,340
And having someone, as you said, guide you along the path,

808
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:35,320
that's when it can be really powerful and really healthy, isn't it?

809
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,460
But it's a balance.

810
00:41:37,139 --> 00:41:37,760
Yeah, yeah.

811
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,460
I mean, everyone should have a voice.

812
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:45,659
From the most junior checkout operator through to the CEO of Woolworths or Coles,

813
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,760
the responsibilities are different, but they're still vital cogs in the same organisation.

814
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,780
And so, I think it's more, there's a lot of nuance in what we're talking about,

815
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,139
Luke.

816
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:01,559
So, I mean, there's no doubt that leaders are responsible for making sure there is a vision,

817
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,300
for example.

818
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:09,099
But I think it's this idea of thinking that you're the only solution to any problem

819
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:11,880
is where leaders are going to fall foul.

820
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,659
And I've seen that in the media space a lot, Kirsten, where, you know,

821
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,639
some of the best ideas and some of the most creative people

822
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:23,659
don't get ever asked about their thoughts because they're in a junior position

823
00:42:23,659 --> 00:42:26,599
and it's five or six people sitting around a board table.

824
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,199
That are the gatekeepers for all good ideas.

825
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,460
That's what a waste, isn't it?

826
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:36,860
When you've got, you know, all those people out there to listen to and we don't ask.

827
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,500
Yeah, I interviewed in my book a whole range of different leaders.

828
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,860
And one of them was Benjamin Law, who's a writer and producer.

829
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,619
And he was just on Survivor, actually.

830
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:48,780
But he used the example that in a writer's room,

831
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,599
there's the producer and the head writer and the other writers.

832
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:54,159
But there's always a note taker.

833
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:58,119
And the note taker tends to be the most junior person

834
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:01,300
and how often they're totally ignored.

835
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:05,300
Yet they'll have the contribution that when he has sorted out

836
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,639
is exactly the piece of particularly lived experience

837
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:12,039
because they're generally from marginalized backgrounds.

838
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:16,760
That's perfect for the solution that they're looking for.

839
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,840
And so he always now seeks out the views of the note taker.

840
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,719
But it's this idea for anyone listening,

841
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:26,820
who's the note taker in your room that you're just ignoring,

842
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,219
that little do you know, they've got the perfect solution.

843
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,039
Everyone should have a voice.

844
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,039
It's obviously in a board meeting, it's different,

845
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:37,340
but you can still make this idea work.

846
00:43:38,139 --> 00:43:41,139
Curiosity is a common word we use as well.

847
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,579
And clearly one of the dimensions you talk about

848
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:46,739
and modern leaders really using curiosity

849
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:50,559
as they're jumping off point, Kirsten, to how they learn and develop themselves.

850
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:52,699
Can you expand on why curiosity?

851
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:53,639
Is so important for you?

852
00:43:54,219 --> 00:43:56,960
Yeah, because it means you've got this genuine thirst

853
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,639
to fill a gap in your knowledge.

854
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,780
But the most important part of it for me

855
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,659
is that it means you've accepted that you don't know everything.

856
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:06,639
So this idea of leaders who feel they need to be

857
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:08,219
the smartest person in the room,

858
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:10,460
that is kryptonite to curiosity

859
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,139
or assumptions are kryptonite to curiosity.

860
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,920
My family has a saying called mum's disease.

861
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,820
And no, I don't have a disease.

862
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,340
I've got nothing wrong with me.

863
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,159
But what I do have a tendency to do

864
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:22,219
is one of the things that I do is I do a lot of research.

865
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:22,260
And I do a lot of research.

866
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:22,300
And I do a lot of research.

867
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:22,340
And I do a lot of research.

868
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:22,380
And I do a lot of research.

869
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:22,420
And I do a lot of research.

870
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,900
One of them will start a sentence

871
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,079
and I will have already thought of a solution

872
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,360
or worse, I've verbalized a solution

873
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,519
before they've even finished.

874
00:44:29,659 --> 00:44:32,579
And so now they just go, mum's disease and walk away.

875
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:35,659
Because that assumption I'm making

876
00:44:35,659 --> 00:44:38,099
is an end to being curious

877
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:40,079
about what they might be about to say.

878
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:43,360
So for me, curiosity is that real willingness to listen

879
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,699
and to then rethink what you thought you knew.

880
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,340
And that is key to being a modern leader.

881
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,840
We simply do not have all the answers.

882
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,119
And if you think you do, obviously, you've got a long way to go.

883
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,039
I love the feedback on the home front.

884
00:44:58,719 --> 00:44:59,880
Oh yeah, so do I.

885
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,019
Really love it, Luke.

886
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:01,579
I love it.

887
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:06,239
I've got a 17-year-old daughter who's giving me plenty of feedback regularly,

888
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,280
whether I like it or not.

889
00:45:09,699 --> 00:45:10,539
But it is, isn't it?

890
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:11,820
It's the mirror up, isn't it?

891
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,619
It's often the...

892
00:45:12,619 --> 00:45:14,019
Yeah, and they're spot on.

893
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,579
The things that trigger you the most generally

894
00:45:16,579 --> 00:45:18,960
are the things that you know they're right.

895
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:21,500
Which is really annoying at the same time.

896
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:21,559
Yeah.

897
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:21,619
Yeah.

898
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:21,679
Yeah.

899
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:21,820
Yeah.

900
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,340
Very irritating.

901
00:45:23,539 --> 00:45:26,880
Communicating with clarity is something we, again,

902
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,519
see leaders really conscious about how they communicate,

903
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:30,579
how often they communicate.

904
00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:32,840
Is that something you've given thought to as well?

905
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,199
Yeah, of course.

906
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:37,360
I mean, unless you can speak in a language

907
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,219
that is received by those you're leading,

908
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,360
then you may as well be speaking a different language altogether.

909
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:49,039
I think too many leaders look to blame the people

910
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:51,679
that they're leading for not getting it.

911
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:55,019
Whereas, you know, it's absolutely put the mirror up.

912
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,340
If you're not communicating in a way that simplifies ideas

913
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:03,260
or is at a pace as in, you know, if there's a lot of change happening,

914
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:07,400
if you haven't matched the pace to the people that you're leading.

915
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,019
And I know that was something I always fell into the trap of

916
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:13,280
as a much younger leader because I was so ambitious

917
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,699
and wanting to do things quickly and move forward.

918
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,940
But, you know, you can only ever go at the pace

919
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:21,539
of the slowest member of the team who you need

920
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:22,239
to bring along.

921
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:26,659
So I think there's a lot of importance for leaders, again,

922
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,360
and it all comes back to that self-awareness

923
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,719
of the impact of their communication,

924
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:33,460
but also getting feedback from others on how effective it is.

925
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,599
And if you're getting feedback that it's not hitting the mark,

926
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:38,840
that is only on you to change.

927
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,480
Yeah, beautifully said.

928
00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:44,039
How important is collaboration to you as a modern leader, Kirsten?

929
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,480
Well, we're not islands, so we are not modern leaders

930
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,840
on our own, that's for sure.

931
00:46:51,539 --> 00:46:54,219
I think the idea of collaborating or collectively leading,

932
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:59,139
I think, is the only way that we can all move together.

933
00:46:59,139 --> 00:47:01,920
And, you know, that, again, is thinking about leadership

934
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,980
in a formal and an informal sense.

935
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:06,840
And so in families, you collaborate on your leadership.

936
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,460
You know, we don't ever call it that, but that's what's happening

937
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,500
when you're arguing about who's picking up the kids from school

938
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,179
or doing all that.

939
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,420
Ultimately, that's a collaboration of a leadership team

940
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,519
that may or may not be communicating well.

941
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:23,400
But at work, it's absolutely critical.

942
00:47:23,659 --> 00:47:26,360
And, you know, I like to think about the collective leadership

943
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:30,280
we've seen from movements like Me Too or Black Lives Matters.

944
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,400
You know, that is a collective leadership model,

945
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,739
and I think we're seeing that more and more.

946
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,820
It's interesting you mention that.

947
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,599
My mind was going a little bit the other way on an international stage

948
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:44,219
and politically to a lot of autocratic leaders that are emerging

949
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:48,340
around the globe and this sort of trend, you know, in the time.

950
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,760
And, you know, we know the names.

951
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,500
You don't even have to.

952
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:51,940
Just to say them out loud.

953
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:52,219
Putin.

954
00:47:52,699 --> 00:47:52,980
Yeah.

955
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:53,320
Trump.

956
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,079
Yeah.

957
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:54,800
Thanks, thanks.

958
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,079
Yeah.

959
00:47:55,659 --> 00:47:58,000
And the list goes on, doesn't it?

960
00:47:58,019 --> 00:48:03,320
That disturbing trend, you know, the opposite of you don't see humility there,

961
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:03,539
do you?

962
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:05,099
You don't see curiosity, you know.

963
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:08,780
And even I felt, you know, through the COVID times,

964
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,320
a lot of leaders shrunk their cabinets to one or two people

965
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:17,679
and didn't take on advice outside of their very, very inner circle,

966
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:19,860
which is sort of counterintuitive to, I think,

967
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,059
the wisdom that you're talking about.

968
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:23,559
Yeah, it was fascinating.

969
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:24,760
I loved watching.

970
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,380
Well, obviously, I didn't enjoy the pandemic, but I did love watching it.

971
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:32,099
It was like a leadership experiment, you know, that we were watching real time.

972
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:39,820
And I think that default to consolidating power is a real throwback to that

973
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:45,940
ingrained stereotypes of leadership that I mentioned earlier that we've had for

974
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:50,199
centuries, where it's that command and control and the idea that, you know,

975
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:55,059
in a battle or in a war that we were waging, you know, you have the one supreme leader.

976
00:48:55,340 --> 00:49:00,900
But if you go and look at Volodymyr Zelensky, he's very openly actually fighting a war

977
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:07,840
and has a large group of people that he will share leadership with and that he relies on.

978
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:12,619
Because, you know, if you can't do that, then I think we've got a lot of problems.

979
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:18,000
And, you know, I know from having been put in that difficult situation leading that we're

980
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,179
talking about before, the more people are.

981
00:49:20,179 --> 00:49:24,840
The more people are around you to actually support and help you come up with good solutions

982
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,199
and good ideas, the better.

983
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:32,659
So, you know, it stumped me why we saw that, particularly here as well, where we came to

984
00:49:32,659 --> 00:49:38,280
learn afterwards that there was a lot of consolidation of power going on.

985
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,960
And I'm sure you would have been, you would be familiar with Jim Collins's great work

986
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,219
in Good to Great.

987
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,579
And he talks about that level five leader.

988
00:49:46,579 --> 00:49:49,000
And he's done so much research and study.

989
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,000
And that.

990
00:49:50,179 --> 00:49:56,179
The sustainable success comes from that modern leader that's humble, the organizations, you

991
00:49:56,179 --> 00:49:58,940
know, you might get a sugar hit, you know, he references in his book, I think, you know,

992
00:49:59,019 --> 00:50:03,539
Mike Chainsaw Dunlap was a sort of flavor of the month and come around and, you know,

993
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:05,719
literally with the chainsaw and sack everyone.

994
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,739
And, you know, you get the spike in bottom line for a period of time.

995
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,659
But afterwards, horrific results.

996
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:18,539
But the humble, self-aware, self-great leader, good to great, you know, had sustained success,

997
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:19,420
as you were saying.

998
00:50:19,579 --> 00:50:19,699
And I.

999
00:50:20,179 --> 00:50:21,860
I think that pattern's pretty, pretty clear.

1000
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:24,940
I want to ask you this question or two final questions, if that's OK.

1001
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:26,940
I've been asking this of all the guests.

1002
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,579
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1003
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,079
Um, I can't give you an answer.

1004
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,880
I have a buffet that I call on.

1005
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,800
And I know you want to name.

1006
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,699
Can you give us the buffet?

1007
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,800
No, I want the buffet.

1008
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:45,019
No, but there's family members, public figures, men, women, strangers, supermarket operators.

1009
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:50,099
Like, I just don't think there's any one leader that ticks all the boxes.

1010
00:50:50,179 --> 00:50:51,679
Well, not for me anyway.

1011
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:55,639
And I, I like to learn from a diverse group of leaders.

1012
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:57,800
So I, I genuinely can't give you one.

1013
00:50:58,179 --> 00:50:59,880
Which is a great answer, Kirsten.

1014
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:00,380
I love it.

1015
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:00,880
Yeah.

1016
00:51:01,139 --> 00:51:01,840
It's a buffet.

1017
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,340
I have a buffet.

1018
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,500
Is there some examples along the way that, that we could, you could share?

1019
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:11,179
Endless, you know, so, well, Jacinda Ardern's amazing and Volodymyr Zelensky there, top of my list at the moment.

1020
00:51:11,179 --> 00:51:16,219
Satya Nadella, the way that he's leading Microsoft, he's put empathy as a bottom line value.

1021
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:19,679
The late Arne Sorensen, who led Marriott Group.

1022
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,179
He was.

1023
00:51:20,179 --> 00:51:21,179
He's an incredible leader.

1024
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:29,679
I write about a guy called Captain Will Swenson at the start of my book, who did this incredible moment of leadership in the Afghanistan war.

1025
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:39,420
Like there's just, I could come on and on, but all of them have qualities that I think together we can learn from, but there's no one person that does that.

1026
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:46,599
Given you've got a PhD in leadership, I'm probably not surprised by the answer you've, you've covered, you've covered some ground.

1027
00:51:46,599 --> 00:51:49,679
It was always going to be hard to, to know on one answer there.

1028
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:50,920
For sure.

1029
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:57,519
But I, I love the thought of it is that constantly learning from those around us, we're, we're a bit obsessed with the idea of collaboration for modern leaders.

1030
00:51:57,519 --> 00:51:59,519
And, and I do like asking this question.

1031
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:11,199
I think I'm going to get a similar answer, but if you could collaborate with, with anyone on, you've got such diverse range of interests and you, and you see that from you in, in media and sport and, and the Air Force.

1032
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:15,599
Is there someone you think, God, if I could have, or could collaborate, is there anyone that springs to mind?

1033
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,940
Oh, you know, the person I would love to sit down with.

1034
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:31,440
And understand is Greta Thunberg, not because, I mean, she's doing great things, but she is a leader that is, breaks every rule of leadership.

1035
00:52:31,699 --> 00:52:32,760
You know, she was a teenager.

1036
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:42,360
She had no followers, no power, no authority, yet she has obviously galvanized millions of people around the world.

1037
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,199
There's no one who wouldn't call her a leader.

1038
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:48,199
And so I'm fascinated by her unconsciousness.

1039
00:52:48,940 --> 00:53:02,280
Conscious approach to leadership and what that would look like and how we could motivate that, whatever that kernel of leadership that was in her that gave her the courage to just speak up when she did.

1040
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:09,539
Imagine if you had people all over the world in whatever it is they're doing or believing in having that same motivation.

1041
00:53:09,539 --> 00:53:17,719
So I think that's more of an answer that's around my curiosity, but yeah, she fascinates me.

1042
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:18,519
Yeah.

1043
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,019
Fascinates me as well.

1044
00:53:20,179 --> 00:53:29,219
You know, 15-year-old, 16-year-old from Sweden, you know, without, as you said, any identifiable reason that she would become so influential.

1045
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,860
It's a great story.

1046
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,079
And there's so many great stories.

1047
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:38,599
I've loved reading and learning a lot about your life and the way you've gone about it.

1048
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:40,420
