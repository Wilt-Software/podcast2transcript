00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,169
Hi, it's Luke Darcy.

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,150
Thank you again for joining me on the Empowering Leaders podcast.

3
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:14,570
I hope you're enjoying it as much as I am recording these conversations.

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,109
The upcoming guest, Michael Hewitt Gleeson.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,269
What a legend.

6
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:20,629
I learned an incredible amount from this conversation,

7
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:25,449
so much so that we lost track of time and have decided to release this in two parts.

8
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:26,910
Both are ready to go now.

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,689
It was a fascinating insight from a man who has collected wisdom right across his life.

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:33,929
I hope you enjoy it.

11
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:34,909
On with the conversation.

12
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:38,640
G'day, it's Luke Darcy.

13
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:42,520
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,280
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

15
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:47,200
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,939
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

17
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:53,100
in education, sport, industry and the arts

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,060
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,539
where everyone has a voice.

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,100
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

21
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:20,439
I love every time I change topic.

22
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,760
You've got another book, Wombat,

23
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,700
selling another one of your brilliant books,

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,000
Word of Mouth, Buy and Tell,

25
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,480
and your sales philosophy sort of pivots into that concept.

26
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:34,019
Can you explain that?

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,900
So, yeah, Wombat, Word of Mouth, Buy and Tell,

28
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:39,280
and it's also Australian, not American, sorry.

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,540
But the idea is the goal in most businesses is to close the sale,

30
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,099
is to get a deal or to get a customer.

31
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,099
So, yeah.

32
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,640
A very, very big in science is replication.

33
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:55,420
You know, I won't go into it all, but it's a very big thing.

34
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:59,980
The whole genetic structure of everything is based on replication

35
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,180
and what happens when genes replicate

36
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,219
and what happens when they replicate accurately

37
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:08,900
and what they have when they replicate with a little flaw

38
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,680
and that plays all out into evolution and everything else.

39
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,560
So, replication is...

40
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,259
And there's only two replicators that we know of at present in science,

41
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:18,259
genes and memes.

42
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,360
Memes are like idea viruses.

43
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,039
Yeah.

44
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:21,879
So...

45
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,580
Darwin's theory would...

46
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,560
Yeah, and applies to them as well.

47
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,199
That's evolution.

48
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,340
The little defaults change evolution.

49
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,240
Yeah, mistakes are the important thing.

50
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:31,439
Yeah.

51
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:35,379
Is what enables us to survive in a changing environment.

52
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,520
Now, if the environment was stable, then you wouldn't want that.

53
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,639
You'd want everything to replicate accurately.

54
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,020
Yeah.

55
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,319
But in a changing environment, which it always is,

56
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:47,840
it's actually the mutations or the mistakes that enables accidentally

57
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,419
to a certain copy.

58
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,539
Yeah.

59
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,800
And the other ones die off, you know.

60
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,099
So, the same with memes.

61
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:01,099
So, use the word meme and I've got, you know, 13, 15, 18, 12-year-olds.

62
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:04,919
So, meme is something that occurs, you know, on social media.

63
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,900
Those memes are an example of a meme, but that's not what memes are.

64
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,120
Memes have been going on for thousands of years.

65
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,219
Memes are little packages of information that are very good

66
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,860
at getting themselves copied from brain to brain.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,340
And historically, how has that happened?

68
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,340
You're like...

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,020
Yeah.

70
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,139
You know, Beethoven's Fifth.

71
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:25,379
It could be, you know, Mind Your Manners.

72
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,159
It could be Drive on a Certain Side of the...

73
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:31,139
They're just things that become highly replicable.

74
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:35,219
Whereas other things, like Save Money, could be a good idea,

75
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,099
but don't want to hear about that.

76
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,599
You know, so they're not always necessarily good or bad.

77
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:43,379
They're just very good at getting copied.

78
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:46,360
Anyway, sorry, that's a bit detour, but that's the science behind one.

79
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:46,560
Yeah.

80
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,520
So, word of mouth, buy and tell.

81
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,060
I buy something.

82
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:52,879
I become a satisfied customer.

83
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,080
And I tell you at a dinner party or something, you know,

84
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,300
you complain about your, you know, your insurance costs.

85
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,419
Oh, you should talk to my guy.

86
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,060
He doesn't do that, you know, and blah, blah, blah.

87
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,580
And then we'll give me his number and so on.

88
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,099
So, we've all done it.

89
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:06,099
Go and see this movie.

90
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,979
We've all, we're all wombats.

91
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,419
So, but in wombat selling, the goal is not the deal, but it's a wombat.

92
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,839
Because every time you get a wombat, a satisfied customer who replicates

93
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,959
another satisfied customer, and it turns out that if a satisfied customer

94
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:27,759
comes to you because they're replicated by a wombat, they're very likely to do

95
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,800
the same thing if you map it out.

96
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,879
That's how you really multiply your business by 10, other than just some

97
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,620
motivational slogan, you know.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,199
And we can, again, track it all down.

99
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,680
But I ask a customer, how many wombats do you have on your database, you know,

100
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,459
and on your spreadsheet?

101
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,500
Oh, what's a wombat, you know?

102
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,040
In other words, it's not even on the spreadsheet of projections.

103
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,560
To be able to measure.

104
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:56,139
It's just deals, sales, and dollars.

105
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:58,360
So, having some data saying, this is our customer base.

106
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,740
We should know who fall into the wombat category, who are genuinely satisfied

107
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,060
and are a good likelihood to tell other people that we're, yeah.

108
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,319
And that's because we're obviously still servicing them very well, and what can

109
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,100
we do to multiply that by 10?

110
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,779
So, that's where the lateral thinking of just different strategies, different

111
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:18,139
ways of looking at the world, and therefore, different behaviours.

112
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:20,420
You've had extraordinary people in your life.

113
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:23,660
I'm going to get to a handful of questions in a moment that I've been asking all

114
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,259
the inspirational leaders, but you mentioned George Gallup.

115
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,519
I didn't realise he was the academic that oversaw your PhD, but became a great

116
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,019
mentor in life.

117
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,759
Tell us George Gallup story.

118
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:36,399
He was 84 when I met him.

119
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,959
He had the Gallup Pollock Princeton, which he'd formed.

120
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,319
He originally was a professor of psychology, I think, in Midwest,

121
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,199
Northwestern University near Chicago or something.

122
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,100
But his idea.

123
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,980
His idea was he would look at newspapers and he would measure, you know, the ads

124
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,579
in newspapers, and then he found a way of measuring readership, and then he would

125
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,899
start calling people and say, did you see the ad on page six, upper left hand?

126
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,779
And then he would do that research and then sell it to advertising agencies,

127
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:07,319
the early days, in the 1920s.

128
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,399
And then Ericsson, I think it was, McCann Ericsson, jumped on this, that this is

129
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:18,079
really clever, and then that led to the kinds of things that they do in marketing.

130
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:24,420
Research, not all of it's great, but a lot of it's good, where you actually measure the

131
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,839
customer's point of view rather than just what you want to say and, you know, what

132
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:33,120
sort of headline you'll have and copywriting, all of which are important, but a big

133
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,879
emphasis on what the customer is thinking and saying, not just, so Henry Ford, you

134
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,639
can have any color you want as long as it's black.

135
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,680
Well, he was the opposite of that.

136
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,560
What do the customers want, you know, and then, and then coming backwards from that.

137
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,980
And so, you know, people wouldn't even run.

138
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:53,519
For politics today, unless they did polling and tried to find out, it's not always done

139
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,839
well, but I mean, it's done.

140
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,879
He changed the system.

141
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,319
I believe it was his mother-in-law that was running for a, for a seat in local government

142
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,139
or a Senate seat.

143
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:01,800
Ah, yeah.

144
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:02,839
I think, I think you're right.

145
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,259
Yeah.

146
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:08,699
And that they had surveying systems that were millions of people, but he worked out he could.

147
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:09,839
The statistical sample.

148
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,199
Yeah.

149
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:15,639
That if you measure 1200 people, you get the same result, plus or minus a small deviation

150
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,959
if you measure everyone.

151
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,300
Yeah.

152
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,060
Well, you can't measure.

153
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,980
You can't measure everyone, but you can measure a sample.

154
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,680
So this is, you're right, sample polling.

155
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,180
And he had brilliant accuracy at the start.

156
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:23,339
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

157
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:25,079
You can always get it right, but we said.

158
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,800
And he got the, the Gallup poll predicted the result of every presidential election

159
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,699
since, you know, from then to then kind of thing.

160
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:35,360
But again, nothing is perfect.

161
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,160
And was he influential on, on your thinking as a, as a thinking instructor?

162
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,300
Yeah, well, he was the one who said the importance of measuring the CVS.

163
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:43,040
Yeah.

164
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:48,060
You know, so Edward was on about, you know, looking for BVSs, you know, in, in my, in my

165
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,600
terminology, you know, thinking outside the box, looking for, for BVSs in better ways.

166
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:52,879
Yeah.

167
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:57,420
Well, George was, but make sure you understand what the CVS, you know, make sure you, you

168
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,339
know, problem well stated is a problem half solved kind of thing.

169
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:09,420
And a lot of time we, we're confused about our CVS, you know, so he helped me to pay

170
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,660
a lot more attention to the CVS and the value of it.

171
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:17,040
And we do have a CVS and it is valuable because we've spent a lot of time on getting it and

172
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,879
investing in it.

173
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:25,740
So, so, and then, then of course the other part of the switch CVS to BVS is, well, then

174
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,600
what can we find that's 10 times better, but you better watch what you're multiplying by

175
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,840
10, you know, because that could lead you off somewhere where you don't really want

176
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,179
to go.

177
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:39,220
So understanding this and his measurement of trying to understand, he measured more

178
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,600
human thinking than any other individual on the planet.

179
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,220
And that transformed your thinking.

180
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:46,379
You've got to know where you are to get to where you want to get to.

181
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:47,960
If you don't know where you are.

182
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:54,139
But using measurement from a scientific point, not just sort of a vague feeling that

183
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:57,820
I think I know what I'm doing or, or my vague feeling that this is what the customer is

184
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,179
wanting.

185
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,960
So, you know, let me ask them 10 questions to find out exactly, you know.

186
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,100
And for a business, that's an important skill too, to understand.

187
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,740
And even in relationships with kids and with partners, you know, it can help if we understand

188
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,019
where they're thinking, where they, yeah, that's right.

189
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:17,659
That's again, careful what you multiply by 10.

190
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:21,379
The classic one I always say is that the parent, well meaning, of course, and most,

191
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,940
most of the things we do are well meaning.

192
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:31,320
The kid spends two hours on writing an essay or something and comes to mom or dad and there's

193
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,740
a spelling mistake on line three.

194
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,820
Well, there is a spelling mistake on line three.

195
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,379
That's true.

196
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:37,320
That's correct.

197
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,779
But something to me, or the famous story is that the cart, can I think we got time to

198
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:44,019
quickly?

199
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:44,580
Absolutely.

200
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:44,700
Absolutely.

201
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,120
So the cut.

202
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:46,960
Yeah.

203
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,019
It's.

204
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:47,039
It's.

205
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:47,159
It's.

206
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:47,179
It's.

207
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:47,200
It's.

208
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,220
It's.

209
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:47,279
It's.

210
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:47,320
It's.

211
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,379
It's.

212
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:47,399
It's.

213
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:47,419
It's.

214
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:47,519
It's.

215
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,000
It's.

216
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,039
It's.

217
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:52,639
playground and he goes up to this little girl he's got his eye on

218
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,559
and he says, if you can guess what I've got in my hand, I'll take you to the

219
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,559
dance tonight. And she says, oh, it must be hippopotamus. He said, that's

220
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,519
close enough, I'll pick you up at 7 o'clock. So there's logic's

221
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,360
one way of thinking, but there are other types of thinking to get a result that you want

222
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,379
that they don't necessarily deal with right and wrong, you know. That's the best lateral

223
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:16,500
thinking I think I've ever heard. If only I'd known that, my youth might have

224
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,039
been a happier time. Andy, who introduced us, loves that one. He loves that one,

225
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:24,100
absolutely. The great Andrew Sutherland, who's been kind enough to

226
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,740
tee up this meeting today and I'm very appreciative.

227
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:32,200
Part of what we've been doing in the leadership space, Michael, is identifying what we think

228
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,220
great leadership looks like in the current context and we see an

229
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,360
evolution in leadership and some traits and dimensions of great

230
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,360
leaders that are coming through regularly and your story is one of the great

231
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,840
leadership stories that

232
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,539
we've ever heard and so please expand on these dimensions

233
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:54,320
or as little as much as you'd like, but we see all leaders have an understanding

234
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,379
of self-leadership. When I ask you about that term,

235
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,120
does it resonate with you? Oh, very much so. I mean,

236
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,679
the way I hear it, you know,

237
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,159
my way of saying is thinking is the skill or ability

238
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:15,299
to lead yourself. So that's where it starts,

239
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:15,679
doesn't it?

240
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,899
Self-leadership. So from a scientific point of view to do with

241
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:22,960
brains and biology and so on, it comes down to behaviours.

242
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:27,139
So, you know, why do I behave

243
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:31,679
in certain ways? And behaviours that are often triggered by emotions, fear being the big one.

244
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,080
So, how do I,

245
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:40,320
to what extent have I been taught?

246
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,379
Maybe formally, the way I'm saying it, or just by good parents and grandparents

247
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:45,779
or

248
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,059
good little village or whatever that you learn somehow instinctively

249
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:53,779
that the importance of not just always reacting to a

250
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:57,600
stimuli on the first response, although there are occasions

251
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,639
where, you know, rustling the grass in the old days, don't say, I wonder what that is?

252
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:04,360
You know, you've got to be out of there, otherwise you're lunch, you know,

253
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:09,759
to a tiger, but still, life is

254
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,759
not full of those kind of moments. So how do we use our thinking

255
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,360
to, and the big word is,

256
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,759
praise. So this is what I was going to do, and if our

257
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,120
prefrontal contact is well and being trained, it says, but wait a minute.

258
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,879
Is that, you know, what's the customer

259
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:31,340
actually thinking here? Or what's your partner thinking?

260
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,320
Or why did he or she say that?

261
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,059
Oh, okay, and then you can have a second think. It's like, you know, a second opinion with doctors.

262
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,000
A second think, and the second thing very often is more

263
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,460
useful.

264
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,799
it's metacognition you're actually thinking about your thinking and therefore the behavior that

265
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:55,279
comes could be a quite different behavior and that's where self-leadership comes in

266
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:01,759
we think and there are other definitions of leadership but that to the extent that one can

267
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:07,120
help others do that whether they're your family your children or your colleagues or your platoon

268
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:15,159
if you can help them also to be better thinkers to lead themselves better that's also fits into

269
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:19,100
my view of leadership yeah it's a brilliant answer and as i'm listening to your talk

270
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,700
in some ways it feels like what you started in that thinking is is sort of the founding part

271
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,759
of the modern mindfulness movement in lots of ways it's really being mindful is actually

272
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:35,679
really taking in your current you know view of the situation as you call it cvs yes being able

273
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:43,679
to process that pause and react in the way that you feel like you want to um and are you a believer

274
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:44,159
in

275
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:44,879
you

276
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:50,200
the stuff like meditation and oh yes very much so i mean nothing could be more deliberate and

277
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,639
mindful than breathe than than your breathing and improving on your breathing i had pneumonia

278
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:02,679
twice when i was a kid and uh you know quite young and i was even apart from giving shot penicillin

279
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:06,980
shots in the bum uh which i remember but i can remember that when i was eight you know i can

280
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:12,580
remember the doctor giving me breathing said all all the rubbish settles down in the bottom of your

281
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,139
lungs and we only breathe shallow most of the time and i was like oh my god i'm not going to

282
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:15,720
breathe at all i'm not going to breathe at all i'm not going to breathe at all i'm not going to breathe at all

283
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:22,519
you know like this so and that's fine but uh to make sure that's a number of times a day you know

284
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,960
the one method i was taught was three deep breaths where you push your stomach out so you feel your

285
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:33,799
stomach first and then your chest and hold it for four seconds and then let it out do three of those

286
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:40,279
you know as many times a day as you can think of now i've had that for well should i admit 70 70

287
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:44,679
75 years so so very much so and then of course uh

288
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:51,720
the buddhist and other um cultures uh that believe in that and understand

289
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:59,879
meditation and are also mindful we call it metacognition thinking about thinking and it's

290
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:08,120
just a synonym yeah their one is mindfulness which as you say is right now um so so yes uh

291
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:15,159
the alternative to mindfulness is unmindfulness the term alternative to metacognition is not the

292
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:18,519
word mindfulness it's actually the other one is sleep so sleep is usually it's always the intention

293
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,759
of that person and that's what you feel it's almost like i'm just thinking about sleep

294
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,000
have that you're sort of thinking about it you're thinking it's basically reacting so you know and

295
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,240
what do you react to a stimulus so basically you know you're a slave to to uh social media

296
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,039
whoever you're sitting with or anything road rage in the car they do something and if i'm gonna do

297
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:41,320
yeah no you you i you do actually do that but that's when your prefrontal cords come in and say

298
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,299
You know, sometimes if you can actually get it on the first thing, but usually on the

299
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:49,320
second thing, whereas without it, you don't do a second thing.

300
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:51,259
You're into the behavior, the behavior takes off.

301
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:55,919
Or I'm going to eat a little bit better today because, you know what, I'd love to have had

302
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,159
the burger, but I know I'm going to feel a bit better afterwards if I have something

303
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,419
that's maybe a bit more nutritious.

304
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:07,440
It's always an alcohol-free day, you know, which, you know, someone talked about years

305
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,139
ago, just a day, you know, we all like to have a drink and that in our society.

306
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,000
We just say, well, today, you know, I'm not giving up drinking, but I'm having an alcohol-free

307
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,399
day.

308
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,980
And then you can have two if you want, you know.

309
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,320
So that's a nice little one.

310
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,320
That was useful for me.

311
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,039
And my mate's just that, you see, today is a day where I just won't have a drink.

312
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,559
The laid gratification.

313
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:26,860
Yeah.

314
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,799
For the great.

315
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:30,580
And that can almost become a skill, you know, a little pattern.

316
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,279
And then you say, I'll do an AFD today.

317
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,340
But what about lunch?

318
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,039
Oh, well, maybe I'll do the AFD tomorrow.

319
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,580
But anyway.

320
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:39,379
Software update's not perfect all the time, Michael.

321
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,220
It glitches occasionally.

322
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,820
But we see leaders are really conscious of how they positively impact others in their

323
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,299
environment.

324
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,200
I mean, that feels like that's been a huge part of your life.

325
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,980
How can I positively impact, train trainers, improve thinking, improve people's lives?

326
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,759
I mean, were you conscious about that?

327
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,039
Yeah.

328
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,259
Yeah.

329
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,159
Well, because that army experience taught me that.

330
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,160
I also had a classical education at a Catholic boarding school at Rupert's Wood in Sunbury.

331
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,299
And that was, you know, the true for Italian, there were all Italian priests that are

332
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:11,539
coming out.

333
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:18,619
So we got the full, you know, Italian church classical education, you know, Latin and learning

334
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:19,160
vocab.

335
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,019
And you had to learn 10 words of Latin vocab every day in the order that they were on the

336
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:24,180
list.

337
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,640
Apart from anything else, you had to do so.

338
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:29,900
A lot of academic discipline stuff, old fashioned in a way.

339
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:37,220
And in updating the education, some of the things we did throw out some of the good things,

340
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,160
the baby with the bathwater.

341
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,220
Because practice repetition.

342
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:45,420
Practition, rehearsal, are what the military use, for example.

343
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:50,279
And when you're, you know, flying in a two-seater plane and the pilot says,

344
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,940
Tango, Whiskey, Juliet, eject, eject, eject.

345
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,940
If you say, are you sure?

346
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:56,940
It's too late.

347
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:59,420
So certain things, and we don't live life like that.

348
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,759
But in the military, they have to deal with situations.

349
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,579
Ambush left.

350
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:04,339
Who, me?

351
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:06,140
You know, it's all over, you know.

352
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:10,759
So there are things that have, in the military, a very severe bottom line.

353
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:17,039
So in the thousands of years of military science, they've evolved pedagogies that are very,

354
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,680
very useful.

355
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:21,700
And, you know, many of my old mates, when we get together and talk about that, we say,

356
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:24,940
well, you know, Marcus Blackmore was in my class.

357
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:29,359
Well, he took his dad's little, I used to tease him, his voodoo laboratory and built

358
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,839
it into, you know, one of the great brands.

359
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,220
Biggest vitamin business, Blackmore's Vitamins.

360
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,259
Yeah, it's an incredible story.

361
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:37,880
Kenneth and Tim Fisher also went to the same education.

362
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,259
So, so, um, I think that the other thing we haven't missed.

363
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:46,019
I think that the other thing we haven't missed is, you know, the role model, the imitation.

364
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,220
So you can learn from techniques that you're taught by a coach and through practice and

365
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:55,700
so on, but the brain through the mean thing can also, and we've all got our heroes and

366
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:03,259
our, which may be, they may be, uh, you know, fake, I mean, if nonfiction or fiction, but

367
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:07,640
they're still, for whatever reason, our heroes, uh, and in the sporting field, you know, we

368
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,839
all had our, we had our little footy cards when we were young.

369
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:11,279
And, you know.

370
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:17,460
And we all wanted to be footy, you know, if you're short and fat like me, uh, then the

371
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,119
opposite of you.

372
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:20,940
So you, you don't, I was always the last one.

373
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:23,440
I was the youngest in the class and the smallest.

374
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,180
And so the big boys like you, uh, would pick their teams and they, you know, one would

375
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,519
pick one and one would pick the other.

376
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:33,440
And then it would come to me and say, they'd fight over who's getting me.

377
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,440
So we had him last time, you know.

378
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:40,259
I don't think any of those guys went on to find, found the school of thinking, but there

379
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:41,079
were DeBoto, uh.

380
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,440
Uh, Michael said, we've all got our.

381
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,480
We've all got our strengths.

382
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,440
We've all got our strengths.

383
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,920
And, uh, you know, someone, uh, on this podcast said to me, you get some cards, you just have

384
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,240
to play those cards well.

385
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:51,799
Exactly.

386
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:56,200
And you've played your cards as well as you could possibly imagine.

387
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:01,599
We, we see great leaders conscious about how they go about creating and sharing their vision.

388
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,400
The school of thinking is a huge vision.

389
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,400
I mean, how did you systematically go about sharing that vision?

390
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,059
Sort of random.

391
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:11,440
Randomly.

392
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,039
So you have to remember, it was also the days of Studio 54.

393
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:22,559
I was new in New York and I was, uh, so it was, uh, you know, it was learning about life

394
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,680
and enjoying myself and, and, and learning on every level that I could.

395
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:26,359
But, um.

396
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,759
Did you have big ambition for it?

397
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,019
Did you?

398
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:28,480
Yeah, yeah.

399
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:34,259
And I had a kind of, well, the fact is, so, uh, I said, we've got to do something.

400
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,099
We've got to have something.

401
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,019
I can't just be wandering around trying to sell.

402
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:39,799
I was originally trying to sell Edward, the city corp on that.

403
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:40,599
And then when I'll get it.

404
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,039
It's a.

405
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,539
They'd say, well, well, where is he then?

406
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,059
Well, he's at Cambridge.

407
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,259
Well, Americans want it now.

408
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:46,519
They don't want some guy.

409
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,059
So I, that wasn't the model.

410
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,759
So I said, Edward.

411
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,980
So I presented him an idea for a school at JFK once on a visit.

412
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,720
The 70th of November, 1979.

413
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,299
And I said, what we need is a school.

414
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,680
So I got a point.

415
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,900
You never forget that day.

416
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,380
No, no, no.

417
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,599
I was there and he said, yes.

418
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:02,740
On the spot.

419
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:02,920
Yeah.

420
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,819
That was when I did the idea of the train, the train.

421
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,079
Yeah.

422
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,359
I'll do what I know.

423
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:06,839
Yeah.

424
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,259
Now.

425
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:08,339
We'll go into business together.

426
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:08,859
Going together.

427
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,619
This is a school.

428
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,839
If you want to do it, we'll do it together.

429
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,460
As a business.

430
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:11,880
Yeah.

431
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,880
I suggested 50-50.

432
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,019
He suggested 60-40.

433
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,960
Fair enough, you know.

434
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,380
So that was okay.

435
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,779
No, but it was good and I knew I could do that.

436
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,279
I put the first ad in the New York Times.

437
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:28,200
I thought teachers would be, you know, logically.

438
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,759
So I put an ad in the New York Times Education Supplement,

439
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:33,839
part-time thinking instructors.

440
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:37,839
And when the ad came out, it was part-time thinking instructors.

441
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:40,180
And then a little copy that.

442
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:40,819
No.

443
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,339
No one knew about De Bono or anything.

444
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,339
And then I'd put the wrong phone number in.

445
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:46,619
I, you know, it was a little bit too much Studio 54.

446
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:51,700
Anyway, this poor lady in Harlem kept getting all these calls about wanting,

447
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,339
people wanting to be part-time thinking.

448
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,119
She gave them a piece of her mind.

449
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,160
So, false start.

450
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,799
So, so De Bono wasn't a household name at that stage.

451
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,940
No, no one had heard of him.

452
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:00,400
Yeah.

453
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,680
And, uh, he, he, he was, no, there wasn't, he was getting well known here

454
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,259
because he'd done regular trips to Australia, was starting to.

455
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:09,839
What brought, what brought him to Australia?

456
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:10,839
He studied at RMI.

457
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:12,079
I tell you, didn't he, here in Australia?

458
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:15,740
No, no, he, you know, he, he, he was given an honorary PhD from RMI.

459
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:15,940
Yeah.

460
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,740
But he did his, he's from Malta.

461
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,980
So he got his, he was very young doctor of meds.

462
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,279
Not all his family are doctors.

463
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,859
Uh, very young.

464
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:27,440
His father was a famous Malta doctor.

465
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,619
Um, and then won a road, road scholarship to Oxford and did psychology at Oxford.

466
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,299
And then when I met him, he was the professor of investigative meds at Cambridge.

467
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:40,539
Since then, he's been given various honorary doctorates around the world, including RMI.

468
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:51,160
But, um, so, so, but what I said was, let's do a book together because then I've got something I can sell, you know, a book.

469
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,180
And then I obviously put courses together.

470
00:22:53,420 --> 00:23:03,900
So we did the learn to think course book and instructor's manual, which we co, uh, authored in, in, uh, 19 sort of 82.

471
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:10,500
And that had the lessons in there and how to teach them, you know, so I had the lessons and if you're an instructor, you just.

472
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:12,160
I bought the book and you could teach from the book.

473
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,420
And that was the multiplier.

474
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:20,980
Then, then, um, uh, he always said, oh, I'd love to get something in the reader's digest because that is the biggest magazine in the world.

475
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,559
So I was like a little, you know, robot bunny, you know, the bunny rabbit just pressed the button.

476
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,039
I said, okay.

477
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:34,839
So I went up and I did manage to get a, an interview, uh, about the book in the reader's digest.

478
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:37,839
And it turned out to be the cover story in all international editions.

479
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,619
And which had massive coverage, didn't it?

480
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:40,380
Read his digest.

481
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,579
That would be like being on Oprah.

482
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah.

483
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,119
You know, it was before the internet on it, 68 million readers.

484
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,299
So, and we had seven lessons in there, you know, so.

485
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,160
And that, and that put the school of thinking on the map.

486
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,339
That, that puts, well, then what, from that comes like hundreds of these.

487
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:54,880
Yeah.

488
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,460
Radio interviews all around America.

489
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:03,660
Cause it's all, everyone copies what's in the reader's digest, the New York times, all cascading across that America we described before.

490
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:04,019
Yeah.

491
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:09,759
So I was doing talk show, like, you know, suddenly from nothing or, you know, a dribble of things we were trying to create.

492
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:09,779
Yeah.

493
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:10,279
And then we hit.

494
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:10,380
Yeah.

495
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,460
And then your vision changes.

496
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,299
I mean, you're sharing it then.

497
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:20,380
But in the course book, I said, let's train 300,000 thinking instructors in America, which is a number I just made up.

498
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:20,759
Yeah.

499
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,480
I mean, that's the long answer to your question.

500
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,819
So Edward said, well, where'd you get that number from?

501
00:24:24,819 --> 00:24:25,980
I said, well, you know, why not?

502
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:27,700
You know.

503
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,440
Six million instructors later.

504
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,799
Now there's 6 million in the world.

505
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,460
We haven't trained them all, but it's cascaded down to 6 million.

506
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,940
So it's a, it's a brilliant story.

507
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,839
It was a vision.

508
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,259
Yeah.

509
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:40,119
But how to do it, it was a little less.

510
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:43,299
It's brilliant to hear the back story of it.

511
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:48,799
I like, we, we see curiosity as a common trait for, for this, uh, modern leaders.

512
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,940
And, and I suspect, uh, that's going to be a huge part of, of you.

513
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:57,079
And then through curiosity, leaders really thinking about how they change and learn and, and develop.

514
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,779
It was, was curiosity a big part of your.

515
00:24:58,779 --> 00:24:59,119
Yeah.

516
00:24:59,119 --> 00:24:59,440
Yeah.

517
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:07,480
I'm always got into trouble for being curious, even in the military, you know, but, um, but, but, uh, that's okay.

518
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,880
Cause sometimes it's perhaps inappropriate, but other times.

519
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,019
Yeah.

520
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:14,099
But it turned out to bone to explain why it's actually very, very important in the brain.

521
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,019
Humor is the other big thing.

522
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:22,079
Um, if, if, if computers ever start laughing, that's going to be a very sinister day indeed.

523
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:27,119
Cause it's one quality of the human brain that indicates that random patterns are connecting.

524
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,759
If it's temporary, then it's just a joke.

525
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,680
But if it's permanent, it's an insight.

526
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,400
Yeah.

527
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,960
And I, I can't do that.

528
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,460
Yeah.

529
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,960
Uh, not, not, we can program, we can program it.

530
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:45,539
We have to do it and it even can take off in self-programming that may, that's kind of changing.

531
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:53,200
And by 2030, there probably will be two distinct types of thinking, silicon and carbon.

532
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:56,400
So it is, as we all know, rapidly changing.

533
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,299
Does that alarm you?

534
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:05,779
Well, it does both, you know, it alarms me and, uh, you know, piques my curiosity, but, uh, but I won't be here.

535
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:10,000
So that's an awful thing to say, but, uh, because, uh, but it is.

536
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:14,339
I mean, it's, it's something we have to, the opportunity is unbelievable.

537
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,099
In artificial intelligence, but the threat's also there.

538
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:23,339
But we have to really be on the ball and know what we're doing because the potential consequences are there as well.

539
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:32,259
I think there's a quote from Elon Musk that's coming to me that, uh, he's clearly an interesting thinker, Elon Musk, however you view his, his view of the world, but he's.

540
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:33,140
He's a visionary.

541
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:39,299
He, at one point said, if we don't have a way back into artificial intelligence, a human way back in.

542
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:39,339
Yes.

543
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:39,380
Yeah.

544
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:39,420
Yeah.

545
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:39,460
Yeah.

546
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:39,500
Yeah.

547
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:39,779
Yeah.

548
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:39,799
Yeah.

549
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:42,759
Humans are a chance to end up like a domesticated cat, effectively.

550
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:46,279
Well, we are going to evolve into the future together.

551
00:26:47,180 --> 00:27:02,500
How, how that unfolds could be anything from us being domesticated to something far more favorable, you know, uh, uh, some sort of cooperative thing that worked well as it, in a sense, has to a large extent so far.

552
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:07,000
But, uh, uh, the biggest thing that worries me on the planet right now is social media.

553
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,819
I mean, if you're, you didn't ask me, so I'm just poking.

554
00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:10,099
I mean, if you're, you didn't ask me, so I'm just poking.

555
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:13,799
Which is great, because it's, uh, it's, it's the addictive nature of it.

556
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:19,559
I mean, it's up there with heroin and, uh, you know, you get, and we don't understand it.

557
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,720
Unfortunately, it's happening faster than our ability to understand it.

558
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:31,500
So you do get people who pick up their kids from school because they're worried about stranger danger.

559
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,660
And then the kids will be sitting back and say, here's your mobile phone.

560
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,720
And, uh, and, uh, and we're becoming more and more aware and even challenging.

561
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:43,460
We're challenging tech companies now to do something about it, but we can already see.

562
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,160
As, as a parent, Michael, it's the number one.

563
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,380
Yeah.

564
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:46,880
Is it?

565
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,160
Yeah.

566
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,380
By far and away, because it's the genie's out of the bottle.

567
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,160
That's where all the communication channels exist.

568
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,299
There's part of it that is, that is genius, that I admire.

569
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:56,960
Their ability to.

570
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,700
It's, it's so useful.

571
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:59,420
I mean, you can't just throw it away.

572
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,180
I'll try and explain it.

573
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:04,000
As a kid, I used to, growing up in, in South Australia, and you'd try and meet someone

574
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,980
in the, in the city, in the mall, and two out of three times, you'd miss each other

575
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,799
because you might've been standing on the side.

576
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:12,079
But you'd go home because.

577
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,660
Yeah, yeah.

578
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,440
You know, it's so.

579
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:19,500
So there's just so many, for all, it's a total mixture of pluses and minuses.

580
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,380
The minus side, can I share this with you?

581
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,539
Because I find this, and I have told this story before, but, you know, through lockdown

582
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:27,859
in Melbourne, we lived in the most lockdown city in the world.

583
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:34,259
And there was an extraordinary amount of teenage girls by the end of it presenting with eating

584
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:34,779
disorders.

585
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:39,400
And the link back to not being able to connect, not being able to connect, sitting at home

586
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:39,779
and looking.

587
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:42,680
And looking at these unrealistic images of what body image looks like.

588
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,779
There was, you know, I'll get the number wrong and I shouldn't have it, but something

589
00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:50,859
like 700 a week teenage girls in the city of Melbourne being diagnosed.

590
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,039
The, the, the social media.

591
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:53,619
Yeah.

592
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,799
The complexity for young people is, it's alarming.

593
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:00,559
The problem is with any, it's, it's an addiction.

594
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,779
And the problem with it, it's two problems with addiction, but the problem with anything

595
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:08,200
like, you know, a Kit Kat or a cigarette, there's nothing wrong with a cigarette.

596
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,339
Or a Kit Kat.

597
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,099
But if you have 10 Kit Kats a day, that is a very, very serious problem.

598
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:18,740
If you have 10 cigarettes a day, so it's the dosage.

599
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,619
People say, oh, you know, it's, it's, it's, and the dosage, the problem with the dosage

600
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:24,420
is some things can be, are addictive.

601
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:30,960
So, an easy, a basic definition of addiction is, I can't say no.

602
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,140
It doesn't matter what it is, whether it's sex or sugar or, you know, coffee or drugs

603
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,180
or whatever.

604
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,259
It doesn't matter what it is, whether it's sex or religion or any of the things to do

605
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:46,420
with, again, we're getting back into the, into the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex.

606
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:53,440
But, um, uh, the basic thing is if you, if you cannot say no, then it's really addiction.

607
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:55,160
And this is something.

608
00:29:55,339 --> 00:29:55,740
Unbelievable.

609
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,700
Right on up there with heroin in terms of the ability to say no.

610
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,980
It's interesting you make that comparison.

611
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,220
And you understand that much more than me because you've got kids.

612
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:03,819
And you know the problem.

613
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:04,720
I've just got my partner.

614
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,140
Yeah.

615
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,400
But I, I find the problem.

616
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,140
I've got to be totally transparent.

617
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,619
I'm yelling at the kids to get off social media as I'm on my phone.

618
00:30:11,619 --> 00:30:12,759
Yeah, I know, of course, exactly.

619
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:18,099
And it has, and I, you, you can lose, and I'm very, very late to the market in social media.

620
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:22,299
In fact, people who know me know that I have no understanding at all, but, but, but I find

621
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:26,380
myself reading news articles and half an hour's gone and you go, what happened just then?

622
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:38,140
Cause it's, it's, it's intelligent behavior to use this, but you know, there's many ways of using, I, I, you know, when I'm had a couple of years.

623
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,779
I've you know, I'm on a roll here with four glasses of red wine and I'm on a roll.

624
00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:51,279
I, I say, uh, partly emotional might say it's like kloaca, maxima, the great sewer of Hen, you know, it's like a sewer in the sewer.

625
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,480
There are diamonds.

626
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,000
Unbelievably precious diamond, but you got to wade through a lot of What a shit to get there.

627
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,279
Well, you said it.

628
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,960
So, so that's, you know, it's a very serious problem.

629
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,200
I think we're now understanding that it is.

630
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,920
And we're starting to the government's and very similar.

631
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:12,160
people. But I don't envy, you know, parents because

632
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,920
I mean, you know, I'm having enough trouble

633
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,980
using leadership on myself with this. It's much more difficult with kids

634
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,940
who don't yet have a prefrontal cortex. Yeah. So there's no

635
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,480
possible way they can really understand what we're trying to tell them,

636
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,180
you know, and all their mates have got it. I mean,

637
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:36,200
I would call it a wicked problem, which is a problem which in a sense

638
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,299
doesn't yet have a solution. Yeah. No, it's a very

639
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:43,960
important point that you make. A couple more dimensions that we've been talking about,

640
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:47,920
communicating with clarity and your books are, and I'm going to come back to

641
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,680
the fourth brain. It feels like you've captured really

642
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,799
a version of where thinking is going in 2022 that we talk about.

643
00:31:56,119 --> 00:32:00,019
It's a good segue from social media and kids really having a shorter, and adults too.

644
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,420
So your communication's brilliant

645
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,839
and clearly your writing and the way that you've been able to expand

646
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:10,779
the school of things. How did you go about that communication?

647
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:14,579
That book there. All of it, yeah, just in all of you.

648
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,720
Well, that's a really good question. I don't really, I don't think I've been asked

649
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,660
that before, but it's one I really

650
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:27,400
like to be asked because it's one of my things that I think I'm good at.

651
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:31,640
So it's about communication and there are levels of communication

652
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,400
aren't there? So for example,

653
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,420
I was raised a Catholic, okay, and had

654
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:41,519
great education, the fall, everything, and the liturgy as it

655
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,880
was then in those days with fabulous vestments and

656
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,480
I was the kid on the smoke thing, you know, and I got the job of doing a smoke ring

657
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,500
once when I thought the priests weren't watching. But you know, all of that

658
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,700
and the wonderful history and

659
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:01,539
culture of the church and so on. Well, it's good because not everyone

660
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:03,039
had a great experience. No, no, no.

661
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,299
I had some experiences that weren't great. Yeah, yeah.

662
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:11,200
But overall, this will be another soapbox I could get in, but overall,

663
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:14,779
well, you can pay, well, you can focus on

664
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:18,920
well, you know, the child abuse thing in the church. There's no doubt about that

665
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,180
that is terrible. Horrific. But already now they're far more advanced

666
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,680
than probably any other country in the world in dealing with it.

667
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,299
That's not focused on and looked at, and so there are other issues. But that's

668
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:32,220
not the point I want to make.

669
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:38,519
Then as I grew up and then I became a scientist and so on, I became agnostic. I couldn't really

670
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:43,740
believe what I taught anymore. But I was trying to hold on with, you know, one foot in the

671
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,200
thing. And then it came to a point where, well, I mean, I'm sorry. I mean, what I've

672
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,440
now learned in science, I have no choice to be an atheist. I can't believe in the version

673
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:59,339
that I was taught. And then I went further and I find myself becoming an agnostic. And

674
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:03,400
now I'm sort of, you know, vacillating between I believe. But the thing is, I'm an agnostic.

675
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,900
I'm an atheist as far as what I was taught when I was young. But the man with the long

676
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:13,019
beard and all that. Yeah. Santa Claus. I mean, that was nice for a prefrontal cortex, pre-pre.

677
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,960
Yeah. You know, but I could never go and believe

678
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:26,539
that anymore. Extraordinary, but a bit the same when you're

679
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:28,099
forced to go into the church environment. It's a mixed bag.

680
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:32,760
And you look back and you go, that, you know, that doesn't add up. But there's part of me

681
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,800
that is in this universal energy understanding of the way that the world organizes itself

682
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,579
and that there is a greater force. Yeah.

683
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,219
If you're curious, there are other ways to explain that.

684
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:47,000
So I had a wonderful meeting once. I was a fan of the Dalai Lamas because I'd read some

685
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,340
of those Lobsang Rama books when I was young. And then I had a chance in New York on his

686
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:57,760
very first trip to America to meet him. A friend of mine was a friend of his. And I

687
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,860
really wanted to have a meeting with the Dalai. So I arranged through CBS for a friend for

688
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:09,039
them to do a documentary on him. And in exchange, I had a long meeting with him.

689
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:09,900
What was that like?

690
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,340
What was that like? They tell me incredible presence being around.

691
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:19,860
I couldn't speak when he, I mean, as you can tell, I'm not someone who has trouble speaking.

692
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:25,440
But when he came into the room and he just, the presence came in and he was in the other

693
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,519
room giving an audience to the governor of New York. And then he came in, there was a

694
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:36,380
chair, his sort of throne type of chair was there. And then mine was here. And then I

695
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,880
had a tape recorder set up and I had a photographer with me. And he came in and I was like, I'm

696
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,440
going to do this. And he came in, big smile, took my hand and then went over, looked at

697
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,340
the chair and then moved mine away. Physically himself, got another one like his and put

698
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:55,159
it next to it. And being cynical, I looked at the, you know, the, all the Tibetans in

699
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:59,019
the room and the ambassadors and that thought, oh, this must be his little stunt that he

700
00:35:59,019 --> 00:36:03,380
does. And you could see by the look on their face that it was a completely spontaneous

701
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:08,500
thing for whatever reason, you know, that he just did. And they were like, this is not

702
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,639
his routine that he does.

703
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,000
Yeah.

704
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,539
It was tremendous. You know, the things we talked about, I asked him to design a new

705
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:13,940
religion.

706
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,300
That would have been interesting. Yeah. That's probably a separate.

707
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,719
He said no at first, but then.

708
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:23,940
I'm fascinated by that. When you're in the presence of someone with great presence, that

709
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:29,079
energy, you know, is such a unique thing. And it's, you know, I'm sure that would have

710
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:35,039
been the experience. We're talking final, so many great stories to keep going, but collaboration,

711
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,780
we see leaders are really passionate now about how they collaborate. Your life is,

712
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:45,400
has been full of great collaborations from Edward de Bono to, to, to George Gallop. I

713
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,619
mean, you've extraordinary life of collaboration is, is, is that how you've.

714
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:54,139
Yeah. And continues. I mean, the, the project that I told you, well, that, that had Andrew

715
00:36:54,139 --> 00:36:58,000
Sutherland who met us. I mean, that's the, you know, it's a collaborative thing we're

716
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,239
doing.

717
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:58,500
Yeah.

718
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:03,380
You know, I couldn't do it without them and the way that they're applying it. I think

719
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:08,659
you really, you know, you can really say you're in the leadership zone when you're collaborating.

720
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:09,360
Yeah.

721
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:09,659
Yeah.

722
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:09,699
Yeah.

723
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:09,800
Yeah.

724
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:09,860
Yeah.

725
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:09,880
Yeah.

726
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:16,480
In an active way with someone with, you know, I don't know, did you know the, one of my

727
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,219
favorite models over these is the transactional analysis model that was developed by, there

728
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:27,539
was a book around in my day called I'm okay, you're okay. It was a big bestseller, but

729
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:31,639
there were the, there's the three circles, parent, adult, child, and you put two of them

730
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:36,460
together, parent, adult, child. So you can do the metrics of the relationships. So parent,

731
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,539
parent is good. Child.

732
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:46,659
Oh, no. Yeah. Yeah. Adult, adult is good. Child, child is good. But parent, child has

733
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:51,699
problems. Nothing to do with the fact that parents and children don't have, but just

734
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:52,739
as a psychological.

735
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:53,860
Exchange.

736
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:57,619
Exchange, you know, there's a power thing, you know, do this because I'm saying so, that

737
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:02,219
sort of thing. So that there are other ways to communicate other than, you know, when

738
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:05,960
I want your opinion, I'll give it to you. You know, that's a joke, you know, but, but

739
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,699
obviously adult, adult's good. And when we're having a bit of fun, child, child, child, child,

740
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:10,420
you know.

741
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:10,760
Yeah.

742
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:16,019
Um, so, so just different ways to communicate. And I think if you're in that collaborative

743
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:20,300
zone, rather than someone just telling you what to do, you're in the leadership zone

744
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,679
no matter what the ranks are.

745
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,239
Yeah.

746
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:27,519
That's fascinating. You know, I love talking parenting, um, you know, given my house is,

747
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:30,840
is full of it. But that is interesting why, because it's the great sort of conundrum is

748
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:36,119
that the parent adult, parent, uh, child relation naturally has got that hierarchy.

749
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:36,460
Yeah.

750
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:37,559
It comes with challenges.

751
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:37,900
Yeah.

752
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,659
One of the things that's been great advice.

753
00:38:39,699 --> 00:38:42,099
is you're having the outside mentors for your kids

754
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:44,920
who naturally they want to gravitate to

755
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,940
because there is that barrier.

756
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,380
And when you can accept that as a parent,

757
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,739
there's so much genius in burnout.

758
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,139
Just sit back and hopefully have other people surround you.

759
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:54,079
Well, in the old days we had a village.

760
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:55,960
They used to say the village raises the child.

761
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:56,400
We don't know.

762
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:00,619
And it's not that the kids shouldn't be exposed to parents.

763
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:03,019
I mean, they've got to grow up and survive in a world of humans.

764
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:03,460
Yeah.

765
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,400
And there are occasions when they'll be authoritative

766
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,380
or even authoritarian.

767
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,480
In some parts of the world.

768
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,179
And so, you know, if they've had a bit of that in the family,

769
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,280
that doesn't hurt them.

770
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,619
But you wouldn't want only that or too much of it, you know.

771
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:16,900
Yeah.

772
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,099
So kids should be exposed to a range of things that they can adapt to

773
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:23,860
and be skilled at.

774
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,219
Otherwise, their survival is inhibited, you know.

775
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:36,079
But we all know what an authoritarian household is like,

776
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,360
you know, whether we've had it or whether we've seen it somewhere.

777
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,539
So, and that's, you know, we can do better than that, you know.

778
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:43,659
Yeah, not a lot of joy.

779
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,039
But there are moments, of course, when rank is important.

780
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,119
We occasionally need it.

781
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,300
Occasionally.

782
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,219
It still happens in my house from time to time.

783
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,480
I put my hand up, pull rank occasionally.

784
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,139
Two final questions.

785
00:39:55,639 --> 00:40:00,260
And I've loved catching up with you and learnt an enormous amount from it.

786
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,159
We've been asking this of all the great leaders we've been around.

787
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:04,619
Who has been the greatest leader in your life?

788
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:06,989
Well.

789
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:09,389
Yeah.

790
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:09,409
Yeah.

791
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:09,429
Yeah.

792
00:40:09,429 --> 00:40:09,449
Yeah.

793
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:09,469
Yeah.

794
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:09,489
Yeah.

795
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:09,510
Yeah.

796
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:09,530
Yeah.

797
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:09,550
Yeah.

798
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:09,590
Yeah.

799
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:09,690
Yeah.

800
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:09,710
Yeah.

801
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:09,789
Yeah.

802
00:40:09,789 --> 00:40:09,829
Yeah.

803
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:09,849
Yeah.

804
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:09,869
Yeah.

805
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:09,889
Yeah.

806
00:40:09,889 --> 00:40:09,929
Yeah.

807
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:09,969
Yeah.

808
00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:10,070
Yeah.

809
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:10,110
Yeah.

810
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:10,130
Yeah.

811
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:14,269
It's like when someone says what's your favorite song or movie, you know, you've got several

812
00:40:14,269 --> 00:40:16,329
that could, I mean, easily my dad.

813
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:19,369
I mean, that's, that's easy, you know, in a sense.

814
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,090
Can you tell me about him quickly before?

815
00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:21,409
Yeah.

816
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:21,750
Yeah.

817
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:26,150
He, uh, he, uh, you know, he, he went to St.

818
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:28,670
Kevin's and went on scholarship there as a St.

819
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,170
Kilda boy, you know, grew up in St.

820
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:35,949
Kilda, put his age up and went to the war for six, six years in the Middle East, New

821
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:39,429
Guinea, came back redhead or sandy coloured hair.

822
00:40:39,429 --> 00:40:44,889
and told me, you know, and then I was born right after then

823
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:46,949
and when I was, one of my earliest memories,

824
00:40:47,409 --> 00:40:51,150
one of his famous sayings, son, if things aren't working out,

825
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,389
go to the beach.

826
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,809
Like that was, that pretty much sums up.

827
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:59,489
He was well-read, one of the most well-read people I've ever met,

828
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:01,389
highly intelligent, wicked sense of humour.

829
00:41:02,389 --> 00:41:05,750
I often say we weren't so much raised up as we were teased up, you know,

830
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,190
cheated at Monopoly, did everything, you know.

831
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:13,369
But we were always laughing, you know, his sense of humour was always,

832
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,949
you know, there were different moments when he had to be dead,

833
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,869
but, and empowering, you know.

834
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,050
He was not an ambitious man himself.

835
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,929
He had a great life, he was fine, but he never brought work home.

836
00:41:25,929 --> 00:41:28,809
You know, we went to the beach every weekend and, you know,

837
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:32,590
but he, anything I ever wanted to do, I was a bit different, you know,

838
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:37,170
I had things I wanted to do and I needed to buy things

839
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,070
that he thought were silly.

840
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,849
Like motivational tapes from America when I was starting out.

841
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,150
Some of them were no good.

842
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:45,809
So he was right, but I didn't know that and I needed them

843
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:46,929
and he paid for them, you know.

844
00:41:47,429 --> 00:41:47,670
Yeah.

845
00:41:47,989 --> 00:41:51,949
You know, like if, well, you know, oh, you're going to play this bullshit,

846
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:55,750
you know, but you need them here and, you know, they were not cheap,

847
00:41:55,829 --> 00:41:57,690
you know, it was like 500 bucks, it was a lot of money then.

848
00:41:57,869 --> 00:41:58,050
Yeah.

849
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:01,289
And so that was dad, you know, whatever you're doing, he backed you

850
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:05,289
and right up and older, I would always go and discuss everything with him,

851
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:05,989
you know, and.

852
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:08,070
It's a gift, Michael, isn't it?

853
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,090
The people that answer that they're a parent.

854
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:10,550
I was lucky.

855
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:13,570
They go there straight away and they feel that I feel exactly the same way.

856
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:13,670
Oh, that's good.

857
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:16,889
And lost my father in recent times as well,

858
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:20,849
but had a very similar relationship to that, you know.

859
00:42:20,889 --> 00:42:24,329
Can I ask you a return question because I really admire the work

860
00:42:24,329 --> 00:42:26,769
that you've been doing and that you are now doing.

861
00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:28,530
I mean, you're current and you're doing this.

862
00:42:29,969 --> 00:42:32,110
What's one of your favourite things to say?

863
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,389
Like, I mean, vaguely in answer to the question,

864
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:37,449
if you could teach a 10-year-old one thing about leadership.

865
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,110
But you don't have to answer that question.

866
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,409
But one of your, if you could just get one message across something

867
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:44,949
you've really learned as being.

868
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:47,710
Well, it's a great comment.

869
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:50,449
It's a lot easier asking the questions, Michael, than answering them.

870
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:57,070
But I think the idea that being able to self-reflect, being self-aware,

871
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,809
you don't have to get things right all the time.

872
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:03,329
But I think there is a common trait of people who I think live a lot more

873
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:06,710
full lives, that they are reflective and want to get better.

874
00:43:06,949 --> 00:43:07,110
Mm-hmm.

875
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:07,150
Yeah.

876
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:07,170
Yeah.

877
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:07,190
Yeah.

878
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:07,250
Yeah.

879
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:07,269
Yeah.

880
00:43:07,269 --> 00:43:07,289
Yeah.

881
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:07,309
Yeah.

882
00:43:07,309 --> 00:43:07,329
Yeah.

883
00:43:07,329 --> 00:43:07,389
Yeah.

884
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:07,409
Yeah.

885
00:43:07,409 --> 00:43:07,429
Yeah.

886
00:43:07,429 --> 00:43:07,489
Yeah.

887
00:43:07,489 --> 00:43:07,510
Yeah.

888
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:07,530
Yeah.

889
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:07,550
Yeah.

890
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:07,570
Yeah.

891
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:07,590
Yeah.

892
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:07,610
Yeah.

893
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:07,650
Yeah.

894
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:07,670
Yeah.

895
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:14,510
Mm-hm.

896
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:19,429
Yeah.

897
00:43:19,429 --> 00:43:19,449
Yeah.

898
00:43:19,449 --> 00:43:19,650
Yeah.

899
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:19,869
Yeah.

900
00:43:23,929 --> 00:43:24,289
Yeah.

901
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:25,469
Yeah.

902
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,250
Yeah.

903
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:36,989
And so that's the sort of community I'm passionate about creating,

904
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:37,289
really.

905
00:43:37,329 --> 00:43:37,650
Yeah.

906
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:41,750
connecting with is that idea of your life experience so different

907
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:45,849
from mine, but there's a hundred things in preparation

908
00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:49,730
for this that I'm reflecting on and what we want to create in the

909
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:53,429
leadership space and the people I want to connect with, that constant idea to learn would be what

910
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:57,690
I would hope to pass on. And learning a lot from people, I can see that

911
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:00,789
in you. It's that constant curiosity and learning.

912
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:05,510
And you're doing it. I mean, of course, having the media

913
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:09,670
is a terrific thing. I mean, the media is great, especially if you've got

914
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:13,650
something interesting to say, whereas not always is that the case. So what

915
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:17,510
you're doing, I mean. And I've worked in mainstream media where you don't get that, which is why

916
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:21,670
you're not all the time. You're sort of soundbite media. You're not really able

917
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:25,650
to, which is the beauty of where I think media is going, which is this format to sit down

918
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:29,670
with someone. Hopefully we're capturing unbelievable life stories

919
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:33,710
like yours and there's going to be life lessons out of it. The world of collaboration

920
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:37,650
is sort of part of what we're passionate about in the business I'm working

921
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:41,530
with my great friend, Matt Waterwitz in Alita. And we see

922
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:45,690
great collaboration and yours is so obvious. But if you look back now

923
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:49,510
and if you collaborate with anyone else, has there been anyone else in the world you could collaborate

924
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:53,030
with right now on any passion of your life? Is there a name that springs to mind?

925
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:57,250
Well, that's great. That's like getting a blank check.

926
00:44:59,210 --> 00:44:59,949
There is

927
00:44:59,949 --> 00:45:05,019
someone.

928
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,500
Whether I can remember or not.

929
00:45:09,699 --> 00:45:13,480
Well, it's not, there's someone else but I can't

930
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,179
remember. But for example, I'll say Prince Charles. Now

931
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:20,719
a couple of reasons. Prince Charles obviously is

932
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:25,320
in his own version, but one of these. You know, they used to joke that he talked

933
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,059
to the flowers and all that. But actually when you look into what he does

934
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:33,559
he's very, he's curious, he's interested in different points of view. He's got an open mind.

935
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,320
And having been

936
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,300
Prince of Wales so long, he can have an opinion, which you won't be able to have

937
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,980
so easily when he becomes king. You'll see he'll change completely.

938
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,300
They're frightened that as a king he'll be, you know, he'll have his finger

939
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:51,400
in every pie. He won't. He knows the job. So as his father pointed

940
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,320
out, being Prince of Wales for so long, he's been able to, you know, build special

941
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,380
towns and have the Prince Charles trust and do all the various

942
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:03,139
things he does. So I've seen a lot of the work he does

943
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:05,219
and you just see, you know,

944
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:09,320
relate to a lot of it, not all of it, but a lot of it. But of course he's going to be the next

945
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,340
King of England. So somehow, you know, you are able to say

946
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:17,280
co-author a book or something. Apart from that, that would be a very interesting

947
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,820
thing to do. There's always the practical outcome. I mean,

948
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:25,139
that would draw a lot of attention to thinking

949
00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:29,300
if one could do a book on, you know, lateral thinking with

950
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:33,659
Prince HRH, you know. HRH lateral thinking. I mean, he gets a bad run.

951
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:35,300
Yeah. Doesn't he? Really? He does.

952
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:39,360
No. Well, he gets a run in a way like the church does

953
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,360
that is less than what it really is, you know. So your understanding

954
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:47,199
is he's a good thinker. Well, you can focus on the quirky things,

955
00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:51,000
but if that's all you focus on, then it's a bad run.

956
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,780
There's a lot of value there.

957
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:59,500
Well, in a Darwinian sense,

958
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:05,320
the Vatican, for example, I wanted to do a Netflix series on the Vatican.

959
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,519
And I've kind of written it up, you know. But

960
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:13,360
it's a human organization. It's the only one that's actually survived for

961
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:17,039
2,000 years. Now, whether Google will survive for 2,000 years

962
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:21,300
or Musk, what's his

963
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,980
company? Tesla. Tesla, yeah. Or Amazon. It's another matter.

964
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:29,079
It's no easy thing to do. And then the crown, of course. Well, number two

965
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:33,079
is the crown. 1,000 years. So it's like Coke and Pepsi.

966
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:33,460
Yeah.

967
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:41,059
If you're a scientist and a Darwinian thinker, you realize the enormous

968
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:44,900
value that must be there for that to happen. And so

969
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,019
if one starts to dig into that value, there's a lot there, regardless of

970
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:52,820
what, you know. Quirky things happen. The coverage is,

971
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,820
you know, and you're going to find terrible mistakes.

972
00:47:57,699 --> 00:48:00,840
And you're going to find what there is to find, which is the highs

973
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,699
and lows. But you just don't, in any species,

974
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,900
get to survive in a Darwinian sense for thousands

975
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:12,940
of years unless there's enormous survival value there. And what is

976
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:17,000
that? And that's what I'm curious about. Well, that's a fascinating answer, isn't it?

977
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,639
Because, you know, your mind doesn't think of it in that way, that the Vatican is the oldest

978
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:24,000
living organization followed by the royal family.

979
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:29,179
And so they must do more than, you know, ride around on horses and, you know.

980
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,539
So, and of course, I mean, you know,

981
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:35,260
I'm not religious at the present.

982
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,699
Okay, so this is not me trying to promote religion, but

983
00:48:38,699 --> 00:48:42,099
the Vatican has 230,000 schools.

984
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,900
Who's got that? Who's got 230,000 schools?

985
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:51,320
Imagine the teachers, the parents, the students. It has 5,000

986
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,960
hospitals. Who's got 5,000 hospitals? America?

987
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,139
Russia? It's got 10,000 old age times.

988
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:03,179
So just forget all of the dogma and all of that

989
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:05,320
and, you know, the fancy hats and so on.

990
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:09,320
Who's actually doing that? Not to mention the gratuitous

991
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,159
libraries and art and music and artifacts

992
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:17,059
that have been spread around the world by missionaries, today you'd call them

993
00:49:17,059 --> 00:49:21,400
influencers, for 2,000 years. So when

994
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,380
you actually look at the value. And the land holdings outside

995
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,159
of all that. You go to Rome and, you know, there's a church on every corner,

996
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:31,960
one of which, if that was in Australia, it'd be the most amazing thing.

997
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,320
Let alone their own country with their own, you know, set of rules.

998
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:39,219
And the Vatican Observatory and science. I mean, the science

999
00:49:39,219 --> 00:49:42,800
of the, I'm just starting a new school, which I haven't launched yet, called

1000
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,420
the School of Catholic Science Thinking. And I'm looking at like a Venn diagram

1001
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,579
if you looked at Catholic thinking, just 20 centuries.

1002
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,559
Science thinking, which is four centuries. The bit that overlaps.

1003
00:49:55,179 --> 00:49:58,780
Now whether it's science that was created, usually the

1004
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:02,760
priests and that, but science that was created because they were Catholics

1005
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,820
or in spite of being Catholics.

1006
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:08,980
Or, you know, just the bit. And then you get these George

1007
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:12,960
Lemaitre's and Mendel, you know, and you get Galileo

1008
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,199
and you get a whole lot of others. And if you just look at that. In the cross over?

1009
00:50:16,539 --> 00:50:20,940
Yeah, just in the part of Catholic science thinking. Which is not thinking about

1010
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:24,000
Catholic science, because there's no such thing. Science is science. But

1011
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,159
to the extent that Catholic education has created valuable

1012
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:33,099
science. You know, it's up there with the schools and the

1013
00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:34,440
hospitals and so on. So

1014
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:40,099
I just encourage people to go a little bit more than just, you know, throwing stones,

1015
00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:41,719
because there's a lot of value there.

1016
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,860
It's a brilliant way to understand the school of thinking. It's a brilliant way to understand

1017
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:49,880
the curiosity of your mind. It's a brilliant way to think outside the square. And an incredible

1018
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,039
note to finish on. I could sit here all afternoon, Michael, and

1019
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:54,199
I'll get off my soapbox now.

1020
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:58,699
You've got story after story. It's a remarkable life. The schoolofthinking.org, really go

1021
00:50:58,699 --> 00:51:03,000
and check it out. There's so many great tools available for free. Most of them, you can

1022
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,219
download the books for free.

1023
00:51:04,219 --> 00:51:08,539
The one I've got in my hand now, The Fourth Brain, alongside all of Michael's other

1024
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:12,539
incredible books. But that is a nine-minute bit of genius that you can pass on, which

1025
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:17,059
I plan to do. Really, it's been a great pleasure to meet you. Thank you for your time.

1026
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:21,619
Thanks, Luke. This has been a lot of fun. Great questions, too. I usually don't get

1027
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:22,500
really good questions.

1028
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,019
Well, I appreciate that.

1029
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,159
It's been lovely having the time, too, instead of like three or four, five minutes to really

1030
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:30,639
learn from each other. It's really, really loved it.

1031
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:34,199
I'm driving everyone mad in my house with X10 thinking, and I'll continue.

1032
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:38,539
Continue to do so. Go to schoolofthinking.org, Michael Hewitt Gleeson on the Empowering Leaders
