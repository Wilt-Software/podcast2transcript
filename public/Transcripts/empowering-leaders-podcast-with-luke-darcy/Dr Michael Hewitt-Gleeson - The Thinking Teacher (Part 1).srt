00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,259
Hi, it's Luke Darcy. Thank you again for joining me on the Empowering Leaders podcast. I hope

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:13,359
you're enjoying it as much as I am recording these conversations. The upcoming guest,

3
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:18,059
Michael Hewitt Gleeson, what a legend. I learned an incredible amount from this conversation,

4
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:23,480
so much so that we lost track of time and have decided to release this in two parts. Both are

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,539
ready to go now. It was a fascinating insight from a man who has collected wisdom right across

6
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,340
his life. I hope you enjoy it. On with the conversation.

7
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:40,420
G'day, it's Luke Darcy. The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field has been

8
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,299
a lifelong passion of mine. With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective and have

9
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:51,020
the privilege of working with thousands of leaders in education, sport, industry, and the arts that

10
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,679
have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership where everyone has a

11
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:18,420
voice. In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders. Dr. Michael Hewitt Gleeson is an

12
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:18,939
incredible historian. He's been a leader for over a decade. He's been a leader for over a decade.

13
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:24,939
He is a Vietnam veteran, author, cognitive neuroscientist, and lecturer. In New York in

14
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:30,060
1979, Michael co-founded the School of Thinking alongside Edward de Bono. The School of Thinking

15
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,939
has gone on to deliver more than a half a billion lessons and has trained in excess of 6 million

16
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:41,379
thinking instructors worldwide. Known as the father of X10 thinking, Michael has been the go-to

17
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:47,280
international consultant on strategy for some of the planet's most inspirational thought leaders.

18
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,859
General Electric's leadership has been a key part of his career. He's been a leader for over a decade.

19
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:53,560
The legendary leader, Jack Wells, described as the manager of the century, had Michael Hewitt

20
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,959
Gleeson on speed dial as one of his closest confidants in growing GE into the world's

21
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:03,040
biggest company at the time. Google founder Larry Page, the United Nations, the White House,

22
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:08,379
and a who's who of leaders around the world all have Michael's X10 thinking as a cornerstone of

23
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:13,680
their success. Based in New York for 14 years, the United States government described Michael

24
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,659
as a national asset. Michael, it's an honor and a privilege to meet you, and I really appreciate

25
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:21,639
you joining me today on the Empowering Leaders podcast. Oh, it's great to be here, Luke.

26
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,800
Thank you so much. So can I start, not quite at the beginning, but you finish your national

27
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,620
service in Vietnam. I understand you return home back to Australia and Edward de Bono is in town,

28
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,939
and you spend a fair chunk of your savings at that stage to attend a lecture from the legendary

29
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:41,840
Edward de Bono. It's a pretty big moment in your life, as it turns out. Can you tell me about it?

30
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,900
Well, yes, it was. As I was leaving the army, an education officer gave me Edward's,

31
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:53,520
I mean, his second book, and he said, I think you'll like this. I took it as a compliment at

32
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,400
the time, but, you know, may not have been. And of course I did. I just loved it. I mean,

33
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:05,919
things that I had been inclined to do in my own, due to my own personality and whatever,

34
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,860
but had often been criticized for doing at school. Here was someone with, you know,

35
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:15,740
the full litany of academic credentials saying and explaining why this is a good thing to do,

36
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,800
lateral thinking, thinking outside the box.

37
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:24,599
So, yeah, so I was hooked. And then not long after that, he came into town and then I went

38
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,039
along to spend all my army payout money and went along and sat in the front row.

39
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:33,800
And you convinced him to have lunch with you the next day. I mean, that's a good effort because

40
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,719
I think you said to me that you're in a room full of CEOs and you were probably maybe the outlier.

41
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,840
How did you convince him to catch up?

42
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:47,340
I think he was too polite a British gentleman to say no, you know, because I came on pretty,

43
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,580
like,

44
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:54,680
I was just, you know, so determined and so, you know, thrilled with the opportunity of meeting

45
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,060
him. And of course, after his, it was a one day thing. And after his one day of sitting,

46
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,560
soaking up as much of what he had to say as possible, you know, he just said, oh, okay,

47
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:04,900
okay, certainly, you know.

48
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:12,419
In 1979, let's fast track to there with Edward de Bono, you go on to found the, co-found the

49
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,259
School of Thinking. With your military background, you have a sense that training the trainers is

50
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:18,540
something that's going to be,

51
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,939
a skill that you're very capable of. I love this quote attributed to, thinking is not a gift,

52
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,079
but an acquired skill that can be learned and developed through lessons and practice like

53
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:32,079
volleyball, guitar, chess, or even cooking a souffle. Now, I suppose the question, Michael,

54
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,980
is, does thinking about thinking work? And I perhaps wanted to lead you in to one of your

55
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,420
first examples, which is an incredible story, the San Francisco United School District. Are you able

56
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:47,560
to take that into the direction of what that achieves? Sure. But I'd just like to just go to

57
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,500
the first bit, because I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know,

58
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:48,639
I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know,

59
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,920
I think this is something that we'll both have in common, and you're probably a much better

60
00:04:52,920 --> 00:05:02,319
example of it than I am. Sort of the discussion about talent, and then skill. I did get involved

61
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:12,879
in training some Olympic people during the LA Olympics, Peter Vidmar at gymnastics, who went

62
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,779
on to win a gold medal with a perfect 10. But Peter used to say that often the people with the

63
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:18,439
most talent,

64
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:25,680
didn't actually make it to the end, because they didn't see the need to practice. And that often

65
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:34,040
people with somewhat less talent, even disabilities, but were very big on practice and, you know, and

66
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,160
training and so on, often did very well. How does that sit with you?

67
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,040
I align with that. Absolutely. My experience of playing professional sport, the players that

68
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,500
had to really find a way through not God-given talent, that

69
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,240
often were overlooked and told they weren't good enough, when they worked their way through,

70
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,139
they became the most resilient, the best teammates you could play. And they had longevity, because

71
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:05,160
there was just nothing that was going to stand in their way. A super talented 13, 14, 15-year-old,

72
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,980
often that's a harder path in some way. So, yeah, I agree. Yeah.

73
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,639
Obviously, if you've got talent, and somehow you, you know, you really work at developing it,

74
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,040
then that's good. But yeah, so that's a bit of a paradox.

75
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:18,360
Yeah.

76
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,899
And I found that, you know, my version of the army was people were pulled out of a hat,

77
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,420
literally. I mean, it was a raffle. So that was the army's, you know.

78
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:28,480
Conscription, wasn't it?

79
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,259
Yeah, that was their selection thing. And, you know, most 20-year-olds could pass, you know,

80
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:38,160
the basic health requirements. So, you know, if the selection is put out, and then after

81
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,139
a certain training sequence they give you, you're put into battle. Even then, although

82
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:48,339
I've understood it more since then, but even then I thought, this is amazing. And then

83
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:51,699
what they're doing here, because I thought the army would be just a lot of people running

84
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:55,180
around screaming at each other, but it was nothing. It was the best training I've ever

85
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:55,560
received.

86
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,680
And you did officer training.

87
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,079
Yes.

88
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:57,980
And you had a famous...

89
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,420
Yeah, well, that was even more amazing, you know.

90
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,160
And did that really form your thoughts on leadership?

91
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:03,779
Absolutely.

92
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,300
Yeah.

93
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,160
So that was where you really, I mean, they did have a higher selection procedure. That

94
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,639
was, that's true. But still, the training was, they'd had the best instructors. It was

95
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,180
sort of the best of everything. It was at Skyville in New South Wales, a 22-week, I'm not sure,

96
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:25,220
week, highly intensive course, you know, which we all hated, sort of. I mean, the brilliant

97
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:30,779
educator, Colonel Geddes, the commandant who started it, on the first night, he said, now,

98
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,759
you know, you're in the one, top 1% of Australians, you know, bravo, it was all very good, looking

99
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,339
around, nodding at each other, you know. And he said, now, you get to make a decision tonight.

100
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:46,120
We have what we call a 30-day pipeline. You can either enter the pipeline or not enter

101
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,079
it. And if you say no, then you can leave.

102
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,920
You can leave tonight. But if you enter, you're promising on your word that you won't complain

103
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,800
or won't try and leave or do anything until the end of 30 days, then you can leave. So

104
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,480
we all, of course, you know, fell for it and we entered it. Well, then, the next day, we

105
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,579
all would have left. But we'd given our word, we wouldn't leave for 30 days. And of course,

106
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:13,220
by 30 days, the training had enough chance to take hold. And of course, away we were.

107
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,660
So very, very clever techniques they had.

108
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,459
Was it brutal, as the time was?

109
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:18,000
Brutal.

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,040
Yeah, brutal as in intense, not brutal as in abusive in any way. I mean, there are things

111
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:29,040
that today they may hear some of the hazing and that they wouldn't, wouldn't, isn't, you

112
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,200
know, okay today. But we didn't take it. It was not abusive. That's the ruthlessly, you

113
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,539
know, well managed. But, you know, lots of skills that you never thought you would ever

114
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:43,659
require. They taught you through practice and repetition.

115
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:47,759
Yeah, and you take that out of Vietnam and you come back. And as I said,

116
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,860
this chance meeting with the legendary Edward de Bono, you go to him. And was that what

117
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,500
you had in mind? I can train people.

118
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:00,299
Yeah. I said, you know, Edward was an academic. I mean, a medical doctor, Rhodes Scholar from

119
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:08,519
Malta to Oxford, D. Phil from Oxford, PhD from Cambridge. I mean, and on and on it goes,

120
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:14,879
but academic. And then, so I brought a different type of knowledge. And I said, you know, just

121
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,879
train the trainer.

122
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:16,879
Let's not teach thinkers.

123
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,879
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

124
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:18,879
Yeah.

125
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,879
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Geez.

126
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:22,840
Let's teach thinking instructors, you know, teachers of thinkers. And he like, he said,

127
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:28,820
oh yes, that, that give us a spread effect. And he, that's really why he fell for me.

128
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,019
And then, and so, that's the School of Thinking, really, the pedagogy of the School of Thinking

129
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:35,600
is part military and part academic science.

130
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,940
Can I ask what it was like as a, as a co-founder and a business partner, and what, what sort

131
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,580
of relationship did you have with Edward de Bono?

132
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,320
It grew to be very intimate and very close. And then ultimately we fell out. That's all

133
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
great relationships, too.

134
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,840
and then made up again.

135
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:55,620
And sadly, we had two trips to Italy planned in the last few years

136
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,639
and we were stopping off at Malta to see him

137
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,820
and unfortunately couldn't go and then he died last year.

138
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:03,659
But he'd become very friendly with his son, Casper,

139
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,000
who's the boss of all his stuff now.

140
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,580
But he was great.

141
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,500
He was just amazing.

142
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:11,740
Very droll, very dry, wicked sense of humor, loved jokes.

143
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,580
So I'd always make sure I had some really good jokes for him.

144
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,899
And just loved.

145
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:21,419
And he was a lot of fun, especially when we were alone together.

146
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,059
When anyone else was there, he'd sort of go into my bed with the burner

147
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:26,220
and you're not sort of thing.

148
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,019
And that was all fun too.

149
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,500
But I picked him up at the airport once in a limo

150
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,220
with two police motorbike escorts.

151
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,860
You could hire them because of the UN and all that.

152
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,019
They were just off-duty cops.

153
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:39,679
Oh, he just loved it.

154
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,480
So little fun things.

155
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,860
But of course, he was a brilliant genius.

156
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:45,580
And what I learned,

157
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,960
from him during that time was just, you know,

158
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,500
I mean, I'm the luckiest guy in the world, so.

159
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:52,899
It's an amazing chapter.

160
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,279
I'm jumping, I want to come back to the San Francisco school district.

161
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,899
That story is an incredible story.

162
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:01,259
But you're being around someone who is the pioneer of lateral thinking

163
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:06,440
and you have taken that really to so many millions and millions of people as well.

164
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:08,360
But did you find that when you were together

165
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,840
that you're constantly coming with those sort of ideas?

166
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,159
Was that him in day-to-day life?

167
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:15,539
Yeah, well, I mean, yes, lots.

168
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,600
And so we were, I'll tell you two quick stories.

169
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,899
So once we, you know, I sort of tried to find ways of making money

170
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:28,580
before we got the school, you know, underway, and then it was fine.

171
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,279
But so at first I tried to sell him as a consultant.

172
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,740
So I would make appointments, you know, with CEOs of Anheuser-Busch

173
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:41,740
or some big tire company and so on, a Citibank.

174
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:42,659
This was the one I'm going to tell you.

175
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,419
And then Edward would come into town about every three months.

176
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:45,700
He was a professional.

177
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,379
He was a professor of investigative medicine at Cambridge.

178
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:56,460
So and we had this meeting and then there were the guy who'd been boss of Citicorp,

179
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:00,720
sort of like the Vatican, the Pope, you know, for a long time was about to retire.

180
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,720
So there were four potential successors.

181
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,000
And one of them was a fellow called George Vojta.

182
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:10,039
So that was the guy that I'd had the, you know, the meeting around.

183
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:13,740
So I ended up in his private dining room at the top of Citicorp with, you know,

184
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,179
white-gloved valet.

185
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:19,639
And it's just the four, George Vojta, one of his off-siders, and then Edward and I.

186
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:23,419
And he's this, you know, and they were impressed with him.

187
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,220
But he's a medical professor and they're asking questions about insurance.

188
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,080
And Edward would do things like, yes, well, there are four things to consider here.

189
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:34,519
And like their eyes would light up and he'd go, number one, and so on.

190
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,059
And I was just as amazed.

191
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,980
But when we went downstairs, we were crossing Park Avenue, I said, I know what you did.

192
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:41,080
He said, what?

193
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,159
I said, well, when you said there were four things, you didn't know what they were.

194
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,419
And that's just terribly impressive.

195
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:49,299
And then you'd say, number one, and rave on a bit.

196
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,919
And then that would make you think of number two.

197
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,559
And then they'd nod and say, that's number three, and so on.

198
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,740
He said, yes, Michael, and I want your opinion.

199
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,539
I'll give it to you.

200
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,559
So he was a lot of fun.

201
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:04,179
He bought himself some time and then came up with it.

202
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:09,519
I'm fascinated with the, as I said, of the San Francisco United School District

203
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,240
and reading a bit of history, and please correct me if I'm wrong,

204
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,120
but you decided that you would take this.

205
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,799
You went into education, trained the trainers,

206
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,960
and you were adopted by the Bay Area of San Francisco.

207
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,240
Can you tell us how that was received and the outcome?

208
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:25,340
Yeah, quickly.

209
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,139
So we actually had a fellow in New York at the City University of New York,

210
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,799
Professor Bossone, who was a bit of a character, a New York character.

211
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,740
And he'd had a grant, some big education grant,

212
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,360
that allowed him to bring the superintendents, they're the bosses,

213
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,139
of the various school districts.

214
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:48,299
And he was able to bring the superintendents together in a conference,

215
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:52,519
I think once a year, and his grant had just run out and he was trying to get it renewed.

216
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,340
This was the back story that I didn't realize.

217
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,399
And then he, you know, he heard about us and he thought, well, teaching,

218
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,519
I mean, legitimately teaching, thinking would be a good thing to do,

219
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,159
but it'd be a great way for him to get his grant renewed.

220
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,799
So he did that.

221
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,960
We, you know, said, yes, we can teach the program.

222
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:15,019
He had a conference in Puerto Rico and New York.

223
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:19,980
San Francisco and Dallas and all various superintendents were there.

224
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:22,399
And I presented, you know, and they loved it.

225
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,600
And the two that took it up were Dallas at that time, were Dallas and San Francisco.

226
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:29,779
But San Francisco was first.

227
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,600
Robert Alioto was the guy.

228
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:39,460
And so I went in and personally trained all of the school principals in the San Francisco Unified School District.

229
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:43,240
That's the Bay Area, Oakland, all around, you know, down to San Jose.

230
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,340
Okay.

231
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,100
And.

232
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:50,179
And then had our program, which couldn't be replicated because we teach thinking instructors

233
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:53,360
and then they can replicate it down through the system.

234
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,100
And that was continued.

235
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:07,879
And, of course, that trained a whole generation of young people who became the employees of what then became Silicon Valley,

236
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:14,259
which then has more patents than all of the rest of America combined.

237
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,000
And I think it's great.

238
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,379
And the first national product, just last time I checked, of that area is bigger than many countries in the world.

239
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,419
I forget them all now.

240
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:23,159
Bigger than Switzerland.

241
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,919
Bigger than Australia.

242
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,779
Bigger than Saudi Arabia.

243
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:27,440
And we all know the story, you know, so.

244
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,480
And look, it's a fascinating bit of, I suppose, data to think about, isn't it?

245
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:35,980
You train a generation of students in a particular area to think about thinking.

246
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:36,240
Yes.

247
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,120
And disrupt the school system through the principals.

248
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:43,600
And then you get this, you know, I think the word you use, cognitive surplus, really.

249
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,059
Yes.

250
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:44,480
Yes.

251
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:52,659
All of that around you, Silicon Valley becomes the, you know, the extraordinary lifting off point for what we look like today.

252
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,779
I mean, is that link pretty clear in your mind?

253
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:56,700
There's no doubt about it.

254
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:10,200
And in the same way that happened at GE, I mean, GE not only grew themselves, but GE became famous for the formation of CEOs of many, many other Fortune 500 companies.

255
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,259
In other words, the people and the training, it wasn't a fluke.

256
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:20,659
They became attractive as leaders of other companies.

257
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,480
And then the same at the startup level in Silicon Valley.

258
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:31,299
I mean, many of the employees that started off at Apple and Google and so on then went off and started their own startups.

259
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:38,279
And in fact, at one stage, Stanford University, you know, you couldn't get anyone to go into the medical faculty or law.

260
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,019
They were all doing the business school, hoping to make a billion dollars, you know.

261
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,440
So that became a whole.

262
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,519
Culture there as well.

263
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:53,799
But yes, it was proven to be what we predicted, replicable and spread and sustained.

264
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:58,759
And in business, you can dollarize, you know, you can measure the value.

265
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:01,159
In other areas, the value is there, but it may not be.

266
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,680
I want to come back to Jack Walsh and GE and to X10 thinking very quickly.

267
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:10,980
But the school system and where it's at is a fascinating conversation for me.

268
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,920
And you've got a live example like that.

269
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,420
I think, you know, parent of.

270
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,440
Of four myself.

271
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,299
One's just finished.

272
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:16,539
Okay.

273
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,980
You see good intentions, but really suboptimal.

274
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,200
Yes.

275
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:28,380
Apart from what it feels like for a very narrow bracket who know they want to be an engineer or know they want to be in the medical profession.

276
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,240
It doesn't feel like it supports great creative thinking.

277
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:33,839
And I've referenced this a lot.

278
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,920
I think the most viewed TED talk is a brilliant, and his name will escape me.

279
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,740
Sir Ken Robinson.

280
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,380
Sir Ken Robinson.

281
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,019
You know.

282
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:42,680
That's a great talk.

283
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,119
School's creativity.

284
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,420
They do.

285
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,900
That's the title of that.

286
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:49,539
And it's worth listening to that TED talk if you haven't before.

287
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,700
Are you a subscriber to that?

288
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:51,480
Yes.

289
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:53,799
And there's a historical reason for it.

290
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,519
I mean, we did the six thinking hats, you know, in the school of thinking.

291
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,480
We did that together in terms of developing this idea.

292
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,299
You and Edward de Bono.

293
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:02,539
Yeah.

294
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,359
And then when we decided to go our separate ways, you know, we agreed he'd take the thinking hats.

295
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,720
And he went on and wrote a book about it.

296
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,019
And it was obviously done very well.

297
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,299
And I would take the school of thinking.

298
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,359
And then the metaphor.

299
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,819
The metaphor that I then used because I was invited through my agent to do some talks

300
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:25,759
at a series of IBM meetings in Monte Carlo where they released the first personal computer.

301
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,640
So, you know, they had those big meetings in those days.

302
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:30,660
You know, budget was no problem.

303
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,700
And out of this sort of what was a swimming pool, sort of on a lift out came this thing

304
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,180
in the fog that they had there.

305
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,740
They had all these CEOs from all around the world with interpreters and that.

306
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,960
And then the spotlight came on.

307
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,440
And there's this just little.

308
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,299
Little box that sat on a desk, which is nothing now.

309
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:51,940
But then computers were rooms full of men in white coats, men and women in white coats,

310
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:54,220
and, you know, all the wiring and air conditioning.

311
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,779
The size of small factories, essentially, weren't they?

312
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:57,059
Yeah, exactly.

313
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,180
So what era are we talking?

314
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:58,660
Is that?

315
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,380
This is 83-ish.

316
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,019
It's not that long ago, is it, when you think about it?

317
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:03,900
No, that's not that long ago.

318
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:04,900
Not when you're my age.

319
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:12,380
But even though we knew it, there was the shock to see a little box that could be my computer.

320
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,319
So I, as a sort of a joke.

321
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,819
Because you've got to try and entertain your audience.

322
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:19,819
I said, well, here we have, you know, the first desktop computer.

323
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:21,079
And that's why we're all here to go.

324
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:21,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

325
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,720
Um, but you know, the brain is your necktop computer.

326
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,059
And I got a little bit of a laugh.

327
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:27,619
That's a good line.

328
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:28,640
Yeah, enough to keep it in.

329
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,720
But that allowed me to talk about then a really good metaphor, which is software for your brain.

330
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,740
And I had then a book, which became an international bestseller.

331
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:44,240
Because then if we've got the hardware and everyone agrees that the human brain is the most amazing

332
00:19:44,440 --> 00:20:10,599
machine of, we know of in the universe, I mean, that we know of, um, but the software we're using is 2,500 years old, Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, uh, which was rediscovered by Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century, bought into the church, just as it was creating the first universities and the wonderful thing that it created a universal education system, which had spread around the world through missionaries, who today we'd call influencers.

333
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:13,440
But this is probably one of the great gifts of the church.

334
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:14,299
And, um,

335
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:25,059
you may be Europe's greatest export, you know, the idea that everyone was entitled to be educated, not just the nobility or, you know, all the wealthy people, all the priests of the church and so on.

336
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:32,200
But the software that was embedded in the education system is, um, logic, right and wrong.

337
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:32,859
I'm right.

338
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:33,579
You're wrong.

339
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:38,619
And that what we now call binary thinking, that idea of right and wrong.

340
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:41,000
And we say our whole parliamentary system is based on that.

341
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:43,539
Everyone in the middle of an election now.

342
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:44,420
But if you.

343
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:52,180
If you do happen to turn on the parliament, you'll see everyone on this side say, everything we say is right and nothing you say makes sense.

344
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:52,839
I mean, nothing.

345
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:53,680
And these are adults.

346
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,099
Yeah.

347
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:57,319
And meanwhile, the other side is saying the exact same thing.

348
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:02,799
I mean, how can, if, if our children behave that way, we're not allowed to smack them anymore, but you know, they go to their room.

349
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:03,160
Yeah.

350
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,319
You know, no, uh, dessert for you.

351
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,559
That was my punishment.

352
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:14,180
But, um, so, uh, so what we need, so in binary thinking, the alternative to good is bad.

353
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:21,859
But what we teach is trinary thinking, where the alternative to good is not only bad, but also better.

354
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:33,279
So you can move from judgment or black hat thinking, I like it, I don't like it into yellow hat or design thinking, but how could we make this 10 times better?

355
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,480
And so then that that's a whole different kind of thinking to just judgment.

356
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:38,539
And, and it's brilliant.

357
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:43,799
And you go back to the school system, um, you know, around, we admonish mistakes, don't we, in the school system.

358
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:44,400
That's right.

359
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,059
That's wrong.

360
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:45,700
Here's a test.

361
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,640
We have exams where you're supposed to get the right answer.

362
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,779
And if you don't, you get punished.

363
00:21:51,119 --> 00:22:11,400
And then we have now highly paid executives who, who, uh, who might even go to a seminar on creativity and innovation, which is a big buzzword right now, uh, and wear the armband and all that, but won't do it because the fear of making a mistake is so great and so costly, uh, that there'll be a lot.

364
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,960
I mean, I had a one client as I won't mention the name.

365
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:24,460
But see, I have a bank, he said, we have, we have innovation, uh, seminars, we have innovation month, we have innovation armbands, we just don't have any innovation.

366
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:30,660
I've ticked all the boxes, but I'm not going to take a risk to innovate.

367
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,900
No, why am I going to, can we go through the exercise?

368
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:44,059
You sent me a brilliant book, uh, and I was saying to you just before we recorded the fourth brain, it's, it's a piece of genius that you can read in about nine minutes and everyone.

369
00:22:44,059 --> 00:23:04,680
In the empowering leaders offices grabbed it once a piece of it, I shared it immediately with Beck, my wife and, and the kids, it's brilliant and it sums up X10 thinking and I, I think, uh, the, the understanding bit of the prefrontal cortex part of our brain of, of how that's the opportunity for us to probably live a much better life if we get a handle on, on that.

370
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,059
Could you give us that example?

371
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:09,799
Because it's, it's, you can do it in a fairly condensed amount of time.

372
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:13,059
I love the thinking current view situation versus better view situation.

373
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:13,779
Can you give us that?

374
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:14,779
That exercise?

375
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:21,259
Well, I, I, I'm, you know, like you interested in all these things and I was in a bookstore the other day and I picked a book off the shelf.

376
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:39,559
I'm not going to mention names and it was a nice book, you know, but, but it was a book, um, uh, it, it had something in the title about the mind, you know, you know, here's for a much better mind that wasn't it, but it was that kind of thing written by someone who might be well known in, uh, Australia.

377
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:43,700
And, um, I've read, I I've done this many times.

378
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,000
Cause it's.

379
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:45,079
It's a bugbear of mine.

380
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:54,740
I went through the whole book and, uh, there wasn't a, an index, but I went through, I can go through pretty quick and there was zero mention of the brain.

381
00:23:55,819 --> 00:24:02,660
Now it'd be like writing a book on, you know, on sailing without mentioning the word boat, you know what I mean?

382
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:13,900
How I don't expect everybody at all to be a neuroscientist, but how could you talk about, you know, um, you know, certain, you know, certain.

383
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:20,960
Subjects without mentioning any, some understanding or even mention, and that really happens quite across the board.

384
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:32,460
So a lot of the talking and well-meaning stuff that goes on in, you know, personal development and even leadership and so on really, um, uh, very superficial.

385
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,759
I mean, really, really not giving you the real code and the thrill.

386
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,200
So in this book, so I decided to write a book that summarizes what we now know.

387
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,039
And, uh, and, uh, much of the work.

388
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:46,799
In the brain has actually been done in just the last 20 years.

389
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,539
So there was, which is since I did all my original study.

390
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:55,960
So I wanted to make sure number one, that what I was still teaching was, was correct and was valid.

391
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:02,500
And number two, I think just people just need some quick understanding of just what this machine is.

392
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,920
And so that was the fourth brain.

393
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:13,819
Uh, can you go through the lives of the brain quickly for, for, so, um, the science currently talks about the, the, uh, triune brain and which is the three.

394
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:26,420
Brain says the reptile brain, which is a, you know, was first formed, you know, many, many millions of generations ago, and that still handles all of the fundamental, I mean, I'm perhaps the most prized position now.

395
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,339
Our blood pressure, you know, our body systems are all automatic.

396
00:25:30,339 --> 00:25:38,839
We don't have to think about consciously, they're all there, uh, away and also very deep evolutionary healing, which has had developed through survival.

397
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,099
Otherwise we wouldn't have survived.

398
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:42,619
Is that the fight or flight along the way that comes out?

399
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:44,039
No, that's a later one.

400
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:55,220
But still that kind of thing, stuff that's learned over many generations, uh, because otherwise if it hadn't, we wouldn't be here, you know, and then you move up to the mammal brain and that's the emotional brain.

401
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,079
Reptiles don't have much in emotional life.

402
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:05,160
So that's the mammal brain, uh, emotions is the main thing there, the limbic system, the amygdala, the big one on fear, violence, and so on.

403
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:14,039
And then, uh, then the big brain, the cortex, that big, you know, which is why human babies have to be born so early.

404
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:21,740
Big just to get that big brain out and need then a lot of attention where other animals can pretty much get up and go not long after they've been born.

405
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:31,019
Um, and then more recently, the part of the brain, that was the fourth one, which I added, they are the three brains, the prefrontal cortex.

406
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:43,900
Um, interestingly, the three brains, the reptile brain, mammal, brain, and cortex, or human brain are all in a sense pre-wired, not pre-wired at birth, but genetically programmed so that they can be.

407
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,240
developed, and they become wired along the way.

408
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,519
But the fourth brain isn't.

409
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:55,680
It's only wired up after you're born and through the street where you live, the family

410
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:01,559
you live in, the environment, the climate, all of the things, the education and things

411
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,779
that happen to you and so on.

412
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:07,819
And so that means you can live and survive on the street where you live, not just in

413
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:09,000
some pre-wired thing.

414
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,579
And that really doesn't come on board fully until you're 25.

415
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:17,440
So adolescents, teenagers, and younger people.

416
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,240
And that's where you have discernment.

417
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,220
You can detect irony.

418
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,619
You know, you and I can look at each other, and we can sort of tell a little bit what's

419
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:28,920
going on over and above what we say.

420
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,299
We don't just have to do judgmental thinking.

421
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,059
We can discern other things.

422
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,559
We're not so subject to peer group, and we don't take risk.

423
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,779
We understand a lot more about risk management.

424
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:48,700
So teenagers without a prefrontal cortex aren't good at risk management.

425
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:55,779
They take risks that we would never take, are very susceptible to peer group, and not

426
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,480
so able to discern.

427
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,539
It's a dangerous time.

428
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,519
You describe it as a dangerous time, isn't it?

429
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,900
And you see that I've got three teenagers in my house.

430
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,819
Yeah, it's a very, yeah.

431
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:07,980
And you can literally see that part of the brain isn't formed, isn't it?

432
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:13,759
And much of the environment that they're involved in now isn't, you know, I'm holding my iPhone,

433
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:19,619
my smartphone, which I can't find it hard to put down as well, but which we're all highly

434
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:20,240
addicted to.

435
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,440
So, yeah, so interesting.

436
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:25,700
So I just thought some understanding of how this all works would be helpful to people.

437
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,279
And what you've done, and part of your X10 thinking is this, and I love your description,

438
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,440
it's a software application for your brain.

439
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,259
It's an update.

440
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,099
It's an app for your brain.

441
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,000
An app for your brain.

442
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,839
Can you talk us through how that works?

443
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,519
So we have lateral thinking, which I think people know enough about.

444
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:40,779
It's thinking outside the box.

445
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:43,740
So our brain becomes wired up in a certain way.

446
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:52,660
You know, there's about 100 times more neurons when we're born than we have now, but they're

447
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,240
not connected.

448
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:53,900
They're not wired.

449
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,920
And as we have our life and experiences, early life, pathways are formed through activation

450
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,619
and through repetition and so on.

451
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,339
And so we learn how to have breakfast in the morning.

452
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,359
You know, we learn how to get, we don't have to reinvent that anymore.

453
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,819
These become patterns.

454
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:08,859
Patterns.

455
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,660
Learn how to drive a car without thinking about it anymore.

456
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,059
All of that.

457
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:11,359
Yeah.

458
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:13,519
And then all those other neurons that didn't get wired up.

459
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,460
They just die away.

460
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:16,720
And so we've got our brain, our wired brain.

461
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:19,019
And so that's great.

462
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:19,940
That's handy.

463
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:25,339
That's how we can live in the particular environment that we're in and survive and grow.

464
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:30,160
But when, for whatever reason, we want it.

465
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,119
So that's our box.

466
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,420
When we want to think, that's how we do the right thing and not the wrong thing.

467
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,099
We know to drive on that side of the road.

468
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,680
We know how to get dressed this way, how to, you know, how to make porridge, whatever it

469
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,240
is we do, right and wrong.

470
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,279
We can make mistakes and we can accidentally discover penicillin by mold on an orange and

471
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:48,940
all that sort of thing.

472
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,039
But mostly we're there to do the right thing and go down the right pathway and so on.

473
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:54,799
We know right and wrong.

474
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:00,480
But what about if we start a business and it's a highly competitive environment like

475
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,400
FinTech that's going on now or something?

476
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:05,599
How do we get that edge over our competitors?

477
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,339
How do we have that point of difference?

478
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:09,339
How do we do things in a different way?

479
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,900
What if we don't have enough capital for our business?

480
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,460
How do we change our business?

481
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,579
How do we change our business plan to get more bang for our buck?

482
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:18,119
How do we think outside the box?

483
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:23,339
And that's, Edward was very big at, you know, creating the need for that.

484
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,079
A lot of people already did it, but it was, oh, don't do that.

485
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,799
You know, there's something wrong with this girl.

486
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,000
You know, she's a bit dodgy.

487
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:30,440
Watch her.

488
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,299
He made it all very legit and so on and also the techniques of how to do it.

489
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:39,079
But even then it was all words which favors one particular side of the brain, which is

490
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:39,380
great.

491
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:43,160
Another part of the brain, though, likes numbers.

492
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,279
She knows much better with numbers than words.

493
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:51,259
So not instead of, but in addition to the lateral thinking techniques, I developed X10

494
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:56,960
thinking, particularly in business, which is all driven by measurement, business and

495
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,200
science, which is driven by measurement and numbers and even sport, you know, in many

496
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,400
ways.

497
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:08,240
So, and so that you, it's just a, you know, an alternative, not an alternative, a synonym

498
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,940
for lateral thinking, X10 thinking.

499
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,960
Because X10 is not logical, you know.

500
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,079
X10 increase every year in business is normal.

501
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,259
Multiply my business by 10.

502
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,160
What are you talking about?

503
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,599
And that was another one of my books, how to multiply your business by 10.

504
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:26,480
And again, well, to do that, you really do have to think outside the box.

505
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:39,000
Seeing the world, sitting across from Michael Hewitt-Gleeson now, but you're giving us an

506
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,279
update to say, can you challenge that to a BVS, a better view of the situation?

507
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,099
Two can't equal the same.

508
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:46,460
No.

509
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,039
And so that's, that's a really practical.

510
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,400
Yeah.

511
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:50,160
Way.

512
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:54,039
And, and, you know, three days ago I read this and my mind's constantly now thinking

513
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:54,259
it.

514
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:54,880
It's, it's.

515
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,759
Well, have a, have an idea you're already that way.

516
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:02,440
But I mean, it's just funny you picked up on that, you know, security.

517
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,519
So one of Edward, one of my favorite sayings of Edward, remember he was a professor of

518
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:10,339
investigative medicine at Cambridge and I was at a dinner once in London.

519
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,119
He used to run these black tie dinners, you know, and involved all sorts of top people.

520
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,440
The chairman of IBM was there at that time, but his boss, Professor Ivan Mills from Cambridge

521
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:19,740
was there.

522
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:25,200
And he told the story about how they'd been doing some experimental work on a dog and

523
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,279
they were putting the liver back in and Edward said, let's put it in back the front.

524
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:35,079
And he, as he told the story, he said, well, we all knew Edward, you know, you know, he's

525
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:40,779
like, so, so they raised eyebrows and rolled eyes and so on, but they did it.

526
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:44,960
And he said that the, I might have this wrong, but it doesn't matter, get the point.

527
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,519
But I think it was the salt, um, extracting the salt from the urine.

528
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:54,339
But it was something like that, uh, an important measurement that they take was much higher

529
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:58,339
than it could, than they would have expected from doing it the right way around.

530
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,079
And that led to 15 years of research in liver.

531
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,839
And here's the interesting thing.

532
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:08,759
Um, and it's really the, the true nature of an experiment in science.

533
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,299
A real experiment is when you do something, not because you know what will happen, but

534
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:14,660
in order to see what will happen.

535
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:19,240
Edward didn't know what was going to happen, but he knew the value of experiments.

536
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:20,720
And it could have been nothing.

537
00:33:20,859 --> 00:33:23,559
It could have been, that's just, obviously you tell the stories of the wins.

538
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:23,920
Yeah.

539
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:31,200
But, um, that's a lovely example of, you know, of, of, of extreme thinking, provocation,

540
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:31,700
so on.

541
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:35,619
And you, you, clearly the link to the business world makes a lot of sense, but you also talk

542
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:38,799
about, you can apply that to your relationships and your family life.

543
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,680
Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely.

544
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,160
And day to day.

545
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,880
Do you find that, that the uptake on that, because I find this interesting, I love talking

546
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,279
about family to, to, to people in leadership positions as well, because I can't separate

547
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:49,460
one from the other.

548
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:55,299
Um, but most people don't tend to apply that sort of thinking that they use for commercial

549
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,119
gain to their own families.

550
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,180
I think you're right.

551
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:00,859
Has this worked for you when you've seen people with that sort of mindset or?

552
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,700
I think so.

553
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:06,099
I mean, it's, it's like you, it's a discussion I enjoy having, you know, in all dinner parties

554
00:34:06,099 --> 00:34:07,960
with all sorts of people in different circumstances.

555
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:14,900
So you do learn stuff over the years, but, um, the, when it comes to leadership, the

556
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:19,739
definition that we, you know, have developed, which is again, coming partly from the, from

557
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:28,019
the military science and also from this cognitive science, that leadership, uh, is the skill

558
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:29,599
of leading yourself.

559
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,820
Sorry, no, start again.

560
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:38,260
Thinking is the skill of leading yourself and leadership of the skill of helping others

561
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,420
to lead themselves.

562
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,679
And like all skills, they can be learned and developed.

563
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,199
In other words, what we're talking about is behavior.

564
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,519
Well, behavior is governed by thinking.

565
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,739
So, um, what we're interested in is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is,

566
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:54,760
is behavior, whether it's behavior in a company or on a footy ground or in a relationship

567
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,440
and so on.

568
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:58,400
How do I manage behavior?

569
00:34:58,539 --> 00:35:01,239
How do I do better behaviors and other behaviors and so on?

570
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,340
Well, that's through thinking.

571
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:07,179
And the, particularly the prefrontal cortex is the one where you can reappraise.

572
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,360
That's the CVS to BVS.

573
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:16,219
So if you don't just do the automatic response, uh, your prefrontal cortex comes in and says,

574
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,639
are you sure that's what you want to do?

575
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,679
So that's where you can have your, when,

576
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:26,039
we learn techniques in leadership, you know, about, uh, various strategies and, you know,

577
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:29,920
and generating alternatives and looking at consequences and all these sorts of things.

578
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:35,780
That's where your prefrontal cortex, and you're about to respond to a stimulus and your PFC

579
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,599
says, well, are you sure?

580
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,559
And that gives you a little chance to maybe choose a better option.

581
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,440
And then we have software for that CVS to BVS.

582
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,380
So your brain is secreting a CVS, current view of the situation at any particular moment,

583
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,539
such as now.

584
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,599
Um, and then that can be the thing that my current view will be the thing that leads

585
00:35:54,599 --> 00:36:01,900
to the appropriate behavior, but I could switch from my CVS to a BVS, a better view of the

586
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:07,000
situation, which if I can't see it, then I can use X10 as a provocation and say, well,

587
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,420
wait a minute.

588
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,820
Um, maybe we'd be better in this interaction with the customer.

589
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:16,619
If I stopped talking about what I think is great about and actually talk to them about

590
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:18,320
what their problem is.

591
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:19,619
And so that would be.

592
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,539
Quite a very significant switch from what I want to say to what the customer wants to

593
00:36:25,539 --> 00:36:25,860
say.

594
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,300
Uh, most salespeople don't do that.

595
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:34,420
They talk and then spend, you know, five minutes selling their product, another 25 minutes

596
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,659
buying it back again, you know?

597
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,300
So that would be a very scene.

598
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,119
That's what we teach salespeople, you know, how to change.

599
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:45,119
But if you can't escape from your CVS and escape is the key word, then you can't then

600
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,119
see one of the many BVSs.

601
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,400
And I want to come back to you.

602
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,340
You revolutionizing the sales world as well.

603
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:56,099
It's another incredible chapter of your life, but the, the idea of escaping that current

604
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:01,039
thought really resonated with me in research for this, that we are often defending our

605
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:01,820
position, aren't we?

606
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,900
Because we think we've got that sorted and we understand, and even going back to the

607
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:10,820
understanding the layers of the, of the brain that, that the reptilian part is saying, geez,

608
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,039
I'd love to go and have a few beers.

609
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:17,340
I'd love to go and have a cigarette or, you know, make a choice that, uh, you know, is

610
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,340
going to give some short-term understanding.

611
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,340
Yeah.

612
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,340
So I think it's really interesting.

613
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,340
It's, it's really interesting.

614
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,340
It's really interesting to me.

615
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,559
I think the fact that you've explained that with the, with the prefrontal cortex, the decision

616
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:32,320
to delay instant gratification for the greater good or a greater life.

617
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,239
It's really, uh, to me, sums it up the way you have done so clearly.

618
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:40,260
And then that opportunity then to, if you really want to then take it to the next level,

619
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,920
have you got a 10 times version of what could really accelerate, whatever, whatever part

620
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,920
of your life.

621
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,380
And that to me is the genius, the software update to your brain that you've, uh, that

622
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,219
you've explained oh, good.

623
00:37:49,219 --> 00:37:52,940
Jack Welsh, who's iconic, the manager of the century.

624
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,239
I think he's been described as the numbers at GE.

625
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,440
And I think maybe you can maybe clarify.

626
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:03,139
I understand GE was potentially, without disruption and lateral thinking,

627
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:05,179
had the potential to be a Kodak.

628
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:05,940
Yes.

629
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:06,500
Oh, yes.

630
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,239
Go out of business.

631
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,400
The digital age went past Kodak.

632
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,219
They're one of the biggest business in the world.

633
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,420
They thought digital cameras were a waste of time.

634
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:15,039
Yes, yes.

635
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:17,920
And they're effectively no longer Kodak.

636
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,500
But in comes Jack Welsh.

637
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,659
He takes the company from a $14 billion market cap to about $450 billion.

638
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:23,980
Yes.

639
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:26,360
The biggest company in the world in his 20-year term.

640
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:28,679
You had an incredibly close relationship with this.

641
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,360
Tell us what it was like being with him.

642
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:33,840
Well, he was, again, one of the great, great characters.

643
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,780
And he did exactly what you said.

644
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:43,239
A company that was over 100 years old and really on, you know, facing extinction

645
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:46,260
because the environment had changed so dramatically, you know,

646
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,860
from the industrial age.

647
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,159
And locomotives and all that.

648
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:52,440
And he came in and changed it.

649
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,099
So he was already that way inclined, as you are.

650
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:59,880
And rather, it's not what I did that made him Jack Welsh.

651
00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:05,139
But people who are interested in these things seek out tools and methods

652
00:39:05,139 --> 00:39:06,000
that may be helpful.

653
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,019
And he was one of those, as you are.

654
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,380
So I was booked to do another gig.

655
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:15,679
You know, this was for GE down in Marco Island in Florida.

656
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,900
And it was just, you know, you're an agent in bookshops.

657
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,599
You're to do your, it's usually a one-hour gig at a conference,

658
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:22,679
at a big sales conference.

659
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,000
And they had all their people around.

660
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,159
I fly down.

661
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,000
I do my gig.

662
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,039
And it was, I always use X10.

663
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:30,199
So I write up on the thing, GE X10.

664
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,780
What if we multiply GE by 10?

665
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,119
And then that's the provocation.

666
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,019
And that gets everyone going.

667
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,119
And then I teach them.

668
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:38,579
Which is why you've got the X and the 10 in that order, haven't you?

669
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:38,639
Yeah.

670
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:40,440
Because it can be, you know.

671
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:40,659
Yeah.

672
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,039
And we don't say 10 times.

673
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:42,760
I mean, you can.

674
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah.

675
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:44,400
It's in one level, same thing.

676
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,860
But the advantage of X10 rather than 10X is you can tag.

677
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,599
You get onto something.

678
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:48,940
Yeah.

679
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,880
So we can go Luke Darcy X10.

680
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:51,219
Yeah.

681
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:52,659
Or anything X10.

682
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:53,840
And then you can start thinking.

683
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,500
It's more than just descriptive of 10 power, which it also does.

684
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:01,840
And that's just at a zero and quite extraordinary.

685
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:05,019
But anyway, so, but as it so happened,

686
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:07,059
the new chairman was sitting in the front row.

687
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:07,800
And that was Jack.

688
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,860
And at the end of the thing, he literally just jumped up on the platform.

689
00:40:12,139 --> 00:40:14,119
Oh, no, he had to give his speech following mine.

690
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,079
Had a little bit of a speech impairment.

691
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:17,019
He used to stutter a bit.

692
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:17,300
And he said,

693
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:21,340
we've got to reach and we've got to grasp and go for the BVS.

694
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,000
And then he got me.

695
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:25,380
He said, oh, this is just what we're looking for.

696
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:26,900
How are you getting back to New York?

697
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,000
I said, well, you know, I've got my ticket.

698
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:28,940
He said, now come with me.

699
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,119
So that entailed going out to the airport.

700
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,480
And the chairman got around in a fleet of, he had a big,

701
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,119
I forget the type of plane, but the big ones that they have.

702
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,519
And then the two little air jets for some of the other executives.

703
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,719
So we, this is the 80s, mind you.

704
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:47,340
And we're literally going back to New York,

705
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,280
eating lobster and French champagne,

706
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:54,179
but talking, you know, face to, like we are intensely about,

707
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:54,960
you know, what can be done.

708
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,179
So I spent four years in those days.

709
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,599
We had these multi-projector,

710
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:02,840
I had 30 slide projectors back behind a screen.

711
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,199
So, and doing, it's all done by computer now,

712
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,079
been those days to create this very good effect.

713
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:10,820
And we'd take this show around the GE world,

714
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,059
everywhere around factories and,

715
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:16,440
and conferences and so on teaching this basic software,

716
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,619
CVS to BVS, which he's got in his book, Jack.

717
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,820
And eventually it was up in every factory, every office, everywhere.

718
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:25,539
So that formula, your formula.

719
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,960
And he changed the, the company, companies have mission statements,

720
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,719
which no one ever looks at, but he changed it to the road to a BVS.

721
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:34,300
Wow.

722
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,980
And where it worked with him,

723
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,920
because I've done lots of work with various Fortune 500 companies and the

724
00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:42,219
CEOs nods and, you know, it's well done.

725
00:41:42,219 --> 00:41:42,860
And then that's it.

726
00:41:43,059 --> 00:41:45,219
He really took it and ran with it.

727
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:48,599
And people, he's, people would come to you and say, Jack, we've got this problem.

728
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,360
And you say, well, what's the BVS?

729
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,480
So they know you don't go to Jack unless you've really got some ideas, you know?

730
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,260
Yeah.

731
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:59,179
And, uh, so that's, I'll just have one quickie.

732
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:00,940
So we're having a cup of tea one day.

733
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:05,139
It was, I think it was a conference in maybe a Kapok, I think GE aerospace.

734
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,840
Anyway, we're having a cup of tea and just chatting and he was actually doing the talking.

735
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,559
He said, I can't get any work done.

736
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:12,940
He said, everyone has to talk to me.

737
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,039
Yeah.

738
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:17,099
You know, I'm the chairman of GE, the chairman of general motors has to talk to the chairman

739
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:19,420
of GE, you know, and he's going on like this.

740
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:23,179
I just can't get anything done, you know, and I'm sipping the tea and nodding.

741
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:23,559
Oh yeah.

742
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:29,739
You know, and he said, you don't think I could multiply myself by 10, which of course you

743
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:34,239
can't, but often the provocation becomes a stepping stone to an idea.

744
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:39,179
Once you leap outside the box, you don't necessarily get there, but you might hit a

745
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:40,719
stepping stone, which then leads on.

746
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,000
So what he did all by himself without.

747
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:52,280
I know he said all of my divisions, you know, aerospace, locomotives, clients, blah, blah,

748
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,780
blah, they're all headed by executive vice presidents.

749
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:58,659
Why don't I call them all presidents, which he did.

750
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:05,059
Now I'm not saying that decision alone grew extended, but that kind of thinking, you know,

751
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:06,159
and that's what he was like.

752
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:06,760
He was just.

753
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:12,739
But as you said, I mean, previously that became the place to go and find the next great CEO.

754
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:16,199
So that stepping stone immediately and that thinking.

755
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:16,699
Well, you're right.

756
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,960
A lot of those guys went on to become the CEO of Exxon and the CEO of somewhere else,

757
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:26,039
you know, and that's all been written well and truly written up by Harvard Business Review

758
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:31,179
or the genealogy coming down from Jack to all these companies.

759
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,000
It's quite interesting.

760
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:33,199
It's an incredible legacy.

761
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:38,420
I mean, perhaps a little bit closer to home for some of the younger generation might be

762
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,500
Google and what they have done.

763
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,719
And Larry Page, one of the co-founders.

764
00:43:42,739 --> 00:43:48,079
In particular, they call it moonshot thinking, which is X10 thinking, and they're devotees

765
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:48,960
of your work.

766
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,519
But reading some of what you've described before, I mean, they really took this to the

767
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:56,579
net, even before they'd grown massive scar.

768
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,760
Is it true that Google had almost a four days regular week?

769
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:01,460
This is what you need to do.

770
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:04,920
And we spend a day literally on X10 thinking.

771
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:09,900
If you go to Mountain View, which is quite funny, they all walk around eating ice creams

772
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,440
and riding.

773
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,460
I have been there.

774
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:11,980
Bicycles.

775
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:12,619
It's a great experience.

776
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:13,460
It's crazy, isn't it?

777
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:13,920
It's a cult.

778
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:14,800
Yeah, it's a cult.

779
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,320
It's acres and acres.

780
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:19,400
23-year-olds living in absolute bliss.

781
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:21,099
You can get your hair done.

782
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,039
You can bring your washing.

783
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:23,840
Yeah.

784
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:24,900
Yeah, no, it's amazing.

785
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,159
But they're all happy to stay there overnight and work and work.

786
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,920
Or they've got buses that bring them down from San Francisco, which is, oh, that's a

787
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,099
nice perk, except that they're all wired up.

788
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:38,820
So the minute they're on the bus, they're working their butts off, but they're happy.

789
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:42,579
But yeah, no, Larry Page said in a cover story,

790
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:46,079
before Wired magazine, I live by the gospel of X10 thinking.

791
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,619
You know, it's not a bad one, one-liner.

792
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,099
Yeah.

793
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,139
But yeah, what they did.

794
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,780
So he, but this is really what sort of, you know, I won't say pisses me off, but puzzles

795
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,239
me, is that, so here's Google.

796
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,599
They do this thing, you know, this one day a week, which they call then Google time.

797
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:09,820
And they're doing, you're not literally not allowed to do your work that you were sort

798
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:10,579
of hired for.

799
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,599
You've just got to sort of play around in the space.

800
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:13,659
It's a sandpit kind of thing.

801
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:17,960
And, you know, a lot of nothing happens, a lot of messing around, or as you would expect,

802
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:19,539
a lot of false steps.

803
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,900
But you're allowed to do it and you're paid for it.

804
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,400
And then they come up with AdWords.

805
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:29,280
Now, up until then, they didn't really have a business plan for making money.

806
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:35,119
It was an academic thing for doing, for how to find, how to find information, you know,

807
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:39,099
and it was driven by their algorithms and so on, which of course in itself was useful.

808
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,699
So they had, but the AdWord engine.

809
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:46,559
Then once they saw how it worked, they moved it across then into the mainstream and developed

810
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:46,659
it.

811
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:51,860
That became the sickest, the single biggest money-making idea in history.

812
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,340
And then came them from a little academic company to, you know, changes.

813
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:00,980
It can be Apple, I think it's sort of.

814
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:02,579
Amazon, Apple, Google.

815
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:05,280
Yeah, Google as the most valuable companies in the world, you know.

816
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,920
And without that time.

817
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:07,980
Without Google time.

818
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:12,480
But the part that gets me, Luke, is why don't the other Fortune 500 companies do?

819
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,139
They do the same thing.

820
00:46:13,699 --> 00:46:16,019
It's not like it's a little kooky California idea.

821
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,880
You know, you take the most hard-known Wall Street pinstriped guy looking at that balance

822
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,699
sheet, must be impressed.

823
00:46:24,139 --> 00:46:24,940
Why don't they do it?

824
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,400
And it hasn't, it hasn't caught on.

825
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,320
Can I, can I ask the question?

826
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:27,960
Not in that way.

827
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,880
Through the lens, Michael, there'll be people listening to this that maybe have a small

828
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,619
business or, you know, 10 people in their, in their space or wanting to grow.

829
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,019
Yes.

830
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,139
I mean, practically, is it as simple as that?

831
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:42,280
Just allocate, be brave enough and say.

832
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,139
We are going to give you this amount of time.

833
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:45,539
Yeah, that's what the military do.

834
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:50,760
I mean, in it, I mean, they're, well, we did, I now realize we did learn a lot about lateral

835
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,820
thinking in the military in a very deliberate way, except they didn't call it that.

836
00:46:53,820 --> 00:47:00,320
But, but, um, but they, they've, they really invest time, hours, which is a big investment.

837
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:06,360
You know, you could be an hour doing the job or an hour being trained to do the job better.

838
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:12,139
They, most companies and startups, cause they're so flat out and undercapitalized and stuff.

839
00:47:12,139 --> 00:47:16,960
So they might do an hour a week or an hour here and there for something.

840
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:23,840
Whereas I'd say if you were doing a day minimum, cause you need to do things better and faster

841
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:29,880
and quicker than just the way you'd be doing it if you didn't learn how to do it better

842
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,840
and faster and quicker.

843
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:35,860
And that's a paradox, which few people seem to get.

844
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:40,679
I'm working with a small company now, small, it's, it's, it leads, it's a leader in its

845
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:41,960
field, but it's small.

846
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:42,019
Yeah.

847
00:47:42,019 --> 00:47:42,059
Yeah.

848
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:42,119
Yeah.

849
00:47:42,139 --> 00:47:47,760
And in terms of the number of people, about 15 and we, we were doing a semester of 10

850
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,380
masterclasses every Wednesday.

851
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,920
So we've got two more, so we've done eight already, two more to go.

852
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:57,460
And you know, um, the small company, three hours every Wednesday, that's a pretty big

853
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:04,139
investment of time, but already within the semester, they've had a number of X10 things

854
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:08,880
that have restructured the senior management and they're looking at now international,

855
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,019
they're looking at different ways to multiply the three main aspects.

856
00:48:12,019 --> 00:48:20,000
I mean, it cannot not work, but, but you would say the same thing about training and footy.

857
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:24,079
I mean, training cannot fail, but of course you might not go to training.

858
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:26,280
So if you don't go, it doesn't work.

859
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:27,579
Yeah.

860
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,739
And if you go, it works.

861
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:34,059
Well, and interestingly, I still think the biggest opportunity in professional, and that's

862
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:38,219
why you've gone into professional sport and you gave the story of a, of a gold medal in

863
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:39,820
gymnastics at the Los Angeles Olympics.

864
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,820
I know you've worked with triathletes and other athletes.

865
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:47,320
As well, that you've got some great stories to tell on that front, but at the end, once

866
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:51,400
you get physical preparation, there's small gains you can make to be fitter and stronger.

867
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:51,900
Really.

868
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,739
You might have some genetic.

869
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:53,239
That's true.

870
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,300
All the gains are in your mental capacity.

871
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:02,480
And you know, the golfer that has got a 10 foot putt for a million dollars, always capable

872
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,679
of making that putt, but how do you change your thinking to do that better?

873
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:09,280
It's still under, under understood, I reckon.

874
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,460
Well, a great example, cause we all know him.

875
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:11,900
I love him.

876
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:12,900
He's Sheeds.

877
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:17,360
She, Sheeds is a, is, um, is a terrific lateral thinker as we know.

878
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:21,719
For those who don't follow the AFL, Kevin Sheedy, uh, Michael is talking about, is a

879
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:26,380
legend in the AFL, coach Essendon for 27 years, won four premierships, is a hall of fame legend

880
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,780
of the game, was a premiership player for Richmond, but Sheeds is half crazy.

881
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:31,780
Yes.

882
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,280
Uh, you know, and I'll say that in the most endearing way.

883
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

884
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,280
No, he'd be the first to admit it.

885
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,820
He probably would because, and you know what, 10 of his ideas are the most strange thing

886
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:39,820
you'll ever hear.

887
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:40,820
Yeah.

888
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:41,820
But five of them have changed the game.

889
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,820
Yeah.

890
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:46,659
And then, and not only, and he comes up with things like the Anzac, uh, uh, game, which

891
00:49:46,659 --> 00:49:47,659
is part of our culture now.

892
00:49:47,659 --> 00:49:48,659
Completely put that on the agenda.

893
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:49,659
You know?

894
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:50,659
Yeah.

895
00:49:50,659 --> 00:49:51,659
And the, and the.

896
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:52,659
Dream time at the G as well.

897
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:53,659
Dream time.

898
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:54,659
Indigenous players.

899
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:58,139
And even international, which is crazy, but maybe one day it won't be, but anyway, but

900
00:49:58,139 --> 00:50:02,760
one of his ideas, and we, we used to give the Australian thinker of the year award and

901
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,380
we gave it to Sheeds one year.

902
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:08,820
It was a little bit nepotistic cause he and I and his brother were paper boys together.

903
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:09,820
Oh really?

904
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:10,820
Way back when.

905
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:11,820
But, um.

906
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,820
Yeah.

907
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:13,820
Yeah.

908
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:14,820
Yeah.

909
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,780
Uh, but, um, but one of Sheeds ideas, which everyone, that's nothing now, everyone does

910
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:23,559
it, but it wasn't, it wasn't when he first did it, he, he taught his players not to kick

911
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:29,159
goals, but to kick at the goals.

912
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:33,059
In other words, not like, you know, I'm trying to kick, obviously we're all trying to get

913
00:50:33,059 --> 00:50:39,539
a goal and, and, and if not a point and we don't want to go out of bounds, but, but the

914
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:40,820
paradox, the lateral ideas.

915
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:44,679
Don't worry about whether you get a goal or point out of bounds, just kick at it anytime

916
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:45,739
you can.

917
00:50:45,739 --> 00:50:51,699
So the difference is he had lots more kicks at, you know, 10 times more kicks at goals,

918
00:50:51,699 --> 00:50:56,880
10 times more out of bounds, 10 times more points and 10 times more goals.

919
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,880
And you'll see those wonderful ones that we love to watch on TV where a player's going

920
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,539
and kicks it madly over the back of his head and those lovely times when that does actually

921
00:51:04,539 --> 00:51:05,539
go through.

922
00:51:05,539 --> 00:51:09,820
Now, every coach teaches that now, but again, that was one of his innovations.

923
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:13,059
And even on that, it's, it's interesting, isn't it?

924
00:51:13,059 --> 00:51:16,239
Because you asked a professional player in that game and said, could you hit a rubbish

925
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,239
bin from 40 minutes?

926
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:21,440
They're going to, they're either going to hit it or miss, not with about 99%, you put

927
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,539
two big white poles up and call it the goal and then something crazy happens in your brain.

928
00:51:26,539 --> 00:51:31,019
And so he was brilliant at just pick out the, the, the one small thing behind the middle

929
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:32,019
and aim for that.

930
00:51:32,019 --> 00:51:34,739
If you miss it by a metre or the other side, it's, it's, it's still a goal.

931
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:37,739
And when I met him later in life, he had about 20 of Edward's books.

932
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:38,739
Really?

933
00:51:38,739 --> 00:51:39,739
Yeah.

934
00:51:39,739 --> 00:51:44,059
He had about a hundred million books, but, uh, he had a full library and, oh, and others

935
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:50,059
and not just Edwards, but his library of self-help was, as I wouldn't be surprised yours is,

936
00:51:50,059 --> 00:51:53,079
was extremely, you know, it wasn't just all made up.

937
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:58,159
The guy had spent many thousands of hours absorbing, thinking, educating himself and,

938
00:51:58,159 --> 00:51:59,159
and experimenting.

939
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:02,159
And he's been transformative in the industry that I played.

940
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:04,539
I'm, I'm interested you grew up with him, Michael.

941
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:05,539
It's amazing.

942
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:09,159
And, uh, not surprised to hear that he's a, he's a big, a big reader.

943
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:13,119
And I need to, I want to get onto the revolution in sales.

944
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:17,019
I mean, any, any one listening, you know, I think your language again, you haven't got

945
00:52:17,019 --> 00:52:18,599
a business, you haven't got a customer.

946
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:25,400
So to really, uh, acquire customers, there really hadn't been a change in that in 50

947
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,400
years.

948
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,039
Your thinking really disrupted that as well.

949
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:30,039
Can you explain how you went about that?

950
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:31,039
Okay.

951
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:34,199
Well, three, a couple, three quickie things that sort of connect the dots.

952
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:38,280
So I, so I'd been involved in sales on my family always had businesses and I grew up

953
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,119
in a sort of a.

954
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,119
Yeah.

955
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:41,119
Sort of a business environment.

956
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:45,460
I mean, they were small businesses and I was a paper boy, as I said before, you know, I

957
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,880
earned my own money and had jobs and things.

958
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:52,079
It was no big deal, but certainly I knew what customers were, you know, and I knew some

959
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:53,480
basic things.

960
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,699
And then as I got older, I did a marketing degree.

961
00:52:55,699 --> 00:52:58,400
It was doing a marketing degree at RMI too, when I got called up.

962
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,900
So that was interrupted, but I had already had a number of selling jobs, uh, of different

963
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:08,079
kinds, just mostly just to make money, you know, as you did in those days, this was a

964
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:09,079
slightly different world then.

965
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,739
So you could always get a selling job and that some of them were dodgy, like selling

966
00:53:12,739 --> 00:53:17,860
encyclopedias door to door, you know, if you were naive and believed everything they told

967
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,119
you, which I did, I just.

968
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:23,119
See, I remember the door to door encyclopedia salesman coming to our home as a kid.

969
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:24,119
I mean, but it's.

970
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:25,119
It's probably me.

971
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,119
But anyway.

972
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:29,119
You had to be good to sell encyclopedias door to door.

973
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,119
You did.

974
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:31,119
And it was, yeah, it was, yeah.

975
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:37,119
And there was a range of things from, uh, things that were not dodgy in the sense of illegal,

976
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:38,119
but not really, you know.

977
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:42,880
What you, one would want to be famous for and, and then, you know, other things are

978
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,880
actually very useful.

979
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:48,880
But, um, so the point that I make is, and I'd read various books, all the American books

980
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,619
and things that were around at the time, not motivational books, how to sell Zig Ziglar

981
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:58,199
and you know, Norman Vincent Peale and J Douglas Edwards and Tom Hopkins.

982
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:01,360
And uh, so it was a, it was a body of work that I was interested in.

983
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:06,539
So when I went to in 1974 to New York, to America, I thought, oh, America, the land

984
00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:07,539
of the salesman.

985
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:10,960
I've learned really everything about selling.

986
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,099
And I was shocked to find that they're not very good at selling at all in America, which

987
00:54:15,099 --> 00:54:20,500
was, which was a kind of strange, obviously there are exceptions and America is a very

988
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,500
big place.

989
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:25,679
So you can have a whole range of things from good to bad, but the, the difference that

990
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:31,920
I didn't realize in Australia, the majority of the population is Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide,

991
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:37,880
highly urbanized with a relatively small number of our people spread across the continent.

992
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:43,059
So people in cities, big cities like Melbourne and Sydney tend to be somewhat cynical.

993
00:54:43,059 --> 00:54:46,980
Their default position is no rather than yes.

994
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:51,119
And it's quite, therefore, in a sense, more difficult to sell to, and you've got to be

995
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,500
sort of better at it.

996
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,239
In America, it's the other way around.

997
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:57,539
New York, Chicago, LA are the minority in America.

998
00:54:57,539 --> 00:55:03,019
The vast 300 million people in America live in tiny little towns spread out where we've

999
00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:04,019
got desert.

1000
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:05,500
They've just got town after town after town.

1001
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,960
And if you drive down the main street of the town and look at it, there's a lot of people,

1002
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,960
there's a lot of people.

1003
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:08,000
Yeah.

1004
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,119
Yeah.

1005
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:10,960
There's a lot of people with the big signs that are up and they're all one, you know,

1006
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,619
they're all variations of hamburgers.

1007
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:13,619
Yeah.

1008
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:20,280
And if you go to, you know, some, I'm not being mean, but if you go to a place in one

1009
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,360
of these towns and say, I'd like to have some Thai food, they look at you.

1010
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,559
Now, this was in 1980, it's probably quite different now.

1011
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,679
But they call them here in, you know, even in America, they call them the flyover states

1012
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:32,679
really.

1013
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:33,679
Yeah.

1014
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:34,679
Yeah.

1015
00:55:34,679 --> 00:55:35,679
Because everyone flies over them to land in New York.

1016
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,679
Exactly.

1017
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:37,679
And, and go and visit.

1018
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:37,960
So.

1019
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,000
And then you go to LA, you know, you can get a different impression.

1020
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,300
Not many Australians have been to outback Alabama or, you know, downtown.

1021
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,300
Exactly.

1022
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,300
Somewhere in the deep south, have they?

1023
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,300
It's not.

1024
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,300
No.

1025
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:52,840
And so it can be quite interesting and there's a lot to, to, to find interesting there.

1026
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:58,039
But, but what I'm, the point is that their tastes, their TV programs, their fashions,

1027
00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:03,659
the clothes that they wear, the tastes, and a lot of there's a whole, you know, a much

1028
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:06,340
different kind of religious profile in America.

1029
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:07,840
I was once giving a, by the way, I was giving a lecture in New York.

1030
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:12,719
I was giving a talk at Lanier Office Systems in Atlanta.

1031
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:17,639
And just before I came on the press and got up and said, and now, if we bow our heads

1032
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:21,679
and said a little prayer that for God to tame our customers.

1033
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:27,260
And now Dr. Michael Hewitt said, what do I say now?

1034
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,260
So that was my experience.

1035
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,260
It's God-fearing territory, isn't it?

1036
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,260
That part of the world.

1037
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,260
Yeah.

1038
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:36,179
I mean, that was then, you know, this is now, but the point is that we, there are issues

1039
00:56:36,179 --> 00:56:37,179
there.

1040
00:56:37,179 --> 00:56:38,179
But you can find easy, the best in the, the best in the world there.

1041
00:56:38,179 --> 00:56:39,179
So does that make it easier to sell in those places or is that the point?

1042
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:46,840
Well, if the default position is yes, then in a sense, you don't have to be as good a

1043
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:52,559
sales person when they're inclined to say yes and they, and they're consumer society

1044
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,079
and they have, you know, income as they did in those days.

1045
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:02,260
So I've found that, and also, also, also there were a lot of problems with that, with the

1046
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:06,980
way they were selling it, closing the sale and the behavior of salespeople and so on.

1047
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:13,619
And, and so my examiner for my PhD was Professor George Gallup, who, who invented market research

1048
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:17,739
and the Gallup poll, you know, actually measuring the opinions of people.

1049
00:57:17,739 --> 00:57:18,739
Amazing story.

1050
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:22,920
I need to talk to you about as well, I want to talk to you about the, he's meant, you

1051
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,059
know, the George Gallup extraordinary change in the landscape, the Gallup poll, people

1052
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:28,059
understand that.

1053
00:57:28,059 --> 00:57:29,059
Yeah, the Gallup poll.

1054
00:57:29,059 --> 00:57:30,059
Got to come back to that.

1055
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:31,059
Yeah.

1056
00:57:31,059 --> 00:57:33,860
So he, he, in a Gallup poll he did every year and they still do it.

1057
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:36,780
And I think Reader's Digest does like a similar one.

1058
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:41,699
But every June I followed this, I mean, pretty much, I sort of probably haven't followed

1059
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:46,119
it lately because I know what it's going to be, but I followed it easily for 35 years

1060
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:51,019
when I was, you know, very out there doing everything and they asked the American people

1061
00:57:51,019 --> 00:57:56,900
to rate how they feel about the various professions in terms of, you know, ethics and trust and

1062
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:57,900
so on.

1063
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:04,300
For 35 years in a row, not like some of the time, but in a row, have a guess where they

1064
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,539
rated the selling profession.

1065
00:58:05,539 --> 00:58:06,539
At the very bottom.

1066
00:58:06,539 --> 00:58:07,539
At the bottom.

1067
00:58:07,539 --> 00:58:08,539
Yeah.

1068
00:58:08,539 --> 00:58:13,780
Now here's a profession that can't even sell its own profession to its people, let alone

1069
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,780
the product or services.

1070
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:20,420
So, so the, and there's my favorite, which I was, you know, if talks like this, you can

1071
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:24,860
just sort of hear I'm on my soapbox now, but one of the ones I did recently a few years

1072
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:30,039
ago was they were all Australia, CEOs of Australian insurance companies and a company had brought

1073
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:34,460
them all together in Tokyo for a conference and I was, I had them actually for a whole

1074
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:35,460
day, which is.

1075
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,460
Well, good for me.

1076
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,460
Not so good for them.

1077
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:43,099
But anyway, I showed them one of my favorite clips and it's a little clip from a Woody

1078
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:44,099
Allen movie.

1079
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:49,219
And Woody Allen's in a sort of a labor camp in Georgia and the narrator's saying, well,

1080
00:58:49,219 --> 00:58:53,699
he's, he's in handcuffs and he's being led to this thing where they open the flap and

1081
00:58:53,699 --> 00:58:58,860
he goes down into the ground, you know, a sweat box and the narrator's saying, and Virgil

1082
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,460
has been very bad.

1083
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:04,460
He's been sentenced to 30 days in solitary confinement with an insurance salesman.

1084
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:05,460
Yeah.

1085
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:09,719
Oh, we can get you double indemnity with a special thing.

1086
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:10,719
And of course everyone laughed.

1087
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:12,340
There was a sense of humor at an insurance conference.

1088
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,340
They, they got the humor.

1089
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,340
They all laughed.

1090
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:15,340
Yeah.

1091
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,079
And so I yelled and said, why are you laughing?

1092
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:19,079
This is your industry.

1093
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:20,079
Yeah.

1094
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:24,960
And you know, fast forward, the Haynes commission, they've practically been legislated out of

1095
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:25,960
business.

1096
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:32,019
So, so the, um, the selling methods that they were being using and teaching didn't give

1097
00:59:32,019 --> 00:59:34,099
them a great reputation.

1098
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:35,099
Yeah.

1099
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:38,579
They were being used with their customers and much needs to be done about that.

1100
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:43,820
Now, now to do something about that, you would need to have something like, well, other parts

1101
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,599
of business, an R and D department.

1102
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:53,000
I have never found one company in America, but to be fair anywhere that has an R and

1103
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,639
D department in its sales division.

1104
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:57,860
In other words, it says, oh, there's something we could learn about selling.

1105
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:58,860
Yeah.

1106
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:03,099
So let's have a budget and do experiments and learn.

1107
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,099
So I did my PhD.

1108
01:00:04,099 --> 01:00:05,099
Yeah.

1109
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:09,920
I, my, it was in natural thinking, but I had to choose a topic.

1110
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,440
So all I said was, well, I looked, you have to look at all of the work on the topic and

1111
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,960
all of the work said, close the sale, salesman closes the sale, the trainer trains them to

1112
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:19,960
close the sale.

1113
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:24,440
The manager says, when they come back from meeting, did you close the sale, you know,

1114
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,239
and they get rewarded for closing the sale.

1115
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:32,219
So that in other words, is the theory of selling in America that the salesman closes the sale,

1116
01:00:32,219 --> 01:00:33,860
but that's getting these terrible results.

1117
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:34,860
Yeah.

1118
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:39,960
So we switched, what if we switch it to the start of the sale, not the close.

1119
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,000
And when we did that, it's so often went up by a factor of 10 that after a while I became

1120
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
confident saying you could multiply your business by 10.

1121
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,539
And we now do that as just as a main thing, get the people to focus on making calls.

1122
01:00:53,539 --> 01:00:59,260
In other words, customer context, the start of the sale and let the customer do the close.

1123
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:02,679
Now that's not so earth shattering now, but it was in, in America in 1980.

1124
01:01:02,679 --> 01:01:03,679
1974.

1125
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:04,679
Yeah.

1126
01:01:04,679 --> 01:01:08,699
So you did your PhD and came up with that idea, but it's still, I think, you know, you,

1127
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:13,300
you referenced a lot of people, uh, nervous to make the call because you know, no is going

1128
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,900
to happen pretty regularly, particularly here in Australia.

1129
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:22,199
But your advice is to say, well, you're better off getting that, make 10 calls, get 10 no's,

1130
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:25,860
then understand why, and you just move through that a lot more quickly.

1131
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,559
And that should be the metric that we.

1132
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:29,800
Well, it'd be like a coaching footy.

1133
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:34,480
Um, basically it's intelligent behavior to do what your boss tells you to do.

1134
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:39,159
You know, if you want to get paid, so, so if your boss, if every time you leave the office

1135
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:42,500
and make a sales call, you know, that's that activity of selling.

1136
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:46,579
So, you know, you go and you come back and your boss says, did you get the sale?

1137
01:01:46,579 --> 01:01:51,920
You could be forgiven after a while for thinking if you're a young person, oh, my job is, and

1138
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:56,679
that, then that leads to all the kinds of behavior that people don't like.

1139
01:01:56,679 --> 01:02:02,940
So we, we, what we've done in many corporations, we divide your sales force randomly, you may

1140
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:03,940
be odd.

1141
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:07,059
But you see people keep one group on what you're currently doing.

1142
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:08,639
Did you get the sale?

1143
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:13,000
And put the other group on where the sales manager says, did you, did you start the,

1144
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,119
you know, did you make a call and then measure the results in one business quarter and see

1145
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:18,380
what happens.

1146
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:20,920
And you've done that data at it, at it?

1147
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,099
Just, you know, times, hundreds of times.

1148
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:24,099
Yeah.

1149
01:02:24,099 --> 01:02:28,219
And because what happens is the main we're we're businesses fail.

1150
01:02:28,219 --> 01:02:31,739
It's as you point out, you get more no's and yeses.

1151
01:02:31,739 --> 01:02:32,739
So.

1152
01:02:32,739 --> 01:02:33,699
If you only focus on the.

1153
01:02:33,699 --> 01:02:33,860
Yeses.

1154
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:37,380
and you make people feel bad about the names, the no's,

1155
01:02:37,539 --> 01:02:38,559
same as in a classroom,

1156
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,860
if you reward the one who gets the right answer

1157
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:44,260
and the ones that don't feel in some way punished,

1158
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,179
they'll stop having a go.

1159
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:46,599
Yeah.

1160
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:49,320
And so you can be busy, you know, doing, you know,

1161
01:02:50,119 --> 01:02:52,840
all sorts of things that look busy

1162
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,300
but actually don't involve talking to a customer.

1163
01:02:56,059 --> 01:02:58,599
And so what does customer context go down?

1164
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,500
And if customer context, you're out of business.

1165
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:01,880
Yeah.

1166
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,639
So what happens is the ones that don't have to worry

1167
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:07,539
about closing the sale make more calls.

1168
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:10,400
If you make more calls, it's the Sheeds thing.

1169
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,760
They get more no's, but they get more yes's.

1170
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:17,659
It flicks the switch immediately, doesn't it?

1171
01:03:18,659 --> 01:03:20,679
There are other aspects, but that's the main,

1172
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,260
that's what I got the PhD for in lateral thinking.

1173
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:28,190
