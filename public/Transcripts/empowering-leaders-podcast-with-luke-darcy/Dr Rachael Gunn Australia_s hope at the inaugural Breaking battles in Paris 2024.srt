1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
It's so exciting. I'm so excited for the world to see what breakers can do. You know, the last time

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,580
people had this level of exposure of breaking was in the early 1980s, all those, you know,

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,559
retro films and video clips. But yeah, you're right. Everyone thought that breaking died.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,800
The fad of breaking was over. What's happened in all those years in between?

5
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:24,760
What happened was that it went underground.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:49,679
A really fascinating guest on the Empowering Ladies podcast this week is Rachel Gunn,

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,960
Australia's representative in the sport of breaking or breakdancing, as it was formerly

8
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,560
known as we head into its inaugural debut at the Paris Olympics. It is a brilliant story of passion

9
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:07,560
and perseverance. You hear her love for her community, passion for a sport very few of us

10
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,079
know anything about, and wanting to carve a path for women in an incredibly male-dominated sport.

11
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:18,280
It's a story that I think you're really going to enjoy. The fact that Rachel works as a university

12
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,819
professor, lecturing as her day job, gives you a bit of insight into the determination and

13
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:29,060
discipline of our next guest. Rachel Gunn is exactly the type of person who inspires the

14
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,700
work we do at Alita. Head to alitacollective.com. Our Alita Connect program brings together people

15
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,340
in groups of five to six from around the globe from unique and diverse backgrounds,

16
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,079
a bit like Rachel Gunn. And you don't have to necessarily be an Olympian,

17
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:46,920
to be part of Alita Connect. We'd love you to check it out. Book a discovery call today.

18
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,560
Huge thanks as always to Jason Nicholas and his team from Temper Bedding. Great athletes,

19
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,239
great performers understand the need for quality sleep, and investing in a mattress like Temper,

20
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,480
NASA designed and approved, is an investment that will change your life.

21
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,819
Rachel Gunn works as a professor at Sydney's Macquarie University, lecturing in the Department

22
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:12,740
of Media, Communications, Creative Arts, and Language. It's an impressive day job for someone

23
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:19,280
about to represent Australia in the Paris Olympics in the inaugural breaking competition. Breaking

24
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,840
or break dancing is a style of dance that emerged from the hip hop culture in the United States in

25
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,599
the 1970s. The Paris Olympics, 16 B boys, 16 B girls will go face to face in solo battles

26
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:38,800
in the open area of the Concorde in central Paris, not far from the Louvre, amazing location,

27
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,020
and is expected to be one of the most sought after tickets with MCs hyping the,

28
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:48,800
crowd, and DJs a vital part of the breaking competition. Rachel, it's great to meet you.

29
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,360
So great to be on here. Thanks, Luke.

30
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,939
Now I'll look back at the Tokyo Olympics, and for me, Rachel, the introduction of skateboarding,

31
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:01,580
BMX, and surfing was the highlight of the Tokyo Olympic Games. What does it mean

32
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,439
to have your world, your chosen passion, to now be an Olympic event?

33
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:13,000
It's so exciting. I'm so excited for the world to see what breakers can do,

34
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,000
you know, the last time people had this level of exposure of breaking was in the early 1980s,

35
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:26,439
all those, you know, retro films and video clips, and it has just continued to grow and evolve and

36
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:32,419
develop, and now to get the opportunity on the world's biggest stage at the Olympics to show

37
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:37,159
what breakers can do, I'm just so excited to be a part of it. And I've got to put my hand up,

38
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,979
Rachel, and say my last memory was probably around those hip hop clips in the early 80s,

39
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,960
that that was just a fad that had disappeared. For it to now pop up in the Olympic Games has put

40
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,580
it on all of our radars. Can you go back and explain the origins of breaking and break dancing

41
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,539
and how it's got so successful that the Olympic movement wanted it as an Olympic event?

42
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:05,580
Yeah, so, you know, it started in the Bronx in the 70s, African-American, Puerto Rican kids,

43
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:11,900
community jams, house parties, finding new ways to express themselves in what was predominantly

44
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,879
a very disco,

45
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:19,000
era. So you had the development of hip hop culture in this setting, the MC, the DJ,

46
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:27,660
the graffiti writers, and the breakers who were drawn to this breakdown of the music that the

47
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:35,240
DJs would then start to extend and start to use to records to extend it even longer. Fast forward,

48
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,579
of course, to the early 1980s, everyone's familiar with that global explosion of breaking. But yeah,

49
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:43,000
you're right. Everyone thought that,

50
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:48,439
breaking died, the fad of breaking was over, you know, what's what's happened in all those years

51
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:56,939
in between. And what happened was that it went underground. So the diehard few that were left

52
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:04,620
in the cities, and I mean, like few, you know, I've spoken to Mystery, who is a old school hip

53
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,439
hopper, breaker, graffiti writer, and he was telling me how, you know, schools went from having

54
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,540
multiple crews in every school,

55
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:18,060
to there was just one crew in all of Sydney, superstars. And, you know, he could name the

56
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,819
other crews in Melbourne and in Queensland, and a couple of guys in Perth. And they would just stay

57
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:32,000
in contact through letter writing, graffiti magazines, Australia has a great reputation for

58
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,100
creating some awesome hip hop magazines that traveled around the world. People traveling,

59
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,660
of course, and VHS tapes, training tapes. And that's really where Australia first started making

60
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,000
their name.

61
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:48,019
With the B-Boy All Stars from Queensland. And, you know, this wasn't just in Australia. This was all

62
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:56,019
around the world, you know, the UK, Italy, South Africa, Germany, LA, you know, there was these

63
00:05:56,019 --> 00:06:01,800
hip hop enthusiasts kept the culture kept the form alive and kept innovating. And then when we get to

64
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,360
the early 90s, that's when we start to see big, large scale competitions reintroduced. And it's

65
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,920
just continued to build from there. You're introduced to it, I understand in your 20s by

66
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,000
your partner, who's,

67
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:20,180
now your coach. Tell us about that dynamic going into an event like this, having your life partner

68
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,279
as your coach. How does that play out for you? Yeah, look, it's so special that we get to

69
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:32,160
experience this together. I mean, Sammy has taught me since day one. He's been teaching me breaking

70
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,439
for like 12 years. So I wouldn't want anyone else by my side. But it is, you know, sometimes a tough

71
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,000
dynamic. You know, we are married, and sometimes we have to clarify things. And I think that's

72
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:47,819
one of the things that we have to clarify between if he's talking to me as my husband or as my coach.

73
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,839
But we've gotten pretty good at having those conversations. And yeah, it's so special that

74
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,720
we get to experience this together. And I think we're also fascinated with

75
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,500
your story, Rachel, because I don't imagine too many university professors are Olympians

76
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,100
or break dancers. You know, when you walk on the campus at Macquarie University, and

77
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,480
you're about to take a lecture, how's the academic world viewed?

78
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:20,680
Yeah, look, I mean, it depends what part of the academic world, I'm sure. But fortunately,

79
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,819
you know, I'm surrounded by arts academics, be it, you know, dance scholars or popular music scholars.

80
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,459
And my colleagues do really awesome things. They're in heavy metal bands, you know, they're

81
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:38,660
composers, they're, you know, do their own dance shows. So, you know, I'm really lucky to be among

82
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,000
such an awesome group of creative practice-based people. And I think it's really important that we

83
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:43,959
get to know each other. And I think it's really important that we get to know each other. And I think

84
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,300
it's really important that we get to know each other. And I think it's really important that we get to know each other.

85
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:51,060
So it's, yeah, it's, you know, but I don't think there are many other, or many other lecturer

86
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,980
breakers. But there are, you know, there are other people that have done their PhD on breaking, but

87
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:01,620
maybe, maybe did it around the other way, started breaking and then did their PhD. Not,

88
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,019
not the way that I've chosen.

89
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,100
One of my other favorite things when the Olympics rolls around is that we all of a sudden all

90
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,000
become experts in these sports that we know nothing about. And we start to, you know, we're

91
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:17,959
become judges of the 10 meter diving and we, oh, that was an over-rotation or I've suddenly

92
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:23,079
got an opinion on modern pentathlon that I know nothing about. For us, when we watch you perform

93
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:27,660
and compete, how are we going to know that it's a good performance? What's, what's something to

94
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,580
look out for? Oh, yeah. Good question. Okay. Because, so, I mean, I'll tell you what the

95
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,720
judges are looking at and then I'll, then I'll translate it a little bit. So the judges are

96
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,080
comparing you against your opponent. It's a comparative judging system. So you've just got

97
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:49,480
who your favorite is, who you're enjoying watching more. They're looking at execution,

98
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:59,899
technique, vocabulary, so range and repertoire of moves, originality. So what new things you're

99
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:03,460
bringing, which is probably a harder thing for audiences at home to watch, but maybe,

100
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:09,820
but also spontaneity is an important aspect of it and musicality. So particularly how you're

101
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,860
responding to music that you're hearing for the first time. So what people at home can look at is

102
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:23,019
things like how the breaker maybe is using the floor, you know, if there are travels,

103
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,639
if they're confident, how they're responding to key points in the music, how they're engaging

104
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:37,039
with their opponent, the perceived difficulty of their moves, the perceived artistry of their moves,

105
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,659
the form, the flow,

106
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:45,480
the lines, the shapes that they're making, the different rhythms that they're performing,

107
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,440
you know, so these sorts of things that, that people can keep in mind. And, and, you know,

108
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,080
once they've watched a few battles, they'll be able to see maybe how the judges are voting and

109
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,919
things like that. But it's, it takes a long time to pick up on all the details of what breakers

110
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:04,840
are doing. And, and of course, you know, the range of what they're doing. So if they're doing just

111
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:09,039
headspins every round, then maybe they're a little bit limited and,

112
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:09,799
and you should think,

113
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,759
what the other person is doing as well.

114
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:19,100
And I read that trash talking is a legitimate part of this event. That's fascinating to me.

115
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:23,379
We've got the Olympic code. I mean, how far can you take trash talking? And is that,

116
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:24,460
is that part of your repertoire?

117
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:31,440
Yeah, look, I love a bit of trash talking. I can't help it. But yeah, look, you are going to have to

118
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,080
be, you know, the Olympics is a different stage. It's different stakes. So you are going to have

119
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,700
to be a bit more respectful, you know, really show that, that, um,

120
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,940
sportsmanship in that competition. So there are ways to get around it. And what you'll probably

121
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:51,980
see the breakers do instead of talking is doing a lot of hand actions. So, you know, if a breaker

122
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:57,379
messes up their move, what they'll probably do is they'll hit the floor. Like the, the opponent

123
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:02,500
who's calling them out on it will hit the floor, or maybe they'll do this, this hand signal,

124
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,500
which shows like, I saw that you thought you got away with that, but you didn't hit that properly.

125
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,679
Or if they're saying, if they're,

126
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,159
they're noticing that they're repeating movements because you shouldn't be repeating

127
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:18,179
movements, you know, they might count or they might be like, oh my gosh, how many times have

128
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:23,080
you done this? You know? So there'll be little hand actions that they're doing as well, which,

129
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:28,740
which can, you know, still get through to the opponent, but it's less kind of, you know,

130
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,620
intrusive.

131
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:36,399
It's intriguing. What a, what a fascinating, uh, sport for us to all understand. And, and

132
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,659
you recently won a sports person of the world.

133
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:45,559
The year award. And I listened to your speech in the last 24 hours and almost just the joy of

134
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:50,519
saying, Hey, you know, this world of breaking, which very few people know about is suddenly

135
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:56,139
you got this legitimacy. Is that how it felt for you? Yeah, absolutely. I think, I think many

136
00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:04,679
people, yeah, misunderstand breakers. I think the, the level of dedication and hard work that

137
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:09,659
it takes to get good at breaking, you know, many people, many breakers in Australia have had to,

138
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:16,000
to put, you know, their studies or their careers or other things on hold to try and really excel

139
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
in this sport, in this dance. And also at the same time where their families are like,

140
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,500
what the hell are you doing? Why are you still dancing? You know, like, can't you move on with

141
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:36,139
your life? So it's, but suddenly now it's in the Olympics. There's a whole new level of support

142
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:39,259
and legitimacy that comes with that.

143
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:45,019
Certainly families and friends are asking how training's going, asking about, you know,

144
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:52,539
your preparation. And so, you know, the, we as breakers always see breaking as legitimate,

145
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:57,360
but it is definitely Olympics has made it legitimate for all the people around us. And

146
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,279
it's important because that's opened doors for us, you know, doors that were previously closed,

147
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:07,600
that people disregarded us, you know, be that in the sporting world, be that in the artistic world,

148
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,519
be that at community halls, because they thought,

149
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:15,600
we're going to ruin the floor, you know? So it's just a really important moment for us to try and

150
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,980
get the story, our story of breaking out there. And as I mentioned in the intro to be literally

151
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:27,940
in central Paris, you know, with the famous Louvre and all of the history of Paris and not far from

152
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:33,860
the Eiffel Tower to have DJs and MCs and just see, this is going to be something that people

153
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,340
will be desperate to get around and get involved in. It couldn't be a better platform, could it?

154
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,960
Yeah. I mean, the, the, the location of it is absolutely amazing. I, I was in Paris earlier

155
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,740
this year and I saw them building all the venues and, you know, the Arc de Triomphe is just down

156
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:55,000
the road and it's just like phenomenal. It's just in the middle of Paris and this, this amazing,

157
00:13:55,179 --> 00:14:00,100
beautiful urban environment. And, you know, the tickets, every time they release tickets,

158
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,240
they sell out so fast. I mean, the men's have totally sold out. I think the women's have just

159
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,519
about sold out now too. So, you know, everyone's that like, Oh yeah, this breaking.

160
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,759
Well, I tell you what, it is popular. They couldn't get more seats in. So yeah.

161
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,419
That's why I love that the skateboarding at Tokyo was your 13 year olds winning Olympic gold

162
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:25,799
medalists, uh, becoming Olympic gold medalists and, and just seeing the, suddenly the, the passion

163
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,220
and the skill of a sport that maybe a lot of people had dismissed in the past. Uh, we have

164
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,080
this saying, Rachel, that success leaves clues. And I love talking to people from different

165
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,659
backgrounds about their story. And for you to have the dedication to do a PhD, you know,

166
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,940
in the creative world, to have that overlaid now with something that you, as you said,

167
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,820
you must've had your family and people saying, what are you still doing? Why is this still

168
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,440
happening? And we, and we think that it's hard to have a leadership without this idea of self

169
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,299
leadership first. Does that ring true to you in, in your world and the way that you've gone about

170
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:04,539
it? Yeah, look, absolutely. It's, it's really been tough for a long time. I think I've always

171
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:09,659
kind of been seen as, as a bit of a weirdo for what I'm deciding to spend my time on,

172
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:15,100
build my career on. Like, why is she doing a PhD on that? Why is she spending her nights,

173
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:20,639
you know, out in front of some local courthouse break dancing, you know, with all these guys,

174
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:28,080
like, what is she doing with her life? But, you know, I, I knew that this was important. I knew

175
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,779
that there was something here and I've just had to keep, you know, working and building at it.

176
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:39,159
And now people are finally starting to understand. So you've got to have faith in what you're doing.

177
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:45,620
You've got to have, um, that passion, that belief. And, you know, even if it didn't get to

178
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,600
this point, I would still be doing breaking. I would still be researching. I would still be

179
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,799
competing. Um, so I'm so fortunate that I've had this Olympic opportunity. Um, but yeah,

180
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:59,399
you really do need that self leadership. It's so important. It's a great story of perseverance,

181
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,899
your story. And we see people like you are really conscious of the impact they have on others. And

182
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:09,139
there's going to be now a young generation of people that this is their thing,

183
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:13,179
that maybe would have given it away. I'm, I'm assuming, has that been something you've

184
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:17,279
been conscious of that impact that you can have on, on others around you in the next generation?

185
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:25,059
Look, totally. I'm, I'm so hopeful and excited to inspire the next generation. And that's always

186
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:30,460
been something that's really conscious for me because the thing, so when I started breaking,

187
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:35,240
you know, I was with my partner and all his mates and it was, you know, a bunch of guys

188
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,139
training in a PCYC, you know, doing flips and stuff like that.

189
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:45,259
And I was like, what is this world? What is this space? You know, it felt so uncomfortable at the

190
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:52,039
beginning. And, um, I'd been to some jams and it was so, so maldominated, you know, and, and so for

191
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:57,779
so long, I didn't think that women could break, you know, my partner had showed me clips online

192
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:03,200
and stuff, but it just couldn't connect to it. And it wasn't until I went to a big event,

193
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,779
the Australian B-Boy Championships, you know, B-Boy was a term for all the dancers back in the day.

194
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,720
Um, B-Boying was a term for all the dancers. So I went along and, and they did actually have a

195
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,200
B-Girl, um, category. And I saw a girl in person break for the first time. And it wasn't just in

196
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,960
the competition. It was just in the ciphers, in the circles before the jam started. And it just,

197
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:31,200
I was totally blown away. I was totally inspired, you know, her getting down in this circle with

198
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,920
all these guys around, totally intimidating. And they just nodded their head as she was doing her

199
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,140
thing. They gave her a clap. They gave her some, you know, a little bit of a, you know, a little

200
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,380
props and she just got up, you know, like it was no big deal. And it just totally put me on a

201
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,920
different path. And so from that moment on, I was like, all right, I'm going to train really hard

202
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:54,799
and I'm going to enter every battle that I can. And I did, I, you know, entered every battle that

203
00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:00,240
came up. And sometimes that was being the only woman at an event because we didn't have enough

204
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,400
B-Girls to have our own B-Girl category in a local jam or sometimes even in a national jam.

205
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,119
So, you know, one time I entered a Red Bull BC1 and there,

206
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:16,839
there was like 50 or 60 B-Boys and me, you know, but I felt like if there was a girl in the crowd

207
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:22,240
or someone in the crowd that saw me and be, they could be inspired to break, I could inspire the

208
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,339
next generation. And so I'm just taking, you know, that is a continuation. The Olympics is

209
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:32,859
now a continuation of that thinking of trying to inspire the next generation through representing

210
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:38,059
myself. I don't dance the way that the most of the other B-Girls that have qualified dance.

211
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:44,559
They do a lot of power and freezes, whereas my specialty is style and creativity. And so I'm

212
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,980
going out there representing the dancers and representing the people that, that choose a

213
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:54,859
different path and dare to do things a little bit differently. So, you know, it's, it is really

214
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:59,599
important to me. Well, it's another ceiling that's been broken through that a lot of us didn't even

215
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:05,880
know about and, and great congratulations again to you. You do a PhD then at the intersection of

216
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,380
breaking and gender.

217
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:12,380
I'm assuming that's a topic that hadn't been covered before, but now, as you said,

218
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,960
you've gone through to take this to an Olympic games. It's a vision that you had, and you've

219
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,859
been able to, I suppose, be fulfilled by it. Can you tell us how you went about that? As you said,

220
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,400
you must've had some people raising their eyebrows at the start with your, with your PhD. How did

221
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:36,980
you go about sharing that vision? Yeah, look, my, my PhD, oh goodness. That was one of the

222
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,039
hardest things I did. I did a PhD, I did a PhD, I did a PhD, I did a PhD, I did a PhD, I did a PhD,

223
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:43,079
until this year. I think this is one of the hardest things I've ever done now. Um, but it,

224
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,859
the PhD was something that, you know, the, the topic continues to evolve and change over the

225
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:53,519
years because you are researching, um, and you're finding out more as you go. And, you know, while

226
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,900
all my previous studies, I'd been interested in youth cultures and music subcultures and things

227
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,920
like that. I was starting to learn breaking at the same time. And I, you know, there wasn't much

228
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,779
research on breaking and my experience.

229
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:12,819
So breaking my knowledge of breaking, you know, gender just became, was so important because it

230
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:19,579
was so male dominated. And, you know, in Australia, guys dancing isn't the most masculine thing

231
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:26,460
normally, but yet in breaking, it was, they're so masculine. They're so in your face with that

232
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:32,059
masculinity. And so that's kind of what inspired me to, to start thinking about gender performance.

233
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:37,240
And then, you know, as I'm learning breaking totally in the minority as a woman learning

234
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,680
breaking.

235
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:44,680
My body's changing, my way of moving is changing. I'm doing different kinds of actions and things

236
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,819
and people are starting to go, yeah, but are you sure you, you don't really want to get big

237
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:55,400
muscles though, do you? And can't you do something a bit more feminine and all girls can't do those

238
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:02,019
moves. And so just gender became so important in, in everything that, um, that I was experiencing.

239
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:07,920
It was there. Anytime I went out, I wasn't just representing me. I was representing all B girls.

240
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:13,380
I was constantly being judged against all women. And these are really common concerns for, for all

241
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:19,519
women in sport, you know? So it just became a topic through which I could explore broader

242
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:24,759
questions around gender politics, gender performance and identity within the Australian

243
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:32,440
context. So, you know, it, it's, I think. Yeah, it's been really interesting, but it also helped

244
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:38,019
me understand how to grow the, the B girl scene in, in Australia and in Sydney. And, you know,

245
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:43,099
we've got tons of B girls in Sydney now. It's amazing. So, you know, that's not saying that's

246
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:46,640
all because of me, you know, there's a, there's a few people that have been really key in helping

247
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,579
to grow that, but it's definitely helped to kind of understand those motivations and those barriers

248
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:57,940
to women's involvement. And maybe in a, in a, an addition to that, the, the success of the

249
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:04,339
Matildas, for example, having record ratings, uh, the numbers speak for themselves, investment in

250
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:07,660
female sporting teams in the U S in particular are becoming

251
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:13,779
commercial successes. So there is zero tokenism at all. The, the actual finances are following

252
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:19,940
through something that you obviously saw as a, as a huge challenge previously, but the success of

253
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:27,180
the AFLW here locally has been overwhelming. So it must fill you with a lot of joy now to see that

254
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:33,920
a lot of these challenges are being met head on. It's fantastic to be part of this new environment

255
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,940
where, where people are excited about women's sports. I mean, yeah,

256
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:43,900
the Matildas, you know, watching Caitlin Clark in the U S as well, an amazing, amazing female

257
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:49,079
basketball player. Um, and it's, it's just so exciting and it, and it's great to see that,

258
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:55,740
you know, once we've given women's sport a chance in terms of, you know, having, having the airtime

259
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:02,539
or, you know, um, building those audiences, the audiences are there tenfold, you know,

260
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:06,880
people are really, really excited. You know, I love watching the women's state of origin. Like

261
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:14,200
fantastic. And so I've, I feel really, um, fortunate to be able to be coming up in a time

262
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,039
where people are excited about women's sport. Um, and I know that, you know, there's a lot of women

263
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:24,420
over the years who have done a lot of work to help get us here. Um, and you know, I'm so grateful

264
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:30,000
for that, but it's, it's such an exciting time now for women's sport. Rachel curiosity is a word

265
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,619
that we hear a lot in this world that people who do things like you have and break a new ground

266
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:37,619
are incredibly curious. Is that something?

267
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:46,220
Totally. Totally. Yeah. I, and I really like challenging myself and, and particularly

268
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:52,700
it seems challenging myself in areas that I'm not naturally gifted, like, which is kind of,

269
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:58,019
which is, you know, it took me a long time to even start breaking. I don't have the upper body

270
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:03,480
strength that others, I don't have a gymnastics background. You know, I was a decent student at

271
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,819
school, but then I got really, I get passionate about things and I work really, really hard.

272
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:16,279
Um, so, but, but curiosity and, and with curiosity, it's about being, having the courage

273
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:24,980
to follow a new path, um, is so important. Uh, and I think I was, I'm so curious about breaking.

274
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:29,859
I'm so curious about everything to do with breaking and it just keeps inspiring, you know,

275
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:37,940
the next moves or my next training, or it inspires my next article or my next research project.

276
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:42,000
Thinking about these different aspects of breaking, you know, why people

277
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,859
think a certain way, why people, you know, train a certain way or why, um, you know, we,

278
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:54,259
I don't know, you know, different, all these different sides of breaking. So yeah,

279
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,779
curiosity is just so important.

280
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,740
Rachel, you've become a great ambassador for your world and you communicate the story

281
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,779
beautifully. And I've seen you on a number of different platforms. How have you gone about

282
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:07,980
that? Is that something that you've.

283
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,180
Really thought about the way you've been able to communicate your world?

284
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:18,299
Um, I, it's so important for me to use this opportunity to, to communicate, to translate

285
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:24,640
breaking to as big an audience as possible, because this is such a unique moment. And also

286
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,099
the, as a breaking, as part of the breaking community, you know, we learned a lot of lessons

287
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:35,720
from the early 1980s. There was not enough of an emphasis on what this dance and culture was about

288
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,940
the term break dancing being used.

289
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:42,420
And I think that is, is, is an example of that. You know, it was used to describe a few different

290
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:48,200
dance styles and didn't really take into account the whole culture behind breaking. So this is such

291
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,480
an important opportunity for us, you know, with the visibility, we want to have the explanation

292
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,299
that goes alongside it of, this is a culture. This is a culture that started in the States,

293
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:04,460
African-American and Puerto Rican kids. But we've also had a scene here in Australia since the late

294
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:11,559
1970s, you know, there's many, what we call OGs, you know, like, um, around still that would be

295
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:17,420
able to tell some amazing stories of what the scene was like in Sydney or Perth or, you know,

296
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:24,359
Melbourne, et cetera. So it's, it's really important to use this opportunity to communicate

297
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:29,559
what I think are the, the really important aspects of breaking at this time. Yeah.

298
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:33,619
Right. You mentioned earlier that you're turning up to competitions, this

299
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:34,440
50, 60, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50,

300
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:39,819
males, you know, fully masculine and putting it out there. You're the sole female that

301
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:45,339
takes a fair bit of courage, but I'm assuming collaboration has been a big part of how you've

302
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:50,359
been able to work your way through this. How important is the collaboration part been for you?

303
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:57,099
Uh, it's, it's totally important. Breaking is a social dance as well as a competitive dance.

304
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,599
Um, so I wouldn't have been able to do all that I've done without the support of my crew,

305
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,160
which is kind of like a,

306
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:10,799
a self-made team, if you will, um, who always had my back at every competition that I went to,

307
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:17,299
you know, so these were intimidating situations that I was in only because I was the only girl

308
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:22,460
and only because I felt so different, you know, sometimes it'd be a bit in your face, but not in

309
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:28,559
a dangerous way. And it just was really nice to have their support always there. The other way

310
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,859
that collaboration is of course so important in breaking is because of the way that we learn and

311
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:33,859
the way that we train.

312
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:40,420
So I only went to a studio for maybe about a year to learn the basic techniques of breaking the rest

313
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:46,140
of the time. I've just been at my training sessions with my crew and I would work on key

314
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:52,339
skills or moves. And I would, you know, work on going into the circle and practice. And my crew

315
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:56,299
mates would teach me, they would teach me cause they've all been breaking, you know, a decade,

316
00:27:56,299 --> 00:28:02,819
at least longer than me. And they would teach me different moves and skills. And so it is a very

317
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:04,140
collaborative culture.

318
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,619
Very social, very collaborative. The knowledge is shared and you're in this together. The same,

319
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:14,720
you know, on the dance floor, when you're battling, there is that social exchange as well. So

320
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:21,460
you, you are constantly kind of thinking about others as you're dancing. It's not just a solo

321
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,119
activity.

322
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:28,220
Fascinating world. We're obsessed with great leadership. Who's been the greatest leader in

323
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:28,619
your life?

324
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:33,160
Oh, that's such, that's such a tough question. I mean,

325
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:41,259
look, I mean, my, my partner has just been amazing, um, and, and constantly helped to keep

326
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:48,900
me, to guide me, to support me, to ground me, you know, whether it's giving him a draft of my

327
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:54,980
article before sending it off to a journal or helping me prepare for a battle, you know, I'm,

328
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:02,640
I'm just so lucky to have his, his wisdom and his knowledge and his guidance there. I think also

329
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,039
just in terms of the practice, I think it's really important to have that kind of, you know,

330
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:10,440
the breaking community. There's, there's a B-boy called Poe One and he's, he's maybe third

331
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,319
generation breaker. I don't, I can't quite remember, but he's, he's been around for a very

332
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:23,099
long time and he was a really big name in the early nineties, you know, from LA, his crew style

333
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:28,500
elements crew is, is, is a really well-known crew. And he's been going around teaching workshops,

334
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,180
judging, and he has so much knowledge and I've done so many workshops of him and he's become a

335
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:33,380
real,

336
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:39,519
real friend. And I constantly am thinking, you know, what would Poe One think about this? You

337
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:44,160
know, what would Poe One remind me of? And, and he says, you know, one of the things that he says,

338
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,220
it's not his line, but he, he says it a lot in his workshops is each one teach one. And that's

339
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:54,960
the ethos of breaking, you know, so you learn, but you then have to share that learning. And I

340
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:02,519
think it's really important to, to have that groundedness, to be humble in that sense and to

341
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:04,019
keep community at,

342
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:10,140
at its core. And, you know, he's, he's one of the most esteemed international judges help design the

343
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:16,339
Olympic judging system. You know, he's just one that I always am inspired and, and go to for

344
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:20,980
thinking about, for thinking about leadership. I love your taking us into this world that is

345
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:27,299
just a completely different universe. Poe One and, you know, second, third generation breakers.

346
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,299
It's the fact that we didn't, you know, so the collective, we, most of us didn't even understand

347
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:33,880
this was still,

348
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:39,259
still the thing is just so interesting to me. The idea of collaboration, I'm going to come back to

349
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:45,259
a final question to you. Obviously this is a world that you're immersed in. Has there been one person

350
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:49,460
you thought, God, I'd love to connect with that. It may be in a different area of your life, but

351
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:54,319
that's someone that stands out in terms of someone you'd like to connect or collaborate with.

352
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,400
Yeah, this is a, this is a really tough question actually, because there's so many breakers that

353
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,740
inspire me in so many different ways. One person, I mean, I was lucky to,

354
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,839
actually learn off this breaker at the start of the year. He came to Australia and taught some

355
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:15,900
workshops, but B-Boy Amir from Kazakhstan is just an absolute phenomenal breaker. And he

356
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:21,759
fortunately qualified. So you will see him at the Olympics and he's just developed a totally new

357
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:28,740
way of moving. You know, he's such a unique breaker in the way that he changes levels and uses

358
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,859
contrast and dynamics. And it's just absolute, that's totally his style.

359
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:40,880
That he's developed, but he also does a lot of kind of artistic videography things as well on his

360
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,880
Instagram channel. And I just think like he would just be so amazing to work with in some capacity,

361
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,799
if it's, you know, in training or in, in an artistic capacity, I had a good chat with him

362
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:58,119
at the work after the workshop talking about great films and things like that. So that would

363
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:01,619
be pretty amazing to collaborate him with, with him in some capacity.

364
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,700
But your last line there sums up to me,

365
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:09,019
the best of the Olympics and why we all have so much hope when it comes around that someone from

366
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:16,200
Kazakhstan growing up in that part of the world is inspiring Rachel Gunn from Sydney and getting

367
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,720
together in an Olympic village with now breakers and a hundred meter sprinters and pole vaulters

368
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,180
and everything else that the United Nations of the world coming together. It's brilliant that

369
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:31,859
your community is a huge part of it. We celebrate you. We wish you all the best for Paris and
