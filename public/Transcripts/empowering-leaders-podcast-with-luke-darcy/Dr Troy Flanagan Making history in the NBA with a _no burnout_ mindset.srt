1
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,030
I'm sure you're going to really enjoy this episode with Dr. Troy Flanagan, the head of

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,529
high performance at the Milwaukee Bucks.

3
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:13,289
The first meeting I had with the ownership, they said, wouldn't it be crazy if the Milwaukee

4
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:15,390
Bucks won the NBA championships?

5
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:18,410
And I'd never really heard of the Milwaukee Bucks.

6
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:22,129
You know, they've been a bottom dweller in the NBA for the 10 years prior.

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,309
He shares how his background in aerospace engineering has given him the ability to step

8
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:30,809
into the future and bring those possibilities into the now.

9
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:36,090
Also, what it's like to work and develop NBA superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo.

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,369
He said at one point, I'd love to be, you know, make the all-star team.

11
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:45,049
And I was pretty ambitious for someone who's pretty early in their career and he did it.

12
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,509
And then I'd like to be MVP and he did it.

13
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,429
I'd like to do it again.

14
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:48,869
He did it.

15
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:49,810
I'd like to win the championship.

16
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,390
He did it.

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,530
The somewhat depressing, but incredibly impactful, what sucks meetings.

18
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:59,829
And we put it up and then we prioritize it from high impact if we're able to solve those

19
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:00,130
things.

20
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,689
To lower impact, which ones are easier to do and which ones are harder to do.

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,469
And so the high impact, easy to do, they're a no brainer.

22
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:08,930
We'll do them.

23
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,810
Where are we now?

24
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:11,129
Where do we need to be?

25
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,269
And how do we get there?

26
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:17,549
How he reset his worldview in his thirties to beat burnout and ended up supercharging

27
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,209
his career in the process.

28
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:22,269
Really taught myself in how to coach and mentor staff.

29
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,909
And at that point, there's a sharp inflection upwards in my career.

30
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,930
That realization that give him back.

31
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:36,549
And being an inspiring leader to others really was the key to success in, in my career.

32
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:39,790
I also loved his insight into mastering the art of staying calm.

33
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:42,950
That's something that has taken years to develop.

34
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,370
You know, I thought I had it after a couple of years, but you know, it would still get

35
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,810
to me, the stress would still get to me.

36
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,129
And, and then after about five years in the NBA, I'm like, it's washing over now.

37
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:54,170
I don't, I don't feel it anymore.

38
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,250
And now after 10 years, it's, I think I've got it, got it mastered.

39
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,909
We are incredibly privileged to have Dr.

40
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,769
Troy Flanagan in a leader connect.

41
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:05,730
We curate groups of five to six leaders around the globe to get together, to learn, to connect

42
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,530
and to collaborate.

43
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:11,370
And Troy shared the story of how Vanessa Ford's work in his leader connect group, a

44
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,909
remarkable Portugal based artists of Jamaican descent, who's transforming her community

45
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:21,990
in a unique way and how that inspired him to raise $5 million to address the obesity

46
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,310
epidemic in Milwaukee.

47
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,969
We love inspiring connections and creating a world of collaboration head to a letter

collective.com and book a discovery call today.

49
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,610
Big.

50
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:29,889
Thanks.

51
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:34,189
To Jason Nicholas and his team from temper bedding, a mattress like no other NASA approved

52
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:35,569
the best bedding in the world.

53
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:38,550
Investing in a mattress like temper will change your life.

54
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:40,210
Dr.

55
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,729
Troy Flanagan is the vice president of performance at the Milwaukee bucks in the NBA with a unique

56
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:49,949
background in sports technology development that includes a PhD in aerospace engineering.

57
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:54,770
Having spent over 20 years directing the sports science and medicine programs across the world.

58
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,110
He has overseen the preparation of Australian Olympic athletes, facilitated the programs

59
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,629
that soar.

60
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:00,889
He's also been the head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks team for the last 20 years, and he's

61
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:01,889
also been the head coach of the U S Olympic ski and snowboard team, more than double their

62
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:02,889
medal tally from the previous Olympics.

63
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:03,889
Troy was brought on at Milwaukee Bucks at the end of the 2015, 2016 season.

64
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:04,889
And over the last decade has built a world-class high performance program that has seen the

65
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:05,889
Bucks go from being an almost forgotten brand in their own city to one of the best performing

66
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:06,889
teams in the NBA.

67
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:07,889
Dr. Troy Flanagan.

68
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:08,889
It's a great pleasure to catch up with you.

69
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:09,889
I've heard so much about you.

70
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:10,889
Well, thank you so much for having me, Luke.

71
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:11,889
Appreciate it.

72
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:12,889
Can I start with the Milwaukee Bucks?

73
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:13,889
Since 2012, they've been the best team in the NBA.

74
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:14,889
They've been the best team in the NBA.

75
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:15,889
Can I start with the Milwaukee Bucks?

76
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:21,889
Since 2016, over that time, the Bucks have pulled off one of the most remarkable transformations

77
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:22,889
in sports history, really.

78
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:26,810
The teams reshape their image and their brand locally, nationally, and globally.

79
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:32,449
Can you tell us about that experience and how does it feel to be part of a brand and

80
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:33,449
project of some kind?

81
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:40,930
Well, there are a number of things that have happened in the last 15 months, um, it's been

82
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,009
really a struggle.

83
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:44,110
A lot of things have happened in the past and you could see that in how that's taken

84
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:44,449
place.

85
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:48,810
part of a program that's been so successful. I remember the first meeting I had with the

86
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,409
ownership. They said, wouldn't it be crazy if the Milwaukee Bucks won the NBA championships?

87
00:03:55,409 --> 00:04:01,650
I lived on the other side of the country in Utah, and I'd never really heard of the Milwaukee Bucks.

88
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:06,930
They've been a bottom dweller in the NBA for the 10 years prior, down the bottom of the league.

89
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:14,629
And it's pretty extraordinary to go through the journey from the bottom to the top. That's

90
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:21,529
actually, as a professional, what I enjoy the most. And your remit covers such a wide range.

91
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:26,870
Is it a sports medicine, wearable technology, software development, performance analytics,

92
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:32,569
diet, psychology? Basically, everything to do with the welfare of the players at the Bucks is

93
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:36,670
in your portfolio. Is there something that jumps out to you, Troy, that you feel like

94
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:36,910
you've learned?

95
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,089
That's an area that's really been important to us in the organization's success.

96
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:46,389
Yeah, I think you do have to be a jack-of-all-trades to do my job. It took me about 20 years to get

97
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:51,269
ready, and I was only just ready to take on this role after about 20 years in the industry.

98
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:59,610
And I think the thing that was really the key to our... I don't know if it's any discipline that

99
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:06,329
I've really overseen, but it was the coordinated, strategic,

100
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:14,209
vision of the owners. And then for us to, I guess, imagine what the Milwaukee Bucks looks

101
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:20,410
like in the future. And then it was a simple to-do list after that. But to identify what's

102
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:25,569
holding a team back and what's limiting the preparation and performance of the team, I think

103
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:32,389
that's really the true mastery of taking a team from the bottom to the top. And the U.S. Olympic

104
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:35,329
team actually taught me how to do that when I went to work for them. They are

105
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:36,310
masterful at that. And I think that's really the key to our success.

106
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,829
strategic planners. And I think that was one of the keys to success.

107
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,230
Troy, did you just mention imagining what the Milwaukee Bucks would look like

108
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,910
into the future? And it sounds like trying to fast-track that. My mind

109
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,750
immediately goes to Australian Hall of Fame legend, John Bertrand, and he's

110
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,170
always looking 10 years ahead. What was the Australia 2 going to look like in 10 years'

111
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:01,490
time and trying to get there quicker than everyone else? Is that sort of thinking a

112
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,449
bit of what you were just describing? Exactly what I was describing. So my

113
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:06,290
background in aerospace is that I've been in the industry for a long time. And I've been

114
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,889
doing aerospace engineering. It's funny you mentioned Australia 2 because that was one of

115
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:17,269
the projects when I was younger that really inspired me to do the work that I do, designing

116
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:21,189
kind of secret weapons. And that was one of the first secret weapons in sport, really, wasn't it?

117
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,449
That people came out and their minds were blown that we could develop that sort of technology and

118
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:32,810
really radically transform the sport. And since then, I've actually had a pattern of designing

119
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,949
secret weapons, whether it's being part of the bike design, whether it's being part of the bike

120
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:36,290
design, whether it's being part of the bike design, whether it's being part of the bike design,

121
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:43,029
program at RMIT University with the aerospace guys there developing pretty much the first

122
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:50,810
wearable technology to track soccer players on the field 24 years ago. And now that stuff's

123
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,410
everywhere. The US Olympic team is the best place in the world to go to design,

124
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,170
particularly skiing and snowboarding. There's so much technology there in designing ski jumping

125
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:05,889
suits that were designed in Melbourne at RMIT and for the US Olympic team. And, you know,

126
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:10,589
those sorts of tech projects, there's something that's always driven. I guess what I'm getting

127
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:15,430
here, the aerospace engineers taught me how to think like that. So what aerospace guys do,

128
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,589
they stand in the future and imagine what the future looks like. And they're like,

129
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:24,209
and the question they ask is, what is stopping that future from actually happening right now?

130
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:30,129
And they identify key technology barriers, or even in the NBA could be culture barriers,

131
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,230
those sorts of things. And then they work on those barriers. And once they solve those barriers,

132
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:40,870
rapid progression, rapid evolution of the sport happens overnight.

133
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,550
And what I love about that thinking, Troy, is that you can literally apply that to anything

134
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:50,629
in life, can't you? To business, to education, to any discipline, is it? Wanting to pursue

135
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:55,889
change at a rapid rate and try and stand, as you said, in the future. Have you seen that in other

136
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:00,149
areas of your life where that pursuit of excellence and trying to bring it forward

137
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:04,029
works for you in other areas? That's a good question. I think I apply that thinking to

138
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:05,089
everything. I think I apply that thinking to everything. I think I apply that thinking to

139
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:05,209
everything. I think I apply that thinking to everything. I think I apply that thinking to

140
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:09,829
how do my staff interact with coaches? I watch coaches and what they do every day. They're

141
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:15,110
spending a lot of time doing these very inefficient processes. And could we imagine the way that

142
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,189
they do things in the future and automating things so that they get their time back?

143
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,129
I guess I just try and apply it everywhere. Do you know what I love? There's a very specific

144
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:30,110
example that will not resonate in an audio medium, but we asked Troy to adjust his camera. And I'd

145
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,710
sat here and was trying to shift my laptop around. You put up your hand and AI moved your camera

146
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:40,809
and my mind was blown before we even started this interview. So I get the feeling you live and

147
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:45,450
breathe what you talk about every moment. You've had it once in a generation, maybe once in a

148
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,649
lifetime athlete. Giannis had a decumbo in your organization, the Milwaukee Bucks. And for those

149
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:55,450
that don't know the story, as an immigrant to Greece and growing up with abject poverty

150
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:04,570
to become an NBA superstar and someone that everyone has marveled at, for you to be around

151
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,669
an athlete like that, what's it take to manage someone like that on a daily basis, Troy?

152
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,070
Well, it's changed over time. When I first walked in, he'd been at the Bucks for a year and he's a

153
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:19,230
big, tall, skinny guy with not many muscles and wasn't very strong. And then I hired one of the

154
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:25,970
best strength coaches in the world, Nsuki Hobson, to come in and build his physique and also his

155
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:33,950
athleticism. And he said at one point, I'd love to make the all-star team. And I was pretty ambitious

156
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:39,669
someone who was pretty early in their career and he did it. And then I'd like to be MVP and he did

157
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:43,750
it. I'd like to do it again. He did it. I'd like to win the championship. He did it. And slowly,

158
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:51,730
but surely, all of the things that come with that increase in performance, but also increase in fame

159
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:58,389
and the demands that pull on him. I've just seen it rapidly change over time to where now we,

160
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:04,269
I've traveled with him to New York City and just to see him and also overseas.

161
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:11,570
And just to see people recognize him and be inspired by him. Kids know him and love him.

162
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:15,490
And he's a pretty special athlete that it's a privilege to even know.

163
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:20,230
And he looks like a remarkable human being as well. Troy, there's a great documentary that's

164
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,149
been released recently on Giannis and I'm sure it only scratches the surface. But the story that

165
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:29,190
springs to mind on when he first came out and literally sending every dollar he had back to

166
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,970
the family. And he would go to the teller every time he got money and literally feed it back to

167
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:39,850
the family. And so much so that he got caught out pre-game, sending money back home, the story

168
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,509
was told and realized then that he was going to miss the game because he literally couldn't catch

169
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:50,889
a taxi to the ground and hailed down a Milwaukee supporter who was driving to the game, who dropped

170
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:57,929
him sort of 10 Ks out. He ran the last sort of six or seven miles to the game. Is that the legend

171
00:10:57,929 --> 00:11:04,169
of that story true? Yes, it is. And it doesn't surprise me that he's very, very resourceful.

172
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:09,409
Yeah, I can see that absolutely happening. I just heard about it afterwards. I would have been

173
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:15,509
horrified if I had been standing at a game and the guy just ran a 10K before they started. But

174
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:21,730
yeah, we heard about it later and that doesn't surprise me. But yeah, incredible guy and so

175
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:28,129
driven, so professional. And he's genetically gifted for sure, but it's the hard work and

176
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:34,409
determination. And like he'll work on himself all day, all night into the wee hours of the

177
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:34,549
morning. And he'll work on himself all day, all night into the wee hours of the morning.

178
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:39,570
He's just constantly working on getting better every single day. So for me, it's not a shock

179
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:45,289
or a surprise that he's achieved the heights he has because of how much work and how much further

180
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:51,669
he's willing to go beyond what any other player in the league is doing. And that's probably a

181
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:57,309
product of his story. Troy, you grew up in a small Australian country town. It's a long way to the

182
00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:02,230
US Olympic team and working at the cutting edge of aerospace engineering and elite performance

183
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,409
and NBA championship winning teams. Do you look back at that?

184
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:09,250
I look back at your upbringing, your background and say, wow, you know, that's the possibilities

185
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,629
endless, isn't it? And it's inspiring to young people listening to this. Can you tell us a bit

186
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:18,570
about that journey? I did grow up in a small town in country New South Wales called Ballaratl,

187
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,889
which if you drive from Sydney to Adelaide, you actually drive through it and don't blink,

188
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:29,389
you'll miss it. It's pretty small, but I was a swimmer when I was a kid. And I remember my mom

189
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:33,970
and dad got a color TV and they turned it on the opening ceremony of the Moscow Olympics was on.

190
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:39,090
And I was just blown away. But one day I'll go to the Olympics and wasn't a good enough swimmer to

191
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:44,710
go, obviously, but it turns out I was a better sports scientist and high performance specialist.

192
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:50,509
And I've been to several Olympics now with the Australian and US teams. And I finally got there

193
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:58,210
and I think I was always really driven. I knew exactly what I wanted to do when I was 16 years

194
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:03,350
old and pretty much this is it. I didn't expect to be in America though. And I didn't expect to be

195
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:10,070
at an NBA basketball team. So that's been kind of the surprise. You just work hard and an

196
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,950
opportunity will present itself. And that often takes you on a tangent sideways.

197
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:19,490
I wanted to ask you about the difference between US and Australian culture. The great Greg Norman,

198
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:25,570
legendary Australian golfer and championship winning world number one, had a saying that

199
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,389
in America, if you buy a nice car, someone's likely to come up and say, hey, Troy, nice car.

200
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:33,929
In Australia, someone's likely to run the keys down the side.

201
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:39,950
And we call it tall poppy syndrome in Australia. It seems a uniquely bad Australian thing there.

202
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:46,110
What do you make of that tall poppy syndrome? It's definitely something that I've experienced

203
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:53,409
personally on my journey, going through my career in the Australian system. And you get to the US

204
00:13:53,409 --> 00:14:01,830
and the attitude is very much can do. It's a culture of possibility. It's probably why

205
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,710
I enjoy working here.

206
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:10,049
So much is because we have billionaire owners who have the exact same mindset that anything

207
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:15,590
is possible. The Milwaukee Bucks can win the NBA championship and potentially win it a couple of

208
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:22,289
times. That's the culture I really thrive in. I love that about Americans. It's a can do attitude.

209
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:27,210
If you want to be a billionaire, everyone says go for it. Whereas in other cultures,

210
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:33,789
you might get, come on, man, be realistic. Over here, they just go for it. And it's a can do

211
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:33,950
culture.

212
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:40,409
So we've heard about your what sucks meetings. Can you talk us through what they are and how that

213
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:41,029
idea started?

214
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:45,889
I always think that the group's more powerful than the individual, right? So we do a thing here.

215
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:52,250
It's part of our planning process to debrief after the season. And we get the whole group,

216
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:57,929
all my staff in, and we just, they're actually, these meetings are a bit depressing because it

217
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:02,049
seems like everything sucks, but everybody throws up things that annoy them, things that are

218
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:03,950
inefficient, things that they need to change. And we just, we just, we just, we just, we just,

219
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:10,929
and we put it up and then we prioritize it from high impact. If we're able to solve those things

220
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:16,950
to lower impact, and then which ones are easier to do and which ones are harder to do. And so

221
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:23,570
the high impact, easy to do, they're a no brainer. I find that it's the high impact,

222
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:30,889
hard to do quadrant that is really, really where the gold is. And if you can just solve one or two

223
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,929
of those things, you can potentially transform the world.

224
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:37,809
The way NBA players are prepared or the way they perform. And so,

225
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,909
so we're really big on prioritizing those things.

226
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:45,889
Yeah. And a follow on from that, I understand that you've talked about good strategic planning. He's

227
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:51,210
aiming for sort of 10 impactful strategies in a relatively short period of time, maybe one to

228
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:57,570
three years that you really go after. Does that come out of that particular forum that you just

229
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,230
talked about? And can you elaborate on how you go about implementing those things?

230
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,669
Yeah, it's a really simple process for me in

231
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:08,110
strategic planning. It's almost oversimplified as where are we now? Where do we need to be?

232
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:12,049
And how do we get there? They're kind of the three. If you look at my strategic plan,

233
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:16,789
you would see those sorts of things. And we do international comparisons of all different areas

234
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:24,929
and gap analysis and things like that, that go into the planning process. But out of it normally

235
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:32,149
comes 10 to 12 key problems that we're going to fix. And I present those to ownership and

236
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:33,649
it actually builds.

237
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:39,509
A lot of confidence and a lot of trust that they say, if we solve these 10 things,

238
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:45,929
we will radically transform our performance. We'll go from here to here. And the owners and the GM

239
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:50,590
and everybody says, well, now I know what you're working on. Off you go. We'll give you whatever

240
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:56,309
you need to do that. And I think it's really got to boil down to more of a problem solving approach

241
00:16:56,309 --> 00:17:02,110
rather than just doing everything slightly better. My strategic planning process is more about

242
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:03,210
identifying,

243
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:04,609
you know, what's holding us back.

244
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:10,029
And Troy, we've been really privileged to cross over with you in the Elite Connect world that

245
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:14,029
we're really passionate about curating groups of five to six different thinkers and leaders from

246
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:18,490
different backgrounds around the globe. And to have you in that, I know the group that you,

247
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:24,029
we have benefited greatly from it. Tyson Vallard's a unique serial entrepreneur,

248
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,769
Hugh van Kylenburg with the Resilience Project, Amit Baines at the Bulldogs are a few of the

249
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:33,029
members of your group. Vanessa Ford as well is an incredible.

250
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,650
Thank you.

251
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,829
Thank you. Can you tell us about that experience and what it's meant for you?

252
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:43,230
Yeah, I've really loved it. I've probably had some of the most radical changes out of that

253
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:49,329
leadership group. You know, listening to people like Vanessa Ford and actually the whole group

254
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:54,029
really, and just how much that they, the significance of their work and how much it's

255
00:17:54,029 --> 00:18:01,849
really about helping others and the communities and giving back. And it made me think, well,

256
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:03,589
what am I doing? I'm, I'm kind of making,

257
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:09,069
rich people played NBA basketball slightly better, right? And so what else could I be doing?

258
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:15,049
And a funny story that spun out is I've got to get back to the community. So I approached our,

259
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:22,549
our owner and within a few weeks, we'd raised $5 million to try and solve obesity in the

260
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:28,049
underprivileged community in Milwaukee. We've enrolled a hundred people in that program.

261
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:33,569
We set up a clinic in a barbershop in downtown Milwaukee. And those, those,

262
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:39,670
people, people that can't really afford the medications and the, the medical infrastructure

263
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:46,269
that, that others can. And they're already halfway through the program and are having

264
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:52,750
extraordinary results. And we hope to, you know, grow up to a thousand and then take it nationally.

265
00:18:52,930 --> 00:19:00,049
So, so that's one spark that, that, that, that leadership courses cause. I've got to give back

266
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:03,549
a little bit more. These guys are doing extraordinary things around the planet.

267
00:19:03,569 --> 00:19:08,970
And, you know, what am I doing to, to contribute and leave the, the world as a better place?

268
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:17,630
The other thing I think that I really love about the leader program was that we started out giving

269
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:24,089
ourselves leadership and business tips and tricks. And the place that we've now ended up

270
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:30,150
12 months later is we're all successful. We're all really good within our workspace.

271
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,470
But are we equally as successful?

272
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:39,750
Outside of our workplace, at home, within our family and friends infrastructure. And we talk

273
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:47,309
about that a lot about the wins outside of work, as much as we do about what we achieve

274
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:52,509
inside our four walls in their businesses. Troy, I love that story. And we talk about

275
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:56,390
these inspiring connections and a world of collaboration. I love that an artist based

276
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:02,369
in Portugal of Jamaican heritage is transforming the way that black people are seen on screens

277
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:08,309
with a super SEMA influencing an aerospace engineer growing up in rural New South Wales

278
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:13,390
at a high performing NBA team and having an impact on the obesity in a city like Milwaukee.

279
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:20,109
I love the fact that someone like you is so capable of implementing and being inspired and

280
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:24,029
that you pick up things and you act on them from what I understand, Troy, and you immediately,

281
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:27,930
the gap between you thinking about something and doing something positive.

282
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,849
Is there been other techniques that you've been able to, to grab and implement

283
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:32,349
individually?

284
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:40,049
I think the other thing that really stood out early on in, in, in the program was how much

285
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:47,430
the other participants in my group cared about the individuals they work for and that they,

286
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:53,289
they serve in their workplace. And it really has made me stop and think about, look,

287
00:20:53,289 --> 00:21:02,329
the NBA is 24 seven, about 360 days of the year. And it's so easy to get caught up in,

288
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:07,930
in the machine and the grind of the daily work and all of the demands that, that, that, that job

289
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:15,170
pulls on you. And you forget to sit your guys down and say, how are you doing? And we work,

290
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:22,549
we work, we play every second, third game day. Um, we travel a day might start at quite often

291
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:28,470
in the season at eight o'clock in the morning and finish at 2 AM that night. And it's taxing on

292
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,450
the staff is taxing on their families.

293
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:38,690
And just connecting with them was, was something that I was reminded to do and to prioritize that.

294
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:45,109
And, and that really had a profound impact on my connection with my staff. And, you know,

295
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:48,410
we're all in this together. We're on a journey together. We're trying to win another NBA

296
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:53,269
championship, but just to make sure and check in that they're okay on that journey is,

297
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:54,029
is really important.

298
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,390
And Troy, we would love that you've been able to share that with the

299
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:02,210
seven or so senior leaders at Milwaukee. And you can see the environment that you're in is just

300
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:02,349
high.

301
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:07,089
Where do we improve? How do we do that? And each of those individuals taking their learning to

302
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:11,430
unique places to bring that back to the organization in unique ways, which we've been

303
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:18,509
incredibly privileged and, uh, and, and fascinated by how you guys think and work. And we, we use this

304
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:23,470
term a lot, uh, Troy, that success leaves clues. And I love the opportunity to sit down and, and

305
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:28,609
talk to someone like you with your experience. And we see leadership has these common traits.

306
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:32,069
I want to ask you about a few of them. And we think the idea of

307
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:37,109
leadership is where it starts for us. It's very hard for anyone to have an impact on someone else

308
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:41,049
without a strong sense of their own self-leadership. What does that mean to you?

309
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:49,410
I had a career early, early days in my twenties, where I was just working crazy hours with the, at

310
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:55,890
the Victorian Institute of sport and in the Institute system and was really burning myself

311
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:02,130
out. So by the time I was 30, you know, I was even considering going off in a different career and

312
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:07,829
what I realized at that point was my career to that point was all about my achievements and what I

313
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:13,529
could do and, um, what I could achieve, like, you know, working with Olympic athletes, done it,

314
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:18,329
working with Olympic champions, done it. How about I get a PhD in aerospace engineering, done it.

315
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:24,329
By the time I was 30, I was exhausted. And there was a moment where I realized that

316
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:29,730
it, my career is not about me. It's about what I can do for others. And,

317
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:37,650
and I put on the possibility of being a brave and inspiring leader to everybody around me

318
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:42,869
and bravery because I, I needed it in that tall poppy syndrome, you know, just to keep,

319
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:49,349
uh, a culture and just to keep, keep charging, keep, keep achieving, keep aiming high,

320
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:54,990
but also inspiring, like just back to the, the wing keel of Australia too. That was an

321
00:23:54,990 --> 00:24:00,630
inspirational moment. And it's easy to be a leader when you're, you're an inspiring. And so that's

322
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,069
been my mantra and I write it down.

323
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:06,210
Once a week on top of my to-do list of being a brave and inspiring leader. And some weeks I'm

324
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:11,789
not a brave and inspiring leader, but that's what I attest to try and be. And, and at that moment,

325
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:17,970
and when I was around 30, I started to, to coach. I said, okay, I'm in a good spot. Now I've got all

326
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:23,430
these staff below me. I'm going to coach them one day a week. I'm going to sit between 30 and 45

327
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:30,509
minutes every week and coach them on how they're doing, what their next job is, how we can get them

328
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:37,890
there, you know, what their dreams are. And, um, and really taught myself on how to coach and mentor

329
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:44,490
staff. And at that point, there's a sharp inflection upwards in my career, that realization

330
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:52,230
that giving back and being an inspiring leader to others really was the key to success in, in my

331
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:56,970
career. And like the secret of it all is the product, you know, I was working on, you know,

332
00:24:57,569 --> 00:24:59,970
almost getting staff to go onto another job,

333
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:06,930
productivity went up 10X and everybody's walking around with a spring in their step. And suddenly

334
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:11,609
we were producing extraordinary technology, extraordinary techniques, uh, with the Olympic

335
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:18,509
athletes. And, and we were starting to really turn heads. And, and that was the key is, is to,

336
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:23,789
to really focus on everyone around you. It's a great story, Troy, and I really

337
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:27,809
appreciate your sharing, isn't it? And to get that knowledge at 30 years of age and have that

338
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:30,329
self reflection on yourself is a great credit to you, isn't it?

339
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:30,349
Yeah.

340
00:25:30,349 --> 00:25:30,450
Yeah.

341
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:30,490
Yeah.

342
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,710
We all probably start there and probably in sport, how do I get to the level I need to

343
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,049
get to?

344
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:36,549
That's probably a natural thing, isn't it?

345
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:39,430
You want to achieve and you want success as a kid.

346
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:42,730
And then to understand that the highest form of living, isn't it, is supporting someone

347
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,130
else to get there.

348
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:48,829
And as you said, when you do that, it actually enhances everyone, doesn't it?

349
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:52,630
People with your 10X people's performance, even if they are going to leave your organization

350
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:58,150
or leave the team that you're in, it's a great way to think and you sum that up in such a

351
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:58,670
brilliant way.

352
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,329
That probably leads to the next dimension pretty clearly.

353
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:06,210
That idea of having a positive impact on people every day in the environment you're in is

354
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,829
something that we see as a key dimension of leadership.

355
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:11,049
And that was a great story about that, isn't it?

356
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:12,809
Starting to focus on being an inspiring.

357
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:16,630
I love that you write that at the top of your diary every week.

358
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,549
How have you gone about that, that positive impact on people daily?

359
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:28,329
Yeah, the MBA ecosystem does everything to stop that, given the demands of the job when

360
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:28,630
you've reached.

361
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:34,410
You've really got to pull yourself back to that human side on a daily basis, not just

362
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:39,309
working a to-do list and charging through your day.

363
00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:45,690
I don't know if I have a terrific technique on what I do daily, but it's definitely a

364
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,650
weekly reflection.

365
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:53,170
You're having the open door policy and just caring about people that are coming through

366
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:53,609
my door.

367
00:26:54,069 --> 00:26:58,509
And Troy, we got an insight into your strategic planning and the excellence that you've

368
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,990
bring to the organization that you're in or every organization that you're in.

369
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:07,130
And I suppose there's been some pretty clear visions that you've had for high performance.

370
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:11,750
How have you gone about sharing that vision, creating and sharing that vision within the

371
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,930
places that you've operated?

372
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:18,470
Yeah, I've always found myself to be a bit of a dreamer of the future is kind of the

373
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,049
theme, right?

374
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:27,089
And I remember the US ski team, I used to present my annual strategic plan, but the

375
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:28,650
first two minutes of it.

376
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:36,650
It was an inspirational video of that had a message that I really wanted the leadership

377
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:41,690
of the US ski team, US Olympic team to look the lens that I wanted them to look through

378
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,730
and then listen to my presentation.

379
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:51,170
And so it's just opening up their minds and letting them see something inspirational.

380
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:55,970
Let's, you know, we went to the Vancouver Olympics and doubled our best ever medal telly

381
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,609
from Torino, which was a disaster for the.

382
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:01,769
US ski and snowboard team as far as metal count.

383
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:07,789
And then they went, they turned up in Vancouver in 2010 after me being there three years.

384
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:11,289
And I'm not saying I was the reason for it, but you know, we got them organized

385
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:15,490
systematic and, and they just seem to win everything in Vancouver.

386
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:21,109
And you know, that my first message after those Olympics in my next strategic plan is,

387
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:23,690
you know, we've dominated the Olympics.

388
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:25,190
What if we could do it again?

389
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,769
What if we could take them up a notch?

390
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:28,509
And then the next Olympic.

391
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:37,289
So it's really coming from a perspective of creating a vision and inspiring people to do that.

392
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:39,750
And then once you start to achieve those things, it becomes easy.

393
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,009
Like, well, you know, what else have you got?

394
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,549
You know, what else do we need to do?

395
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:44,130
It's easy to get funding.

396
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:48,269
You know, they trust million dollar technology projects that I would take on.

397
00:28:48,849 --> 00:28:51,849
They trust that, you know, the last one work, let's go again.

398
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,269
You know, what, what can we do with the Alpine suits?

399
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:55,730
Can we make them more dynamic?

400
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,190
Can we do more wind tunnel testing?

401
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,690
Can we get.

402
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:58,470
Some.

403
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:02,630
More, you know, experts from around the world to look over our shoulder, those sorts of things.

404
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,750
So everybody's at the snowball starts.

405
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:11,289
Then in my mind, my strategy is to just give them that lens and then show them the future.

406
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:16,950
Troy, we see a lot of people who have success like you and consistently are really curious people.

407
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:21,009
And through that curiosity, that's how they approach their learning and development.

408
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,509
Does curiosity ring true for you?

409
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:24,789
Oh, absolutely.

410
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,970
If our department was a business, we would be.

411
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:33,490
Incredibly successful because we all need PhDs to work with elite athletes.

412
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:38,890
We just do, you know, 20, 30 years of preparation in order to get ready just for this role.

413
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:47,390
Uh, research in anywhere from nutrition and aerospace industry to medical side.

414
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:57,890
So like the amount of preparation that we have to do just to work with an athlete these days, there's really like no other industry postgraduate degree and you go and need most other injuries.

415
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:58,049
So.

416
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:01,390
Uh, it, in most other, um, industries.

417
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:19,690
So, you know, I, I think that sort of level of preparation lends itself to having an extraordinary foundation of science underneath you that backs you that curiosity to learn and, and to innovate causes extraordinary results on the other end.

418
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:25,250
Communicating with clarity is a dimension that we see consistently, uh, around different layers.

419
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,029
How have you gone about, uh, that communication strategy?

420
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:35,650
I think the first thing that comes to my mind is I'm the guy who interprets all the technical jargon and gives it to the general manager and the owner.

421
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:45,710
And so I take complex medical jargon about a particular injury and I, I walk upstairs and say, okay, here's what's going on with his knees.

422
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:52,150
Don't, don't, don't actually the us ski team taught me this in any situation you need three talking points.

423
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:58,150
And as simple as that sounds like we would have an incident or a new sponsorship or.

424
00:30:58,509 --> 00:31:07,509
You know, an athlete that's achieved good results or perhaps underachieved, they always used to meet as a group, collective group and say, okay, this has happened.

425
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:15,130
These are our talking points, everyone on that message, you can say other things, but I want you to hit these three target points.

426
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:25,130
If anyone from the media, anyone from the organization, we're all sticking to these three talking points and I I've really taken that forward.

427
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:33,130
You know, if, if something's happening here with the bucks, I, I always get the group in and say, okay, this has happened, you know, we've got a significant injury.

428
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,130
Here are our talking points.

429
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:38,130
If anyone asks us, people will come and ask for information from all different angles.

430
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,130
And yeah, that's certainly in good stead.

431
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:43,130
And you're talking the highest pressure situations.

432
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,130
You go back to an NBA championship, uh, podcast.

433
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:50,130
You go back to the playoffs and, uh, one of the most high profile athletes in the world has a knee injury.

434
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,130
Every person in your city wants to know about that knee injury.

435
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,130
And what are you doing, Troy?

436
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,130
How do we get Giannis back on the court?

437
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:01,130
So again, is it just, here's the three things that we're working on.

438
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,130
Let's stick to that communication.

439
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,130
Is it, does that work under that extreme pressure as well?

440
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,130
It really does.

441
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:15,130
And one of the things that I've, I look back on in my time in Australia is the best medical professionals like Peter Harcourt and all those guys.

442
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:18,130
You know, they're always so calm under pressure.

443
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:21,130
Like just all sorts of stuff would be happening.

444
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,130
And they were just absolutely calm.

445
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:27,130
Like surgeons, you know, when things are going wrong and they're just so cool and calm.

446
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,130
And that's what I try.

447
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:37,130
And if you actually see me in a game, like behind the bench, you know, the whole crowd is roaring and I'm just sitting there calmly.

448
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:44,130
Not so much inside, but developed that skill over 10 years of, you know, and everything is happening in the gut wrenching.

449
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:48,130
Stress of winning an NBA championship.

450
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:52,130
You know, it's kind of at the end of COVID, which adds a whole nother layer of stress.

451
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:56,130
It's taught me to be calm in really chaotic situations.

452
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:03,130
And I think that married with clear communication has been one of the keys to success.

453
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:12,130
And even when we've got Doc Rivers now and his assistant coaches, and they're like, we can't believe how calm you are in an injury crisis.

454
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,130
And, you know, I've had it a lot.

455
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,130
A lot of them.

456
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,130
So maybe it just washes off these days.

457
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:21,130
But that's something that has taken years to develop.

458
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:25,130
You know, I thought I had it after a couple of years, but, you know, it would still get to me.

459
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,130
The stress would still get to me.

460
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:30,130
And then after about five years in the NBA, I'm like, it's washing over now.

461
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,130
I don't feel it anymore.

462
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:37,130
And now after 10 years, I think I've got it mastered.

463
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:42,130
I love you described that's a skill you went after and worked on and a mastery of wanting to be that way.

464
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,130
How important is collaboration?

465
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:47,130
Yeah, I think it's really the key to success.

466
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:56,130
If I talk to this NBA, I think in the past in the NBA, you know, the medical staff and performance staff are over in that corner and coaches are up in that corner.

467
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,130
And, you know, that's coaching and that's medicine.

468
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:13,130
And I think the really progressive world class teams now are inviting the performance and medical staff into coaches meetings there to listen to hear what the coaches are saying directly about the players.

469
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:16,130
And taking that information back into that preparation.

470
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:27,130
You know, I think really the key to our success or one of the keys to our success has been the inviting nature of the different groups in the organization.

471
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:31,130
And it's taught me a lot of how important it is when we've been successful.

472
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:34,130
And when we haven't, it's been awful little.

473
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:38,130
And so we're always striving to, you know, form those partnerships.

474
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:42,130
And the GM and the coach and I, we always say it's a partnership.

475
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,130
We work in a partnership.

476
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,130
And we say that word a lot.

477
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,130
You know, we're partners in this.

478
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:52,130
And I think that sets the tone.

479
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,130
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

480
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,130
The greatest leader in my life?

481
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,130
That's a good question.

482
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:02,130
I think it's been a culmination of a lot of people.

483
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:06,130
I think when I was in Australia, I really loved working for Dr. Frank Pike.

484
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:10,130
I think he was the head of the VIS.

485
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:12,130
And actually the first four scientists.

486
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,130
That ever fixed Dennis Lilly's back in the days.

487
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:18,130
You know, like he's a phys editor and pioneered the whole industry.

488
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:21,130
And he's probably the guy who gave me my first start.

489
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:28,130
I would say Frank would be probably my favorite leader.

490
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:32,130
And Peter Spencer, the two that gave me my start.

491
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,130
And saw my vision and my hunger to go off into this career.

492
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,130
You reference a famous story, isn't it?

493
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:42,130
One of the all-time great Australian athletes whose back was gone and rebuilt.

494
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:45,130
His bowling technique, the great Dennis Lilly.

495
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:50,130
And then I understand he passed it on to a generation of bowlers who just consisted.

496
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:54,130
It's the most unnatural thing in the world to do to bowl cricket balls at 160 kilometers an hour.

497
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:58,130
And on a piece of concrete effectively running it at full speed.

498
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:04,130
And I think he influenced a huge amount of athletes after that with great success as well.

499
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,130
So I love that chain of it being passed on.

500
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:11,130
You sitting there now in the US and passing your knowledge on to a range of athletes.

501
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,130
And changing their life.

502
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:17,130
We're a bit obsessed in the elite world with the idea of collaboration and what it looks like.

503
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:25,130
I mean, you've had access to incredible collaborators to try and take high-performing Olympic teams and NBA teams to their very best.

504
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:28,130
Has there been one person from any of your passions?

505
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:32,130
Because you've done, as you said, different things with wearable technology and bikes.

506
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:36,130
Or anyone you thought, that's someone I'd love to tap into their knowledge and collaborate with.

507
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,130
Is there a name that springs to mind?

508
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,130
I think there's lots of names that spring to mind.

509
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:47,130
Which is why I'm not, you know, I think the All Blacks are a group that I'd love to collaborate with.

510
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,130
And I haven't at this point.

511
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,130
My wife's a Kiwi, so she would enjoy that.

512
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:54,130
We just don't talk about rugby at home and everything's great.

513
00:36:54,130 --> 00:37:03,130
They seem to be an organization that's been big on cultural change, innovation in, you know, the performance world.

514
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,130
And, you know, one of the most successful teams in the world.

515
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:09,130
And they've written books and all that sort of thing.

516
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:13,130
But I'd like to learn what's not in the book as well.

517
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:17,130
Because I've learned over the past is that you can say a lot without saying anything.

518
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,130
You know, there's some secret sauce that they don't let out.

519
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:23,130
And that's definitely what happens here at the NBA.

520
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,130
But I'd love to work with those guys.

521
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,130
Yeah, it's a brilliant answer, isn't it?

522
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,130
A team that's had that sustained success.

523
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:33,130
And it's more than a religion in New Zealand, isn't it?

524
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:36,130
The All Blacks are part of the DNA of that whole country.

525
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,130
And it takes over every year.

526
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:41,130
Every part of everyone who lives in that part of the world.

527
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,130
And I'm sure that would be a fascinating collaboration.

528
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,130
Dr. Troy Flanagan, it's been a great privilege to spend some time with you.

529
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:54,130
Fascinated by the work that you're doing and how you implement all the great successes in the spaces you've been in.

530
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,130
I really appreciate your time.

531
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,130
Thanks for joining me.

532
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,130
