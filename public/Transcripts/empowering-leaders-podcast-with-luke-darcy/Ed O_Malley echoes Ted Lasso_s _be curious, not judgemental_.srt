00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:08,699
This week's episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast comes from Kansas in the U.S., Ed

2
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:15,419
O'Malley, a former elected official in Kansas who left his role to start the Kansas Leadership

3
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:19,559
Center that has impacted tens of thousands of people in his local community.

4
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,579
Ed is a fascinating and curious person.

5
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:28,420
He talks a lot about leadership being disappointing people at a rate that they previously can't

6
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:28,859
absorb.

7
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:35,280
He also makes a really clear distinction between what is a role of authority and exercising

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,840
leadership.

9
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,299
And just because you're in a role of authority doesn't mean that you choose to exercise leadership

10
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:45,140
or have the skills to do it, and that leadership is actually a skill that can be learned and

11
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,159
an exercise in itself.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,899
He talks about the challenge of the gun laws in the United States, his passion for a formal

13
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,039
global collaboration of leadership programs around the world to get together and support

14
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,840
a more creative and collaborative leadership.

15
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,859
You'll also hear him reference Ted Lasso's brilliant line, be curious, not judgmental.

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,599
Ed O'Malley is a fascinating person who's doing great work in this space, and I'm sure

17
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,219
you're going to enjoy listening to it.

18
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,299
It's conversations like this one with Ed O'Malley that form the basis for our passion with the

19
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,459
work we do at Alita, particularly our Alita Connect program.

20

from the world of the arts or starting a small business or from education or sport.

26
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,019
The idea of collaborative learning is something we are incredibly passionate about and seeing

27
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:47,060
the positive learning and personal development that we feel really passionate about with

28
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,420

Thank you.

39
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:58,219
Thank you.

40
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:58,239
Thank you.

41
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:58,260
Thank you.

42
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:58,280
Thank you.

43
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,299
Thank you.

44
00:01:58,299 --> 00:01:58,319
Thank you.

45
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:58,340
Thank you.

46
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,840
Thank you.

47
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:58,959
Thank you.

48
00:01:58,959 --> 00:01:59,000
Thank you.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,019
Thank you.

50
00:01:59,019 --> 00:01:59,060
Thank you.

51
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,099
Thank you.

52
00:01:59,099 --> 00:01:59,159
Thank you.

53
00:01:59,159 --> 00:01:59,180
Thank you.

54
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,200
Thank you.

55
00:01:59,219 --> 00:01:59,239
Thank you.

56
00:01:59,239 --> 00:01:59,260
Thank you.

57
00:01:59,260 --> 00:01:59,459
Thank you.

58
00:01:59,459 --> 00:01:59,560
Thank you.

59
00:01:59,560 --> 00:01:59,579
Thank you.

60
00:01:59,579 --> 00:01:59,599
Thank you.

61
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,319
Thank you.

62
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:00,519
Thank you.

63
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:20,889
At a time where our trust in elected officials around the globe is at an all-time low, a

64
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:26,110
leadership story out of Kansas and the United States is a beacon of positivity for me for

65
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,810
what is possible.

66
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,870
Ed O'Malley's passion for the power of positive leadership

67
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:33,830
led him to founding the Kansas Leadership Center in 2007

68
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,509
and serving as its president and CEO for the next 15 years

69
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:40,669
following a four-year stint in public office

70
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:42,469
in the Kansas legislature.

71
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,770
The Kansas Leadership Center is a not-for-profit organization

72
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,090
that has engaged more than 15,000 participants

73
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,530
across 44 states, 62 countries,

74
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:54,229
with 98% highly recommending the program to their colleagues.

75
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:58,750
Independent research has shown the benefits to the community are many.

76
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,710
A more engaged workforce, employees more committed,

77
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:04,069
and a sense of greater hope for the future.

78
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:06,229
Ed, great to catch up with you today.

79
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:06,909
Thanks for your time.

80
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:07,909
Thanks, Luke.

81
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:09,090
It's great to be with you.

82
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:10,590
I'm excited for the conversation.

83
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:15,169
Ed, I mentioned our trust in elected officials is at an all-time low,

84
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:16,590
close to zero in my mind.

85
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,629
That's why I love reading about your story,

86
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,490
using the power of your position to create something

87
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,490
that's having a really meaningful, positive impact from what I can see.

88
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,550
Tell us a bit about your founding of the Kansas Leadership Center.

89
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,330
Yeah, Luke, thanks.

90
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:34,550
You know, I mean, trust is such a key part of leadership.

91
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,729
I bet we'll dig into that just a little bit.

92
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,629
But I came from politics.

93
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:41,330
I used to be a member of the Kansas House of Representatives,

94
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,509
as you mentioned in the introduction.

95
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:47,509
I resigned my seat to start the Kansas Leadership Center,

96
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,669
believing that the quality and the quantity of leadership

97
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:57,250
in a community or in a company is really a key determinant

98
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,729
to whether there's going to be some kind of change.

99
00:03:58,729 --> 00:03:59,370
Whether there's going to be success,

100
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:03,669
whether there's going to be enough bonds of trust

101
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:07,110
among diverse people to do important work.

102
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,229
And so those two things, the quality of leadership

103
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:12,169
and the quantity of leadership,

104
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:17,730
wanting to get more of both is what led me to leave politics,

105
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,149
start the Kansas Leadership Center.

106
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:26,670
We had some wonderful philanthropic dollars to launch the center.

107
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,709
And now 16, 17 years later,

108
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,509
it's worked with thousands and thousands of folks around Kansas,

109
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,629
but also around the globe, including in Australia,

110
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:37,610
which is why it's so great to be connecting with you today, Luke.

111
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,389
Yeah, likewise, Ed.

112
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,009
And you mentioned your role in politics.

113
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:44,170
You describe yourself, I think, as a moderate Republican.

114
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,649
And just zooming out for a moment, Ed, to me,

115
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,589
I'm a bit disturbed by the extreme divide that we seem to see

116
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:51,910
around the world at the moment.

117
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:55,050
We've got other countries still invading sovereign nations.

118
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:58,629
You know, in the U.S., you've got a former president currently indicted on over,

119
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,529
I think, 100 charges.

120
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:03,870
Are you optimistic about leadership or are you concerned?

121
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,990
Yeah, Luke, it's very concerned.

122
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:14,970
And I think a key is to recognize that people in authority roles,

123
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,589
sometimes they exercise leadership, but most of the time they don't.

124
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,490
To me, leadership is an activity.

125
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:24,170
It's something that happens.

126
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:27,990
And oftentimes people in authority,

127
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,189
are really crummy at exercising leadership.

128
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,829
They have a lot of expectations on them

129
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:39,550
from the very people who gave them their authority.

130
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:43,410
And to me, those expectations are almost always

131
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,290
to make things better for them, right?

132
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,870
For the people who gave the person the authority,

133
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:56,569
to make things be easier for their faction in the community or in the nation.

134
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:58,509
And I think leadership,

135
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,610
the exercise of leadership is disruptive.

136
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,610
It is often about disappointing people

137
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,889
more than it is about telling people what they want to hear.

138
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:17,149
So, I'm really worried about the state of formal authority in our world today.

139
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:23,649
And if we look primarily to those individuals in the United States and Australia

140
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:27,529
and other countries, if we look to them to be the source of all of our leadership,

141
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:28,310
if we look to them to be the source of all of our leadership,

142
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:28,569
If we look to them to be the source of all of our leadership,

143
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:34,370
leadership, I'm afraid that it could be a really messy future. I think they have a role to play,

144
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,589
but I really believe in ground up leadership as absolutely critical.

145
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,569
I love that you're making that distinction, Ed, isn't it, between authority and leadership,

146
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:48,529
just because you're in a position of authority, as you say, doesn't mean you get to exercise what

147
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:52,310
we think is great leadership. And often that's what's lacking at the moment, isn't people

148
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:58,230
finding a way into authority without the skills that you're talking about, that I'm passionate

149
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:03,350
about as well, is that ability to have positive impact, that community-based leadership. And I

150
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,329
know you're really passionate about this thing. You don't need authority to exercise leadership

151
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:09,850
at the same time. It's one of your strong beliefs, isn't it?

152
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:16,350
Yeah, it is. And look, I know for a lot of people, if they haven't thought about this before,

153
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:23,610
this could be really hard to wrap their arms around, but authority is critical. And for a lot

154
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,209
of problems, all you need is authority to make the right decision.

155
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:34,569
To do the right thing. But on the toughest challenges, the biggest challenges facing

156
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:42,910
a community, an organization, a sports team, you have so much experience in athletics. The biggest

157
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:50,569
challenges take leadership from the many. The team captain is a critical role that often

158
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:56,589
doesn't have enough authority to solve something all by himself or all by herself.

159
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,870
So this idea...

160
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:03,610
The idea that authority is critical, but leadership is needed from the many,

161
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:07,870
including those without authority, I think is quite liberating,

162
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:11,810
but it is very counterintuitive to a whole lot of people.

163
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:16,949
And there's one thing that puzzles us Australians here, and I'm sure you've heard this question

164
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:23,389
before, but you look to the US and you see 600 mass shootings a year, 50 people a day die by

165
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:28,170
firearm in the US. So I'm talking to you in Kansas today. It's one of the...

166
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,490
It's one of the world's most important capitals of the world. Is there any hope in your mind

167
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:38,990
that you can get a shift in leadership to make an impact on what just seems to be a

168
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,450
crazy thing that unfolds day after day in America?

169
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:50,889
Yeah, it is crazy. And I, of course, I'm familiar with the Australian history and its approach

170
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:57,889
to acting so quickly years ago to counteract the presence of so many...

171
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:04,809
weapons that could contribute to the type of mass destruction that we see way too often here.

172
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:09,769
It's incredibly frustrating. And to me, if we think of that as a case study,

173
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:17,289
it's a sad case study, but I think it's a relevant one because what I know from exercising

174
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:20,669
leadership, from studying leadership and being involved in civic life,

175
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:27,830
is we're not going to convince opposing factions with our favorite talking points.

176
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:37,990
If I'm in favor of more gun control, this is one of those things where just talking about my point

177
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:43,570
of view louder isn't going to convince anybody on the other side. And that's what's happening

178
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:50,330
right now is almost like these factions talk past each other. And I think it's a good example

179
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:57,830
because to actually talk together and sit down at the same table and try to find some common ground,

180
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:04,049
frankly, it's what's needed. But it's also so hard because we are so polarized.

181
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:10,809
It's very difficult for people to sit down with the opposing faction and be able to explain as to

182
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:16,649
why they did that, why they sat down with those people who are the quote-unquote enemy. And I

183
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:22,250
think in the gun debate, the mass violence debate, the mass shooting debate in America, you see

184
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:28,210
the worst of what happens when there aren't enough people who have the ability to do that. And I think

185
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,730
in the gun debate, the mass shooting debate, the mass shooting debate in America, you see the worst of

186
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:28,789
what happens when there aren't enough people who have the ability to do that. And I think in the

187
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:34,350
exercise leadership, even in situations where they don't have enough authority on their own.

188
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:39,990
And Ed, for me, one of the big problems in the world now is that we can't even seem to agree

189
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:46,190
on simple facts anymore and right or wrong, what's true and false. And one of the strange things I

190
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:52,350
like to do from here in Australia is occasionally flick between CNN and Fox News on an issue like

191
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:58,210
this, you know, on gun control. And it's not alternative opinion. It's alternative facts that

192
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:03,809
are being passed down the line. And then you get the algorithms of social media that reinforce the

193
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:08,309
bias that you've already got. I mean, we used to have great debates, didn't we? You know,

194
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:13,730
you're a moderate Republican, you'd sit down with a Democrat friend over dinner and you might have

195
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,649
a debate and you maybe would shift some ground back into the middle and find common ground.

196
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:22,490
And it feels like, you know, if you're left or right here in Australia or whatever side you

197
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:28,090
tend to lean towards, now we want to cancel each other. Now we want people removed. We haven't

198
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:33,870
got that ability to find middle ground. I mean, is that as big a problem as I'm articulating it

199
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:42,149
there? Oh, I think it's bigger than you're articulating. I think it's a massive problem.

200
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:50,629
And two things come to mind, Luke. One of them is the presence of our modern technology, which

201
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:58,169
I can't begin to fully understand or appreciate, but clearly the presence of social media and,

202
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:06,750
you know, the 24-7 digitally connected world is making it harder to agree on a common set of

203
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:13,289
facts, making it harder to have a common narrative of what's going on, which to me is all the more

204
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:20,730
reason why we need a lot more people who have the skill to exercise leadership, the skill to

205
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:28,210
better diagnose situations and engage people of differing opinions to come to the table,

206
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:37,409
maybe in the past, you could solve a really tough community, civic, political problem with one or

207
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:43,370
two people who really understood how to exercise leadership. I think today you can't. Today you

208
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:50,809
need a lot of people, frankly, in all of the different factions who have the ability to

209
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:56,590
exercise leadership. And what that means is that every time I have exercised leadership, I'm

210
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:02,750
angering my people. You know, when I was in politics, when I look back and I think about

211
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:08,169
the moments that I was exercising leadership, which I think are few and far between for all of

212
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:16,830
us, but in those moments, I was angering my fellow Republicans. You know, I was upsetting them. I was

213
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:23,450
convincing them they had to evolve. I wasn't bashing the opposition Democrats. You know,

214
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,529
so I think that's what leadership is. Leadership is disappointing

215
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:33,629
your own people at a rate they can't absorb. And in this moment, we need a lot more people

216
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:40,409
who have the ability and the skill to do that because of the rapid changing world we're in.

217
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:45,649
And Ed, I love the language you use, exercising leadership. And often you're right. It's the hard

218
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:49,950
decisions. It's not the popular decisions. And maybe an easy way to understand it, because it's

219
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:54,909
one of my favorite topics, is going back on the home front, isn't it? You're a father of three and

220
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:56,509
married to your child. You're a father of three and married to your child. You're a father of three and

221
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:02,730
I read Ed, but often the leadership on the home front are the most unpopular decisions too,

222
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:06,230
aren't they? And they start from the youngest age. It's time to go to bed. It's time to,

223
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:13,029
you know, pick up your clothes off the bedroom floor. Can you help out at dinner time? I mean,

224
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,889
they're not popular calls on the home front either, are they? But you expand that out.

225
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:22,809
It's an exercise, isn't it? It's a choice, but there's some skill involved in it as well that

226
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:26,370
can be taught. And that's why I describe what you're doing as a beacon of hope,

227
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:33,190
to take politics into expanding that exercise and that skill around the community so we can

228
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:39,490
come together. It's a very worthwhile thing that you're doing it. Well, thank you, Luke. And I think

229
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:46,909
your example about the home front is a great one. And one of the dynamics at the home front in our

230
00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:56,210
families is like, my kids, they didn't give me my authority to be their dad. I just am their dad.

231
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:03,029
And I can make them super, super angry, and I'm still going to be their dad. But for a lot of

232
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:11,029
people in authority roles, if they anger the people who gave them their authority too much,

233
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:18,509
those people will choose somebody else to be their president, their elected official, their

234
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:25,950
quote unquote leader, which is why I think it's just dangerous in these polarized times to expect

235
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:33,029
people to rely on folks in these authority roles to have all the answers, because they are so

236
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:41,029
beholden to those who gave them their authority. It's hard for them to operate otherwise. And they

237
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:48,529
need though, they also need help with learning the skills of how do you disappoint your own people

238
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:52,950
at a rate they can absorb. That's what leadership is all about. It's tricky, but we all got to learn

239
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,950
it.

240
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,950
And then one of the things that I read about with you is the link and the passion between the two.

241
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:01,110
I mean, it's a passion between better health and better leadership. And you're now serving on the

242
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,889
Kansas Health Center, I understand. And that funds a lot of the Kansas Leadership Center.

243
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:11,429
The research is pretty evident, isn't it? If you get that exercise of leadership expanded in the

244
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:15,750
community, people are healthier, they live better lives. Can you explain a bit of that research?

245
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:24,309
Yeah, you bet. So I run the Kansas Health Foundation now, and people look at health in

246
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:25,850
our name, and they might assume,

247
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:34,409
we focus on health care. We really don't. We focus on those interventions that lead to healthier

248
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:42,730
people, healthier populations. And what we know is that the biggest determinant of someone's health

249
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:49,470
is their economic status. It's how much money they have and how stable they are with their

250
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:55,549
financial situation. The second biggest determinant of someone's health,

251
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:01,750
is their level of educational attainment. Have they had the opportunity to go to university,

252
00:17:02,049 --> 00:17:08,710
to go beyond the bare basics? Other key determinants of health are things like,

253
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:15,430
how safe is the neighborhood in which they live? Well, those things like the safety of a

254
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:21,130
neighborhood, the educational opportunities, and certainly things like economic mobility,

255
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,769
it takes a lot of leadership from a lot of people to create those

256
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:32,410
conditions so that people can live healthy, thriving lives. So that's the connection we see in

257
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:38,430
lots of the research that backs that connection up, the connection between the quality and quantity

258
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:44,630
of leadership in a community or an organization, and ultimately the health and vitality of the

259
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,750
members of that community or organization. And then I mentioned in the intro that more

260
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,450
than 15,000 participants have gone through the leadership center that you've founded, and

261
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,170
you're passing on that leadership. So I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good

262
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:55,410
point. I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good

263
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:55,910
point. I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point.

264
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,250
I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point.

265
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:01,589
Great values around what we see modern leadership looking like, which is more empathy and more

266
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:07,309
collaboration and moving away from hierarchy. And you talk about that old model being bankrupt,

267
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:13,309
where leadership development programs in the past, they were aimed at two or three people who were

268
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:18,609
going to take on that next role of authority that you speak about. Can you explain that grass

269
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:24,210
movement community-based model, the sort of impact that you're seeing in your community on the back

270
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:24,410
of it?

271
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:30,970
The distinction is so important. Most leadership development programs in America, and I've had a

272
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,910
chance to spend a lot of time in Australia, I think it's fair to say that most of the leadership

273
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:42,529
development programs in Australia also are really about building the next group of authority

274
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:48,450
figures. That's really how they got started, these leadership development programs. And there's

275
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:54,130
nothing wrong with that per se, but we took a totally different approach.

276
00:18:54,410 --> 00:19:01,910
Our approach was saying, whether somebody is going to develop in their career to be the next CEO of

277
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:07,589
such and such organization or the next head of such and such political party, that doesn't matter to

278
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:15,650
us. What matters to us is that we are building the capacity of lots of people, whether they are on

279
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:22,829
the management track or not, to be more skilled at exercising leadership. It's a totally different

280
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:23,329
distinction.

281
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:32,529
After 17 years now and 15,000 people, we have enough experience to talk about the results

282
00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:40,029
of that. You talked about trust earlier, Luke. One of the things I'm so proud of is that the

283
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:46,410
research is now showing in organizations that have taken this approach to leadership development,

284
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:51,970
building the leadership capacity of everyone in the system, not just the people on the

285
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,029
management track.

286
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,589
And I think that's really important. I think that the most important thing is that people are more

287
00:19:56,589 --> 00:20:03,950
open to change. People trust what's going on more. Some of the other things that they see happen when

288
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:11,529
they build the leadership capacity of everyone is that people are more open to change. Change is

289
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:17,509
hard. And just to get people open to it is a big first step. But people, these cultures are

290
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:24,390
naturally more open to change. Two other big findings that have emerged from organizations and

291
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:29,990
communities that have saturated themselves with this type of leadership development. Things become

292
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:39,150
more equitable. Power is shared more broadly. More people have voice at the table, which leads to

293
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:45,269
better decisions and more buy-in on those decisions. And the last thing, and this one surprised

294
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:51,809
us, Luke, but as an athlete, you know the importance of taking care of yourself. And if you're not at

295
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:54,390
your best come game day, you're not going to be able to do your best. You're not going to be able to do your

296
00:20:54,390 --> 00:21:02,130
best for the team. These cultures also dramatically increase the value for self-care and

297
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:07,630
recognizing that exercising leadership is hard and people need to take care of themselves so

298
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:14,730
they're able to effectively exercise leadership, effectively disappoint people at a rate they can't

299
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,990
absorb, because that's hard work. So I love that that finding came about. It surprised us, but it's

300
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,369
an important one. Disappoint people at a rate they can't absorb. That's a fantastic

301
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,990
way to talk about leadership in lots of ways. Exercising leadership. I love the language you

302
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:35,509
use. And just to share with you for a moment, it's the world that we're really passionate about too

303
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:40,529
and the work we're doing with a leader and our Leader Connect program is really similar to what

304
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:46,769
your language is. And that is we're connecting Ed O'Malley from Kansas, who has had a great

305
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:51,710
presence in this style of leadership with someone from the world of the arts or with a sports person

306
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,210
or with someone in commerce or industry.

307
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:59,930
And finding that synergy and a bit like you describe, we see those positive ripples as being

308
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:04,589
a great benefit because hopefully in that shared environment where we facilitate these groups

309
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:08,710
around the globe, people do exercise better leadership and we learn from each other in a

310
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:13,910
really powerful way. And so it has been really interesting to listen to your story and to see

311
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:20,450
that happen at a state-based level, to have a center like this funded by the state, improving

312
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:24,230
better health outcomes. And yeah, really love the synergy.

313
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:29,829
Well, thank you, Luke. It's great to share some of the things we've learned here.

314
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:34,549
I know there's so much good leadership development work happening in Australia. I've had a chance to

315
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:39,210
connect with a lot of folks there over the years. And I love the work you're doing at spreading

316
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:47,990
these positive messages. I think leadership, if we assume it's easy, I think we're not going to

317
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:52,109
do ourselves any favors. But if we assume it's something we have to work at, which is why we

318
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:54,029
like to talk about the exercise of leadership.

319
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:59,750
Practice of leadership. You had to practice a lot back in your day, right? You went to practice

320
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,589
all the time. You went to training all the time. We think leadership is like that. We have to

321
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:10,470
keep developing those skills. And I appreciate how you are helping so many people practice

322
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,150
leadership and get better at their practice of leadership.

323
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:18,269
We love the term success leaves clues. And we've seen these common traits around what

324
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:23,309
modern leadership looks like in a positive form in our space. And we start with that

325
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:24,369
idea. One of the things that I've learned is that leadership is not just about the

326
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:28,970
dimensions of leadership we talk about in our world, Ed, is the idea of self-leadership and that

327
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:34,210
it's hard to lead someone else unless you have an idea of leading yourself. What does that term

328
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:39,589
mean to you? I love it. It makes me think about when you're on the airplane and they tell you to

329
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:45,630
put on your mask first before you help those around you. That if we're not putting ourselves

330
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:52,289
into the position to be most effective, it's going to be really hard to help mobilize others.

331
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:54,190
So I love it. We talk about

332
00:23:54,390 --> 00:24:01,269
managing self. And what we notice is often in the toughest challenges, we're getting emotionally

333
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:06,970
triggered. And part of exercising leadership is controlling those triggers and making very

334
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:12,809
conscious choices about how we engage and intervene. So I like your term of self-leadership,

335
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:16,730
though. That's good. I might steal it. The next dimension I want to ask you about is

336
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:21,829
how do we go about positively impacting others in our environment? And your life story is that

337
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:24,369
you were an elected official. You saw a gap and you went through a lot of things. And you're

338
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:30,750
founded this leadership center in Kansas. It's a great positive impact story. But maybe just on

339
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:37,430
the day-to-day, we see now really great leaders who exercise leadership conscious on a day-by-day

340
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:43,750
basis how they impact people positively. How have you gone about that? To me, what I'm noticing

341
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:50,990
right now, and especially because of how heavy things are in our world, I think the more people

342
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,190
who can help curate, help...

343
00:24:54,390 --> 00:25:02,849
Develop a positive, shared, bold vision. People, I think, are craving positive,

344
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:09,849
shared, bold visions. It's something different than offering a bold vision,

345
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:16,470
but somebody who can help a group come up with a bold vision so it's shared. That's something that

346
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:22,869
my sense is needed more. And I would encourage your listeners to be thinking more about

347
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,990
if we had more time, we could talk through some of those steps. How do you engage others,

348
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:34,450
not to sell them on your bold vision, but to help them craft and inform a shared

349
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:39,910
bold vision? Feels critical in these moments. Yeah, it's a great point, Ed. It does lead to

350
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:44,309
the next dimension. And maybe you can expand on that. How do you go about creating and sharing

351
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:49,609
your vision, which is a bold vision, isn't it? It's about community leadership and teaching

352
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:53,789
thousands and thousands of people to exercise leadership in a better way. And then that's

353
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:54,369
spreading across the world. And I think that's a great point. And I think that's a great point.

354
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:59,410
And then creating better health outcomes and better decision-making, it's bold. How have you

355
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:07,289
gone about sharing that and making the impact you want? Yeah. What comes to my mind, Luke, is

356
00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:15,930
I think we're often, especially in public life, we're arguing about our preferred strategy

357
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:24,369
rather than talking about our collective purpose or goal. And my sense is,

358
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:31,269
those who are most effective at exercising leadership, their vision is about the big goal

359
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:37,250
that a lot of people can get excited about. So like now at the Kansas Health Foundation,

360
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:45,549
our vision is for Kansas to lead the nation in health. The 50 states in the US are ranked every

361
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:52,690
year, one to 50. I can't bump into anybody who disagrees with the vision of us leading the nation

362
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,369
in health. We might disagree, but we're not going to disagree. And I think that's a great point.

363
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:59,849
We might disagree with how to make that happen. But if we can first agree on the vision,

364
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:05,309
well, then we're halfway there. And so one piece of advice I would have for those

365
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:12,809
wanting to exercise more leadership is to cast a vision that others can see themselves as a part

366
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:19,569
of. Debate the strategies later, but get them on board with the vision first. And when you get to

367
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:24,349
the point of debating strategies, be willing to let go of your own and embrace some of the

368
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:30,470
theirs. Focus on the vision. Focus on the goal. Be less loyal to your preferred strategy.

369
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:35,589
Yeah. Well said. It's a great way to think about it, isn't it? You can get halfway there on the

370
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:40,009
common ground, which is, as we said, a little bit harder in the modern world than it perhaps

371
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:44,190
used to be. But I love your thoughts on that. Curiosity is a word that comes up a lot in our

372
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:49,109
world, Ed. And we see these really successful modern leaders are so curious and through that

373
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:52,630
curiosity, they're constantly learning and developing. Does that resonate with you?

374
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,329
Yeah, it does. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

375
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:58,190
know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. If Ted Lasso has taken off in Australia like it

376
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:02,970
has in Australia. Sure has. What a great show. Oh, it's such a great show. But there's that

377
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:10,589
one episode, you know, where he talks about being curious, not judgmental. And I just thought that

378
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:18,230
was a great line. And it describes to me so much about leadership to be curious, not judgmental.

379
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:23,549
One of the problems, I think, with our current world is because we're so polarized,

380
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:30,130
um, most people in one faction have a lot of judgments about people in the other faction,

381
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:35,890
or, or if we just want to talk about politics, you know, conservatives have a lot of judgments

382
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:42,269
they make about progressives and, and vice versa. And I think those who exercise leadership

383
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:49,230
suspend their judgments and don't let themselves get emotionally triggered by those,

384
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:56,990
that rhetoric. And they instead get very curious about why somebody is doing what they're doing and,

385
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:01,589
and, and how they might engage with that person to help them maybe do something different.

386
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,990
Curiosity feels like a key ingredient to me for exercising effective leadership.

387
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:12,130
Yeah. Well said again. And for those that haven't seen Ted Lasso, I encourage you to go and do it.

388
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:17,349
You're not going to be disappointed. And talk about real life imitating art. I know a lot of,

389
00:29:17,349 --> 00:29:19,210
you know, senior coaches in leagues,

390
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:24,950
around the world, you know, reference and use Ted Lasso and, and, and see that as really the style

391
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:30,349
of leadership that they want to, to exercise. It's a, it's fascinating. And the shift in leadership

392
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:35,650
in sport ed is profound, you know, from the era I played in where it was just command and control

393
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:41,230
and hierarchy and you got yelled at and you either, you know, coped or you didn't, you know,

394
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:48,750
the Ted Lasso approach seems to be without even being serious for a moment. It's genuinely a

395
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,210
healthier way of doing things.

396
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:53,849
Yeah. So the next generation want to work collaboratively and they want to be thought

397
00:29:53,849 --> 00:29:58,829
of and cared for in that way, which is a profound shift and a positive shift as well. Communicating

398
00:29:58,829 --> 00:30:03,109
with clarity is another dimension I want to ask you about. And you've got a great way. You're an

399
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:09,150
author of four books and your latest book is, is brilliant. I was having a read of it when everyone

400
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:13,410
leads and you talk about that language very, very consistently. How have you gone about

401
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:18,650
communicating your message? Yeah. The word intentionality comes to mind.

402
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:23,529
And I'm the type of person who likes to think out loud.

403
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,430
I don't know what I think until I start talking half the time.

404
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:46,170
And I've had to learn that in moments when I'm trying to intervene, to exercise leadership, to mobilize a group of people to think differently, to do something differently, I need to be very intentional about what I'm communicating and why I'm communicating.

405
00:30:46,170 --> 00:31:05,029
And I think of it a lot as like an experimental mindset that as we engage with others, we're trying to exercise leadership to have a hypothesis about what I think is going on and what I think my intervention is going to do.

406
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:07,410
And then to evaluate, well, did it do it?

407
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,170
Did it work?

408
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,069
Was I successful?

409
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:10,990
Most of the time, I'm not.

410
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,150
But that's okay.

411
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:13,190
Learn from it.

412
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,609
Then intervene again intentionally.

413
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:18,609
But leadership is all about communication.

414
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,970
I think the key is intentional communication.

415
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:25,430
Strategic conscious choices is the key.

416
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:28,569
How important has collaboration been for you, Ed?

417
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:32,309
Yeah, I think it's massive.

418
00:31:33,009 --> 00:31:40,650
And what I've learned over the years is collaboration is really easy when the stakes are low.

419
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:45,009
But when the stakes are high and maybe resources are limited.

420
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:47,910
Then collaboration is hard.

421
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:53,930
And I've seen lots of situations where people begin by collaborating.

422
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,410
But then when the things get hard, the collaboration breaks down.

423
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:10,910
To me, real leadership is looking at a situation, knowing the factions, whether the factions in the company or the factions in the community or the factions in the state or the factions in the nation.

424
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:14,890
Knowing the factions, you need to come together.

425
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:15,490
Okay.

426
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:15,529
Okay.

427
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:15,569
Okay.

428
00:32:15,569 --> 00:32:15,589
Okay.

429
00:32:15,589 --> 00:32:15,609
Okay.

430
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:21,890
And then creating the conditions for collaboration among those factions.

431
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:32,730
So going back to the gun violence debate in America, there is no table right now where those factions are together in a productive way.

432
00:32:33,329 --> 00:32:38,309
And I think until that table exists, I don't know how we make progress on that horrific issue.

433
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,009
But that's what leadership does.

434
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:45,549
It creates the conditions for the right factions to be together, to collaborate.

435
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:47,069
and find a way forward.

436
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:48,809
I love your point, isn't it?

437
00:32:48,829 --> 00:32:50,730
It's easy when the stakes are low, isn't it?

438
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:54,750
But you raise the bar and it just gets significantly harder,

439
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,710
even though we might have the intention to want to collaborate.

440
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:58,650
So it's a great point.

441
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,730
I've been asking these two questions of everyone I've sat down with,

442
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,190
and I love talking to you from Kansas in the U.S. today

443
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:10,349
and your unique take on what community leadership looks like.

444
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,549
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

445
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:14,650
Oh, wow.

446
00:33:15,549 --> 00:33:21,329
I mean, so many, but one that comes to mind, perhaps, Luke,

447
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:26,369
because of your athletic background, but a phenomenal coach in this part

448
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:30,430
of the world, a man named Bill Snyder, was the head football coach

449
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,130
at Kansas State University.

450
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:35,369
You all might know that we're kind of crazy about college sports

451
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:40,089
here in America, and Coach Snyder became a dear friend and mentor,

452
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:45,529
and it was a classic turnaround from, like, the worst program in America

453
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:48,650
to one of the best programs in America.

454
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:56,589
And what I learned from him was the power of taking a long time horizon,

455
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:00,890
of realizing that we have to have a sense of urgency,

456
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:06,410
but we also have to stay at this for years and just keep –

457
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,170
he used to say, you've got to keep just sawing the wood,

458
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,809
just keep sawing the wood, and eventually that tree is going to come down.

459
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,510
So Coach Bill Snyder comes to mind.

460
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:20,789
And when I was in politics, I had a chance to author a bill

461
00:34:20,789 --> 00:34:24,050
that named the highway that leads up to the stadium after him.

462
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:27,070
He's long since retired, but he's the one that comes to mind.

463
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,849
There's so many others, and I think that's one thing that people do

464
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:33,190
who want to get better at exercising leadership.

465
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:37,730
They surround themselves with inspirational people who exercise

466
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,210
the type of leadership they want to do.

467
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,530
I've tried to do that myself.

468
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,769
Yeah, it's why we love sharing these stories, isn't it?

469
00:34:43,769 --> 00:34:45,329
It's a great opportunity, isn't it, to hear?

470
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:48,670
Coach Snyder and keep sawing the wood and the long-term horizon

471
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:52,530
and that opportunity, isn't it, to learn from someone

472
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,369
with a completely different background and where sport crosses over

473
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:56,510
with public life for you.

474
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,610
Always curious and fascinated about that.

475
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:03,730
The Kansas Leadership Center, as I described, a beacon of hope for me

476
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:09,670
around what elected officials can do if you choose to really live a life

477
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,329
with purpose.

478
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:13,929
If you could collaborate with anyone on anything, Ed,

479
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:17,889
given the power of your vision, is there someone that springs to mind

480
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:21,610
that you thought, that's the person that I could really accelerate our work with?

481
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:25,650
Yeah, you know, what comes to my mind, Luke, is I've had a chance,

482
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,889
because the Kansas Leadership Center is so unique, there's nothing quite like it

483
00:35:29,889 --> 00:35:34,590
in terms of the scale, the focus, the belief that leadership is an activity.

484
00:35:35,309 --> 00:35:39,250
I've had a chance over the years to help inspire similar efforts

485
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,230
around the world.

486
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:46,150
And what I would love is a formal way for those groups to collaborate.

487
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:49,590
So there are some in Australia, like Leadership Victoria.

488
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:53,429
There's the Massa Leadership Initiative in Jerusalem.

489
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:56,409
There's Sistema Italia in Italy.

490
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,849
There's the Hawaii Leadership Forum.

491
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:04,170
There's probably a few dozen of these efforts around the globe

492
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:07,489
that I think share a lot of the similar beliefs and principles

493
00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:08,670
we've talked about today.

494
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,110
And I would love...

495
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:17,630
I would love a global collaboration to dismantle the bad leadership

496
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,489
that exists and help promote this new vision of leadership

497
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:23,469
that you share, that I share, that we're all working on.

498
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,849
That would be my dream.

499
00:36:25,389 --> 00:36:26,510
Well, what a dream that is.

500
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:29,750
And, you know, it's fascinating, Ed, isn't it, that I'm sitting here

501
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,530
in Victoria, don't know anything about Leadership Victoria,

502
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,789
but I'm reading about the Leadership Kansas Center

503
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:37,949
that you've created.

504
00:36:37,949 --> 00:36:38,670
And I'm with you.

505
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,030
If we could spread more of that.

506
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,889
If we could spread more positivity, understand more, as you said,

507
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,969
that leadership's not authority.

508
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,949
It is about exercising leadership.

509
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:46,949
It's a skill.

510
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:47,650
It's not easy.

511
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,150
It's something we can all do.

512
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:51,150
And you don't have to have a title to do it.

513
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:53,730
And you can do it on a daily basis with your own family,

514
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,809
and you can actually create better outcomes.

515
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,070
It's a great story, Ed.

516
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,449
I'm fascinated by it.

517
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:01,230
Really incredible what you've been up to.

518
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:02,730
And I really appreciate your time today.

519
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:03,369
Thanks for joining me.

520
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,869
Luke, thanks for the opportunity.

521
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,469
Thanks for doing what you do.

522
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:08,630
And we'd love to connect again in the future.

523
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:09,469
I appreciate your work.

524
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,170
