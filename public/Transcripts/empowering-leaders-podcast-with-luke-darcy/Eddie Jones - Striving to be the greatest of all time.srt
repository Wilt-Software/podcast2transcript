A Listener Production.

2
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:09,279
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

3
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:13,179
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,939
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,859
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,600
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,760
in education, sport, industry and the arts

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,739
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

9
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,199
where everyone has a voice.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,780
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:51,710
Eddie Jones was born in Burnie, Tasmania

12
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,990
to a Japanese mother and an Australian father.

13
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,109
Eddie's lifelong dedication to the sport of rugby union

14
00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:58,990
began at Mattreville Sports High

15
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,390
playing alongside the legendary Ella Brothers.

16
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:05,370
His playing career included 147 first grade games for RAM

17
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,629
where he can represent in New South Wales on 13 occasions.

18
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,090
His working life started as a teacher and school principal

19
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,370
before transitioning into a professional rugby coaching career

20
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,390
that has seen him at the highest level of international rugby union

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,829
for more than 25 years.

22
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,590
Including stints as the national coach of Australia,

23
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,069
South Africa, Japan and currently as head coach of English rugby.

24
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,689
Eddie has coached at four rugby world cups

25
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,230
reaching the final on three occasions

26
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,709
as well as a win as an assistant in the 2007 world cup

27
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:36,670
with the South Africans.

28
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,829
He's an author including his latest book

29
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:41,390
Eddie Jones Leadership Lessons from a Life in Rugby.

30
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,109
He's married to his Japanese born wife Hiroko

31
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:45,109
and they have a daughter Chelsea.

32
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,969
Eddie, it's an incredible life that you've had.

33
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:48,769
It's an extraordinary job.

34
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:49,590
It's been a journey of leadership.

35
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,510
I really appreciate you joining me today.

36
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,549
Nice to be here, Luke.

37
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,549
Thanks for your time.

38
00:01:54,730 --> 00:02:00,230
Now, you start to me and I've really enjoyed reading in preparation for this

39
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:05,170
but you strike me as a lifelong learner, a constant self-improver.

40
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,370
Where does that come from within you?

41
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:09,870
Well, I really don't know.

42
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:11,469
Yeah, I was lucky.

43
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,349
I was brought up in eastern suburbs of Sydney.

44
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:17,710
Yeah, we were a working class family.

45
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,810
Sport was the way to, as a half Japanese, half Australian.

46
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:25,389
Yeah, I was quite unusual back then.

47
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,569
Yeah, I remember the primary class I was in,

48
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,409
there was about six Aboriginal boys, an Egyptian boy and myself

49
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:35,009
and everyone else was Anglo-Saxons.

50
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:37,729
So you had to find a way to be part of the group

51
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:42,409
and the only way I could be part of the group was being good at sports.

52
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,469
So, yeah, I tried to be good at rugby union,

53
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:46,610
tried to be good at cricket.

54
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:53,469
And maybe that experience then led me to always want to keep improving.

55
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,229
Yeah, and you've been lucky enough to play at the highest level

56
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:02,569
and I've been lucky enough to play a little bit and coach.

57
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,189
You're so privileged to be in this role and you want to keep improving

58
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:09,210
and you want to keep giving the players the best experience you can.

59
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,349
Eddie, I want to go to November 2019.

60
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:13,370
It's the World Cup semi-final.

61
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,370
You coach England to a famous win over...

62
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,449
the legendary All Blacks

63
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:23,629
and you've since described it as close to sporting perfection as it gets

64
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:27,889
and then seven days later, painful loss to South Africa in the final.

65
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:29,110
You lose 32-12.

66
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,509
Can you take us through what's that like as a leader?

67
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:36,050
You know, the learnings, the joy of being close to perfect

68
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,849
and then I suppose the pain at the end of it all.

69
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:40,530
How do you process that when you look back?

70
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,409
Yeah, I go through it every day, mate.

71
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,530
Look, the...

72
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,490
You still think about...

73
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,569
You still think about that regularly?

74
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,110
Oh, how I could have done that week better

75
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:56,810
because, you know, to beat New Zealand, you've got to be at your best

76
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,490
and you know then to win the final, you've got to be close to your best

77
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,509
and the challenge of coaching is always when you've got a team really humming

78
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:12,169
and it takes a bit out of them to be right at their best, you know,

79
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:16,170
when everything's working well, to get them particularly...

80
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:21,649
particularly in the English rugby environment where the next day,

81
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:26,209
you know, everything's like we're the gods of rugby, you know,

82
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:30,290
and the players, unfortunately, they're human, they hear that

83
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,209
and to try to bring them down and get them back up, I wasn't able to do

84
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:38,050
and if I had my time again, I'd try something a little bit different

85
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,850
but I don't know whether it'll work, you know,

86
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,129
and that's always a challenge of coaching at this level.

87
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,970
You know, you've got to get them right but when you're in a tournament,

88
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,550
you want to be about 98% for the semi and 100% for the final as close as you can.

89
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,449
And the beauty of sitting there talking to you now is that you've reloaded again

90
00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:01,110
and you're on the path to the next World Cup, you know,

91
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:05,149
a couple of years away from the journey but you're really systematic

92
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:09,310
about the way that you coach and methodical about learnings

93
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,269
and resetting a vision, you have to ask yourself first whether or not

94
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:16,589
you felt like you were up for that challenge but you mentioned it earlier,

95
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:22,610
the window now from criticism to, and the English media are renowned at it,

96
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:26,790
I mean, we see it here in Australia, it's brutal, I think it's got out of hand

97
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,230
almost crazy, we've got huge issues with our senior coaches back here

98
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,970
and the scrutiny they face has, I think, gone out of control

99
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:39,009
but England's another level, Eddie, they come for you in ways often uneducated,

100
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,689
even someone who doesn't follow, I can see what you're doing,

101
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,170
you're rebuilding, you're giving younger players an opportunity,

102
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,209
you have to go back to go forward, really.

103
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:46,410
Really.

104
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,529
That makes sense but how do you deal with that pressure,

105
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,889
how do you, you know, that constant pressure that comes your way?

106
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:56,509
The good thing that experience is getting old that gives you

107
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:00,490
is that you understand it really doesn't matter, like, you know,

108
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:05,110
you've got a job to do, rebuilding a team at the international level,

109
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,170
like it is at any level, is difficult, particularly when the expectation

110
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,470
is that you keep winning, you know, there's always,

111
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:15,930
you don't want it but there's, generally speaking,

112
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:16,470
a bit of a performance.

113
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,230
There's a bit of a performance dropout where you get the gap

114
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,350
between the older players who are sometimes declining

115
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,209
and the younger players aren't quite ready and you get the team

116
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:29,009
at its best when you get that right mix and we're a little bit away from that

117
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:34,089
so, you know, the beauty of being a bit older is that I don't listen to it,

118
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:37,269
I don't read it, I don't know it, even though I ring my mum,

119
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,509
she's 97 now, she's in Sydney, she reads everything and she said,

120
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:44,350
is it true what they said about you, you're going to get the sack?

121
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,509
So I get that every morning, I ring her.

122
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,829
You know, so you still hear it but I just get on with it

123
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:53,930
and literally I just laugh about it now and, you know,

124
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:56,129
I've got a job to do, I'll do it as well as I can

125
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:59,810
and if people decide I'm not good enough then I'll do something else, mate.

126
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:04,449
And it doesn't penetrate, I mean, that sounds easy when you say it like that

127
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:07,689
but in reality, you know, you have to front up at press conferences,

128
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:10,829
you have to answer these questions, I mean, some of it's craziness

129
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:13,290
and stupid and it's aimed to try and get a reaction out of you,

130
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,009
that's really what a lot of journalists are trying to do.

131
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:21,009
They're sophisticated in trying to see if they can unravel you at stages

132
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:23,029
but you've really got to the level where, you know,

133
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,790
apart from a call from mum, you can brush it aside.

134
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:28,089
Ah, well, it's always there, mate.

135
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,850
Yeah, the reality is it's there and you think about it, you know,

136
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:35,329
I woke up at four this morning thinking about the team, you know,

137
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:41,689
so you're thinking about it, you think, you know, sometimes you do think

138
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:45,389
what they're saying, is it right, is there some truth to it

139
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:46,589
and sometimes you've got to try.

140
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,550
You've got to pick out because there are some good bits there

141
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:54,149
but I think we've got a pretty good plan and I know, you know,

142
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:59,209
the people, one of which is Neil, you know, we feel like we're

143
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:03,290
in a good position even though the external results doesn't seem

144
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,550
like that so we've just got to keep plugging away, mate,

145
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:07,250
keep chipping away at the stone.

146
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:10,990
I wasn't going to go to you but I need to go back to the Ella brothers

147
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,350
and your school has produced some serious athletes in rugby

148
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,350
and rugby unions.

149
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,569
Can you just describe for those who maybe don't follow your code

150
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:24,910
as closely, they're legendary icons, the Ella brothers, aren't they?

151
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,910
Yeah, no, three Ella boys.

152
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,129
I remember going to the first kindergarten class, first day

153
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:36,250
and there's three Aboriginal boys sitting there and no one knew

154
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,169
what they were to become.

155
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:42,090
You know, they changed the rugby world, changed the Australian fortune

156
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,889
in rugby and Mark particularly, who was the most driven of the three,

157
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,509
captain of Australia when he was 25, went on a Grand Slam tour

158
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,750
to England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, scored a try and each try,

159
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:57,450
captain at 25, retires at 26.

160
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:03,929
Yeah, they were like, well, for the Aussie rural supporters,

161
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:05,350
they were like the Cracker brothers.

162
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,309
You know, they could do anything with the ball.

163
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:10,830
They had this innate sense of being able to find each other on the field

164
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,730
and they just changed the way the game was played from being quite

165
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,570
a stodgy kid.

166
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:21,789
It was a kicking field position game to be this free-flowing ball retention,

167
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,250
ball movement type game.

168
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:27,110
Twelve siblings sleeping on the floor of that house just around the corner

169
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:32,289
from where you grew up and you write about it beautifully in your book

170
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:36,409
but the field of sport and what that did for them and their family

171
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,610
and what they passed on was extraordinary.

172
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,830
I wanted to sort of transition.

173
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,929
You've been someone who's constantly sought out learning opportunities

174
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:46,049
and sharing of information.

175
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:50,570
Head coach of English Rugby, you've had access to iconic coaches,

176
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,629
Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger, Pep Guardiola and Gareth Southgate

177
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:55,450
to name a few.

178
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:57,269
Have you picked up a pattern?

179
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:00,629
Is there some consistent behaviours that you see from the great leaders

180
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:01,389
you've been involved with?

181
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:02,970
Yeah, I think there is, mate.

182
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:08,610
And I think they've all got a very clear vision about how they want

183
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,129
the team to operate and then they're really good at,

184
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:15,889
in each team environment, understanding what to prioritise

185
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:16,549
and what not to prioritise.

186
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:22,389
I think the second big thing is that they're always good judges

187
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:26,990
of talent and character and I wouldn't separate talent and character.

188
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:28,750
I'd almost put them together.

189
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,889
And then thirdly, they've got an insatiable appetite to keep winning.

190
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,730
Yeah, it's a fascinating summation that clearly you've put some thought into

191
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,409
and you have reached out beyond the sporting arena and I'm fascinated.

192
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:45,769
You've struck up a friendship with Tadashi.

193
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:49,789
In IE, I hope I pronounced that correctly, the founder of Uniqlo.

194
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:54,409
And for those that aren't aware, Uniqlo is close to the biggest retailer

195
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:58,610
in the world, maybe behind the giant Zara in Spain.

196
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,370
But it went from literally zero to a current, I think his personal net worth

197
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,389
is $45 billion.

198
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:06,570
Now, you've spent some time with Tadashi.

199
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,610
What lessons have you taken from his extraordinary story?

200
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,470
Nothing's impossible, mate.

201
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:15,629
Yeah, he started off running a small,

202
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:21,769
retail store in Western Tokyo and he had this dream to be the biggest

203
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:25,549
casual maker of clothes in the world.

204
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:30,870
And in 20 years or whatever it is, I think he's, at one stage,

205
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:31,669
they were number one.

206
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:33,529
I think last year they got to number one.

207
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:39,289
I remember I went and did a bit of a lecture for their employees

208
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:44,610
and I finished and it was, you know, it was quite an open,

209
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,110
engaging.

210
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:47,690
Fun type chat.

211
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,309
And he got up and he was so, again,

212
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,669
so relentless about wanting them to keep driving, keep being better.

213
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:59,149
And, you know, I was lucky enough to coach Japan as well.

214
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,710
And we were able to go to a World Cup.

215
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,250
They hadn't won a World Cup game for 24 years and we win,

216
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:07,529
we beat South Africa.

217
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,450
And so it shows you if you've got a dream and you're prepared to work hard,

218
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,009
you're prepared to try to find,

219
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:18,929
a way to be slightly different that you can,

220
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:20,870
you can achieve great things in this world.

221
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,669
I love the overlap, Eddie, between, you know,

222
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:24,990
sport and the commercial world.

223
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,830
You've bridged that gap a lot and you've consulted with,

224
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,029
with big firms along the journey as well and done lots of work in that space.

225
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:36,110
I mean, are you always open to that learning experience?

226
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,049
I mean, I suppose when you have access to leaders like that and their stories,

227
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,490
has it been really valuable for you along the way?

228
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,529
Yeah, I think just reinforcing, I think, you know,

229
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,490
as when,

230
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:49,110
when you're involved in sport and as a coach,

231
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:50,350
you're always doubting yourself.

232
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:50,889
Yeah.

233
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,809
I wake up this morning and I'm thinking, yeah,

234
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:55,330
am I good enough to coach England?

235
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,710
Yeah.

236
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:57,809
And that's the reality.

237
00:12:57,909 --> 00:12:59,490
I think most coaches are like that.

238
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,370
And I think most successful people are like that.

239
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:03,970
They doubt themselves a fair bit,

240
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:05,649
but they also then,

241
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:08,649
then have a belief that they can do something.

242
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:09,409
So it's this,

243
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:12,190
I reckon it's this intriguing mix of,

244
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,750
of not knowing,

245
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:14,610
but knowing,

246
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:16,490
and then trying to reach,

247
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:18,649
out to find a little bit better information.

248
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:20,330
Cause there's always smarter people out there.

249
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:21,110
Yeah.

250
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:25,070
There's always more than you and that's the challenge to keep finding them.

251
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:25,610
Yeah.

252
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,649
And I love that you're open enough and it's true,

253
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:29,029
isn't it?

254
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:29,269
I mean,

255
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:29,549
you,

256
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:30,389
everyone,

257
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:30,789
you know,

258
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:31,330
not everyone,

259
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,070
I think there's probably categories of people that don't,

260
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:34,730
but that,

261
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,429
that mix of self doubt and that drive then to want to get better,

262
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,049
even when you've achieved,

263
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:40,289
you know,

264
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:42,009
people would find that staggering.

265
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:42,250
I mean,

266
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,269
Eddie Jones is the pinnacle of sport has had success everywhere.

267
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:49,629
You've gone every organisation you've touched has got better,

268
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:50,529
but yeah,

269
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,269
you still wake up some mornings and think,

270
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:52,690
you know,

271
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,649
am I good enough?

272
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:53,830
That,

273
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,009
that,

274
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:54,909
that still happens daily.

275
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:55,389
Yeah.

276
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:57,149
And then you look at someone like Federer,

277
00:13:57,149 --> 00:13:57,409
might,

278
00:13:57,409 --> 00:13:57,909
you know,

279
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,049
who's been the best tennis player for maybe the last 20 years,

280
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:03,669
still has a tennis coach.

281
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:03,909
What,

282
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:04,210
you know,

283
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,309
why would a guy like him need a tennis coach?

284
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,870
It just goes to show you,

285
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,070
you know,

286
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,669
there's always a way to get better.

287
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:09,889
And,

288
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,549
and if you've got that approach,

289
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:13,870
then there's no limit to what you can do.

290
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:14,769
I love one of the,

291
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:16,149
the quotes in your book.

292
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:16,250
And,

293
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:18,009
and I'm going to read it back to you.

294
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,230
If I was running a business now,

295
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:22,649
the first person I would employ would be a learning expert.

296
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:24,730
The pressing question for me is always,

297
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,730
how can I create a better learning environment?

298
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,850
Can you expand on why that's so,

299
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:30,730
so important for you?

300
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:31,230
Well,

301
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:32,850
I just think particularly,

302
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,450
you know,

303
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,769
coming from an era where I grew up,

304
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,169
where,

305
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:36,929
you know,

306
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:38,950
we were told what to do and you were happy,

307
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,190
you're quite happy to follow instructions to a large extent.

308
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,649
But the world's now,

309
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:45,169
you know,

310
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:46,710
over the last 30 years,

311
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:48,889
the changes in the world have been remarkable.

312
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:49,090
And,

313
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:54,610
and part of that is that I think that everyone who's involved in a high performance

314
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:00,590
organisation now wants to be a contributor.

315
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,309
They don't just want to be told.

316
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:06,929
So the ability to create an environment where people have the opportunity to learn,

317
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,330
where people have the opportunity to voice their opinion is just so important.

318
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,009
And yeah,

319
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:14,789
we've been lucky enough with England over the last period of time,

320
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,789
to have Neil Craig involved with us.

321
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,350
He was a very successful Adelaide Crows coach and,

322
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,669
and was involved in Australian cycling.

323
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:28,129
So he's added to that learning environment and using a guy called Doug Lemoff over the last period of time.

324
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:30,210
And I've been lucky enough to be involved in a,

325
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:30,870
you know,

326
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,429
a coaching get together.

327
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:34,809
It's the most fun thing I do each,

328
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:35,889
each couple of weeks.

329
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:36,149
You know,

330
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,450
we've got Brian Gorshin,

331
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,889
Ange Postakoslis,

332
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:40,889
Luke,

333
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,110
Neil Craig,

334
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:44,769
and Matt from ACS.

335
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:45,509
Runs this,

336
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:47,889
this great learning environment.

337
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,169
So if you can role model it yourself,

338
00:15:50,169 --> 00:15:52,789
you've got a great opportunity to do it in your organisation.

339
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:53,409
Yeah.

340
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:53,850
Thank you.

341
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:54,049
Eddie,

342
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,230
I wanted to mention,

343
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:58,870
mention that and a great passion of mine and my great friend,

344
00:15:58,950 --> 00:15:59,149
Matt,

345
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,129
what a witch who I grew up with and,

346
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,129
and the idea of connecting extraordinary leaders like you guys together.

347
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:06,669
And a leader connect is the,

348
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,389
is the programme,

349
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,929
as you mentioned the group before Luke Beveridge,

350
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,649
the Bulldogs coach,

351
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,450
Ange Postakosli,

352
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:11,950
Brian Gorge and Neil Craig.

353
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:12,929
I want to speak to you a lot about,

354
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:14,570
because I know he's had a big influence on you.

355
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:19,710
And the AFL world will know Neil with his incredible reputation in high

356
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,169
performance,

357
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:22,350
but what you have done Eddie,

358
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:23,350
and we're grateful for it.

359
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:27,610
You're inspiring lots of other people who are connecting with us to join a

360
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,870
programme like a leader connect.

361
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,769
And we've got a spreadsheet full of names from diverse backgrounds and from

362
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:33,289
education,

363
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,889
from sport and from industry and from every area.

364
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:36,169
Can you,

365
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:40,350
can you explain why reflecting with other leaders in forums like that is a,

366
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,470
is a really worthwhile thing in your mind?

367
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,429
I reckon in the most common way,

368
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,669
it's like alcoholics,

369
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:46,549
alcoholics,

370
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:46,950
anonymous,

371
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:47,389
mate,

372
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:48,710
you get in there,

373
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:49,870
all the coaches give you,

374
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:54,049
and you can share every story about what's not going right,

375
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:55,470
where you'd like a bit of help.

376
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:56,970
And you,

377
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:58,210
and all the coaches,

378
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:58,750
because,

379
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,809
because we're non-competitors and because we're all,

380
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:02,230
I think,

381
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:02,570
you know,

382
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,509
really want to learn,

383
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:05,670
they share what they've done.

384
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,269
And you might just find a different nuance way to,

385
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:11,829
to handle a problem that you've got as well as,

386
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,509
as provide just a forum to have a bit of,

387
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:15,509
a bit of fun.

388
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:16,509
Cause I think,

389
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:17,509
you know,

390
00:17:17,509 --> 00:17:18,509
we all started sport cause we loved it.

391
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:19,509
And it's so,

392
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:20,509
you know,

393
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:21,509
it's so serious.

394
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:22,509
Now you lose,

395
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:23,509
like I was looking at the AFL,

396
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,509
you lose three games now and the coach's heads on the chopping block.

397
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:27,509
Yeah.

398
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:31,509
So it's so serious now that they have the opportunity just to have a bit of

399
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,509
fun and talk about how it is.

400
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:36,509
It's just fantastic as well as being a great learning medium.

401
00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:38,509
And Matt does a great job.

402
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:39,509
Yeah.

403
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:40,509
Thank you for,

404
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:41,509
for,

405
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:42,509
for that.

406
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:43,509
I mean,

407
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:44,509
that's,

408
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:46,509
that's what that can do for people.

409
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:48,509
And you described it beautifully.

410
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:50,509
And I suppose historically Eddie,

411
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:51,509
us males,

412
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:53,509
us Aussie males in particular,

413
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:54,509
weren't great at,

414
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:57,509
at opening up and you've adapted your coaching brilliantly the next

415
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:58,509
generation.

416
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:00,509
And you are incredibly vulnerable as a coach,

417
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:03,509
you put your hand up regularly and you've done that in,

418
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:04,509
in post-teen meetings and said,

419
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:05,509
Hey,

420
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:06,509
that that's,

421
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:07,509
that's mine today.

422
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:08,509
I didn't prepare you well enough,

423
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:09,509
which is,

424
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:10,509
which is a remarkable evolution,

425
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:11,509
you know,

426
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:12,509
for someone who's been at it as long as you have.

427
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:13,509
And I suppose that's,

428
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,509
that's one of the things we see has been really beneficial,

429
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:16,509
isn't it?

430
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:17,509
You combine the fun part,

431
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:19,509
but also with the support part.

432
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:22,509
And it sounds like from the outside that you do challenge each other as

433
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:23,509
well on the way you think.

434
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:24,509
So it's,

435
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:25,509
it's a pretty powerful medium,

436
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:26,509
isn't it?

437
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:27,509
Yeah,

438
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:28,509
no,

439
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:29,509
it's fantastic mate.

440
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:30,509
You know,

441
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,509
and,

442
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:32,509
and you look at the,

443
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:33,509
the people involved in it,

444
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:34,509
in completely different experiences,

445
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:35,509
like Ang is in Celtic now in,

446
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:36,509
in probably,

447
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:37,509
yeah,

448
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:38,509
one of the,

449
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:40,509
the most intense rivalries there is in world sports.

450
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:41,509
And,

451
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:42,509
and doing well.

452
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:43,509
Luke's looking out,

453
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:44,509
trying to rebuild the Bulldogs again.

454
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:45,509
Yeah.

455
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:46,509
Brian Gorgian's,

456
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:47,509
I don't know how old Brian is.

457
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:48,509
You know,

458
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:49,509
I can remember,

459
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:50,509
I can remember as a kid watching him coach Sydney Kings,

460
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:51,509
you know,

461
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:52,509
up and down the sideline,

462
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:53,509
ranting and raving.

463
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:54,509
And he's still doing a great job.

464
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:55,509
And there's a great Twitter snap of him coaching the Hawks on the weekend,

465
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,509
where he's still got that passion and that unbelievable desire to win.

466
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:57,509
So,

467
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:58,509
and,

468
00:18:58,509 --> 00:18:59,509
and,

469
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:00,509
and,

470
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:01,509
and,

471
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:02,509
and,

472
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:03,509
and,

473
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,509
and,

474
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:05,509
and,

475
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:06,509
and,

476
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:07,509
and,

477
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:08,509
and,

478
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:09,509
and,

479
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:10,509
and,

480
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:11,509
and,

481
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:12,509
and,

482
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:13,509
and,

483
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:14,509
and,

484
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:15,509
and,

485
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:16,509
and,

486
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:17,509
and,

487
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:18,509
and,

488
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:19,509
and,

489
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:20,509
and,

490
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:21,509
and,

491
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:22,509
and,

492
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:23,509
and,

493
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:24,509
and,

494
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:25,509
and,

495
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:26,509
and,

496
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:27,509
and,

497
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:28,509
and,

498
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:29,509
and,

499
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:30,509
and,

500
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:31,509
and,

501
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:32,509
and,

502
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:33,509
and,

503
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:34,509
and,

504
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:35,509
and,

505
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:36,509
and,

506
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,509
and,

507
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,509
and,

508
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:39,509
and,

509
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:40,509
and,

510
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:47,769
Yeah, that's right. I'm sure he tells you about it. But you call him your truth teller and it's

511
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:53,170
a role that you really seek out, having someone, and he's a pretty direct human being, Neil Craig,

512
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:59,190
so he challenges you along the way. Why is that so important for you at this stage of your life

513
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:05,289
to have someone like him in your world? Well, I'll tell you, mate, if I was to go back 20 years now

514
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:11,190
and I was to be given the job of Australia, the first thing I'd go and do is find a Neil Craig

515
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:17,349
because I think you always need someone there because when you're the head coach or the head

516
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:23,029
of any organisation, people are less inclined to tell you the truth and the longer you're in the

517
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:29,750
job, the less inclined they are. So there's almost like you've been in the job and you're in it

518
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:35,269
longer and you get less of the truth and you need it. You need to have the input of

519
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:42,089
other people in the organisation telling you what needs to be done. So, yeah, Neil and I have

520
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:47,230
a very simple process. Even now, I'll ring him most mornings and we'll have a chat. We'll go for

521
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:54,250
coffee every morning about seven o'clock, review the day, chat about the day ahead. Who do we need

522
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:59,690
to talk to? Who needs a bit of love? Who needs a bit more instruction? And it just sets the day in

523
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,809
place and he gives me feedback on how I communicate to the players, how I communicate to the coaches.

524
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:10,890
And it's just absolutely invaluable. You've modelled that in some ways and you

525
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:16,329
mentioned this. Steve Kerr is a triple NBA championship coach now with the Golden State

526
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:21,650
Warriors, was part of the Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls, got an extraordinary history. But the first

527
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:27,349
thing he did was fine. Rod Adams, I think off the top of my head is the name. He was well into his

528
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:32,630
70s now, I think, still an assistant coach and still playing that role. So it's something that

529
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,250
you've seen work pretty well from afar. Yeah.

530
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:42,170
I was lucky enough to have a Zoom with Ron. Yeah, I think this was last year. He was still

531
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:49,829
assistant coach and his role was completely to give Steve the truth, you know, because his

532
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:55,589
approach to coaching and Steve's approach was completely different. Steve's a very, you know,

533
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:02,190
sort of West Coast, engage everyone, make everyone happy, whereas Ron's are more fundamentals,

534
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,069
you know, let's coach hard. So that, again,

535
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:12,069
really great mix of philosophies, getting the right environment for the teams, obviously work

536
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:24,799
for them. And, you know, Neil does the same for us. The family support part, I wanted to ask you

537
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:31,680
about Eddie and your beautiful wife. I think you're right that in the 29 or so years of marriage,

538
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,700
and I'll make sure I get that right, almost all of those apart from three, you've been an

539
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,359
international coach. That is, you know, a lot of commitment on the road and travelling and,

540
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:47,200
I mentioned, you've coached all around the world. So to have that support must be quite

541
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,539
extraordinary. And then you mentioned that she's only twice asked you, challenged you on rugby

542
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:56,799
questions. It's not really her thing and she loves your passion for it. But both times it was around

543
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,359
people you'd employed and whether they were the right character. And you say that she was spot

544
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:06,599
on. Can you talk about that support and I suppose the intuition that she's had for you a couple of

545
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:11,359
times? Yeah, well, I think, you know, because my wife's been around,

546
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:16,579
the team all the time, she's got a sense of what's right and what's wrong. And I can always

547
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:22,519
remember with Australia, she said about one assistant coach and then she said it about

548
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:29,240
England here and she's been right both times. And she tells me she's always right. So, yeah.

549
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,799
And the reason we've been able to stay in marriage is because most of the time I've

550
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:40,759
agreed that she is right. It is an extraordinary support. Now, to have that for you to go on and

551
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:41,480
continue to do.

552
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:49,480
I'm sure that that is an incredible part of your success. One of the things I've in reading in

553
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:55,240
preparation for our chat today, you describe your philosophy is now as always being a servant to the

554
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:01,019
players that you coach. Now, that is an interesting thing. It certainly wasn't the era that I grew up

555
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:06,759
in playing. The coaches were at the top of the tree and the players were there to serve the

556
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:11,519
coaches. Why have you flipped that on its head? Oh, look, I think that's the way it is now.

557
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:18,039
You know, I think younger players, I don't know whether they're more intelligent, but they're

558
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:31,460
more cognizant of a number of issues. They're more well read. And so our job as coaches is just

559
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:37,660
to provide an environment for them to flourish. And if you look at, you know, just simply how

560
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:41,519
people are brought up now, you know, I've had a much easier life. I've had a much easier life.

561
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:48,519
My father, you know, fought for Australia, was in, you know, I remember he told me he worked in

562
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:53,500
the gold mine when he was 15, you know, and I haven't had to do any of that sort of thing. You

563
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:59,200
know, I've had a pretty good life. And my daughter, who's now 30, she's had a much better

564
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:08,200
life than I had. So every generation of people coming through have had a different life experience.

565
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,400
And so you've got to match your coaching,

566
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:16,720
to the life experience. But having said that, you know, when I say I'm a servant to the players,

567
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,279
at the end of the day, there's sometimes you've got to beat the drum. And, you know, you've got

568
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,220
to be relentless and non-negotiable about some things. So I think it's understanding

569
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:32,420
what you need to be negotiable about and provide an opportunity for the players to

570
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:37,880
voice their opinion and do what they think. But you've also got to be non-negotiable about the

571
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,259
things that are really important. And, you know, both our games,

572
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:46,519
AFL and rugby, if you're not physically equipped to handle the hottest periods of the game,

573
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:50,779
you're doing a disservice to the players. So you've got to equip them in that area.

574
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:57,759
You speak that you would always, if you could, that character in the form of grit always overrides

575
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:02,880
pure talent. Is that something that you've seen play out over your long history?

576
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,240
Yeah, there's no doubt about that, mate. I think that,

577
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,180
yeah, you've got to have that huge competitive spirit. And I think

578
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,200
that's a big part of it. And I think that's a big part of it. And I think that's a big part of it.

579
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,519
And I think that's a big part of it. And I think that's a big part of it. And I think that's a big part of it.

580
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:16,319
That's about grit. That's about staying at the task when it's tough. And of course,

581
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,079
you need talent to get it. You need talent to get in the yard, but then you need that

582
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:28,059
grit to keep doing it. And the good players keep doing it. And the really talented players

583
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:33,539
who haven't had that opportunity to develop that grit at a young age generally fall away.

584
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,839
Yeah, I concur absolutely with you. And the players that I played with that

585
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,440
had to work harder at a young age,

586
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:44,259
once they got there and developed the skills, they were the ones that

587
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:48,920
just were so consistent and ended up having extraordinary careers. They might've come

588
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,279
from a lower base, but you're right. They had to fight their way through,

589
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:57,039
eventually became some of the best players that I saw and played with.

590
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,200
Eddie, I want to ask you a number of questions. We generally feel as though,

591
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,819
as you said earlier, from your experience in leadership, there are some patterns and some

592
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:11,460
cues that are coming their way and specific traits of leaders that we're identifying. And we start

593
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:15,759
with self-leadership. We think all great leaders really have a sense of self-leadership. What does

594
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:20,980
that mean to you? I think you can't lead yourself unless you know yourself. So you've got to know

595
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:31,099
your strengths, your weaknesses. And I also think you've got to treat yourself almost like a

596
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:36,920
business. You've got to work on your strengths, keep developing your strengths, and at the same

597
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,519
time, understand what your weaknesses are and try to get people who are complimentary,

598
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:49,480
uh, to those weaknesses to, to build up the, the organization strengths. So that's,

599
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:54,140
that to me is, is leading yourself. Yeah. I'll write every three months,

600
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,359
I'll write a leadership plan for myself. Really? Yeah. Can you explain, can you explain it?

601
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:02,519
Cause I can see that in how you operate. You know, you mentioned the people that you get around you

602
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:06,859
and you target specific people with skill sets that you want, and you're pretty relentless in

603
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:10,720
going after people who you think can add to your environment. So what does that, what does a three

604
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,519
month lead to? Yeah.

605
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:16,400
Leadership plan look like in your world? Yeah. Just like, it's just a simple piece of paper

606
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,259
and I'll put it at the back of my diary. And it's just about professionally, what do I want to

607
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:26,279
achieve over the next three months? What's the key area? Like, you know, we've been working with a

608
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:32,059
forensic psychologist for the last three months about driving better relationships, better

609
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:38,680
conversation within our coaching group, and then from the coaches to the players. Um, and then

610
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,519
having a, a personal one as well, which might,

611
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:48,180
might involve family issues or might involve, uh, health or, or trying to get fit or what I need to

612
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:53,960
do to, to be in a better spot, to be at my best. So I try to combine those, try to review it all

613
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,779
the time. And sometimes it mightn't change, but sometimes there are key things that you need to

614
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:05,700
really focus on to get yourself in a better state. And you find the three month window works really

615
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,700
well. You never go too far. You don't have a five year plan on top of that, but update every three

616
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:10,940
months.

617
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:15,099
No. And I think in coaching three months is getting, probably getting too long, mate.

618
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:22,880
It can be a lifetime in the world that you operate in. Uh, it is an interesting, uh,

619
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,000
practice that you do. I appreciate you sharing it. Um, we see leaders are now incredibly conscious

620
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,119
of how they positively impact others in their environment. We heard you talk about

621
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:36,140
serving the players, but beating the drum. I mean, how, how do you go about that? The

622
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,539
positive impact on others around you?

623
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:41,160
Oh, I think more and more again, it's, it's about,

624
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:49,119
there's a great book by, uh, Craig, he put me on the, by Xander, uh, who's, uh, he was in charge

625
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:55,920
of an orchestra, um, Ben Xander, and it's called the art of possibility. And, and it really

626
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:01,059
resonates with me that all the time you're trying to create possibilities for the players. You're

627
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:06,819
trying to create opportunities for the players to be better. You get them to see what, what they

628
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:11,519
could do. And I think if you can create good stories about that and create good conversations,

629
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:17,660
about that, and basically light their eyes up, you got a much greater chance of, of driving them

630
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:23,759
to success. Like yesterday, I had a difficult conversation with one player, um, about a

631
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:30,599
performance on the weekend where he didn't give a hundred percent effort. Um, and, and, you know,

632
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:36,680
the old school 20 years ago, you'd ring up and say, you know, you hadn't done that. You hadn't

633
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:41,519
done that. Uh, you know, and now you try to get them to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to,

634
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:48,519
to, if they did give effort, how good their game would be. Um, and at the same time, make it quite

635
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:54,059
clear that if they don't reach that effort, then, then it's going to be difficult for them to be in

636
00:30:54,059 --> 00:31:00,460
the team. But I think it's that art of possibility, mate, that's just so important. It's a great book.

637
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,539
I'd encourage anyone, you know, anyone that's listening to your podcast would be well worth a

638
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:08,779
read, mate. Yeah. I've just written it down, the art of possibility, uh, Ben Xander. And I love,

639
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:10,599
you know, from a conductor of an orchestra,

640
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:17,299
over into the world of, uh, of English rugby, um, the leadership stories are so effective

641
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:22,119
across multiple disciplines. Creating and sharing a vision is something that, uh, we see great

642
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:26,859
leaders do. And, and you are meticulous in this from what I've read. And I, and I love the vision.

643
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,519
I love how open you are about it. Your vision at the moment is for England to be the best rugby team

644
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:37,920
in history. It's, it's, it's a bold, profound thing to say. How do you go about that? And

645
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,299
what's that like sharing that with the players? Uh, well, I think you've,

646
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:48,880
also, you, you've always got to stimulate the players to be better. Um, and, and if I was,

647
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:55,339
if I was involved in any team and I want that team to be the team that, that when you go down

648
00:31:55,339 --> 00:32:00,119
the pub and you, you go down, then you don't know anyone. And there's four blokes or four people in

649
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:04,619
the corner and they're having a drink and they start talking about, about sport. You want to

650
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:11,000
be a team that you're involved in, you know? So it's then, then, then creating,

651
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:16,079
idea in their head, creating something that, that lights their eyes up and then giving them

652
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:20,880
a plan of going forward. And yeah, we're a long way away from, from being that, but there's no

653
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,640
reason in 18 months we can't be that team. And you speak about in 2019, it was a really

654
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,420
crystal clear focus on winning the world cup and on reflection, I think maybe that, you know,

655
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:37,180
after you beat the All Blacks, which as you said, extraordinary performance, but does it leave

656
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,119
enough breadth for, for, for possibilities? Is that why you sort of, you, you,

657
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:46,099
tweaked that again to, to, to open it up? Why not? I mean, who's to say that that group that

658
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:51,859
you're coaching now won't be the best team ever? Yeah. And it's probably more rather than being

659
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:57,660
goal orientated. And I think it's, it's almost a function of being with the team for, for a longer

660
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:02,700
period of time, more process function now. It's more about the process of how can we become the

661
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,700
greatest team? How can we be a team that everyone remembers? What's the sort of rugby we've got to

662
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,680
play? What do we need to do to get there? How do we need to operate?

663
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:16,859
On and off the field to get to that situation. So we just keep driving before, because, you know,

664
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:23,960
the attainable goal of being the greatest team is, is actually not a goal. It's, it's a, it's a,

665
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:30,359
it's a focus of, of improving all the time. And I think, you know, for a team that's been together

666
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:35,759
for a while, you need to find a new way of stimulating their, their, their quest to want

667
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:41,180
to be better. Yeah. I'm assuming if you're living a standard that is aiming to be the best ever,

668
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:45,740
it's going to be a high standard, isn't it? And as a result of that, you, you, you know,

669
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:51,079
you're going to have outstanding results. So it makes sense. Curiosity is a word that we hear

670
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:55,200
leaders talk about a lot, Eddie, and it's something I, I see in you all the time and,

671
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,539
and through curiosity approach to learning and development, you had a great story that I wasn't

672
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:06,420
aware of the Gonzaga Bulldog story. Can you share that with us? Because it's a, it's a great example

673
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:11,019
of curiosity and something that's really, you know, been something you've implemented pretty

674
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:16,300
on the back of it. Yeah. An old strength and conditioning coach that was with you with Japan

675
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:23,400
is now, he's in a, he's in another team now. And we, we chat regularly about, about how can we

676
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:30,280
improve the training week? You know, he's a very bright, intelligent guy. And to me, the challenge

677
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:35,360
of the training week at the moment is always the Monday. Like particularly now where the game's

678
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:41,159
got more intense, it's got harder, the physical requirements to the game, the seasons are

679
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:48,059
longer. Monday's the day that, and we have some research on it, that if, if your players are

680
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:51,960
feeling pretty good at the end of the Monday, you've got a good chance for good performance

681
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:58,960
that week. So, you know, and Monday's the day where it's, it's a routine day. It's a big routine

682
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,460
day, isn't it? You got to, you got to review the previous game, feed in the next game, the skills

683
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:10,320
are light. And if you, and, and maybe the concentration of the players is not where it

684
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:10,840
should be.

685
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:18,320
Um, so we, we, we were just talking and, and we ended up, he read something about Growth

686
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,239
Monday, this concept of Growth Monday. And he had, he had a meeting with the performance

687
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:28,239
director of the university. And then we ended up having a Zoom together and just, cause

688
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:33,840
they, they had really engaged this Growth Monday where the players had come in, they'd

689
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:40,019
run the day. Um, and they, so at the end of the day, they were inspired about the rest

690
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:40,500
of the week.

691
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:46,659
Um, so we, we've tried it with, with England. Um, so the players, they, they, we've got them

692
00:35:46,659 --> 00:35:52,039
in four groups. We've got a leader of each group. They've got to decide their timetable

693
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:57,239
for the day. Um, so they decide the timetable of the day. There are, there are some non-negotiable

694
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:01,780
things they've got to do. And also within those non-negotiables, there's some scope for

695
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:07,260
them to, to put a bent on it, to, to decide, for instance, what skills they do on that

696
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,039
day. So we've gone down that, that, that, uh,

697
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:17,739
pathway. Um, and we feel like it's, it's the right one, but again, we're going to change

698
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:22,260
it again. Cause again, I think that one of the other things that's happened now, Luke,

699
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,980
is that young players like change in the schedule. Yeah. Previously, you know, 30 years

700
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:32,579
ago, everyone liked the same thing, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, you know, you, you go

701
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:37,860
just like the way your parents used to make your lunch. Like I used to have like cheese

702
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,739
and tomato on Monday, cheese and beetroot Tuesday.

703
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:46,599
Cheese and Vegemite Wednesday, you know, people like change now. So we've, we've gone

704
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:51,179
down that. Now we're looking at the, at the new, new way of growing that Monday. But I

705
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:52,320
think the concept's right.

706
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:58,539
Yeah. And I love that you found a story out of a small university in Washington that,

707
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:04,059
uh, in the NCAA, the National College Athletic Association, where this unit had no right

708
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:10,380
to have a championship level basketball team, 68 teams, I think in the NCAA. And, and they

709
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,139
have consistent,

710
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:16,139
consistently made finals, got incredibly close to, to winning it against all odds. And,

711
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:20,280
and, you know, you're learning and that curiosity, what are they doing? How do I find out about

712
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,760
it? And, and you being the person you are is, is onto that and implementing that straight

713
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,760
away, which is a, is a great lesson of how you go about it. You're communicating with,

714
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,019
with clarity. It, it seems a great strength of yours, Eddie, and I know you review it

715
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:38,179
regularly. How have you gone about, um, your communication with, with clarity?

716
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:41,039
Uh, well, I'm lucky I'm Australian up here, mate.

717
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,539
Oh, I can understand what I say.

718
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:50,659
Uh, no, no. Well, the, the, the big thing we've really worked with this forensic psychologist,

719
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:57,039
um, Natasha, Nash, Nash, the, the soul home has written a book called pin code. Again,

720
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:03,820
it's a, it's a, it's a good read and it's really been focusing. She's got an ABC communication,

721
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:11,039
you know, approach, uh, body language, uh, communication. And, and so,

722
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:17,659
I don't think you can spend enough time on communication. Yeah. Uh, the great, you know,

723
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:21,920
when you go back to the great coach, I think all in their way, they can tell a good story.

724
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:27,000
Yeah. And again, you know, if you can create a good story, people are going to remember what

725
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,719
you said. And then if they got to remember what you said, they got a chance to do it.

726
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:35,840
So I don't think you can ever spend enough time in becoming a better communicator. Like,

727
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,400
Alex Ferguson, you go, you meet him and it's just one,

728
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:40,539
um,

729
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:46,519
series of story after story, you know, and he tells the Scottish pro and half the time you

730
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:51,119
can't understand what he, what he said, but you get the, you get the intent of what he's saying.

731
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:56,840
And, and I think, you know, that longevity of him was a result of him being able to create

732
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,280
an environment where people saw pictures of what they were going to do, because you're always

733
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,440
trying to create pictures in people's head. Yeah. And adapting that, as you said, to this

734
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,519
new generation who really think differently, communicate differently, uh, like change in

735
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:14,900
routine. And I, and I know you've been really specific on how, uh, you keep evolving that

736
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,699
message, uh, with the change in generation. Uh, collaboration is something we see leaders

737
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:24,519
really passionate about now, and you can hear it in all of your work. How, how important

738
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:31,280
is collaboration to you? Yeah, well, I think it's a, it's a process. Um, and I think we can't

739
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,480
ever look again as a, as a goal. It's something you just got to keep working on. Yeah. Again,

740
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,500
with having four assistant coaches now, when I coached Japan, which was,

741
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:45,579
only 10 years ago, I had one assistant coach. Yeah. And so collaboration was having a drink

742
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:50,559
at the bar, going over the, the training plan for the next day. And now you've got four coaches.

743
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,940
Um, and we're probably one short. We probably need five. Cause I think that's the other thing

744
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:01,219
that's changed Luke. And I'm sure it's the same if AFL and I know, yeah, it's one of the issues

745
00:40:01,219 --> 00:40:08,639
of AFL at the moment that the, the, the soft caps being cut and, and players want individual

746
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,500
attention. Yeah. They want individual attention. Yeah. And I think that's, I think that's, I think

747
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:15,179
individual data, they want individual attention. Yeah. One of the NBA coaches we were talking

748
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:21,019
about was saying that, uh, that now, you know, the analysts, they can't be blokes with, with,

749
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:28,039
uh, you know, glasses and who eat donuts all day and a bit chubby. They've got to be guys who can

750
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:32,019
not only do the analyst work, but they can get on the court and shoot one-on-one with the players

751
00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:38,079
because that's what players want. So with bigger coaching staff, you need, you need again, that

752
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:44,920
collaborative process of, of right. This is the way we're going to play, uh, making sure that the

753
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,619
messages are clear, making sure that there's no overlap in what we're telling the players because

754
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:55,699
the players have got a lot more voices talking to them now. And I love, uh, you know, reading

755
00:40:55,699 --> 00:41:01,000
about your work, Eddie, you coach the English rugby team, but you, you are a full-time coach.

756
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,880
And so you'll go back to Japan to, to the club level that you coach. You've got the

757
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,920
strange amount of criticism. It seems in the English media,

758
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,019
around that being some sort of conflict, but your logic sound, isn't it? I mean, I'm evolving

759
00:41:13,019 --> 00:41:17,699
and challenging myself and constantly, and everyone understands that there is a sharing

760
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:22,519
of information, but clearly nothing that is, uh, affecting anything apart from positively

761
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:26,539
the English environment. Are you surprised that people don't, don't get that, that it's not more

762
00:41:26,539 --> 00:41:33,199
widely understood? It's, it's crazy, mate. It's really crazy. I think, you know, the more you give,

763
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,780
the more you get back. That's the thing I've always learned. And I always remember I had this

764
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:43,340
great coach, Bob Dwyer, who won the 91 World Cup with Australia. And he always used to say to me,

765
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:49,500
it still resonates in my head. He said, the best coaches are the best players. And so the more you

766
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,340
expose yourself to working with the best players, the more you learn. Like I was lucky enough to

767
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:59,480
work with Bowdoin Barrett last year. Um, and I can tell you, I learned more from him than he learned

768
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:06,099
from me. Um, and, and, you know, so you want to expose yourself to those situations and you want

769
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:07,760
to keep learning. Um, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

770
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:13,679
and if you don't do that, if you just stay in your own insulated pocket, all you know is, is what's

771
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,000
in that pocket. You've got to get out, you've got to share, and you've got to take a risk sometimes

772
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,920
of sharing information to get better information back. I love it. Uh, love that, uh, incredible

773
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,440
sense that you've got on, on that. And we're seeing it with the, your openness and, uh, and

774
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,000
joining the Leader Connect group we spoke about before, but asking these two questions of all the

775
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,239
ladies and I, I love doing it. I'll be fascinated with, with your response. Who's been the greatest

776
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:37,119
leader in your life?

777
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:42,460
Uh, that's a, that's a pretty good question, mate. Uh, I've never really thought about

778
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:51,099
that. Um, probably one of the person I admired the most was Bob Hawke and Ian Chappell. Uh,

779
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:59,780
both because, uh, and I say this in a good way, really Aussie, uh, were bold in what

780
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:07,440
they did, um, and led, led people. Like, yeah, I love Ian Chappell was to me, the way

781
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,500
he resurrected Australian cricket and did it his own way. I can always remember I was

782
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,579
lucky enough. I was there for his first test as captain. You know, he comes out there in

783
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:22,380
those days, you know, cricket was quite a, uh, yeah, everyone, everyone followed a fairly

784
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:27,960
strict protocol and he came out as Australian captain, had his shirt undone to there. They,

785
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:32,019
they had the new ball. I remember the first time he threw it, it bounced the mid off,

786
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:37,119
you know, and that was seen as a, as, as, as sacrilegious in those days. And he went

787
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:43,360
about developing this Australian team that did it their own way. Um, and I love that.

788
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,760
And Bob Hawke, you know, I'm probably on the other side of the, the political spectrum

789
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:55,480
to a large degree, but the way he went about, you know, is this rough, tough, uh, union

790
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,460
leader that came about and led Australia to prosperity. You know, those sort of people

791
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:06,460
to me really inspired me. And I always wanted to feel like, you know, I'd, I'd have a sense

792
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,659
of, I'm going to do it my way and I'm going to make, make a better place for the people

793
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:17,519
that I'm involved in. And if I've been any way, been able to do that, then it's probably

794
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:18,219
been useful.

795
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,639
I love the answers. And I know you're, you're a passionate, uh, cricket lover and, uh, and,

796
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:27,480
and study that, that closely. And the, it was a different era, wasn't it? The charisma

797
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:33,119
of someone in a prime minister of Bob Hawke and, you know, scaling a beer and anyone who,

798
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,099
uh, who, uh, is a bum. If you don't give someone a day off after,

799
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:42,500
after the Australia's Cup win, I mean, you, you can't imagine it, can you, uh, in 2022,

800
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:47,440
but he did it his way. There's no, no doubt about it. Um, if you could collaborate with

801
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,139
anyone in the world on any area of your life, Eddie, and clearly you've got specific interests

802
00:44:53,139 --> 00:44:57,559
in the world of rugby, but would there be someone that springs to mind that you'd love

803
00:44:57,559 --> 00:44:58,239
to collaborate with?

804
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:03,639
I reckon there's, there's two coaches in football up here that are completely different, but

805
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:06,639
they're both so driven, like peppered man city.

806
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:13,840
Like he's this tactical guru, you know, they play in a, in a organised, but free sense.

807
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:21,059
Um, and then you've got Klopp, who's at Liverpool, who's this, like, they play heavy metal pressing.

808
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,679
Yeah. They push it. He's, he's all about involving the crowd. I'd love to have those

809
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:31,639
two guys in my back staff. It'd be, uh, it'd be a fascinating combination. So, and look,

810
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:36,960
I love, uh, Eddie, the fact that we, we threw the world of streaming services,

811
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,360
and we get to hear from Pep Guardiola behind the scenes, and you hear from Jurgen Klopp

812
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,539
in ways you haven't before. I mean, is it, are you watching that content? Are you picking

813
00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:49,159
up bits and pieces? And do you think that's a, it's a good thing? I mean, I've said this

814
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:55,679
before, but Vince Lombardi is, uh, the legendary NFL coach. There's only so many tiny snippets

815
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:58,460
of, you know, there's been a hundred books written about him, but we didn't hear a lot

816
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:02,159
of it in his own voice. Do you, do you like the fact we're hearing more of, of you guys

817
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:02,960
while you're still in the chair?

818
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,579
Yeah, I think it's fantastic, mate. Now, again, I think it, it shows you that, that

819
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:15,239
information now is, is not owned by people. It's owned by the world. And so you've got

820
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:20,280
to, it really reinforces the fact that you've got to keep learning. Because as soon as you

821
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:25,079
do something good, someone shows it, someone talks about it, someone dissects it. So you've

822
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:30,599
got to keep finding some way of doing it better. And a lot of times it's going back to go forward.

823
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:32,940
Um, but you've got to find new ways of doing it.

824
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,860
Well, if you want to keep your learning journey going, uh, you can start with Eddie Jones's

825
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:41,039
book. It's called Leadership Lessons from My Life in Rugby. I really enjoyed it. There

826
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:45,239
were so many great practical takeaways and written superbly. And if you're listening

827
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:50,940
to Eddie, you get a sense of, uh, that incredible desire to keep improving. It's been a great

828
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:55,400
pleasure to catch up with you. I really appreciate your time. And I, I can't wait to see the

829
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:01,059
coming, uh, 18 months of English rugby. You've got a plan. Uh, you're copying it from all

830
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:02,940
angles, but I get the feeling that, uh, you've got a plan.

831
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,500
It's exactly on track for what you had anticipated and wish you all the best in the next period

832
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,739
of time. Thanks for joining us.

833
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:15,619
No, thanks Luke. And, uh, doing a great job with the podcast and with, with Matt. So I

834
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:19,739
hope it keeps going and it's been a pleasure to be with you today, mate. And go the dogs,

835
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:19,920
eh?

836
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:24,920
I love it, mate. Final note, you spent, your dad grew up in Footscray. So we've got, we've

837
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,659
got you on board, mate. Wait till they hear about that, uh, at, uh, Red, White and Blue

838
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:32,480
headquarters. So I, I didn't know that until we spoke just before the start. So, uh, I'm

839
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:32,940
looking forward to it.

840
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,480
You're one of us, Eddie. I'm, uh, and I'm finding myself, uh, wanting, uh, England to

841
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,139
win the World Cup too, just listening to your passion as well. So, uh, thanks again, mate.

842
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:41,659
It's been great fun.

843
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,480
All right. Good on you, Luke. Cheers, mate.

844
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:43,900
Thanks, Eddie.
