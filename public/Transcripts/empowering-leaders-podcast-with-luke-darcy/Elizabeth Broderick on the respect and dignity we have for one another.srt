00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:09,669
I hope you enjoyed this conversation with an incredible Australian leader, Elizabeth Broderick.

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:16,530
She's currently working with the United Nations Human Rights Council addressing gender inequality globally.

3
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:24,969
A remarkable person and you'll love hearing about Elizabeth's sense of positivity, even when the stats are incredibly challenging and damning.

4
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:30,989
Her story of picking up the phone and ringing the most senior men in Australian corporate life is one that you want to hear.

5
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:40,689
And understanding the complexity of impacting gender inequality in a country like Afghanistan and how she's going about it, Elizabeth, is a remarkable story.

6
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:47,130

15
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:35,469
Elizabeth Broderick, AO, was Australian.

16
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:40,549
Now is longer serving sex discrimination commissioner from 2007 to 2015.

17
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:49,930
Elizabeth has successfully brought together captains of industry, governments, defence force chiefs and the like to address gender inequality in Australia and beyond.

18
00:01:50,769 --> 00:02:01,250
Elizabeth established and convenes the globally recognised champions of change strategy, enlisting a who's who of powerful male leaders to tackle workplace gender inequality.

19
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,450
Elizabeth is an independent expert on the United Nations Human Rights Council.

20
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:15,229
Holding a special procedures mandate as part of a working group of five to assist nation states and other actors on laws and practices that discriminate against women.

21
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:21,629
In 2016, Elizabeth was awarded the New South Wales Australian of the Year for her extraordinary contribution.

22
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:23,569
Elizabeth, really appreciate your time.

23
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,349
It's great to see you today.

24
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,389
Yeah, lovely to see you, Luke.

25
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:32,669
It's an incredible legacy you've got, an impact that you've made to take such a strong leadership stance on gender inequality.

26
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:34,750
Where did that strength come from within you?

27
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:37,229
It's interesting, isn't it?

28
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:41,150
I've often reflected on that and thought, well, was there a moment in time?

29
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,650
But I don't think there was a moment that set me on that path.

30
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,310
I think probably it was because I was born an identical twin.

31
00:02:50,289 --> 00:03:02,509
And the fact is, when you're an identical twin, from the minute you put your feet on the ground, you're looking around to see whether you and your twin are being, you know, dealt with, well, in a sense, fairly, but I'd say equally as well.

32
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:05,590
So if my twin sister got a particular present for Christmas.

33
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:10,169
Did I get one which is, you know, as good of equal or comparable value?

34
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:15,930
So I think just right from the get go, you understand what fairness looks like, what equality looks like.

35
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:20,889
And that just becomes part of who you are and the way you see the world and navigate the world.

36
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:25,430
And so I suppose I had an acute antenna for unfairness.

37
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:33,469
I still remember with mum and dad occasionally would take us out to restaurants and I would always want to go to the restaurant which had no people in it.

38
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,469
Ordinarily for very good reasons.

39
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:46,669
And there were no people, probably the food wasn't very good, but it just made me really understand, I think, fairness, human suffering, those types of things.

40
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,289
So that's just how I'm built, I think.

41
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,229
And that's probably what set me on that path.

42
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,889
Well, I'm fascinated about your identical twin.

43
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:55,990
What's the relationship like?

44
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,810
Are you similar?

45
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,409
Have you got similar values?

46
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,110
Yeah, we're very close.

47
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:02,710
We live a couple of streets from each other.

48
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,610
We always said, OK, we need to be a 90 second person.

49
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,129
And push away from each other.

50
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,770
So and we we went to separate schools right from the get go.

51
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:16,670
My mum was a very strong in the belief that competition can kill relationships.

52
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:20,629
So she didn't want us to be in environments which were competitive.

53
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:24,709
So my dad used to drive my twin sister in one direction.

54
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,689
My mum would drive me in the other direction and we'd go to our separate schools.

55
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:34,769
And periodically we would dress up in each other's uniform and go off to each other's schools.

56
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:38,370
Which was always, I have to say, a very stressful experience.

57
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:45,310
And even in the final year, we were both head school captains of our respective schools.

58
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,910
So we had so much fun together as well with our friends and whatever.

59
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,550
But yes, scary at times, terrifying, Luke.

60
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,329
What an amazing commitment from your parents, isn't it?

61
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,069
To go to that extra mile to make sure that there was harmony in that relationship.

62
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:05,550
It must have been tempting to go to one school and not take on.

63
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:08,110
Well, that it's an incredible effort, isn't it?

64
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:17,029
You're right, because having had my own kids now, the idea that, you know, you're sending one this way and one that way, you know, with all the busyness of life, it was an incredible commitment.

65
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:20,709
And I think if it was left up to my dad, he wouldn't have gone that way.

66
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,709
But my mum was an activist and she made that decision.

67
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:32,069
I still remember she had to write to the minister for education because at that time you had to send your kids to the school that was in your area.

68
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:33,750
We went to a local public school.

69
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,449
So she had to get a special.

70
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:39,389
It was a dispensation to send me to one school and my sister to the other.

71
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:52,129
But when I think about it now and I reflect back on it, the fact that we were never competing, because if she did better in her French exam than I did in mine, I just remind her about how difficult French was.

72
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:56,350
And we had a much higher barrier at our school than she would have had at her school.

73
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:05,350
And I still remember she the one day that we swapped schools was the day of the big year nine science exam, which I'd forgotten.

74
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:07,970
I'd admitted to tell her about.

75
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:12,870
So she arrived at my school to be sat down with, you know, the exam paper.

76
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,050
I have to say I came third in the class.

77
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:16,110
Thanks very much, Luke.

78
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,730
So we had fun with it that way as well.

79
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:19,870
I love it.

80
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,329
That's that's incredible.

81
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,529
And no one knew.

82
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,889
No one picked up.

83
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:24,089
No.

84
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,810
Look, our close friends knew.

85
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,550
But aside from that, none of the teachers knew or whatever.

86
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:31,629
I still remember being hauled up in her German class.

87
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,290
Now, I've never spoken a word of German in my entire life, thankfully.

88
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:41,970
And we one half of the class had to ask the other half a word.

89
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,750
And you had to say it in German.

90
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,649
Fortunately, one of her friends cottoned on the fact that I wasn't Jane.

91
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:53,870
I was actually Liz and asked me what the name, you know, thank you was to which my one German word.

92
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,670
I was able to say Duncan and Duncan.

93
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,709
And that was about the extent of it.

94
00:06:57,949 --> 00:06:58,769
So, yeah.

95
00:06:59,329 --> 00:06:59,769
Brilliant.

96
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:03,110
I want to jump into to the stats.

97
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,329
And it takes a turn.

98
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:04,930
It isn't Elizabeth.

99
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:10,269
One in three women over the age of 15 have experienced physical or sexual violence.

100
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:19,769
980 million women worldwide and 1.2 million of those in Australia live in an intimate relationship that is characterized by violence.

101
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,189
It's horrific when you say that out loud.

102
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,389
In your mind, are we seeing progress?

103
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:26,290
Are we making a difference?

104
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:33,610
Look, I think we're discussing this issue much more openly today than we would have five years, 10 years ago.

105
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:50,910
And, you know, the reason we're doing that is the good work of a lot of NGOs, you know, who are bringing this on to the national agenda, but also people like Rosie Batty, Grace Tame and others who have had the courage to actually get up and tell their personal story.

106
00:07:50,910 --> 00:08:03,490
And I still remember with Rosie Batty, I was able to invite Rosie to meet with a group of CEOs through a strategy which I founded about 10 years ago now called the Champions.

107
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:08,629
It brings together CEOs of organizations all across Australia.

108
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:33,470
And Rosie had the courage to sit down with them and just talk to them about her experience of living in an intimate relationship characterized by violence and also working at the same time and helping these CEOs see that there were so many times when Rosie, as a woman living with violence, reached out for help and nothing ever happened.

109
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:43,730
So it was really the question she posed to them was, you know, when women living with violence speak, the system isn't listening.

110
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:45,409
So how can we shift that?

111
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,490
Because every one of us makes up the system.

112
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:54,370
So I think it was, you know, the great work that she did and others, which mean that the issue is on our agenda.

113
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:02,110
But let's remember Australia here today, almost more than one woman a week is murdered by her intimate partner.

114
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:02,889
Yeah.

115
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,070
I take it out more, more, more globally.

116
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:23,370
Next week, I'm supposed to travel into Afghanistan on the UN country mission into Afghanistan and the levels of violence and just discrimination and erasure of women from all aspects of public life in so many regions of the world.

117
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,929
But Afghanistan would have to be a standout.

118
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,750
It's increasing.

119
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,429
It's increasing as a result of COVID.

120
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:33,429
It's increasing as a result of a rise of populism.

121
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,309
And religious fundamentalism.

122
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:43,870
But we, you know, we and I'd say everyone in this, it'll take all of us to actually shift this picture.

123
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:50,629
And Elizabeth, you mentioned, you know, Rosie Batty, who have had the incredible pleasure to meet a handful of times.

124
00:09:50,889 --> 00:10:00,149
And she said, I remember her saying to me prior to Luke's death, her son's death, it was murdered by her partner in the most horrific possible way you could imagine.

125
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:03,389
She said, no one wanted to hear my story living with violence.

126
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,330
After Luke's death, everyone suddenly wanted to hear her story.

127
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:12,070
And for those that don't know it, it's worth having a listen to Rosie's story.

128
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:17,769
When you personalize it like that and you just see how devastating that was for everyone.

129
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:24,090
I suppose when I think about it, for me, you know, turning 48 this year, I think of my beautiful 18-year-old daughter.

130
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,289
I think of my beautiful wife and how lucky I am.

131
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:28,029
My two beautiful sisters and my mom.

132
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:33,029
And how would I react if someone was violent or discriminatory?

133
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:37,029
Towards them, zero tolerance is the answer.

134
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:42,309
Is that the way for men to understand a bit better through their own loved ones?

135
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,710
Does that resonate like it does with me, Elizabeth?

136
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:49,330
Yeah, I think, look, personalizing it is always a good strategy.

137
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:58,529
But, you know, from a human rights perspective, when one woman is diminished in that way, we're all diminished, essentially.

138
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:01,750
So I think, yes, understand it in your own circle.

139
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:06,029
Because that will allow you to have a deep emotional attachment to the issue.

140
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,990
But then try to extrapolate out from that.

141
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:18,710
And, you know, when I look at violence against women and particularly domestic and family violence, at the heart of that issue is gender inequality.

142
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:27,509
One of the things we know from the research here in Australia is those men that believe fundamentally in gender equality.

143
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:30,669
So they believe that men and women are truly equal.

144
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:34,889
Their propensity to commit violence against women is almost zero.

145
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:39,049
So that's the attitude we've got to be engendering in our sons.

146
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:44,830
We've got to help our sons understand that men and women, people of all genders, are equal.

147
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:47,629
They deserve respect and human dignity.

148
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,570
I mean, that's a basic human right.

149
00:11:50,769 --> 00:12:00,009
And, you know, right from the beginning, I think if they grow up with that belief, and let's face it, it's when they look around their own family, how does dad treat mom?

150
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:00,490
Mm-hmm.

151
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:01,789
I mean, that's really important.

152
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,149
If dad's disrespecting mom, why will I grow up believing that women deserve respect?

153
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:06,950
I won't.

154
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,389
So I think respect starts at home.

155
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,809
It's what we model.

156
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:16,110
And that's in opposite-sex relationships as well as same-sex relationships as well.

157
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:25,990
So if we want our kids to actually be respectful, we need to model it every day in our family, in our workplaces, and in the community.

158
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,789
That's what I believe.

159
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,230
Human rights starts at home.

160
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:30,509
Yeah, beautifully.

161
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:42,009
You said, and you mentioned Champions of Change, which you founded, and you picked up the phone, and you ranked some of the most influential men in Australian business life, CEOs of the big banks, of Qantas, of IBM.

162
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:46,590
You went straight to the top, and there was a bit of backlash towards you for that, too.

163
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,870
It's like, why are we, you know, why is this about males again?

164
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,289
Tell us about your strategy and why that was so important and why it's worked.

165
00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:00,049
Yeah, so when I became Australia's Sex Discrimination Commissioner, I kind of had in my mind, well,

166
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:02,370
you know, gender equality is a women's issue.

167
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:06,090
I'm just going to get all the great women I know, and we'll all get on board together.

168
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:18,970
And I started down that path, but I came to understand that, actually, gender equality is really about the redistribution of power, whether that's in a family, a workplace, or indeed in a nation.

169
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:26,070
And if we want to redistribute power, then I need to work with those who hold the levers of power.

170
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,649
And even today, in 2023, in pretty much every nation of the world, we're going to have to work with those who hold the levers of power.

171
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:37,149
And even today, in 2023, in pretty much every nation of the world, it's men that largely hold the levers of power, not exclusively, but largely.

172
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:49,570
So then I started to understand, okay, well, if that's the case, then I need to engage with powerful, decent, you know, good men who want to create a peaceful, prosperous, and gender equal world.

173
00:13:49,929 --> 00:14:00,429
And that's when I decided, look, I could do a whole lot of research to see who these men are, or I could just go through the paper, look at the big names, and I'll pick up the phone and ring them, which is essentially what I did.

174
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:00,490
Yeah.

175
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:03,889
I did a whole lot of strategic planning and research and whatever.

176
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,169
No, I just figured, I'm going to pick up the phone and ring these men.

177
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:13,970
And I still remember I started with a beautiful man who was the head of IBM in our region at the time.

178
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:18,809
And I just, I helped him see the absence of women.

179
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,649
So at that time, I think we had only 8% of women on company boards.

180
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,809
We had only 10% in, you know, executive roles.

181
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:30,309
You know, women were continuing to be murdered by intimate partners.

182
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:48,090
I just took him through that because I also understood that he had twins, a boy and a girl, and helped him see that, you know, that his daughter would never have the same opportunities as his son, all because she was born a girl.

183
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:54,889
And, you know, at that point, he just kind of said, well, yeah, just tell me, where do I sign up?

184
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,990
What do I need to do?

185
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,289
And I started to understand also that once you get a few men on board.

186
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:06,710
Other men look up to, then you've got yourself a strategy, which is, which can, you know, really evolve.

187
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,850
And that's where we're at today.

188
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:11,429
We've got about 270 champions of change.

189
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:19,509
They're both men and women now, because very much this is about bringing women as CEOs into the fold as well.

190
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,870
So that's where we've ended up.

191
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:21,929
Yeah, congratulations.

192
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,009
It's become, you know, such a part of your legacy, isn't it?

193
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,269
And engaging people in that way.

194
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,509
And that message does filter down.

195
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:30,549
You know, in preparation.

196
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:37,750
After this conversation, Elizabeth, as I said, as a male, 47, you start scanning your own world a little bit more closely.

197
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,309
And you realize, I went to an all-boys school.

198
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:41,230
I went to an all-boys boarding school.

199
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,590
I played AFL football in an incredibly male-dominated environment.

200
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:48,570
I worked in the media, which was, you know, incredibly male-dominated.

201
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:51,389
And I don't think I've ever been biased in any way.

202
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:53,830
As I said, I love the women in my life.

203
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:59,450
But it's only in recent times that I've had this great pleasure of working with so many incredible, brilliant women.

204
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:00,570
And understand.

205
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,350
And this skill set that men just don't have.

206
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,509
That women naturally bring to the table.

207
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:07,009
That is just an amazing thing to be around.

208
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,029
Is that a thought that you hear a lot from people like me?

209
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:13,090
I just hadn't experienced it.

210
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:14,470
It wasn't something that I had planned.

211
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,429
And when you do, you see the benefit and the joy.

212
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:19,149
And hopefully breaking down those barriers.

213
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:21,429
No, you're so right, Luke.

214
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,669
Because each of us, we see the world as we are rather than as it is.

215
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:30,549
And if you go to an all-boys school, an all-boys college, you're in an all-boys working.

216
00:16:30,669 --> 00:16:33,629
environment or sporting environment, that's the way you see the world.

217
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:38,730
And I think it's when you get out and understand, particularly the lived experiences of women.

218
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:40,490
Women that you care about.

219
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,490
Women who you come into contact about.

220
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,769
And you sit and listen deeply to their stories.

221
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:52,649
That's when you start to understand, well, actually the system as constructed today,

222
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:55,850
it actually delivers some advantages to men.

223
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:59,549
Some power and privilege that women don't necessarily have.

224
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,649
And let's face it.

225
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:02,169
Not all women are equal.

226
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:07,609
I mean, there's women like me who are white women, cisgender, educated.

227
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:15,970
I probably have experienced much greater advantages through the women's movement than my indigenous sisters or women of color.

228
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:24,930
So, you know, understanding everyone else's experience and then asking yourself, well, you know, this is happening on my watch.

229
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:28,410
I'm someone as a white man with power and influence.

230
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,650
What can I do to actually shift?

231
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,390
What can I do to shift the system?

232
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:41,769
And I think then just taking those small steps, which is firstly about listening to others' experience and then asking, look, what support can I give?

233
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,329
How could I be a really strong male ally in relation to gender equality?

234
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,690
I think that's really important.

235
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:53,769
Elizabeth, you've been courageous and open enough to speak about as a young lawyer experiencing sexual harassment yourself.

236
00:17:53,769 --> 00:18:00,650
Was that part of your lived experience that created this desire in you to make change?

237
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:09,430
Yeah, I think, I mean, I, when I was a sex discrimination commissioner, decided to publicly tell my story, as you said.

238
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:13,450
And I didn't tell it because it was a more important story.

239
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:14,789
It absolutely wasn't.

240
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:30,109
I told it because it spoke to a lot of the issues that all women talk to me about, the silence, the shame, the inability to change my situation, the going from a job that I really loved to not liking what I was doing.

241
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,150
Liking work.

242
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:40,269
There are all the things that many women who experienced sexual harassment, actually, that's their experience as well.

243
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:43,130
So I told my story for that reason.

244
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:50,269
And I'm determined to actually get out through listening to thousands of stories of sexual harassment, sexual assault.

245
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:55,309
I do that in my consulting work every single day in many regions of the world.

246
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:58,529
And I'm absolutely determined to name.

247
00:18:58,809 --> 00:18:59,569
You know that.

248
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:08,369
experience and help people see that you know that that if we want to live in a world which is

249
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:15,069
where everyone feels safe then every one of us has to take action to end sexual harassment and

250
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:20,069
the fact is if you're not hearing about sexual harassment in your workplace it doesn't mean it's

251
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:24,029
not happening it just means you're not asking the right questions you're not getting out and

252
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:29,190
listening enough because what we do know is that around 25 percent of women have been sexually

253
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:35,950
harassed in the last few years that's a high percentage of women so it's absolutely out there

254
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:42,230
but people are silent on it because if I dare to speak out about it then not only will I be the

255
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,490
victim of a sexual harassment I'll be the victim of bringing it to the attention of management as

256
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:52,309
well and Elizabeth just picking up on on those work environments as you said that you know the

257
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:57,170
numbers as you said you're not seeing it's not because it's not happening but it feels like a

258
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,970
really complex world now

259
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:04,670
around right and wrong and we want our workplaces to be fun we want them to be dynamic and we want

260
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,390
to have great relationships with our female and male colleagues I think as a whole but

261
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:12,690
how would you describe what's appropriate now because it does seem

262
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:18,369
a bit more complex than it was can you define that that's right and I worry that you know for

263
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:24,009
many men they'll be cautious and they'll kind of pull back from their relationships with women

264
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:28,950
because they're scared and so I think you're understanding what sexual harassment is and

265
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:40,109
it's really unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature which offends intimidates humiliates so but what

266
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:45,769
is it because there's a gray area on that I mean can I ask someone in the workplace out for a date

267
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:51,410
I mean a lot of people find their mates in workplaces and I think you know really just

268
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:57,589
understanding of course you can but once that individual said you know that it's they don't

269
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,950
want to go out or whatever to continue to do that then it's really unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature

270
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:03,490
continue go back and keep on asking them that's when you're starting to cross the line

271
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:08,809
a lot of the sexual harassment that happens today as well is not necessarily physical it's

272
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:16,789
sending unwanted sexting you know videos images those types of things as well

273
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:24,109
so I think it's the obligations on the employer to make sure that everyone knows what's appropriate

274
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:28,710
and what's not and I think also what's happened is organizational dynamics

275
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:35,130
have really shifted in the last few years particularly after the me too movement so

276
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:40,849
the sexualized banter which we might have heard five years ago it actually no longer has a place

277
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:50,549
in most workplaces so just really being aware of that and just testing also you know is this

278
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:57,269
conversation okay for you or or whatever I think is really important so keeping your antenna up

279
00:21:57,309 --> 00:21:58,589
my rule is

280
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:05,230
if you're worried about it don't do it because it's something you know that's telling you this

281
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:11,730
is a bit on the edge so maybe I should desist and I know good organizations are when they onboard

282
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:17,769
people they've got good strategies to create a common language in this area so one example I'm

283
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:24,930
thinking about is an industrial company when you come in you're taught the say it again strategy

284
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:28,769
so if you were you know telling a sexualized

285
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,410
I'd say hi Luke can you say that again

286
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:35,630
and everyone in the organization knows well looks a little bit

287
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:42,109
potentially going across the line it's just a depersonalized way of just saying to Luke I'm

288
00:22:42,109 --> 00:22:46,509
feeling a bit uncomfortable here so there's some really good work and strategies being done there

289
00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:52,130
yeah no doubt the landscape has changed enormously hasn't it Elizabeth you know five years now and

290
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:58,809
what was you know deemed acceptable and even in in broadcasting on air that's it's just you're right

291
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:04,529
used to be a lot more free-flowing and now I find myself in that situation all the time where you've

292
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:10,309
got no intention to do anything that would harm or upset or anyone but you're right it's a good

293
00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:15,009
way to think about it and if you are thinking about it could be what's the upside yeah maybe

294
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:20,609
maybe leave it out maybe move on exactly I also think we need a bit of tolerance here though as

295
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:24,769
well because everyone's learning and you don't want to be dumped on by a huge height from the

296
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:31,589
sisterhood or whoever it is so I always I you know make it my business just to help educate

297
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:38,849
people in a in a humorous way or whatever just to kind of help people see that maybe and you know

298
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:44,049
sex everyday sexism is one thing but I see everyday racism and those types of things as well

299
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:49,390
we do need to call it out but in a way which doesn't alienate people but gets them to come

300
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:54,069
on the journey of learning what's acceptable and what's not I mentioned in the intro you're one of

301
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:54,750
the United Nations

302
00:23:54,769 --> 00:24:00,670
key leaders on human on the Human Rights Council for addressing this globally the gender inequality

303
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:06,410
challenge it's an incredible role that you've got incredible leadership position what

304
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,910
what are the traits that you feel have helped you in those key roles

305
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:18,589
well I've learned as I've gone along because you know creating change at an organizational

306
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:23,190
level is one thing creating change at a nation state level is something else

307
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,349
and I

308
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:24,750
I

309
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:24,769
I

310
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:54,750
, I undertake the UN's country missions I interact with the leaders of nation states and I use similar principles which is not to go on the attack for me I work within the corridors of power I mean change happens on a continuum and radical activism is very important it's just not the type of work that I do I'm more sit within the corridors of power to help expand that out to help leaders

311
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,089
powerful leaders see

312
00:24:56,089 --> 00:24:59,690
that small shifts can actually have an outsized impact

313
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:04,930
so I think for me what have I learned I've learned that

314
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:09,910
I need to build bridges of understanding between different

315
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,970
views and perspectives

316
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,150
so

317
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:19,150
I do that by a number of techniques one is when I enter into a conversation with

318
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,049
someone

319
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:24,710
I never assume ill intent I always assume good intentions

320
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:30,690
intent or at a base level, even neutral intent. Even if I had a conversation with this same

321
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:36,970
individual a couple of weeks before, and we were on different parts of a planet. So assume good

322
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:44,490
intent. And then I can disagree with people's views, but what I can never disagree with is

323
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:50,329
the influences and forces that have shaped them to hold that view. And just to give you an example

324
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:57,509
of that, I mean, I'm in a small working group of five special rapporteurs. We traverse very

325
00:25:57,509 --> 00:26:05,950
emotionally difficult grounds, such as abortion, surrogacy, sex work. And even amongst the five of

326
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:13,670
us, we have different views. Now, as a women's rights activist, most of us would agree in women's

327
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:20,309
reproductive rights and women's right to abortion. But one of our members,

328
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:26,049
didn't see it that way. And so I could see initially that we were just butting heads on

329
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:31,910
that issue. But what we came to understand is that individual, when they were about age 10,

330
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:38,369
their parents had been taken away in their country to a re-education camp. And this individual was

331
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:44,950
left at age 10 with a younger brother to really raise that younger brother. And it was a

332
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:50,309
Pentecostal church that accepted her in. And that's how her

333
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:55,789
views about women's reproductive rights were shaped. So that's why she's not a proponent of

334
00:26:55,789 --> 00:27:01,430
women's ability to access abortion. And once we kind of understood that, we could say, OK, well,

335
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:06,450
what is it that we can agree with? Because we could put ourselves in her situation and say,

336
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:13,849
well, if we'd been raised in the Pentecostal church, we probably wouldn't agree with women's

337
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:19,150
right to seek an abortion as well. So I just think instead of disagreeing with someone's view,

338
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,190
actually going to...

339
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:25,890
Try and understand what are the influences and forces that have shaped them to hold that view.

340
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:32,910
And let's see if we can identify some common ground at that part. That's what leads you to

341
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:39,109
really build a strong platform for reform. And that's what I try to do in the interactions I had,

342
00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:44,130
whether it's with the head of a nation state, an ambassador or whatever, or indeed,

343
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:50,109
someone that I meet at the coalface in a mine site or in a factory or wherever it is on a sporting

344
00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:50,289
field.

345
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:57,829
Yeah, Elizabeth, you mentioned your pending trip to Afghanistan, potentially. And I think you see

346
00:27:57,829 --> 00:28:03,950
the images of progression and young women going to university and school and education and

347
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:11,730
progression. And then we've just seen an immediate halt back into sort of sixth century times. I

348
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:18,910
mean, is there hope? How do you even start to tackle something that is just seemingly so intricate

349
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,109
as Afghanistan?

350
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:27,869
I know. Look, it's so difficult. We are in a period of major pushback on human rights generally,

351
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:34,410
but particularly the rights of women and girls and the LGBTIQ community. So that's happening in

352
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:39,869
every region of the world. We're seeing a real pushback. But in these roles, you have to have

353
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:50,069
hope. And without hope, then, you know, there is no future which is underpinned by human rights. So

354
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:57,890
I, you know, sometimes I feel despairing, but I don't keep a chair for despair. Absolutely not.

355
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:06,269
I, I also understand that, you know, to think about me taking a particular action, and it will

356
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:12,369
have any given impact. So for example, our country mission to Afghanistan, if I held on to the belief

357
00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:19,630
that we would be able to change the Taliban, then I could be very sorely disappointed. So what I do

358
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,109
is really focus on the fact that I'm not going to be able to change the Taliban. I'm going to be able to

359
00:29:20,109 --> 00:29:26,269
focus more on the work that I'm doing. Do I believe in the truth, the rightness and the value of the

360
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:32,430
work that I'm doing? Because if I believe in that, that should be enough, rather than believe that

361
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:38,690
I'm going to get any given outcome, because it's way too complex for that. And I think those leaders

362
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:46,509
who are leading in really periods of such mass uncertainty, complexity, we have to come back to

363
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:49,589
that type of impact.

364
00:29:50,109 --> 00:29:55,549
Rather than thinking, well, I'm taking this action. And if I don't get that impact, I'm a failure. So

365
00:29:55,549 --> 00:30:00,210
Elizabeth, I wanted to speak to you about a range of different leadership traits that we see

366
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:05,029
common with extraordinary leaders like you and love your perspective and your world and the

367
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:11,329
legacy that you've got in, in really changing the conversation around gender inequality. But we see

368
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:16,029
from a leadership point of view, Elizabeth, that very hard to start without a sense of

369
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:19,410
self-leadership. And does that term resonate with you, self-leadership?

370
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:27,789
Absolutely. I mean, you have to walk. I believe that leadership is not a title or it is a skill set,

371
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:35,410
I suppose, in some ways, but it's a way of walking in the world. And anyone can be a leader. But you

372
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:42,109
have to walk in the world in a way that is totally congruent with what you say as well. We are what we

373
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:49,750
do, not what we say. So for me, as someone who's a human rights advocate, if I'm not treating

374
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,089
everyone as a human rights advocate, I'm not going to be a human rights advocate. I'm going to be a human rights advocate.

375
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:58,410
with respect. If I'm not, you know, ensuring human dignity, the human dignity of every

376
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:07,230
individual, if my interactions are not permeated by human decency, then I'm, you know, I'm not

377
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:12,529
leading in the way that I need to lead. So I believe human rights starts at home. That's how

378
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:19,809
I act, which is most important. And also self-leadership, as you talk about it, is also

379
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:25,609
about self-care. I think very much about in this moment, when I look at the enormity of the

380
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:30,130
geopolitical shifts and the other things that each of us are holding for the climate crisis,

381
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:39,309
the inequality crisis, the global pandemic. I, you know, I think the ability to ensure that we're

382
00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:44,329
both physically and mentally well is really critical. I mean, the human rights defenders

383
00:31:44,329 --> 00:31:49,529
across the world have taught me that being well, both physically and mentally is the ultimate

384
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:49,789
action. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's a really important thing.

385
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:53,829
It's the ultimate act of political empowerment in most countries of the world. And it's the

386
00:31:53,829 --> 00:32:00,049
ultimate act of, you know, women's empowerment as well. So I will be well, both physically and

387
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:06,250
mentally. And that means I'll invest in self-care. I'll, you know, I've developed techniques around

388
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:12,990
that. When I go on mission, I have a toolbox of techniques. I'm a regular meditator. So I'll use

389
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:19,789
that as a, as a, you know, daily or weekly practice. But I'll also, you know, I've also,

390
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:25,890
I learned to recognize emotional signals in my body, to use the wisdom of the body, as well as

391
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:34,690
my mind to stay safe in any particular circumstance and know that I'll be okay. Recognize how I'm

392
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:41,390
feeling and adjust for that. So I, yeah, I can't stress enough the importance of, you know, self-care

393
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:48,670
as a component of self-leadership. And particularly in this moment, because our movements for change

394
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,789
will only ever be as a result of self-care. And so I think that's a really important thing.

395
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:57,349
Strong as every one of us who makes up that movement. And for me, that's why I choose to

396
00:32:57,349 --> 00:33:01,809
be physically and mentally well. It's a brilliant answer, Elizabeth. Thanks for sharing that. And I

397
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:06,369
love your, your thoughts on a, on a toolbox of techniques. And we often hear, you know, meditation

398
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:12,329
on as a, as a common trait. But as you said, if the ultimate empowerment is being physically and

399
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:18,289
mentally well, isn't it? It's an incredible thing to start with every day. And I love the way you

400
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:19,769
described that. We see leaders are really good at that. And I think that's a really good thing.

401
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:24,809
We're conscious of how they positively impact others in their environment. And you just described

402
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:30,430
that you're doing that on a global scale. But how do you think about that on a daily basis? You gave

403
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:35,390
a bit of that in your last answer, but does that resonate as well? Yeah, definitely. You, as a

404
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:42,869
leader, you've got the responsibility to, yeah, to ensure that those that you're working with,

405
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:48,890
firstly, that they're treated respectfully. I mean, I do a lot of work and deep examinations

406
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:56,269
of culture, from big global multinationals, to militaries, to police forces, to, you know,

407
00:33:56,349 --> 00:34:01,670
orchestras and whatever. And some of the toxic behavior I see, particularly from leadership,

408
00:34:02,069 --> 00:34:09,969
has such an outsized impact with, with people, actually. And actually, just in relation to that,

409
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:17,889
Luke, I just wanted to maybe just read just a letter, which a man that I recently

410
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:18,869
came across, and I think it's a really good one, which is, I think it's a really good one,

411
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:27,889
on one of these deep examinations brought to a storytelling. So what I do in organizations is I

412
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:33,369
try to take the lived experience of individuals directly to the heart of power, so to the CEO

413
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:39,389
of the leaders of the organization. And this individual had been relentlessly bullied over

414
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:45,230
about a year, he tried to speak out, he tried to get support, but nothing was really forthcoming.

415
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,869
And indeed, it wasn't until,

416
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:54,949
he was able to tell his story directly to the CEO, that he managed to get some respite. But I'd just

417
00:34:54,949 --> 00:35:03,170
like to just read to you what, I asked them to bring, you know, to tell their story in a deeply

418
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:10,230
human way, but also to bring any, you know, collateral information that they might have.

419
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:16,869
And this man brought a letter from his young daughter that she'd written him on Father's Day,

420
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:18,449
which was a couple of months before.

421
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,909
And this is what the letter says. It says,

422
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:23,590
Dear Daddy, I love you always and forever.

423
00:35:24,949 --> 00:35:29,710
Dear Daddy, oh my God, where do I begin? You're my knight in shining armor,

424
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:36,750
the joy to my life and the love in my life. I don't think that in all my 15 years of being alive,

425
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:43,510
I've ever met someone as brave as you. I know that life's been really tough lately for you at work,

426
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:48,429
and that some very sad things have happened. But what you always need to know is,

427
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:53,429
that I'm always here for you, and we will always get this through this together.

428
00:35:53,429 --> 00:35:59,429
I remember when I was younger, we'd go to the beach and let the waves crash up against us.

429
00:35:59,429 --> 00:36:06,429
They were so powerful, but not as powerful as you. I'd be scared, but before those waves could reach me,

430
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:11,429
you would scoop me up into your arms, the place where I was always safe.

431
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:16,429
That was the day that I realized you could always protect me.

432
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:17,429
And the day I realized that I was safe.

433
00:36:17,429 --> 00:36:18,429
And the day I realized that I could always protect you.

434
00:36:18,429 --> 00:36:26,389
would always protect you and i i think it's a beautiful example of just how you know bullying

435
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:33,389
in a workplace so how you act as a leader in your workplace what type of impact that that can have

436
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:38,190
not just on the individuals in your workplace but all the people that they're connected to as well

437
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:43,889
including that beautiful young daughter who wrote that letter yeah thank you for sharing that and

438
00:36:43,889 --> 00:36:48,289
and we're really passionate about that too in the work we do you just see that if your work

439
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:52,769
environment is unhappy and stressful it has an enormous amount of flow and effects as you just

440
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:56,889
pointed out so beautiful what a beautiful letter from a 15 year old daughter by the way how how

441
00:36:56,889 --> 00:37:01,650
amazing is is that but you know she's picking up on the stress of her dad and that's affecting his

442
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:07,929
home life and affecting his relationships and and you know to to not understand uh i was speaking

443
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:12,909
to to ruddick sally on this who was the founder of swiss and and he was just describing the only

444
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:13,869
thing that kept him up at night was the fact that he was not able to do his job and he was not able

445
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:13,889
to do his job and he was not able to do his job and he was not able to do his job and he was not able to do his job

446
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:18,849
was how happy the people were that were in his environment and what else could i do to make

447
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:25,030
people more happy because that's the responsibility of leadership isn't it is exactly like that and so

448
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:30,150
to uh to share that conversation is really powerful i appreciate it we wanted to talk

449
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:34,030
to you about creating i wanted to talk to you about creating and sharing a vision you've

450
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:39,730
got a global vision it seems for uh the uh conversation around gender inequality how

451
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:43,869
have you gone about sharing and creating that vision um i

452
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:50,210
i think for me um sharing the vision is about engaging people's both their heads and their

453
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:56,670
hearts i mean what i learned early on is you could share all the data which supported your vision my

454
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:03,269
vision is for a much more gender equal world um a kinder more compassionate world a prosperous

455
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:10,809
world for sure but one where everyone has a place everyone's valued um treated with dignity and

456
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:13,849
respect and to get people along with you and to get people along with you and to get people along

457
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:20,570
on that journey often means that they need to shift now i can put all the data about you know

458
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:27,190
the gender inequality stats you know women are paid less they experience more violence they

459
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:34,309
sexually harassed more all that data that will never be enough what i need to do is engage people's

460
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:40,130
hearts and i do that through the storytelling i mean just that story that i told then and read

461
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:43,750
verbatim that letter it's the stories of

462
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:50,389
human harm that are happening in this moment if i can engage you on that then i think you will

463
00:38:50,389 --> 00:38:57,769
more be more likely to step up with me on my vision of a gender equal world because change

464
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:05,590
usually happens not by taking a giant leap it happens by adding adding to continuing adding

465
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:11,449
more all these small nudges and really about healing the part of the world that touches you

466
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,829
that's around you and to do that and to do that and to do that and to do that and to do that and

467
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:19,070
to do that you have to get proximate to the issues and listen to the stories or what i what i call the

468
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:27,530
other voices the voices that are outside usually your remit so to get people to come on board with

469
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:35,489
my vision i'm helping them get proximate to the human harm i'm investing in storytelling i'm

470
00:39:35,489 --> 00:39:41,170
engaging both their heads and their hearts and then helping them see what part they can play

471
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,829
in creating um you know the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the

472
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:51,250
creating this more more gender equal world and actually i i love the work um that i think it's um

473
00:39:51,250 --> 00:40:00,969
just trying to remember uh the guy who wrote the um uh a humor kai it was he's written a lot but

474
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:08,409
his new book was on the kindness pandemic and he said there look if we dare to dream of a more

475
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:13,550
loving country a kinder more compassionate more cooperative more respectful

476
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:21,110
um country then there's really only one way to turn that dream into reality and that is that

477
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:28,409
each of us must live our lives of if as if that country already exists because if enough of us

478
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:36,610
do that then that country will exist and and i love to you know kind of move along in in that

479
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:43,289
vein to help others see that if we just shift a little bit and live in that way then we will create

480
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:51,829
this vision of a more gender equal yeah australia family nation actually world yeah beautifully said

481
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:56,250
and you know in a world where we just experience so much negativity in terms of mainstream media

482
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:01,050
it's a it's a there's just a little acts of kindness to share them and to take that to your

483
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:05,590
daily uh practice wherever it is isn't it it's the small little things whoever you interact with

484
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:10,570
uh you can have a huge impact curiosity is where we hear a lot elizabeth from leaders we talk to

485
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,829
and through curiosity it's how they continue to learn and learn and learn and learn and learn and

486
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:20,449
grow does that uh appeal to you as well yeah absolutely we've got to be curious about the

487
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:27,449
world and suspend judgment um that's why coming back to those techniques we talked about um the

488
00:41:27,449 --> 00:41:34,269
body wisdom the meditation or whatever um it was victor frankel i think who said between stimulus

489
00:41:34,269 --> 00:41:41,030
and response there's a space and it's in that space that i really i mean he said it more profoundly

490
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,829
than this but that i really get to choose who i am

491
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:51,849
that i can choose freedom and and so for me when i'm engaged in conversations as well when i get

492
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:59,849
curious about things i don't jump jump to judgment quickly i try to keep that space open to remain

493
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:10,349
curious um and really you know learn because the world's so complex um so fascinating in this moment

494
00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:13,829
with everything that's happening i mean yeah sometimes

495
00:42:13,849 --> 00:42:21,349
deeply distressing but also fascinating because with change comes opportunity so let's get curious

496
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:27,489
about that um and let's get intentional and for me also let's remain optimistic and hopeful

497
00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:34,929
yeah beautiful hope is an act of revolution in this moment i think so i hang on to that

498
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:39,650
yeah beautifully said again um you know communicating with clarity is another common

499
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:43,570
trait we see of leaders and and clearly you've got a great skillet

500
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:49,650
doing that on a message that you know is one that you're really purposefully trying to

501
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,309
create a difference and have you gone about communicating that message with clarity

502
00:42:53,309 --> 00:43:01,690
um i think i'm emotionally attached to the message so it makes it easier for me to communicate it

503
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:09,670
um with some clarity and also you know hopefully when i speak it's not just liz broderick speaking

504
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,670
it's liz broderick fueled by the thousands of instances

505
00:43:13,849 --> 00:43:20,130
of human suffering and inequality that i've borne witness to so that what's that's what makes me

506
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:27,969
powerful that's what makes me clear and articulate on this message and um even though you know

507
00:43:27,969 --> 00:43:35,829
sometimes i don't feel at all powerful what i've come and often i'm just have no power at all i'm

508
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:42,130
just thinking of a situation i was in a refugee camp in greece on the isle of lesbos the moria

509
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,829
camp talking to a man who was a refugee who was a refugee who was a refugee who was a refugee who was a

510
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:51,309
you know refugees who come from such you know problematic situations who'd experienced huge

511
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:58,989
sexual violence on their journeys into this refugee camp and they were keen that i engage with

512
00:43:58,989 --> 00:44:05,090
you know european nations to change their migration policies and refugee policies i mean i was

513
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:13,070
absolutely powerless to actually create any change there but i realized if you can you know kind of

514
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:23,769
if you can infuse into yourself a sense of inner power then that radiates um and you know it it helps

515
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:31,010
empower others as well so i might be powerless to change a nation state's immigration policy but i

516
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:37,909
can actually infuse myself by feeling powerful and then how i turn up and bear witness to these

517
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:43,829
stories i can do it in a way which radiates power that matters um so i think it's really important to

518
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:48,250
so coming back to small moments and techniques like that i think is the things that i've learned

519
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:53,829
across my my life yeah and you express it in an incredibly uh clear and purposeful way

520
00:44:53,829 --> 00:44:59,769
how important has collaboration been we we heard about the champions of change collaboration which

521
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:04,489
has been a great part of your history clearly it's something you've identified as really

522
00:45:04,489 --> 00:45:11,610
important to you collaboration's key um because everyone believes that they have the right view

523
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,690
um and

524
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:19,909
none of us has that you know you know there's so many different perspectives so i think the ability

525
00:45:19,909 --> 00:45:24,849
to what i call build bridges of understanding through those techniques like don't assume in

526
00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:32,190
ill intent offer up if you're challenged about something in your own view offer up what what's

527
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:39,409
concerning you to others because that gives them something to latch on to um so i think those types

528
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:43,389
of techniques are techniques where you can start to build collaboration because

529
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:51,389
those solutions that are owned by many are so much more powerful than a solution owned by one

530
00:45:51,389 --> 00:45:56,489
yeah beautifully said again uh who's been the greatest leader in your life

531
00:45:56,489 --> 00:46:04,889
i've been so blessed to have you know to have a life that at different times has touched on

532
00:46:04,889 --> 00:46:12,449
you know wonderful leaders in so many different walks of life so leaders who have positional

533
00:46:12,449 --> 00:46:13,829
power but those who don't have positional power are the ones who are the most powerful

534
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:20,829
i mean i've learned so much from young people as well um and starting with my parents i mean i just

535
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:26,190
feel every day so blessed about the family that i was born into also the country that i was born

536
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:34,010
into so um yeah rather than maybe identifying individuals it's you know those leaders who have

537
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:43,829
been compassionate who are humble who are curious who are courageous um you know wherever i find

538
00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:49,909
them uh you know in not just here in australia as well but in different nations across the world

539
00:46:49,909 --> 00:46:56,530
i'm particularly thinking of a woman in ethiopia that i recently met who when i asked her you know

540
00:46:56,530 --> 00:47:03,670
how she created change because she was a leader in her nation she said look liz i never forget that

541
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:10,829
when i look out on the african plains i realize that a tree so she'll be looking for a tree she

542
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:13,829
said that started with a seed and then some of the trees that she was looking for she said that

543
00:47:13,849 --> 00:47:21,150
and then some sun came and drought might have ravaged that seedling at the beginning she said

544
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:27,849
but what i've come to understand is that i'll do my part and i know that you'll do yours and that's

545
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:34,349
together we'll create change so i also remind myself that i'm not carrying this you know

546
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:41,150
responsibility for creating a gender equal world by myself i'm just a small microcosm of an ecosystem

547
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,829
of change i'll do my part and i know that you'll do yours and that's together we'll create change

548
00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:49,170
i know that you'll do yours yeah and that's uplifting i think yeah thanks for sharing that

549
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:54,250
yeah i love those qualities that you spoke about too elizabeth you know finding people

550
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:59,909
in the leadership that have got that care and empathy and courage and all those traits uh

551
00:47:59,909 --> 00:48:04,110
you know what we see modern leadership looking like in such a healthy way and while we love

552
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:08,670
sharing these stories and hearing you express that so clearly is a really powerful message

553
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:13,829
again i'm in the in the spirit of collaboration we just see now leaders value this in

554
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:20,030
uh in such a strong way and clearly what you're doing globally in this space is there anyone that

555
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:24,789
comes to mind you think god if i could collaborate with that person on this particular part of your

556
00:48:24,789 --> 00:48:29,849
life or another area of passion it might be you know sing with mick jagger for all i know but has

557
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:33,210
there been anyone you thought you'd like to collaborate with that would make a difference

558
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:43,510
um well you know the leaders that i um aspire to even here in in australia i mean people like

559
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:50,190
june oscar um you know senior indigenous elder who i've done a lot of work with but she's taught

560
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:56,530
me so much about walking in a way that you know with deep connection to land and culture and

561
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:03,769
country um so people like that as as i said young people i'm deeply connected with a lot of young

562
00:49:03,769 --> 00:49:11,750
men who and i'm thinking about one um called um now with cena who just has won the human rights

563
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,829
medal for really bringing

564
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:20,829
the largest um group of uh young children from afghanistan he brought them here to australia but

565
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:29,469
i just saw how he led through that evacuation and whatever never giving up um but always you know

566
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:35,369
always believing that it was possible so leaders like that i mean there's so many people that i

567
00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:40,389
come across in everyday life i mean i'm thinking another one katherine smith who was a woman who

568
00:49:40,389 --> 00:49:43,670
was um lived with such extreme

569
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:50,670
violence and i met her as she was going through a trial which was to bring her husband um to

570
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:57,929
account for his actions and he was he was found guilty and sent to jail but i just saw her courage

571
00:49:57,929 --> 00:50:04,750
and leadership as she was going through that trial every day fronting up in front of her violent

572
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:11,650
partner and giving evidence so it's people like that um so from those that are not well known to

573
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:13,590
some that are well known but yeah

574
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:18,469
every one of them i've learned something through us as i've traversed my way through life

575
00:50:18,469 --> 00:50:23,130
and i've learned an enormous amount today elizabeth from our conversation and i love the way you

576
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:28,570
express it with such great passion but not in a way that is shameful as well it feels like you are

577
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:33,250
bringing people along in the conversation and you know i understand i come from uh you know

578
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:38,710
incredibly different background but with a curious mind about wanting to uh to learn more about this

579
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:42,329
and so thank you so much for for sharing your incredible story and the amazing work you're

580
00:50:42,329 --> 00:50:43,769
