1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,929
What does it take to become a great leader?

2
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,650
Is it taking your team to win a premiership?

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:19,579
Is it teaching future generations about compassion and respect?

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,079
What interests you the most? What are you passionate about?

5
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,079
And absolutely, I knew if I was to get out of bed every day

6
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,519
and put my heart and soul into something,

7
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:29,539
that was the number one thing I wanted to do.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,859
Is it empowering colleagues so they can be their best at work?

9
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,979
You get that input into projects early

10
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:38,560
so there's a sense of ownership.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,880
Over not just the outcome,

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,359
but also the process on how we're going to get there.

13
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,520
Leadership isn't something we're born with.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,159
It's something we learn by collaborating with others

15
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,799
to create positive change.

16
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:52,640
I feel informed. I feel inspired.

17
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,939
I've got lots of things to take away from our chat.

18
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,179
G'day, it's Luke Darcy here.

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,039
I've been involved in leadership both on and off the field

20
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,280
for most of my life, and I'm passionate about

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,040
the positive change I've seen in leadership

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,299
to giving people a voice in their environment.

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,640
So,

24
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:10,099
I've created this podcast,

25
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:11,120
Empowering Leaders.

26
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:12,640
In this series,

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,680
we'll unpack learnings and life lessons

28
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,280
from people who are game changers in their chosen field,

29
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,599
whether it's sport,

30
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:19,379
art,

31
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,159
business,

32
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:20,959
or education.

33
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,120
We'll break down the fundamentals

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,519
of the new style of leadership,

35
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:26,060
such as collaboration,

36
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:26,939
integrity,

37
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:27,799
and innovation

38
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:30,239
through the stories of these iconic leaders.

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,879
