1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:10,259
I speak a lot on this podcast about being a father of four

2
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:13,119
and the great privilege of being able to provide for them

3
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:18,160
and the fact that they're healthy and thriving is a real gift in life.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,519
And so when you realise that that is not the case for many kids,

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,379
in fact, a lot of kids face serious abuse,

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,859
grow up in homes where they're not safe

7
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:31,160
and on the receiving end of enormous amounts of domestic violence and challenge.

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,619
So to meet Dave Graham, farmer Dave Graham,

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,979
growing up on a sheep farm,

10
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:38,420
to understand the work that he's doing,

11
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:40,859
saving kids' lives every single day,

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,420
it is truly one of the most inspiring leadership stories

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,939
that I've ever come across.

14
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,299
The work he does with Rough Track is a great inspiration.

15
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:51,179
I hope you take the time to listen to Dave's story.

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,119
It is incredibly inspiring.

17
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,950
Dave Graham is the youngest of 11 kids

18
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,030
growing up on a beef, cattle, cropping and sheep station

19
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:10,709
at the Army.

20
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,750
At the age of 19,

21
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,969
he walked the international catwalks of Europe

22
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:15,609
and graced billboards around the world.

23
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,909
His diverse life includes coming out as an openly gay man

24
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:20,310
on reality TV in Australia,

25
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,709
shifting the language around homophobia

26
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,409
and also using the same platform to raise awareness

27
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,530
for the plight of drought-stricken farmers.

28
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:30,430
He's an internationally recognised dog training expert

29
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,150
and runs a range of education and entertainment platforms

30
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,069
to build relationships between the city and country.

31
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,730
His current role as co-founder and manager

32
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,469
of the at-risk youth charity,

33
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,209
Rough Track,

34
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:43,450
is an inspiring leadership story.

35
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:46,629
Rough Track runs programs for 12 to 17-year-olds

36
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:49,650
who have often been severely neglected and abused,

37
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:52,510
many of which have become completely disengaged

38
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,450
with society through no fault of their own.

39
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:56,170
Dave, I really appreciate you joining me today

40
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,189
on the Empowering Leaders podcast.

41
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:58,430
Yeah, thanks, Dars.

42
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:59,230
Thanks for having me, mate.

43
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,430
It's an incredible story and incredible work that you do.

44
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,150
I'm really taken by it.

45
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,689
The challenge of taking on teenagers

46
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,969
who have been disengaged,

47
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:10,710
about as complex a problem, I think,

48
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,270
Dave, as society throws our way.

49
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,530
Where did you find the courage and the leadership

50
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,569
from within yourself to tackle this work?

51
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:21,610
Yeah, I suppose it just comes back to that simple thing of,

52
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:24,189
you know, you point at a problem and the solutions,

53
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:26,030
those three fingers pointing back at you.

54
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:30,530
And that's simply where this whole thing came about for me,

55
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:36,169
was the Tracker Network is based on the Backtrack Way,

56
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:38,449
which was started by Bernie Shakespeare,

57
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,509
an Australian of the Year local hero,

58
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:42,430
a couple of years ago.

59
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,710
And he started it back in 2006.

60
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,289
And it reduced youth crime in New England area by 30%.

61
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:54,150
And it really did capture those kids that had not just fallen

62
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,969
through the cracks, but had fallen out of the radar

63
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:59,689
of the system and, you know, gave them the opportunities

64
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:00,830
to chase their hopes and dreams.

65
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,990
So the evidence was there that it worked.

66
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:06,110
And the local Hawkesbury region really wanted

67
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,909
to implement something very similar in this region

68
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:09,849
in northwest Sydney.

69
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:10,569
And that's what we've done.

70
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,250
They reached out to me as a dog trainer to be able

71
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,250
to help get them started.

72
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,770
And then, look, not everyone wants to work with violent

73
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,669
and vulnerable teenagers.

74
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,189
And so the six-week pilot was four years ago,

75
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:23,990
and I'm still here.

76
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:28,150
So when you say, you know, how did I get into this position,

77
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:31,090
it chose me, and I'm still here.

78
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:33,189
And we're thankful that's the case, Dave.

79
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:35,409
It's, as I said, an incredible contribution you're making.

80
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:38,830
Can you explain to our listeners how the Rough Track program works

81
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,330
and maybe some of the challenges?

82
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:43,930
And the youth and the kids that you're working with have dealt

83
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,830
with and are dealing with?

84
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:45,650
Crikey.

85
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,250
There's a lot right there, mate.

86
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:54,509
So some of the challenges, look, this region has been hit incredibly

87
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:59,590
hard by the natural phenomenons of drought initially and then

88
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,629
the incredible bushfires that we had all in our region just here

89
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:04,969
and then flood after flood after flood and, of course,

90
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:06,849
as everyone did, COVID.

91
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:10,210
But, you know, we've got the blight of social,

92
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:14,389
economic pressures in our region, you know,

93
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:18,930
just around here where we have the farm where a lot of the kids come

94
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,129
from is council housing area, but then we've got 300 square metre

95
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,990
blocks selling for a million dollars.

96
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:26,350
And, you know, we're an hour and a half from Sydney itself.

97
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,149
So we have this massive dichotomy going on in our own region,

98
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:33,209
and it's gone from a very rural region to now just another suburban

99
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,009
sprawl of Sydney.

100
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:39,170
So there's a lot of those simple social issues going on.

101
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,170
There's the environment.

102
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,009
There's environmental issues.

103
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,889
And then there's the blight of drugs and domestic violence that is just

104
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:49,310
ever-present in our young people's lives.

105
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:55,350
And so the challenges are to do anything and everything possible

106
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,230
to meet each kid where they're at and to get them where they want to go.

107
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,730
And sometimes working out where they want to go is the greatest challenge.

108
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,930
You know, what do you want to do?

109
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,029
And sometimes the simple argument that I've got to have with them is

110
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:09,829
to stay alive, to stay breathing.

111
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:15,250
And it's a daily thing that I come across is kids not wanting to be alive.

112
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,709
And when you've got a kid that's 12 or 13, having that conversation with you

113
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:24,629
first thing in the morning when they arrive, every day is a challenge.

114
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:28,410
It's heartbreaking, Dave, when you articulate it like that.

115
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:31,589
Young people who simply don't want to exist.

116
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,730
You know, they've had so much trauma and no path or really no one

117
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,589
to buy into their story.

118
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:39,990
Can you just go through what you do?

119
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:40,149
What do you do?

120
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:42,149
Rough track and how the program works?

121
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,790
So it's using the idea of space.

122
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,149
So giving space when it's needed.

123
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:50,829
So we have pressure on and we have pressure off and we allow a young person

124
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:53,290
to navigate that space, whatever it's required.

125
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:55,949
So we have the space of the farm.

126
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,910
So we're on five acres here.

127
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,990
We also have another five acres next door, which we utilise thanks

128
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,089
to the property owners there.

129
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:07,449
They're giving us all of that space.

130
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:09,389
So we fill it with animals.

131
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:12,389
We fill it with animals, which give a lot to our kids.

132
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:13,730
So they teach them compassion.

133
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,149
They teach them kindness, but they teach them responsibility

134
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:18,350
and respect because, you know, the first thing the kids do as soon

135
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:24,269
as they arrive is put on their boots and put away their bags and put

136
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:28,209
away their phones and they get their hands dirty, picking up the poop

137
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:30,670
of the animals, making sure that welfare of every animal across the

138
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,110
place is taken care of and connecting with the animals.

139
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,329
And sometimes that's just having a cuddle.

140
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,269
That's just having that connection, which teenagers,

141
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:44,269
often just don't have in general, let alone the kids that we're getting

142
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:45,329
to work with.

143
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:48,410
So it's connecting with those animals, then it's coming back as a group

144
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,689
and we do what's called circle work.

145
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,529
So we sit in a yarning circle and share where we're at

146
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:56,449
and we use numbers.

147
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,209
So a number from one to ten, ten being the best you've ever felt,

148
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,790
one being the worst you've ever felt.

149
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,910
And so we can at least get an insight into where they're at.

150
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,490
So if they're feeling right at the top of the schedule, well,

151
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,009
then we know, yep, we can give them a great activity to really

152
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:11,810
charge on forward and off they go throughout the day.

153
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,930
If they're down and about a one or a two, well,

154
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:16,069
then I know that I've got to spend some time with them and maybe,

155
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:19,029
again, do some horticulture, get our hands dirty,

156
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,290
get some earth around us or just simply sit with them under a tree

157
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,970
and feel some presence so that they understand that there's someone

158
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,329
there to listen to them.

159
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,149
That's literally the first half an hour of the day and it really

160
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:34,970
unfolds from there.

161
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,529
And it could be anything from any of the fabrication workshops

162
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:38,990
to the production.

163
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:44,410
Today they were building plasma cut and metal fabricated fire pits.

164
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,209
They were knocking a heap of those out.

165
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:51,889
They might be reconditioning fence posts or horseshoes to be able

166
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:56,269
to make different art projects or just simple round yards that we use

167
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:58,269
in our sheep herding activities.

168
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:00,449
We do lots of woodwork.

169
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,589
So they were doing woodwork today.

170
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:05,850
They were doing art, heaps of art around here that they painted today.

171
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,470
So a lot of activities.

172
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,990
It really is whatever.

173
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:12,069
That kid needs at that moment in time where you go off,

174
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,769
we have that activity, then we connect back together and we give

175
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:19,129
an opportunity for them, again, to talk about what they did

176
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:21,970
because giving them the confidence to talk in a group is essential

177
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,209
if you want to get a job in life.

178
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,889
You've got to be able to talk to strangers.

179
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:27,930
You've got to be able to talk with proficiency and competency.

180
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,189
So there's a lot of talking that goes on but then there's a heck

181
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,910
of a lot of activity.

182
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:32,929
So it's activating.

183
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:34,070
It's leading from the front.

184
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:38,210
All of our leaders lead from the front and if a young fellow

185
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:38,990
or a young lady is in a group, they're going to be able to talk

186
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:39,309
about what they're doing.

187
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:42,870
If a young lass is not coping, well, then we're there to pick

188
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,730
up the activity to keep it going forward until we get to do that check-in

189
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,669
and then we can talk about how difficult it was,

190
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:54,169
what challenges we faced and also what it is that as a group we can help

191
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:57,090
move that activity forward going back to that activity.

192
00:08:57,529 --> 00:08:58,690
They cook their own tucker.

193
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:01,610
They make sure that all their PPE is correct.

194
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:05,669
So all the stuff to make them job ready that probably you and I take

195
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:08,049
for granted that our parents taught us or the fact that we've been

196
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:08,710
around people.

197
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:12,250
In the workforce are giving us all of those skills.

198
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:14,789
You know, we're giving them everything that they need to be able to get

199
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:16,429
to that workforce stage.

200
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,950
And I mentioned in the preamble that you're an internationally renowned

201
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,769
dog trainer and the use of dogs in the Rough Track program is at the core

202
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:26,950
of the program as well.

203
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,289
Is that for every child?

204
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,509
Does every child get to select a dog?

205
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,370
Is that part of it?

206
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:34,909
Yeah, that's what does make us unique in the tracker network,

207
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,129
which is that every kid does get a dog.

208
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:38,429
I mean,

209
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:39,690
every dog's here.

210
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,129
So every kid gets to bond with their own dog.

211
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,789
And it's just crazy cool how each different child,

212
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,529
depending on their own personality type and their excitement levels,

213
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,549
which dog they end up choosing.

214
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:54,009
And of course,

215
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:54,990
the dog's got to choose them as well.

216
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:59,470
They've got to have a coming together of the relationship because kids need

217
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,309
to learn how to manage a relationship.

218
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,929
Often they don't have good role models of what a healthy relationship looks

219
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:05,169
like.

220
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:08,769
So having that relationship with their dog is teaching them how to have a

221
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:08,990
healthy,

222
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:13,509
healthy relationship moving forward to break any domestic violence cycles

223
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:16,029
that they may be young have dealt with themselves.

224
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:16,450
I mean,

225
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,509
let's let's face it.

226
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,710
I mean,

227
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:17,950
in,

228
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,490
in our,

229
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:18,850
our,

230
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,750
our young people,

231
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,570
some of them are domestic violence perpetrators themselves,

232
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,490
and some of them have received that in their own,

233
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:26,789
you know,

234
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:28,289
young relationships,

235
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,889
let alone their family relationships.

236
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:34,529
So that dog is is teaching them how to be kind,

237
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:35,649
how to be compassionate,

238
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,409
but also how to communicate effectively without language.

239
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:38,929
You know,

240
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,009
you can't just say to a dog,

241
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:40,370
Hey,

242
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,149
do this,

243
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:41,370
you know,

244
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,129
you've got to use body language.

245
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:43,490
And,

246
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,210
um,

247
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,070
and oftentimes when a teenager,

248
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,370
we've all seen it,

249
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,470
we've been at ourselves,

250
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:49,070
uh,

251
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,149
they don't give much,

252
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,490
they grunt.

253
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:52,909
Um,

254
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:54,409
and their body language is usually,

255
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:56,549
I hate the world when you see them first thing in the morning,

256
00:10:56,549 --> 00:10:57,610
cause they don't want to be out of bed.

257
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,830
They were playing games all night on their computer.

258
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,730
So,

259
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:00,950
you know,

260
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,990
it's learning how to activate a dog and how to activate a relationship by

261
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,710
being involved by being present,

262
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,629
but also making sure that the mood,

263
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:09,769
um,

264
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,389
isn't just done by your words,

265
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:12,730
but also done by your behavior.

266
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,929
So that behavioral exchange coming from the dogs is absolutely key to giving

267
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:20,809
these kids that strong ability to create healthy relationships.

268
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,509
And I don't think a non dog lovers quite appreciate what you're saying.

269
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:26,009
A dentist,

270
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:28,090
this blue staffie in our house is,

271
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,889
but I say this seriously is by far and away,

272
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:30,789
the most important,

273
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:31,789
uh,

274
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:32,909
contributor to the house.

275
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:34,250
And I've got four kids,

276
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,090
three teenagers,

277
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,470
one turns 12 next week.

278
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,330
They pour the teenagers,

279
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:38,909
but they pour their,

280
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:40,590
their love into dentists.

281
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,149
And that's how they express themselves because he doesn't yell back.

282
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:44,250
He doesn't tell them to make their bed.

283
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,370
And he's got this incredible intuition around,

284
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:47,669
you know,

285
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:48,710
who's having an off day.

286
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,909
And,

287
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:49,230
and,

288
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,470
and I love that you're extrapolating that out to,

289
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,549
to kids.

290
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:55,289
And I suppose the brilliant part too,

291
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:56,149
is that at the end of it,

292
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:00,509
I understand that you make them pass that back on at the end.

293
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:00,909
Don't you?

294
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:01,649
So it's,

295
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:02,909
it's not a dog for life.

296
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:03,509
It's,

297
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:04,769
this is a learning experience.

298
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:06,570
Can you explain why that's important as well?

299
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:07,850
Yeah.

300
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,750
So,

301
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,649
the idea of being able to give,

302
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:15,649
give an opportunity to the idea is that you can love something and love it,

303
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:17,350
holus bolus and it's,

304
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,990
it's your everything and it's your whole world,

305
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,750
but then you've got to let go.

306
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,990
And oftentimes men aren't taught to,

307
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,990
to let things go.

308
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,990
And that's why we have these terrible atrocities that happen in our society of

309
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,990
crimes against,

310
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:31,990
and mostly,

311
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,990
mostly women,

312
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,990
but,

313
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,990
but also men,

314
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,990
because we don't know how to let go.

315
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,990
And that's,

316
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,490
how to let go of something that we love because not all relationships are forever.

317
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:42,889
In fact,

318
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:45,889
most relationships we have for short periods of time,

319
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:47,389
but that can be very intense.

320
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:51,190
So to have that skill of being able to form this amazing relationship,

321
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,190
to work together,

322
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:57,389
to camp in your swag together as the kids do with their dogs,

323
00:12:57,389 --> 00:12:58,389
and,

324
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:01,889
and really build this beautiful relationship that takes them to,

325
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:02,590
you know,

326
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,850
audiences of tens of thousands,

327
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,990
which the kids perform with their dogs together.

328
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,990
Right around Australia.

329
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,990
But then to be able to let it go is such a unique part of the program,

330
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,490
which,

331
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:22,990
which gives us the knowledge that kid is ready for the world and is ready as a fully fledged adult that knows that I can love,

332
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:23,990
but I can let go.

333
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,990
And I don't need to hold on or force a relationship to continue when it's past its use by date.

334
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,190
So when a kid comes to me and says,

335
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:32,990
how you look,

336
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:33,490
you know,

337
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,990
I'm ready to move on.

338
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,789
All I'm waiting for that young person to say,

339
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:38,289
is that,

340
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:41,789
and I really want my dog to stay in the program for another young person.

341
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:49,789
And that's when I know that kid has broken the cycle of domestic violence and broken the cycles of dependency and,

342
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:50,289
and is,

343
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:53,789
is no longer anything but a self-empowered,

344
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:54,289
resilient,

345
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:58,789
young person ready to take on the world with their boots on and their,

346
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:04,789
their brain set for the abilities to really give back to society as a independent human.

347
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:07,289
It's incredibly profound.

348
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:08,789
The way that you say that,

349
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:09,090
uh,

350
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:09,490
Dave,

351
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,389
and I will give some details and talk in a moment,

352
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:13,190
how you can support Dave and rough track.

353
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,789
And the idea of having a forever farm is a,

354
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:16,090
is a,

355
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,590
is a great cause at the moment.

356
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,190
So we'll come back to that day and make sure that people listening can,

357
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,090
I'm sure are going to,

358
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:22,590
you can't help,

359
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,590
but be moved by the work that Dave's done.

360
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,789
I was looking at some stats that,

361
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:26,789
uh,

362
00:14:26,789 --> 00:14:28,789
apply to this one in four young people,

363
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:30,990
age 16 to 24 live with a mental health disorder.

364
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,289
Now,

365
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:35,590
one in five young people are not enrolled in any form of formal education.

366
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:35,889
There's 30,000 plus young people,

367
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:36,090
uh,

368
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:36,289
uh,

369
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:36,389
uh,

370
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:36,490
uh,

371
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:36,590
uh,

372
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:36,690
uh,

373
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:36,789
uh,

374
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:39,490
plus young people under the age of 25 who,

375
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:39,889
uh,

376
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:42,190
sleep without shelter every night in this country.

377
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,289
One in 10,

378
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:46,590
age 14 to 17 use illicit substances on a weekly basis.

379
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,289
It is a significant problem.

380
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:52,190
We don't see it when we live privileged lives like,

381
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:52,490
uh,

382
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:52,990
like I,

383
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:53,389
and others,

384
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:54,090
uh,

385
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:54,889
are allowed to,

386
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:55,490
um,

387
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:55,690
uh,

388
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,090
are we making a dent in it,

389
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:57,389
Dave?

390
00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:02,490
Do you feel like that the pathways like you're providing are making a significant dent?

391
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,090
Yeah.

392
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,289
Uh,

393
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:05,789
we,

394
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:06,389
um,

395
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:07,090
we're around,

396
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:07,389
uh,

397
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:08,990
a fire not long ago.

398
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,389
And,

399
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:09,889
uh,

400
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:10,690
there was about 20,

401
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,090
20 kids around the fire,

402
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:12,789
the campfire.

403
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:12,990
And,

404
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,090
and often that's when some amazing insights into a young person's,

405
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:17,389
uh,

406
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:21,690
psychology and trauma really get vented out into the world,

407
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:21,990
um,

408
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,590
because of the,

409
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,990
the safety of the night.

410
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,190
But,

411
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:24,389
um,

412
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:26,889
there's something about being around a fire that allows,

413
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:27,289
uh,

414
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:28,090
young people to,

415
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,289
to really open up and,

416
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:32,590
and to be super vulnerable and to heal a lot of that,

417
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:32,889
um,

418
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:34,190
that past hurt that,

419
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:34,590
uh,

420
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,190
that was there.

421
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:36,590
And,

422
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,990
uh,

423
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,690
uh,

424
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,389
Crikey.

425
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:41,789
Um,

426
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:43,190
you'll have to ask the question again.

427
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,690
Sorry.

428
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,490
Yeah.

429
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:45,789
Yeah.

430
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:45,990
It's,

431
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,590
um,

432
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:46,990
it's,

433
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,590
okay.

434
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,389
I'll keep going.

435
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,990
I'll keep going.

436
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,789
I'm just going to break,

437
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:49,990
but,

438
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,590
um,

439
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:50,789
nah,

440
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:51,389
it's emotional,

441
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:51,590
mate.

442
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,190
I can,

443
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,190
I can only imagine what,

444
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,590
what you've been through and what you've seen sitting around the campfire.

445
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:57,990
And you're,

446
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,590
you're about to share about,

447
00:15:59,590 --> 00:15:59,789
you know,

448
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:00,990
the difference it's making.

449
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,990
And yeah,

450
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,690
it clearly gets you straight in the heart,

451
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:03,889
mate.

452
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:04,190
And I,

453
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:04,690
you know,

454
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,090
I only met you a few days ago,

455
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:06,789
on the set of an,

456
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:07,289
and I,

457
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:07,789
I,

458
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:08,590
you know,

459
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,889
and known for not having,

460
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:10,490
uh,

461
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:10,990
you know,

462
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:11,590
but my wife,

463
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,990
where it says boarding school took all the emotions straight out of you,

464
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,590
but I,

465
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,289
your story captivated me straight away.

466
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:16,690
And I was like,

467
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:16,889
man,

468
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:19,289
I'd love to catch up again and hopefully share it.

469
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:20,289
So,

470
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:20,690
I mean,

471
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,590
are you comfortable sharing that story?

472
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:22,889
Yeah,

473
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:23,289
no,

474
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:23,590
no.

475
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:23,990
Look,

476
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,389
um,

477
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:27,190
so 20 young people around the campfire and,

478
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,090
um,

479
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:29,289
uh,

480
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:32,490
there wasn't a single one that didn't say that if it wasn't,

481
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:32,789
uh,

482
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:33,990
for rough track,

483
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,389
um,

484
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:36,090
they wouldn't be here.

485
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,389
And,

486
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:37,690
you know,

487
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,990
you're making a difference when 100% of these,

488
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:41,789
their teenage,

489
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:43,090
their kids,

490
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,690
when they say that they wouldn't be,

491
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,990
they're having a conversation with you.

492
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,090
Uh,

493
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,789
if it wasn't for the program that you're,

494
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:51,590
you're providing,

495
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,090
it wasn't for the,

496
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,389
the compassion and,

497
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:54,590
uh,

498
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,289
the sense of belonging and the ability to master,

499
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:58,090
um,

500
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,389
the skills that they,

501
00:16:59,389 --> 00:16:59,690
they,

502
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,090
uh,

503
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:00,789
they have,

504
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:02,190
um,

505
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:02,590
it,

506
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:02,789
uh,

507
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:05,589
it makes you get up the next day and,

508
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:05,789
uh,

509
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:09,390
and work harder so you can help more kids achieve that same outcome.

510
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,990
And that is to have air in their lungs and,

511
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,289
uh,

512
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:15,190
to experience this incredible thing that,

513
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:15,589
um,

514
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,589
so many of us just take for granted,

515
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:17,890
but,

516
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:18,289
um,

517
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:18,990
but yeah,

518
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,190
I,

519
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:19,589
yeah,

520
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,289
I can't stress enough when you have,

521
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:21,490
uh,

522
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,690
one kid say that to you,

523
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,990
let alone around one campfire,

524
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:25,990
every single kid,

525
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,390
um,

526
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,490
say that same thing.

527
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:27,990
Um,

528
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,289
it's,

529
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:29,589
it's powerful stuff and it's a,

530
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:32,589
it's a driving force that makes you in,

531
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:33,690
in a very difficult,

532
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,690
um,

533
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,289
job,

534
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:35,789
uh,

535
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,390
keep going every single day.

536
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,690
It's the ultimate story of,

537
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:38,890
uh,

538
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,789
incredible leadership,

539
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:40,089
Dave.

540
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:40,490
And I,

541
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,289
I commend you in every sense.

542
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:42,490
It's,

543
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,490
it's such a,

544
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:43,990
as you said,

545
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,289
if you,

546
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:47,289
if you could in your lifetime impact when save one life,

547
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:54,089
that may be the greatest thing you ever do to sit around a campfire and have every single teenager expressed that that's what you've done is,

548
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:54,289
is,

549
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:55,289
is so profound.

550
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:56,089
So again,

551
00:17:56,089 --> 00:18:01,190
we'll talk about how to get to rough track and support a permanent farm to save lives.

552
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,390
I mean,

553
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,289
you couldn't think of a better cause to contribute to.

554
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:05,089
So look up rough track,

555
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:06,390
are you double left track?

556
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:06,890
Um,

557
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,490
we'll come back to that again and just make sure that if you are interested in that conversation,

558
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,289
um,

559
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:13,490
it's hard not to be,

560
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,289
um,

561
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:18,990
what a great thing to build a farm permanently in an area that's changing people's lives.

562
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,089
Your leadership is,

563
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:21,490
is something that,

564
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,289
and you're wrong money.

565
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:27,190
I'm assuming a lot of these kids haven't had adults take an interest in their life at times.

566
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,990
So how hard is it for you?

567
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,289
I mean,

568
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:31,490
you asked them to give the dogs back to pass it on.

569
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,789
How hard is it for you sometimes to send them back into their environment?

570
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:36,190
Oh,

571
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:36,690
look,

572
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,089
um,

573
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:38,190
when we first started,

574
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,490
there was a lot of camping here at the farm.

575
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,289
Um,

576
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:42,490
we were really fortunate.

577
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,589
Uh,

578
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:43,789
uh,

579
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,589
BCF,

580
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:45,289
uh,

581
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:48,089
found out what we were doing and they sent us a heap of swags.

582
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:48,690
Um,

583
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,490
cause you know,

584
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,289
sometimes I had kids camping here that couldn't go home or whatever.

585
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:53,589
And,

586
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:54,589
um,

587
00:18:54,589 --> 00:18:54,890
uh,

588
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,089
we had more kids than obviously blankets and,

589
00:18:57,089 --> 00:18:57,289
um,

590
00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:00,089
sometimes I would just under towels here and,

591
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:00,190
uh,

592
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,490
whatever to keep them,

593
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,289
keep them,

594
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:02,789
you know,

595
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:04,589
to a point that they can have a sleep at night.

596
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:05,990
So we got all these swags.

597
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,490
So,

598
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:06,990
um,

599
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,789
there was some nights where you'd have,

600
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:08,990
you know,

601
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:09,490
10,

602
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,289
12 kids,

603
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:11,589
kids camped here,

604
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:12,289
um,

605
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:14,589
just to make sure that they were safe and they felt safe.

606
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:15,190
Um,

607
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,990
and it,

608
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,890
it still happens,

609
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,690
but much,

610
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:25,990
much less because every day they're building the resilience and they're building the communication skills to be able to stay in whatever home looks like.

611
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,890
Uh,

612
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:27,589
but,

613
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:29,089
but I'll be straight up honest with you.

614
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:29,490
Um,

615
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,490
in the last two weeks,

616
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,789
I've had three of the young people I work with,

617
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:34,190
um,

618
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,089
assault or,

619
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:35,490
um,

620
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,089
or use,

621
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:36,490
uh,

622
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,890
a weapon on,

623
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:38,990
on caregivers.

624
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,589
Um,

625
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:40,089
these are,

626
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:40,289
you know,

627
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:41,789
kids that are new to our program.

628
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:42,190
Um,

629
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:42,789
they're in their,

630
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:44,089
their fourth week.

631
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:44,390
Um,

632
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,890
usually the violence really,

633
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,390
uh,

634
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,789
dissipates almost completely between third and fourth week,

635
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,289
which is we're on track for that.

636
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:51,490
But,

637
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,289
um,

638
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:53,089
but yeah,

639
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:54,589
violence can be a,

640
00:19:54,589 --> 00:19:54,990
uh,

641
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,990
an only tool that these kids,

642
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,289
uh,

643
00:19:57,289 --> 00:19:59,490
use in their home environments to,

644
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,890
to just feel like they've got some control or got some power over their own existence.

645
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:04,289
And,

646
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:04,990
uh,

647
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,990
so there's quite a few court cases for me to,

648
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,990
to support the kids coming up to,

649
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,089
um,

650
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:10,990
to grow and learn from,

651
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:17,789
because locking them away is not a solution for these poor choices that I feel forced to make.

652
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:18,589
I mean,

653
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:21,690
anyone that has seen a frightened animal cornered,

654
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,690
they know that animal is going to attack because it has no other options.

655
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,089
And I'm not saying these kids are animals.

656
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:29,490
I'm saying these kids are creatures just like you and me that,

657
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:29,789
um,

658
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:30,490
often,

659
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:30,890
uh,

660
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,690
without the skills to be able to communicate effectively,

661
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,890
what they're going through or what they're feeling at that time.

662
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:36,190
And,

663
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:36,890
um,

664
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,789
they often caged in care and,

665
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:39,190
uh,

666
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,789
we've got an amazing system in Australia that looks out for our young people,

667
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:43,089
but,

668
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:43,390
um,

669
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,289
sometimes it doesn't give them the outlets of,

670
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:45,890
uh,

671
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,589
their energy or the traumas or the anxieties that they may be going through.

672
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:52,890
So yeah,

673
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,390
it's,

674
00:20:53,390 --> 00:21:00,190
it's working in the fact that usually by this stage in the 10 week initial foundation program,

675
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:00,490
um,

676
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,589
it dissipates a lot,

677
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:01,789
but,

678
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:02,089
um,

679
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:03,289
but unusually we've had,

680
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:03,589
uh,

681
00:21:03,589 --> 00:21:04,089
a lot of,

682
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:04,789
um,

683
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:05,490
a lot of kids,

684
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,190
uh,

685
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:06,789
um,

686
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:09,390
probably attack those that are trying to look after them,

687
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:09,789
um,

688
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:10,690
in the system.

689
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,490
Um,

690
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,990
but hopefully going forward,

691
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,289
like every single teen week program,

692
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:15,589
um,

693
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:16,789
that dissipates completely.

694
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:18,890
And those of the kids that have been in our core program,

695
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,589
that is the ongoing after the 10 weeks,

696
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:21,390
uh,

697
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:21,589
the,

698
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:23,490
the violence dissipates completely and,

699
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:23,789
um,

700
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:23,990
it,

701
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,990
and it permeates all parts of their life.

702
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,289
And,

703
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:27,190
uh,

704
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,690
parents,

705
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,990
caregivers all,

706
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,990
um,

707
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,990
say to me the same thing every single time is like,

708
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,289
what the hell do you mob do there?

709
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:34,190
And,

710
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:34,390
uh,

711
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,390
the answer is simple.

712
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,390
We just be kind and we listen.

713
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,589
Yeah.

714
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:39,089
And,

715
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,390
and sketching up with you a few days ago,

716
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:47,690
I think we touched on what happens when youth get into youth detention and then graduate to,

717
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,589
to prison.

718
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:48,990
I mean,

719
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:49,089
the,

720
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:51,490
the data and the stats on that is horrific,

721
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:51,890
isn't it?

722
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,089
I mean,

723
00:21:52,089 --> 00:21:52,890
can you share with you,

724
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,089
I mean,

725
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:54,089
that's one of the key things,

726
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:54,390
isn't it?

727
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,089
Keep these kids alive,

728
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:59,289
give them love and care and support to join society in a normal way.

729
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:02,589
But part is just keeping them out of detention and jail in a big way,

730
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:03,089
isn't it?

731
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:03,490
Yeah.

732
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:03,789
Well,

733
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:04,089
the,

734
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,490
the simple stats are that currently we've got,

735
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:06,890
we're on a,

736
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,589
on about 80% of,

737
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:08,890
um,

738
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,289
kids will go through to,

739
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:11,089
uh,

740
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:12,289
to grade 12,

741
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,589
but 97% of kids,

742
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:16,089
um,

743
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:19,390
that get incarcerated for a period of time in their teenagehood,

744
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:19,589
uh,

745
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,089
will end up in prison as adults.

746
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:26,490
And wouldn't it be great if we had 97% of kids going through to grade 12 and,

747
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,390
um,

748
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:27,789
yeah,

749
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:27,990
I,

750
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,289
um,

751
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:29,589
uh,

752
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:33,089
inability to even think that we should throw kids in jail as young as 12 in

753
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:33,390
Australia.

754
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:33,890
And,

755
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:34,390
uh,

756
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,690
we've got a problem with,

757
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,089
um,

758
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:37,289
locking people up,

759
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:37,589
you know,

760
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:42,089
the modern Australian state was kind of founded on locking people up,

761
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:42,390
isn't it?

762
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,890
And getting them away and putting them away,

763
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:45,890
the problem will be over there.

764
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,089
And it never worked 235 years ago for the British.

765
00:22:49,089 --> 00:22:49,390
I mean,

766
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,089
they've still got jails and they've still got crime problems.

767
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:52,890
Um,

768
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,190
whole approach,

769
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,690
uh,

770
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,490
is what works and,

771
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,990
and putting a kid in a prison cell is never going to work.

772
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,289
It,

773
00:22:59,289 --> 00:22:59,990
it never will.

774
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:01,089
No,

775
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:01,589
well said,

776
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:01,789
I,

777
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:02,089
I,

778
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:02,490
uh,

779
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,289
concur with you on it.

780
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:05,890
I had the great pleasure of talking to,

781
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,589
um,

782
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:07,789
a brilliant us author,

783
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:12,289
Don Winslow on this podcast and he's a passionate advocate in,

784
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:12,990
in the us,

785
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,789
the record amount of incarceration in the history of,

786
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:16,589
uh,

787
00:23:16,589 --> 00:23:17,089
of,

788
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:17,289
uh,

789
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:18,890
of humankind.

790
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,690
And now we've got these privatized prisons as he calls them that are

791
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,390
incentivized to have more people in jail and make money off having more people

792
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,789
in jail.

793
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:30,990
Like get your head around our crazy that we've commercialized imprisonment,

794
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,190
uh,

795
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,190
fair to say that we've lost.

796
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:33,990
Our way a little bit.

797
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,289
And,

798
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,390
and we are a smaller version of that here in Australia.

799
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:39,390
So much to talk about Dave on that front.

800
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:39,890
And it's,

801
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,789
it is an amazing story.

802
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:42,589
I did say in the intro,

803
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,190
you've had a diverse life from the catwalks in Europe and,

804
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:47,390
and build up billboards as a male model.

805
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,289
But I want to go back.

806
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:50,490
If you don't mind 16 years ago,

807
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:51,289
uh,

808
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:52,589
reality TV,

809
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:56,990
you're a Queensland farmer and you're much love and you come out,

810
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:57,490
uh,

811
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,190
you know,

812
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,490
with your story and you,

813
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,390
and I read,

814
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:00,589
you know,

815
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:02,190
doing some research for today that you're,

816
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,089
you're the victim of a,

817
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:05,890
a horrific guy bashing and,

818
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:06,289
and,

819
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:08,589
and come out on national television.

820
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:08,890
Can,

821
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:12,789
can you tell us where did that come from within you to have the courage to do

822
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:12,990
that?

823
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:13,789
Cause it was such a,

824
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:15,390
you look back and think that was significant.

825
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:17,289
You really shifted the narrative.

826
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,190
It felt back then.

827
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,390
What was that like?

828
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:20,589
Look,

829
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,289
I didn't really think about it.

830
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:25,589
It's the same as taking on this role and building rough track.

831
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,190
Uh,

832
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:26,890
it's,

833
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:27,690
there's a problem.

834
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,890
Someone's got to do something about it and you look around and no one's doing

835
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:31,089
it.

836
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:31,690
So,

837
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:32,589
you know,

838
00:24:32,589 --> 00:24:32,890
you've,

839
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:33,589
you've got to,

840
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:35,690
you've got to be that person.

841
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:36,089
You know,

842
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:36,589
it's like,

843
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,589
it's like if there's rubbish on a beach or if there's rubbish on the street,

844
00:24:40,589 --> 00:24:40,990
or if there's,

845
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,190
there's something needs to be done,

846
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:45,990
just be the person to pick it up and put it where it belongs.

847
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,589
And that's just who I am as a person.

848
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:49,089
I suppose.

849
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,390
I don't know if that's just a general thing as,

850
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,589
as those of us who grow up on stations,

851
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:54,690
we don't have anyone else.

852
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,890
We don't have garbage collection.

853
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,789
We don't have a police force or ambulance or anything like,

854
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,390
you know,

855
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,690
you've got to look after your own mob and your own land.

856
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,089
And you've got to,

857
00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:04,589
you're responsible for everything.

858
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:07,190
So maybe that's the cultural background that,

859
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,690
that built me as a person,

860
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,789
but I just couldn't understand that.

861
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,690
Here we were past the year 2000,

862
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,289
when everything was supposed to be perfect.

863
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:16,990
And we were meant to have hoverboards and,

864
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:21,490
and cars that drove themselves that we had,

865
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:21,890
you know,

866
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,190
hundreds of laws federally in state that still made gay people,

867
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,089
second-class citizens.

868
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:29,589
So our government was second-class citizen,

869
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:31,690
us where I come from,

870
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:32,289
you know,

871
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:34,890
the expectation was that you just kill yourself.

872
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,289
If you're gay or you move,

873
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:37,089
get, get the hell out,

874
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:37,690
go away,

875
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,289
give you,

876
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:38,990
give your family,

877
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,690
a, a,

878
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:42,890
a good reason that you're in some other city,

879
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:43,490
Sydney,

880
00:25:44,589 --> 00:25:44,990
Melbourne,

881
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,289
or further afield,

882
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:47,990
if you possibly could just get away,

883
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,289
you know,

884
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:50,089
we don't want to deal with this whole gay stuff.

885
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:51,390
And I was just thinking,

886
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,690
this is a joke.

887
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:52,990
You know,

888
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:57,490
we had an amazing football and I've just forgotten his bloody name.

889
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,289
Ian Roberts.

890
00:25:58,289 --> 00:25:58,890
Ian Roberts.

891
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,089
Yeah,

892
00:25:59,089 --> 00:25:59,490
of course,

893
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:02,190
Ian Roberts came out in the 1990s.

894
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:02,390
You know,

895
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,490
when I was at school and that was phenomenal.

896
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,089
And it was like,

897
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:07,890
this whole change was going to happen and then nothing.

898
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,789
It's like this man put himself out there and said,

899
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:11,990
I am who I am.

900
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,190
And I'm cool with it.

901
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,390
Yeah.

902
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:13,490
Oh,

903
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:13,890
if you're not,

904
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:13,990
well,

905
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,690
that's your problem.

906
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:17,289
And no one kept it going.

907
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:20,690
So I thought the only way to really talk to Australia,

908
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,190
and I'd been involved in politics,

909
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,190
quite a fair bit at,

910
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:24,690
um,

911
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:25,390
uh,

912
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:25,690
you know,

913
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,289
in the young nationals,

914
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,190
which is a very right wing party and,

915
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:30,690
uh,

916
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,089
and trying to get changed.

917
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:32,789
There.

918
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:35,789
And I was just hitting my head against a brick wall.

919
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:37,589
And I thought the best way to do it is to go on a

920
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:41,190
reality TV show that has millions of people every night,

921
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,089
sitting down and got their eyes glued to it.

922
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:47,390
And I can have a conversation with every single person watching

923
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:52,190
and challenge their thinking because I couldn't challenge the politics because,

924
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:53,390
you know,

925
00:26:54,589 --> 00:26:55,589
it was just not moving,

926
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:56,390
but I thought,

927
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,990
let's just challenge the people to,

928
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,390
um,

929
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:58,990
say,

930
00:26:58,990 --> 00:26:59,289
you know,

931
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:00,190
do you have a problem with,

932
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:00,690
um,

933
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:02,390
with my sexuality?

934
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,789
And do you want to maybe think about that?

935
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,690
I have a conversation with your family whilst you're watching this TV show.

936
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:07,890
And,

937
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:08,789
you know,

938
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:11,390
the great opportunity was I was on there for three months and,

939
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,089
um,

940
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,089
and people could either like me or dislike me,

941
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,390
but I had to challenge the fact that I was a gay man.

942
00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:18,390
And was,

943
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,089
was that why they liked me or disliked me?

944
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:20,390
And if,

945
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,289
if that was the case,

946
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:24,789
then maybe we could really start breaking down some prejudices as in Robertson.

947
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,390
I'm a football player.

948
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,589
I'm also guy.

949
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:28,490
Is that,

950
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,490
is that reason to like me or just like me?

951
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:31,089
Well,

952
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:32,789
maybe you should challenge your own prejudices.

953
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:34,490
Just like people who have,

954
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:34,890
um,

955
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:35,990
you know,

956
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:42,890
have a vagina had to break that stereotype down or people who had different coloured skin other than pale white had to break that down.

957
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:51,589
Someone had to break down this idea that being gay was somehow bad and was somehow evil and was something that we just needed to get away.

958
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:51,990
And,

959
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,390
uh,

960
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:54,490
three fingers pointed back at me.

961
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,289
It's amazing.

962
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:56,589
Is any,

963
00:27:56,589 --> 00:27:57,089
and you,

964
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:58,690
you mentioned Ian Roberts took,

965
00:27:58,690 --> 00:27:59,089
you know,

966
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:00,390
who just happened to be,

967
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,589
the toughest and most brutal rugby league player.

968
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:04,190
And that's the thing,

969
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:04,789
isn't it?

970
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:05,289
So you,

971
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:06,089
you know,

972
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:06,390
we don't,

973
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,990
we don't have gay men who are sheep farmers on cattle stations.

974
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,990
That's not how it works.

975
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,089
And,

976
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:10,289
and,

977
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:10,990
and it's like,

978
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,690
it's embarrassing.

979
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,390
It's not even anywhere near strong enough for word to think that's not that long ago,

980
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,490
16 years ago.

981
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,289
And it's still,

982
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:17,789
I mean,

983
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:18,690
I have read that,

984
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:18,990
you know,

985
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,890
even in your own family and your community,

986
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:21,289
it was,

987
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,490
as you said,

988
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:22,690
you know,

989
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,990
that serious homophobic move away,

990
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:25,890
you know,

991
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:26,789
in July.

992
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,390
How has that been now in the course of time?

993
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:29,890
Dave,

994
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:30,589
when you look back,

995
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:33,089
is it with your own family and your own community?

996
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:34,589
Do they get it now?

997
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:35,190
Oh,

998
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,890
absolutely.

999
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,089
Yeah.

1000
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:41,190
The outpouring of love and affection for my family was amazing.

1001
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,390
The hardest thing for me,

1002
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,589
once I'd come out,

1003
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:46,789
the realization of what have I done to my mum,

1004
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,390
because I did come from a community where it was,

1005
00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:53,190
just do your family a favor and,

1006
00:28:53,589 --> 00:28:55,890
and do a single vehicle accident and make it,

1007
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:56,890
make it look like an accident.

1008
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:57,690
That was the,

1009
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,289
the,

1010
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,490
the common way that,

1011
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,190
that was spoken about quite openly,

1012
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,690
the favor that you would do for your family.

1013
00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:09,990
So I really feared for how the community would ostracize her as well.

1014
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,690
My dad and,

1015
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,089
you know,

1016
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:11,690
all of my,

1017
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,390
my many siblings.

1018
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:14,390
And,

1019
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:14,990
and that's,

1020
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:18,490
that was my biggest fear is how they would be treated.

1021
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,089
But it was the exact opposite.

1022
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:21,390
I mean,

1023
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:27,089
people absolutely embraced my family and celebrated my family and the amount of people that came out of the woodwork and said,

1024
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:27,490
Oh,

1025
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,490
you know,

1026
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:29,390
you know,

1027
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,089
James,

1028
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:30,289
you know,

1029
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:30,890
Michael,

1030
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:31,390
you know,

1031
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:31,990
Sandra,

1032
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:32,890
you know,

1033
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:33,789
they're gay as well.

1034
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:33,990
And,

1035
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,990
and so it really did change the way that people looked at their family.

1036
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,390
And it's like,

1037
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:38,890
kind of like,

1038
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:39,190
well,

1039
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,089
no one really has a problem.

1040
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:41,390
Why,

1041
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,589
why do I have a problem with my child or,

1042
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,890
or my sister or anything like that?

1043
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:49,890
And hopefully it did really smash a lot of those prejudices,

1044
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,990
but I don't know what we were afraid of,

1045
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,390
but we were probably afraid of the fear of the fear.

1046
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:55,990
But I think deep down,

1047
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,190
everyone loved their,

1048
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,190
their gay or lesbian family members.

1049
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:01,789
They just didn't know how.

1050
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,289
So bizarre.

1051
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:03,890
I find when you,

1052
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,890
when you look back on it,

1053
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,390
isn't to think it's such a continuum,

1054
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:07,789
isn't it?

1055
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:08,490
Sexuality,

1056
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,089
what someone likes compared to what,

1057
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:10,890
I mean,

1058
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:15,289
why would you care out of all the things that you could care about in your life?

1059
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:15,690
Yeah.

1060
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,289
Why would that even,

1061
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:17,690
and,

1062
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:17,990
and,

1063
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,789
but you're right.

1064
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:18,990
I mean,

1065
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,690
it's took such courage and,

1066
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:21,789
you know,

1067
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:21,990
I,

1068
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,390
I played AFL football,

1069
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:23,890
Damon,

1070
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,289
and there's still some huge concern that that's still not a,

1071
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:29,890
an environment where a male players,

1072
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,289
ever felt comfortable coming in.

1073
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:32,390
So it's not as though,

1074
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:32,789
you know,

1075
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,589
that's been moved on.

1076
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:34,789
I mean,

1077
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:36,990
you shifted the needle big time in what you did,

1078
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,190
but yeah,

1079
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,390
it's strange to me that there's still people that have,

1080
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:41,190
however,

1081
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,490
you can have prejudice on that off.

1082
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,289
I find,

1083
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:44,289
I find bizarre.

1084
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:45,390
Did you feel,

1085
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:46,089
you know,

1086
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:48,089
now 2022 and I love your story.

1087
00:30:48,089 --> 00:30:48,289
You know,

1088
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:48,490
you're,

1089
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,390
you're a dad to,

1090
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:49,690
to,

1091
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:50,589
to four children.

1092
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:51,890
That's a great story as well.

1093
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:52,890
Can you tell us about,

1094
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:53,990
about that?

1095
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,390
You've,

1096
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:55,490
you know,

1097
00:30:56,589 --> 00:30:57,390
it's five now.

1098
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:57,490
Oh,

1099
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:57,990
I'm sorry.

1100
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,589
Another one.

1101
00:30:58,589 --> 00:30:58,990
Yeah.

1102
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,289
Yeah.

1103
00:30:59,289 --> 00:30:59,490
No,

1104
00:30:59,490 --> 00:30:59,789
I don't,

1105
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:00,589
I don't like around,

1106
00:31:00,589 --> 00:31:02,589
but yeah,

1107
00:31:02,589 --> 00:31:02,690
no,

1108
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,390
I'm very proud donor dad to,

1109
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,089
to five now.

1110
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:06,990
So yeah,

1111
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,089
it's an ongoing journey.

1112
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:08,390
It's,

1113
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:08,789
it's,

1114
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:10,490
it's something that look,

1115
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:10,990
you know,

1116
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,890
like still even someone who has prejudiced against someone of a different

1117
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:14,289
race,

1118
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,589
it blows my mind that that can still happen or,

1119
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:20,190
or someone that has a misogynistic thing to say,

1120
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,190
it still blows my mind that someone would say,

1121
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:22,289
well,

1122
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:23,089
women shouldn't,

1123
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:23,789
what,

1124
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:24,990
what is that?

1125
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:25,589
But also,

1126
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:25,789
yeah,

1127
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:28,289
just the simple sexuality issue.

1128
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:29,690
It is bizarre.

1129
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,190
That some men not that long ago,

1130
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,789
refused to wear a Jersey because it was a bit of a rainbow on

1131
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:34,990
it.

1132
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,490
And they,

1133
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:40,789
they couldn't even bring themselves to send a message of compassion and,

1134
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:43,490
and integration to others.

1135
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:43,890
So,

1136
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:44,089
you know,

1137
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:46,589
there is still a lot of prejudice out there,

1138
00:31:46,589 --> 00:31:50,690
but the good news is that every year it gets less and less.

1139
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:55,490
And that's because people are making choices to think differently about things

1140
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:55,690
and,

1141
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,589
and how it actually really affects you.

1142
00:31:58,589 --> 00:31:59,289
I mean,

1143
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:01,490
when you walk outside and it's raining,

1144
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,589
you get wet.

1145
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,589
If someone's in a gay relationship,

1146
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:09,089
nothing like absolutely nothing happens to you.

1147
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,589
If someone's skin is a different color to you,

1148
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:12,789
nothing happens to you.

1149
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:13,089
I mean,

1150
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:14,589
the rain will get you wet,

1151
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:20,890
but if someone else's unchangeable factors will not affect you in any way,

1152
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:21,890
shape or form.

1153
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:30,740
It's a great way to,

1154
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,039
to express the absurdity of it.

1155
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,039
And once again,

1156
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:34,539
it's a,

1157
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,940
I love your leadership story.

1158
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,339
And in every area of your life,

1159
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:37,940
there's a pattern,

1160
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,240
isn't it?

1161
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,039
You step up when,

1162
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:40,039
as you said,

1163
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:41,940
the challenge needs to be taken on.

1164
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,039
What we've been asking these,

1165
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:49,539
I've been asking these questions of a range of different leaders from sport and social venture and industry and the arts and,

1166
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:51,539
and what we think great leadership looks like.

1167
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,339
And we think there's a big shift that,

1168
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:53,640
Dave,

1169
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:59,839
in leaders and how they lead with empathy and lead with the care that is clearly what you do every single day.

1170
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:02,140
You've just come out with a breech lamb.

1171
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,440
You told me before we started,

1172
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,140
and you know,

1173
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,240
the kids have experienced,

1174
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,839
you know,

1175
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:07,839
what that's like on the farm today.

1176
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:10,140
So we start with self-leadership and ask that question.

1177
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,839
We think most leaders have a real sense of self-leadership.

1178
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,140
When I ask you about that,

1179
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,240
what does that term mean to you?

1180
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,839
That you have to model exactly what you want.

1181
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:18,839
If you want respect,

1182
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:19,940
if you want kindness,

1183
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,440
if you want town talk,

1184
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,839
if you want anything,

1185
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,640
you've got to model it and,

1186
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,740
and you've got to be what you want.

1187
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,240
And if you can't be it,

1188
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,440
well,

1189
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,839
then maybe you should get to the back of the line,

1190
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,339
you know,

1191
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:34,740
like,

1192
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,740
leaders have to lead from the front and they've got to do everything that they expect others to do.

1193
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,940
This idea of you should do,

1194
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,839
that doesn't wash with me.

1195
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:45,440
That's not,

1196
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,240
not in my playbook of leadership.

1197
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:47,839
It,

1198
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,440
it really is leading from a place of this is,

1199
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,140
this is what I can do for you.

1200
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,839
This is what,

1201
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:01,640
this is me giving you all of what I have and it's your choice with what,

1202
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,240
what you want to do with that.

1203
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,140
And it's about giving those choices.

1204
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,539
The authenticity you can,

1205
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:10,340
you can feel in meeting you a few days ago,

1206
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:10,539
it,

1207
00:34:10,539 --> 00:34:11,739
it pours out of you.

1208
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:14,039
There's no other option in your DNA,

1209
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:14,739
which is,

1210
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:15,739
which is brilliant to share.

1211
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:16,139
We,

1212
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:21,739
we see leaders are now really conscious about how they positively impact others in their environment.

1213
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:21,940
I mean,

1214
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,440
rough track,

1215
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,239
you could not get a better example of,

1216
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,440
of having a positive impact.

1217
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:27,739
I mean,

1218
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:31,539
how have you thought about that consciously about how you go about impacting others positively?

1219
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,440
Yeah,

1220
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,239
absolutely.

1221
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,539
This afternoon,

1222
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,039
I,

1223
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:44,940
I took three kids that have been going through some really tough times and the way I teach young people,

1224
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,340
if you're going through something tough,

1225
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:47,239
give,

1226
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:48,440
give,

1227
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,440
give what you have.

1228
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:54,239
And it's that old adage of if you've got nothing to give,

1229
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:54,440
well,

1230
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,539
then give your time,

1231
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:56,539
give your ears.

1232
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:02,039
And so we went out and did a flood recovery for a turf farmer that is just run off his feet.

1233
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:05,139
He can't get enough staff just to do is what he's actually doing with his veggies.

1234
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:09,139
And he's got all this rubble and rock and everything.

1235
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:10,739
That's just six metres of water.

1236
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:13,639
I've just obliterated his farm.

1237
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:20,440
He's lost huge big gouges of his turf and we're out there picking up picking up rocks and it's hard work.

1238
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,340
It's really hard work.

1239
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,039
And but for me,

1240
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,739
the leadership is to say to these kids,

1241
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:25,039
you know,

1242
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:35,039
if you if you really want something then then give it give it out because someone else needs that and and that's how you effectively create a cycle that that is a good cycle.

1243
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:38,239
That that we can pass on to others.

1244
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,840
Such a brilliant message,

1245
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,239
isn't it?

1246
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:44,539
The second you get into the mode of giving you stop thinking about self,

1247
00:35:44,539 --> 00:35:45,039
don't you?

1248
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:48,139
And and and the problems we create for ourselves as we do.

1249
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:49,639
I mean in the most extreme example,

1250
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:51,239
it's such a it's simple,

1251
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,739
but it's so it's such a brilliant way to think about it.

1252
00:35:53,739 --> 00:36:00,039
I mean we see ladies are really sophisticated how they go about creating and sharing the vision and you know,

1253
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:04,340
I only found out about rough track and he said it's based on the backtrack program.

1254
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:04,940
That's been,

1255
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:08,940
successfully run for a long period of time and and you get your message out really well.

1256
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,539
You've got a great way of articulating.

1257
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:15,340
Have you have you been conscious about creating and sharing that business?

1258
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,840
No,

1259
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,139
no,

1260
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:18,840
I just do it.

1261
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,639
I mean,

1262
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,039
yeah,

1263
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:31,840
I went on back to the future big brother just recently in order to share this rough track message and it wasn't to to,

1264
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,039
you know,

1265
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:34,739
see if I could get a TV gig or it wasn't to,

1266
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:35,239
um,

1267
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:38,239
sell teeth whitening ointments on Instagram.

1268
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:46,440
It was again to be able to come into contact with you and to be able to tell the rough track story because it's one worth sharing.

1269
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:54,139
But the one thing that I know is at the heart of every human is this concept that it takes a village to raise our kids.

1270
00:36:54,139 --> 00:36:56,139
It doesn't take a chieftain.

1271
00:36:56,139 --> 00:37:04,239
It takes a village and and if I tell people what the village is doing with animals and with skills and with compassion,

1272
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:04,940
well,

1273
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:10,840
then they're going to get involved and and that's what I'm hoping out of all the things that I do when I'm sharing this.

1274
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,940
This message is that people will get involved and we need a lot of stuff at rough track.

1275
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,239
I mean,

1276
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,340
we need more leaders.

1277
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:25,039
We want tradies out there that want to actually give back the opportunities that they've been given in a selfless lot way.

1278
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:26,039
But um,

1279
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:27,139
but also in a way that,

1280
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:27,440
you know,

1281
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:34,340
we actually do offer real jobs that that they can actually get involved in teaching our young people.

1282
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:34,539
By,

1283
00:37:34,539 --> 00:37:36,039
by leading from the front,

1284
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:41,440
leading with compassion and and setting the example that they want these young people to follow.

1285
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:41,739
Davo,

1286
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:43,639
the great pleasure of talking to Dr.

1287
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:45,139
Anna Rubenstein,

1288
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:53,940
who's been a world leader in bringing back rites of passage for teenagers and in his words are really lost over 2,000 years.

1289
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,340
Tribes were sophisticated about how we ushered our teenagers,

1290
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:57,440
you know,

1291
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,739
in particular back then boys to men was a really big and we've lost that that way.

1292
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:02,639
And there's so much,

1293
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:02,840
you know,

1294
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,639
since he's doing that,

1295
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,440
bringing dads together,

1296
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,139
getting them to talk about the care of their kids and getting them around the campfire.

1297
00:38:09,139 --> 00:38:11,440
And you're doing it at the end of,

1298
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:11,639
you know,

1299
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:13,739
the point of saving lives,

1300
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:14,440
but it's great.

1301
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,139
And even as a parent of four,

1302
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:18,139
you hopefully created a loving environment,

1303
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:21,639
but you learn so much just in the language that you're sharing today.

1304
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:23,639
It's such a great story for all of us,

1305
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,239
wherever we sit in that space,

1306
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:25,840
you know,

1307
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,940
looking after our teenagers is maybe the most,

1308
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,739
you know,

1309
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:31,239
important thing that we can all do.

1310
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,639
We see leaders are really curious,

1311
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:32,840
Davo,

1312
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,039
about everything.

1313
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,039
And through curiosity,

1314
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:36,940
that's how they constantly evolve and learn.

1315
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,539
Does that word resonate with you being curious?

1316
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:41,840
Yeah.

1317
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,739
Yeah,

1318
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:45,440
and and I try and make that contagious.

1319
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,340
And so yesterday I,

1320
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,539
I was sharing a YouTube video because kids are on their phones all the time.

1321
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,940
I think kids are constantly on the phone.

1322
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,840
So I'm like,

1323
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:54,940
hey,

1324
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:59,840
did you guys do you guys see this video about how to smelt iron?

1325
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,340
And you know,

1326
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,840
we're all in there watching this video on how to smelt or how to smelt.

1327
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,239
Iron and then that gives us a conversation to talk about,

1328
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:07,639
you know,

1329
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:08,739
all the different ages,

1330
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:13,639
the metal ages from the bronze age and the copper age before that and the stone age.

1331
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:20,039
And it gives you so many opportunities to create conversations around how incredible humans are.

1332
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:24,639
But but also the idea that that wasn't that long ago.

1333
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:27,440
And I mean in some parts where I come from and big and bold country,

1334
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,639
only a hundred and fifty years ago,

1335
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:33,639
we're a stone age people and and it gives you so many opportunities for,

1336
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:38,440
for conversation that you can allow the kids to take it where they want to go.

1337
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,539
Are we going to be talking about jobs in as a Boilermaker?

1338
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:48,440
Or are we going to be talking about the clash of cultures that happened in many parts of Australia over the last two hundred and thirty years?

1339
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:48,739
You know,

1340
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:53,239
so it I like the kids to lead the conversations,

1341
00:39:53,239 --> 00:40:03,440
but I love to have that curiosity that you can inject into the conversation to allow us to go in a direction whereby.

1342
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,239
We're not going to end up going.

1343
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,039
This sucks.

1344
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:09,340
That's so I want some cones,

1345
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:09,840
you know,

1346
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:17,739
like and that's often the conversation that started before we inject some in curiosity into the conversation.

1347
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:18,739
The next dimension.

1348
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:23,039
I want to talk to you as communicating with clarity and there may be no more difficult environment any,

1349
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:27,840
you know of house full of teenagers and you sometimes get six words a week.

1350
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:33,039
If you're if you're having a good week and and you're learning to sort of back off and create the space and hopefully,

1351
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,440
that that they do come back.

1352
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,340
I mean for you to be able to communicate with clarity.

1353
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:37,539
I mean,

1354
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:39,739
what what's the skill set that you bring down?

1355
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:42,239
And you're brilliant at it in terms of telling the Rough Tracks story.

1356
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,139
But have you thought about that a lot in your in your world?

1357
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:48,739
It is critical for me to give confidence.

1358
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:58,139
I was an anxiety-ridden teenager and like so much so that I missed most of my senior year and and you know,

1359
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:02,940
I had to go away to boarding school as most Bush kids have to and I missed,

1360
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:08,639
most of my senior year simply because I was so anxious that if I was running late for a class,

1361
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:11,039
because most of the doors were at the front of the classroom,

1362
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,239
I couldn't go in the classroom because I was afraid that all them other lads are going to be looking at me.

1363
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,139
I was petrified.

1364
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:18,639
So I'd go and hide in the in the bathroom.

1365
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:27,440
That's how afraid of being in front of humans let alone speaking in front of humans was but I had that crazy opportunity to go modeling,

1366
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,539
which was all just by chance and coincidence.

1367
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:32,840
And I learned the confidence.

1368
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:46,239
Confidence of being in front of people just by being a walking coat hanger and and it really came from there that I was pushed out into the world because all I ever wanted to do was live on my farm and be away from from humans.

1369
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:50,239
I know what it's like to be so riddled with anxiety that you can't even be seen by humans.

1370
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:53,840
So I get where so many of the kids that come here are.

1371
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:58,739
So to get a kid that has got his hoodie over and he's got his sashy bag there.

1372
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:00,340
And the only thing,

1373
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,539
the only movement you see is when they're rolling the dart,

1374
00:42:02,539 --> 00:42:05,739
to stick in their hoodie little mouth here.

1375
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:13,539
The only movement is that that when you see them in a few weeks later performing in front of thousands of people,

1376
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:23,239
like I had 16 of these kids performing at Sydney Olympic Park two weekends ago in front of tens of thousands of people with their dog,

1377
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:31,940
you know, giving them the confidence to be able to be in front of humans and then allow them the confidence to communicate.

1378
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,340
Sometimes it's just a few words.

1379
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,139
It could be a yes,

1380
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:34,539
or it could be,

1381
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:34,739
you know,

1382
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:35,739
it could be just their names,

1383
00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:40,340
but being able to get that microphone in front of them and and for them to go,

1384
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:40,639
wow,

1385
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:46,440
I have power to be able to communicate whatever message and that's what we do every single day here.

1386
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:53,239
There's six different opportunities for them to speak in front of a group here every single day because once you have confidence,

1387
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:55,539
then you have career opportunities,

1388
00:42:55,539 --> 00:43:00,940
but also you have the ability to open up what's happening inside and get it to the outside world.

1389
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,739
Yeah, beautiful.

1390
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:02,840
Beautifully said.

1391
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,940
What an incredible,

1392
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,039
you know,

1393
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:08,940
I suppose part of the program that is challenging,

1394
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,039
but you've got an amazing way of bringing that to life.

1395
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:13,840
We see leaders value collaboration now,

1396
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,940
Dave, more than ever before.

1397
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,340
How important has collaboration been for you?

1398
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,539
You can't raise a kid without a village.

1399
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:22,840
So we have our tracker network,

1400
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:27,039
which is there's nine of our organizations throughout New South Wales and Queensland.

1401
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:31,639
So we're constantly collaborating with each other about what it is that we can do in each of our communities.

1402
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:33,440
We catch up every two months.

1403
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:41,940
We all visit each of us in our silos to make sure we break down that silo within their own community because this job can be all-consuming.

1404
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,039
But you know, this organization,

1405
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:49,239
Rough Track, only started with heaps of community groundswell.

1406
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:52,139
So with our police and of course the kids that come to us,

1407
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:55,340
they're enemy number one on all fronts.

1408
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,639
But today when I took the bus,

1409
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:01,440
a busload of kids out to do some flood recovery work,

1410
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,239
stopped on the side of the road in our bus,

1411
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:07,039
and then right next to us was a PCYC full of cops.

1412
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,840
Kids are all having a yarn to them.

1413
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,139
And that's when you know you're breaking down barriers.

1414
00:44:11,139 --> 00:44:14,539
So when you collaborate with the enemy,

1415
00:44:14,539 --> 00:44:16,639
you find out that they're not actually the enemy.

1416
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:19,739
And that's when breaking down barriers,

1417
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:21,840
whichever direction you can go,

1418
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,139
be it the general public,

1419
00:44:23,139 --> 00:44:28,039
again, a lot of our kids hate the general public because they think the general public hates them,

1420
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:31,340
and giving them the opportunity to,

1421
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,639
have a pathway of communication to be able to get a hand and give a hand.

1422
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:41,139
It's just everything that we do is collaboration.

1423
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:45,239
And you know, oftentimes just getting our kids to work together on a project,

1424
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:47,340
to lift something that's heavy together.

1425
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,739
You got to communicate, you got to work together to be able to get that,

1426
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:53,440
because I guarantee you every kid that comes to you,

1427
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,039
the first thing that he's going to do if I ask him to help out is drop it and go,

1428
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:00,340
fuck this, fucking this is shit.

1429
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,340
But give him a couple of weeks,

1430
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,340
or give her a couple of weeks.

1431
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,539
And they're like, okay, ready?

1432
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:07,239
One, two, three, and away they go.

1433
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:09,940
And then they're communicating with each other about how it is.

1434
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,639
They're going to get that heavy object to where they want to go.

1435
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:15,039
And then afterwards, the smile on their face,

1436
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:19,340
when they get something as a team where they want it to go,

1437
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:23,840
which is exactly what I saw only about an hour ago when the last three kids left here,

1438
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,840
they had, they built a huge big fire pit,

1439
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,539
a big massive metal fire pit with rough track on the side.

1440
00:45:29,539 --> 00:45:31,039
And they had to get it in one of the kids,

1441
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:33,340
boots of his mum's car.

1442
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,639
And the fact that they all got it in there,

1443
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:37,940
and then I just saw them all turn around and smile and high five each other.

1444
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,639
It's just like, that's gold.

1445
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:41,340
That's collaboration.

1446
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:44,840
You can feel the joy in that brilliant story.

1447
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:50,139
It's just sensational to hear it all come together in such a way,

1448
00:45:50,139 --> 00:45:53,239
saving lives and teaching kids along the way.

1449
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:54,440
It's incredible.

1450
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,539
Asking these two final questions, Dave,

1451
00:45:56,539 --> 00:45:59,039
to all the leaders I've had the privilege of sitting down with.

1452
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:00,840
And I'll start with this for you.

1453
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,639
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1454
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:08,639
It's pretty easy, but a bizarre one, I suppose.

1455
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,539
Queen Elizabeth, Queen Elizabeth II.

1456
00:46:10,539 --> 00:46:13,539
She epitomises leadership to me.

1457
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:22,139
So she quietly and confidently has been monarch to so many people for 70 years.

1458
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:28,639
And she does it with incredible dignity and dedication.

1459
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:30,739
And here she is still,

1460
00:46:30,739 --> 00:46:33,940
in the absolute twilight of her life,

1461
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,539
giving everything that she's got.

1462
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:41,539
And, you know, what she went through in the 1990s with her own family breakdowns,

1463
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:47,239
with, you know, her ancestral home burning down and feeling like,

1464
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:51,639
you know, the entire universe was probably against her reign.

1465
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:56,539
But she just soldiered on every single day with dedication and commitment.

1466
00:46:56,539 --> 00:47:00,539
And that gets me through everything that goes wrong in my life.

1467
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:05,639
And, you know, it doesn't matter if she has all the wealth in the world.

1468
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:08,239
The fact is, the responsibility ends with her.

1469
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:14,639
And she wears that responsibility like no other human I've ever come across.

1470
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:16,440
It's an extraordinary answer, Dale.

1471
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:20,039
If you had to give me a thousand guesses, I wouldn't have got anywhere near Queen.

1472
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:24,139
And it's great to hear, to say that, because it's underappreciated.

1473
00:47:24,139 --> 00:47:27,739
I think the royals, you know, cop a whack for people

1474
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:29,940
because this sense of entitlement and privilege.

1475
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,739
But when you break it down like that, you think of her, you know,

1476
00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:36,639
she was 20 or younger, I think, when she came into that role.

1477
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:38,539
And, you know, across from Churchill.

1478
00:47:38,539 --> 00:47:40,940
And you think of the leaders that have sat down at that table

1479
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:46,239
and the grace that she's had and the composure to be able to continue it.

1480
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:47,840
I mean, I have never thought of her in that light.

1481
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:52,139
What an incredible sense, you know, from a sheep farmer

1482
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:56,639
and a station to take that sense of values from Queen Elizabeth.

1483
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:57,840
I'm sure she'd love to...

1484
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,639
What a boss, though.

1485
00:47:58,639 --> 00:47:59,539
Like, what a boss.

1486
00:47:59,539 --> 00:47:59,639
I know.

1487
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:06,639
When she was in her 20s, she had to be the boss of Winston Churchill.

1488
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:11,840
I mean, in a period of time where women couldn't even, you know,

1489
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,840
buy a home without the permission of a man.

1490
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:18,039
And she did it in her 20s to what was clearly one

1491
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:21,639
of the most powerful humans that have ever existed.

1492
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:24,340
So, yeah, just from the outset, that woman just,

1493
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:29,539
she just impresses me beyond anything when it comes to real leadership.

1494
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:35,039
And it comes from an inner strength, not a physical strength of any measure.

1495
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:37,039
Fascinated by that answer.

1496
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:37,940
I love it.

1497
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:40,639
In the spirit of collaboration, we're obsessed with collaboration.

1498
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:43,940
If you could collaborate with anyone on the world on anything,

1499
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,840
and you've clearly got so many passions in the work you do,

1500
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:55,239
is there someone that you would love to collaborate with on any part of your life?

1501
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:58,539
Your dear listener, the person listening to this right now.

1502
00:48:58,539 --> 00:48:59,739
Yeah, that's who I want to collaborate with.

1503
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:07,739
Because we've all got a role, and you can be part of a greater future.

1504
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:13,739
And we often feel so insignificant, whether it's at the ballot box

1505
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:20,739
or whether it's watching television news or just being in society

1506
00:49:20,739 --> 00:49:22,739
and seeing things that we don't like.

1507
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:24,739
We feel so insignificant and powerless.

1508
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:28,739
And yet, your listener, you have power.

1509
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:29,739
Yeah.

1510
00:49:29,739 --> 00:49:34,739
You can change lives by getting involved in what we do here at Rough Track

1511
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:40,739
or saying something kind to a young person that may not have heard it that day

1512
00:49:40,739 --> 00:49:43,739
because they've got this look about them that says,

1513
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:44,739
fuck off world.

1514
00:49:44,739 --> 00:49:46,739
And so that's how the world treats them.

1515
00:49:46,739 --> 00:49:49,739
But you could break through that by saying something kind.

1516
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:51,739
And they may tell you to fuck off, but you know what?

1517
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:56,739
That kind word may change the outcome of that young person's life.

1518
00:49:56,739 --> 00:49:58,739
What a brilliant message to end on.

1519
00:49:58,739 --> 00:50:03,739
And I love, as you say, the ability to impact someone with a random act of kindness

1520
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:07,739
or someone in your sphere just with having that empathy is profound.

1521
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:11,739
I think another great way, I mean, to create a permanent home for Rough Track

1522
00:50:11,739 --> 00:50:15,739
in your part of the world feels like something that just has to happen.

1523
00:50:15,739 --> 00:50:17,739
And so how do we do that?

1524
00:50:17,739 --> 00:50:19,739
How do we get involved, get behind Rough Track?

1525
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:23,739
What's the best way for us to donate and support the work you're doing?

1526
00:50:23,739 --> 00:50:27,739
Yeah, well, we're a fully-fledged charity, so tax-deductible.

1527
00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:31,739
Donations via our website, roughtrack.com.

1528
00:50:31,739 --> 00:50:32,739
We build stuff.

1529
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:33,739
We make stuff.

1530
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:38,739
We're out in the community and, you know, buy stuff off our website

1531
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:39,739
that the kids have made.

1532
00:50:39,739 --> 00:50:43,739
I mean, there's fully-functional fire pits at the moment.

1533
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:46,739
We do metal cutouts.

1534
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:48,739
We do artworks.

1535
00:50:48,739 --> 00:50:52,739
We've now got a coffee cart, and we do productions.

1536
00:50:52,739 --> 00:50:55,739
So we're coming down to the Melbourne Royal Show.

1537
00:50:55,739 --> 00:50:56,739
We're going to the Melbourne Dog Lovers Show

1538
00:50:56,739 --> 00:50:57,739
at Geoff's Shed.

1539
00:50:57,739 --> 00:50:59,739
We're out and about and we're everywhere.

1540
00:50:59,739 --> 00:51:04,739
So if it's simply just saying a kind word on our Facebook page or our Insta,

1541
00:51:04,739 --> 00:51:07,739
because the kids all read it and they see it, and these are the kids

1542
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:09,739
that think the world hates them.

1543
00:51:09,739 --> 00:51:12,739
And to see comments from people who say, no, we don't hate you,

1544
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:16,739
we think what you're doing is amazing, or actually investing in our future

1545
00:51:16,739 --> 00:51:20,739
so that we can actually give these kids that security of tenure

1546
00:51:20,739 --> 00:51:22,739
because we're being built out here in the Hawkesbury,

1547
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:25,739
and there is a ticking time bomb on our future.

1548
00:51:25,739 --> 00:51:28,739
So we're going to be working on the services that we can provide

1549
00:51:28,739 --> 00:51:30,739
on this lease-held farm.

1550
00:51:30,739 --> 00:51:34,739
So if we can get a forever farm, and if that's your business,

1551
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:39,739
giving a sizeable, taxable donation, tax-deductible donation to us,

1552
00:51:39,739 --> 00:51:41,739
or if it's an individual saying, you know what,

1553
00:51:41,739 --> 00:51:45,739
I'm not going to have a coffee today, I'm going to give $5 to Rough Track,

1554
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:50,739
well, it all makes a difference because it takes a village.

1555
00:51:50,739 --> 00:51:53,739
And you, dear listener, are part of our village.

1556
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:54,739
Beautifully said, Dave.

1557
00:51:54,739 --> 00:51:57,739
It's an incredible story, an incredible life that you've lived

1558
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,739
of courage and leadership and the ultimate contribution,

1559
00:52:00,739 --> 00:52:04,739
tackling one of the most sophisticatedly challenging things

1560
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:06,739
that our country and society faces.

1561
00:52:06,739 --> 00:52:08,739
You're doing it in such an amazing way.

1562
00:52:08,739 --> 00:52:09,739
It's a heartwarming story.

1563
00:52:09,739 --> 00:52:11,739
Great honour to spend some time with you.

1564
00:52:11,739 --> 00:52:13,739
Thanks for sharing the story, Dave.

1565
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:14,739
And look up Rough Track.

1566
00:52:14,739 --> 00:52:17,739
Get behind support, Dave, and the amazing work he does.

1567
00:52:17,739 --> 00:52:18,739
Thanks again.

1568
00:52:18,739 --> 00:52:19,739
Yeah, no worries.

1569
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:23,739
And look, to us, my job is to create space for someone else to fill it.

1570
00:52:23,739 --> 00:52:27,739
And the good thing is is that I've got young people at Rough Track

1571
00:52:27,739 --> 00:52:30,739
that are jumping up, stepping up, and they're doing me out of a job.

1572
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:33,739
And that's me as a leader is to be done out of a job.

1573
00:52:33,739 --> 00:52:35,739
That's what I want.

1574
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:36,739
I love it.

1575
00:52:36,739 --> 00:52:37,739
What an inspiration.

1576
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:38,739
Thanks again.

1577
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:39,739
Thanks, mate.

1578
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:44,440
