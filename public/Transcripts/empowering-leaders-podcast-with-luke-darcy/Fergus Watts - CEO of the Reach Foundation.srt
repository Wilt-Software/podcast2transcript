1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,109
a listener production. This is a conversation that I've been looking forward to for some time

2
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:14,310
on the Empowering Leaders podcast with the CEO of the Reach Foundation, Fergus Watts.

3
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:20,170
Reach is a foundation that helps support over 40,000 kids a year. Their aim is to create

4
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:25,530
generations of confident, self-aware, passionate young people who can shape the world into a better

5
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:31,890
place. Fergus is a former AFL footballer turned entrepreneur. There are many things to unpack

6
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,670
in this conversation. What struck me, though, was the incredible story he tells about his own

7
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:42,850
experience with Reach. As a young man, the late, great Jim Stines, who was the co-founder of Reach,

8
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:48,469
came to Fergus' school and led a program that had an enormous impact on him. I'll let Fergus tell

9
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:54,009
you that story in his own words, but definitely worth listening to. This crossover between social

10
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:58,969
venture, entrepreneurship, and business is something that I've been exploring with the

11
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:01,869
business I co-founded with my great friend, Matt Wadowitz, called Aleda.

12
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,730
It is a place where we are having leaders come together, collaborating and learning from one

13
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:12,629
another. We've had incredible people as part of the program. Ange Postacoglu from Celtic,

14
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,709
Arsenal's Mikel Arteta in recent times, the Milwaukee Bucks assistant coach, Mike Dunlap,

15
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:21,450
is brilliant. And if you're interested in this space, you don't need to be a global

16
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,209
leader of repute like the names I just mentioned. We are finding people are starting their own

17
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:31,530
business, finding out all about what we're doing at aledacollective.com.au or a social

18
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:31,870
entrepreneur.

19
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,489
If you're an entrepreneur like Fergus Watts, we'd encourage you to check out our signature

20
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:40,569
Aleda Connect program to understand how people like Fergus and others are collaborating and

21
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:53,620
leading in their world. Always great to catch up with you, mate.

22
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,659
It's good to be here.

23
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,400
Thanks for joining me. It might go back to a pretty brutal start to your working life,

24
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:05,480
mate, in the world of AFL and being a first round draft pick, public nature of being a

25
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,780
professional athlete. How hard was that for you at the time?

26
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,180
The failure of my footy career was...

27
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:20,319
It was interesting for me because I'd had so many injuries, so it just veered off track

28
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:27,639
real quick. I was first round pick to the Crows. That was all going great. Requested

29
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:33,159
a trade back to a Melbourne club. Ended up at St. Kilda. Broke my leg round two. And then

30
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:39,860
I had 12, 13 operations in the next two years. So by the end of that two year period where

31
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,000
I was on crutches for a lot of it and in rehab, I was like, I'm going to do this. I'm going

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,539
to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going

33
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:41,719
to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going

34
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:41,800
to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going

35
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,939
I was so over it that I just wanted to get out. But at the same time, it was this sort

36
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:54,900
of abrupt end to my lifelong dream and my entire identity and all that sort of stuff.

37
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:59,620
And I didn't know at the time, if you'd have asked me as a 19 year old, I said, oh, yeah,

38
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,300
fine, I'll get on with my life. But it took me years to truly sort of process it and go

39
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:11,300
through that whole sort of development phase of that sort of career ending and ending in

40
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:11,539
a quite awkward way.

41
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,599
a public way. Which is even more remarkable for me when I think at 22 years of age, you've got

42
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,719
the courage to start your own business. That's not long after, you know, as you said, going through

43
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:27,199
that challenging time. Where did that courage come from at that age? Well, I'd replace the word

44
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,939
courage with stupidity, because it's one of those things where you just, you don't know what you

45
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:38,240
don't know. So I had no idea like what to do. Like I didn't know what a job was, you know,

46
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,060
I didn't have an email address, nothing. And I sort of came out of footy and went and met with

47
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,960
as many different people with jobs as I could just to figure out what job was and end up-

48
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,039
Hadn't studied at all?

49
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:54,939
Nothing, no. Never went to university. You know, wasn't really a great student at school. Like

50
00:03:54,939 --> 00:04:00,479
just didn't really know what was out there, you know? Like I didn't know what a lawyer was or

51
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,280
what an account, like I couldn't get it together. So I ended up meeting with a guy around an

52
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,139
advertising agency and he was a saint.

53
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,439
Which I think helped. And he gave me a job and I liked it because, you know, they were wearing

54
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,459
t-shirts and there was music playing in the office, not suits and it being dry. And that's

55
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,180
sort of how it started. And then it was the evolution of getting out of there and doing it

56
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,459
for myself. So Bastien becomes this incredible success story. And as you said, from there,

57
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:34,339
you know, without any real understanding to create what you have as Australia's largest

58
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:38,220
independent agency. And I love one of the quotes I read in preparation of this,

59
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,800
it's impossible to grow if you're trying to control every aspect of your business. It seems

60
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,180
like you've been brilliant at empowering other people. The title of this is empowering leadership.

61
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,759
I mean, it sounds like you got that pretty early. Can you explain why that was so important?

62
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:57,560
Well, that has been the entire focus of the whole time. And that was because when I started at 23,

63
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,860
like I didn't know how to do anything. So the only choice I had was to empower other people

64
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,839
to do it because that was the only way I was going to do it, you know? So, you know, our whole

65
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:14,579
rhetoric that I had was, I will go find someone who knew how to do something, digital marketing,

66
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:19,720
PR, whatever that might be. And then I can go and do the grunt work, pound on the pavement,

67
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:25,680
get some leads in. And, you know, my kind of thing was I could sit down with a business owner or a

68
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,879
person who controlled a budget and talk to them about what their real issues were,

69
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,819
their business issues. And not really trying to sell them something, just sort of getting to the

70
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:38,199
bottom of what was really at stake for them. And then I would say, well, if I could, you know,

71
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:43,399
solve that problem for you, would that be of value? And they would say yes. And I'd go away

72
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:47,579
and I'd go to my guys, like, how the hell do we do this? And then if I didn't have people that could

73
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:52,620
do it, I'd go and find other people who had that skillset. And that's inevitably how it went. And

74
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,879
so the lack of experience, I think, was the greatest asset that we ever had building this thing.

75
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,259
There's some skill in doing that though, Fergus, as well. It's one thing to say,

76
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,439
hey, you're going to get all these great people, but great people come at a cost. And then,

77
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:07,779
you know, trying to build a business model, a lot of people listening to that and saying,

78
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,139
geez, I'd love to be able to expand. I'm open to doing that. I want to collaborate. I want to

79
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:17,220
bring people in. But can I get into the micro a little bit? Did you offer equity in Bastion?

80
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,139
Yeah. So we would create partnership models. So the partnership model was

81
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:26,639
like individual entities wrapped around individual service offerings. So the whole

82
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,819
thing around Bastion is we talk about thinking wide. So thinking wide in terms of the breadth

83
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:37,160
of expertise, but also then depth of expertise. So you can't have

84
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,180
one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person,

85
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,920
person that sort of dabbles in PR and say you've got a PR offering. You know, you need real depth

86
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:51,199
of expertise. So we just, and continue to today, create verticals of specific expertise that we

87
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,459
can then add on to provide an integrated solution to clients. And we do that through a range of

88
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,300
different equity models and incentive projects. A bit different now, but at the start, it was

89
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,279
always about an equity position. So someone would come along with a PR expertise,

90
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:07,800
they would get a state in that particular business. That's a separate business as part

91
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,259
of Bastion. And every time you added on another offering, you'd take on a partner effectively or

92
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,939
give someone equity. Exactly right. And they would come over. So there's lower wage costs,

93
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:23,279
there's lower overhead costs. The risks are shared. You know, we'd put them up in our office and,

94
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:26,980
you know, a lot of those sorts of things, a lot of the backend finance and those sorts of things

95
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,980
that we'd developed over time, we'd do it. Initially it was, you know, I remember saying

96
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,339
to the first guy, I said, do you just do all the things you like doing and all the stuff you don't

97
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:38,139
like doing, I'll do, you know? And that was kind of it.

98
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:44,220
And now, you know, and then we moved out of that startup model where we were starting businesses

99
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,399
and we went to an acquisition model and we were acquiring services. So we needed a research

100
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:53,920
business. So we went and acquired a research business. We needed an experiential and events

101
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:01,519
arm. We'd go and make that acquisition. And again, pretty much always they're an 80% type

102
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:06,560
acquisition and the founder keeps them skin in the game. They stay motivated, they stay engaged,

103
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,720
and they build.

104
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,199
Sort of that depth of expertise in that area.

105
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,860
Yeah, clearly that's worked. As we said, you've got offices around the world and you're, you know,

106
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,740
real focused on the US and trying to, you know, replicate your success here in Australia. And I

107
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:24,120
reading some of your work before we sat down today, you hear your language a lot around focusing on

108
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,459
the people and not the business. Again, can you explain a bit more detail why that's worked for

109
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:29,879
you so well?

110
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,639
Well, it's a lot of what I took out of the footy days, you know, like I'm wired

111
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,620
from a high performance perspective. And,

112
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:44,399
you know, I've always been team first. So there's, there's two things in it for me. One is it's got to be team

113
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,019
first, not individual first, right? And in business, a lot of the time, I just don't think that happens

114
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:53,659
because people's livelihoods are on the line, you know? So we're going to do the strategy of this

115
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:57,779
business or we're going to do this, but geez, I've got to make sure that I'm still relevant in this

116
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:02,320
company, you know, because otherwise there's, there's implications and consequences for me. And

117
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,100
that, that, that from my perspective, it never existed. I was always trying to make myself

118
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,159
successful. And I think that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's,

119
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:14,120
always and trying to build these teams that could run the operations of the business

120
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,700
wholeheartedly. And I was very comfortable and still am to just say, well, if you get it wrong,

121
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:24,940
if you make mistakes, that's okay. It's, I'm not going to then come and jump back in and kind of

122
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,659
do it all. And again, that was built out of, because I couldn't do that in the early days,

123
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,940
you know? And so I had to develop those, those activities. The other area is culture. And we

124
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,299
ran an exercise really early. Um,

125
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:44,220
uh, when we moved into the Cremorne office and we had 20 or 30 staff and, you know, in that office

126
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,360
now we've got 110 staff or something, right? So we took this big risk on this office and we had 20

127
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,860
odd people in there. And we did this exercise, we sent everyone out to train stations all around

128
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,500
Melbourne at 7.30 in the morning. And we said, go out in groups of five, go to a train station,

129
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,720
get the train that comes into Richmond, peak hour, everyone coming into work,

130
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,220
get on a carriage by yourself and just observe. And they came into the office. I said, well,

131
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:14,860
did you see? And they said, Oh my God, like gray faces, people look half depressed, you know,

132
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:20,700
like they're going to a place where they're spending all of their time looking like it's

133
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:26,039
the worst thing in the world they could be doing, you know? And I said, well, let's never be that.

134
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:31,500
Let's always be a place that when you come here, it's fun to be here. It's engaging to be here

135
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,840
because not just cause it's warm and fluffy and we all have beers on Friday night, but because

136
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,200
we're achieving something, we're creating something. And I said, well, let's never be that.

137
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,820
We're creating something and we're really executing a high performance culture. And that

138
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,940
was sort of the depth of it that, that those two things sort of created, created what it is today.

139
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,399
Yeah. Great, a great success story. Nothing sadder in my mind, you know, first when you see people,

140
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,100
Jan, a lot of people get stuck in a role or they think they're stuck in a role for their entire

141
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,679
life because they're too risk averse to change or, you know, you start a family and you go,

142
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:07,059
how can I possibly give up that particular income? But they're genuinely miserable every day at work.

143
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:07,200
Yeah.

144
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,740
And I think, you know, I've got no evidence, but I feel like there's a huge amount of people that

145
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,720
that applies to. And, and so when you start something from scratch, you know, you get the

146
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,779
ability, don't you, to try and keep that fun and keep that energy going. And, and, and as you've

147
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:23,159
expanded, do you feel like you've been able to still capture that?

148
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:30,320
Uh, certainly it's very different. We've got 300, 350 staff across three countries, right? So it's

149
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,240
a very different proposition now, um, in terms of what's important, how you engage people,

150
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,620
how you can empower people. It's a totally different model, you know, and hence why two

151
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,460
years ago I stepped out of being the CEO, because I'm also a believer that there's certain leaders

152
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,480
for certain times and there's a certain skillset that needs to happen. And, you know, when I talked

153
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,320
about making myself redundant every six months, I got to a point where I was like, I'm actually not

154
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,600
the right guy anymore. I've achieved it. Yeah. And, uh, I'm not the right guy to run this business.

155
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,059
It requires a different type of CEO. And I've been lucky enough to be part of my brother,

156
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,220
who is like the direct opposite of me.

157
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,139
Who's much more the sort of corporate CEO and runs it better. So, um, you know, the,

158
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:20,240
the ability to inspire people and create an opportunity for them to, um, develop not only

159
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,700
new skills in their execution and their work, but develop their emotional intelligence,

160
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:30,419
develop their understanding of the world, develop their understanding of how that industry goes

161
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:34,919
together. That creates greater value for them outside. And if they're good enough, they can

162
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,220
take advantage of those opportunities.

163
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,480
And that's a big focus for us.

164
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,500
And that still takes great self-awareness to understand and, you know, and, and understanding

165
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,460
ego to say, you know what, I'm, I'm, there's someone better at this than me. Not many people

166
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,600
can do that. And when it's your brother as well, it's a, it's obviously that comes with some

167
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,720
challenge. Some people, I mean, that was that something always in you, you felt like you had

168
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,159
the self-awareness to, to work out when the time was right.

169
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:04,440
Yeah, I think so. It's, um, it's always been, I knew the day was coming always, assuming we got

170
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,220
to a big enough proposition because, you know, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was,

171
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,960
um, you know, the way we always describe, my brother described was like, I was the first guy

172
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,419
through the wall on the next acquisition or the, you know, I'd go to Sydney and I'd get Sydney

173
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:19,600
going, you know, I'd go to LA, get LA going, go to London, like that sort of stuff. But then

174
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,399
someone had to come behind and actually run the thing after that, you know? And, and, and so that

175
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,519
was, that was the element of it. But I always knew the day was going to come if it was successful,

176
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,399
that that skillset would not be of as big a value as it is at the start.

177
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:46,720
Um, and what I didn't realize is once I got out, it was the biggest, um, hit to my ego. It was the

178
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,840
biggest confidence thing, confidence hit. An exceptionally difficult thing to do is get out

179
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,019
and get out of the way. Well, that's a great, it's a great

180
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:00,799
conversation for, you know, for all of us, whatever stage of your life, isn't it? You know,

181
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,600
whether you're exit footy after six games or after however long you and I, you know,

182
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,279
played in the same industry, even when you finish and you think it's on your terms, it's still a big,

183
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:17,019
big adjustment to not identify what that was or, you know, work in the media for a long period of

184
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:20,960
time. It's an incredibly insecure industry. No matter how high up the tree you are, there's

185
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,580
always someone else coming in who's, who's better. And you, and you get to the age where you go,

186
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,840
it should be on top of that, but it's just a natural part of human evolution, isn't it?

187
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,759
But it's also what you attach your identity to, you know? And this is a lot of the stuff that I

188
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:35,580
learned from Jim Steinbeck. Um, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

189
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,799
22 years ago when I walked in as a 15 year old, um, as a facilitator there, the same work we do

190
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:48,039
today, it's, it's the ability to understand yourself, the ability to understand who you

191
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:55,700
are as a person, what's important to you, what's your value set, not what's your job and where's

192
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,379
your identity attached to. And as a footballer, really hard thing to do because it's very public.

193
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:04,980
So, you know, you're Luke Darcy, the footballer, I was Fergus, what's a footballer. And that's

194
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,580
your identity.

195
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:12,919
I was also Fergus, what's a CEO, Bastion. And, you know, six months later or a year later, um,

196
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,480
a Bastion or after footy, when all of a sudden they go, who, who are you? Well, you know, like

197
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,460
I'm, I'm Fergus Watts. I go, well, what do you do? I go, well, you know, and the, um, and same

198
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:28,899
with Bastion, like, you know, you walk in there, it really didn't take long where there'd be new

199
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:33,419
staff floating through the joint and you'd walk in there and I'd enjoy, I'd go, hi, how you doing?

200
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:35,480
I'm Ferg, good to meet you. And they'd go, what do you do here?

201
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:44,279
And I'd go, oh, like what? Like mate, the hit to the ego on that is enormous. Um, and so I had to move away from the identity issue.

202
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:50,100
I got to tell a quick story. It was my favorite story finishing up in, in, uh, in footy. I had, um,

203
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,399
this beautiful young guy at the Bulldogs. I was injured. I did my knee twice until the last three

204
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,480
years. And I got to know a lad called Liam, uh, Down syndrome when his dad would bring him to,

205
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,340
uh, Bulldog events. And he, he was, I used to describe his, his two things he liked,

206
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,580
bizarrely he loved John Farnham and he loved me. Going, geez, that's a tough, tough bracket,

207
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,879
mate. I'm not sure I can live up to this. And he'd come to, he'd give me a huge hug and he'd yell out my name.

208
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,639
And, you know, even when you're injured, you couldn't help but feel good. And I decided to

209
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,460
retire, you know, you would have the same feeling. You're over it, your body's letting you down.

210
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,419
And I, and it was pretty quick decision to have this, I think, shit, I forgot to ring him. This

211
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:32,139
one person I've spoken to 12 times a day, literally, that's how often he'd ring me.

212
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,320
His dad encouraged me not to give him my number, but he'd ring and I'd answer it. We'd have 30

213
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,860
seconds on the phone and, and hang up. And I thought, oh shit, I've got to go and ring this

214
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,259
kid. And I, so I ring him, I go, mate, I'm so sorry. You're not going to understand how,

215
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:48,200
you know, bad I feel about this. And, and, you know, I know you've been my greatest

216
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,059
supporter all my life. So sorry, mate, I didn't hear you first. It took him five seconds. It was

217
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:57,759
just five second pause. And he said, that's okay. Can you give me Jason Ackermanis' number?

218
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:07,000
He'd moved on in the nanosecond that, uh, and I just laughed. I just thought, mate, that's it.

219
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:13,660
The second you're out. Well, it's, it's a, it's a, I think it's a fascinating subject because

220
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:18,900
people that, especially people that hold significant jobs, like we see it a lot and

221
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,359
we've seen it a lot in the marketing space. Cause if you're the marketing manager or the,

222
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,660
or the CMO of a business, you hold a budget, which means you hold a budget and people are

223
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,480
always coming at you. They're inviting you to staff, they, cause they want you to spend,

224
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,539
right? So if you're holding a $30 million budget, you're a really important person,

225
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:37,579
you know, and you're a very interesting person and you, you know, all that sort of stuff.

226
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:43,119
And if you don't hold that budget anymore, if you don't have that job,

227
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:48,440
well, and the phone stops ringing, are you still comfortable with yourself?

228
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,420
You know? And, and it was, it was the same, very much the same for me. It's like,

229
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,940
if I'm not walking in that building every day, high-fiving everyone and, you know, like I'm the

230
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:05,839
man, am I, am I okay? You know, am I okay with who I am? Cause, and, and that, that really took

231
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:11,640
a good couple of years to really work through and it needed a pretty immense amount of sort of

232
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,099
self-awareness on a day to day basis. And I think that's, I think that's, I think that's, I think that's

233
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:19,460
a daily basis on how you react to every situation because you could emotionally flip out and all

234
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,940
sorts of stuff, but you know, I probably almost did. Well, it's great to, you know, hear you talk

235
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,039
so openly about, I want to get to the reach part and you mentioned values before. And again, I was,

236
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:34,619
you know, uh, sat down with, um, Sal Gordon, who's the principal of the green school in Bali and

237
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:40,440
they're, you know, teaching values-based education, learning at school. You know, we, we don't get

238
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,700
that in many other settings. It's like, you can actually learn values. We don't often have that

239
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,839
in a Western setting where it's like, what, what are the things that, um, are unique to you that

240
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:55,339
you want to try and encourage those behaviors and learn about empathy and learn about, um,

241
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,359
collaborating with other people. And so I know, um, at reach, you guys pick up the slack on that

242
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:05,000
really, really well. But when you get to those moments in your life, if you haven't got that

243
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,720
sense of who you are and your values, you, you can get off the rails pretty quick, can't you?

244
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:10,420
Completely. And that, that is what reached me.

245
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:15,759
It's all about, 22 years ago, I walked into Leander by the Yarra for Heroes Day and we still

246
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,359
do Heroes Days at Reach, 500 people in a room. It's like a big, amazing day. We did them last

247
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:25,079
week. They're extraordinary. Um, they're like a music festival almost, right? Runs all day.

248
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:32,000
And they're all year nines, well, year nines and tens. And, um, so I went to this thing,

249
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:37,940
got invited by my school and, uh, and Jim Steins was facilitating and he picked me out of the

250
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,619
crowd and he said, stand up on your chair.

251
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,279
And he said, you know, you're dicking around and joking and laughing. And he said, who are you?

252
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,619
And I said, I don't know, I'm Fergus, you know, he goes, no, no, no. He said, I'm going to ask

253
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:55,000
your name. I said, who are you? And I sort of just fluffed the answer. Oh, you know, I got a

254
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,420
Wesley or this or that. And he's like, no, no, no. I don't want the particulars around who you are.

255
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,680
Who are you? And I, you know, I inevitably couldn't answer it. And later in the day,

256
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:09,279
I've found myself in the microphone of my hand again, talking about something much more emotive,

257
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,220
much more vulnerable.

258
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,680
Um, and he said to me, that's who you are. He says, not just you being emotive and vulnerable.

259
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,940
He says, but it's also, you know, the hyper-masculine 15 year old at the start,

260
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:26,420
joking around, laughing with his mates. It's all of you. So unless you understand all of you,

261
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:32,940
how can you truly be comfortable in yourself, um, and be able to dial it up and dial it down

262
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:39,140
where you need. And, you know, and, and that changed my life that day. Um, and, you know,

263
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,279
reach, we talk about,

264
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:45,940
the main things we looked is developing sense of self, right? And we talk about creating a two

265
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,880
degree shift, um, in a young person. So when they walk out of a workshop, like I did, I wasn't a

266
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,380
drastically different kid the next day. You're not the typical reach kid either. Private school

267
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,819
educated, great family. Well, we do. It's a bit of a misconception about reach because we do about

268
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:06,359
70% of what we do is stocks down to normal people. You're like normal kids, right? Um, and by normal,

269
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:09,880
I mean, on the surface, decent family, you know.

270
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,700
Not at risk.

271
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:15,500
Public style private school, not at risk, not disengaged, right? About 30% of what we do is

272
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,440
disengaged kids at school, at risk, out of home care, those sorts of things. But the vast majority

273
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:27,740
is just in, in normal schools. Um, and you know, this two degree shift that happened to me on that

274
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:34,420
day, which got me thinking, hang on, maybe it's a bit, something happened here. I don't know what

275
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,000
it was, but something happened. And I've thought about myself more and I've watched other people

276
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,799
share. And the best way to describe it is if you've got a rocket ship on earth and you change

277
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,759
the launch direction by two degrees on earth, no one notices, but by the time it's in outer space,

278
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:54,059
it's a thousand miles on a different course. And that's what happens at reach. It's what happened

279
00:21:54,059 --> 00:22:02,160
to me on that day. And it's really helped, um, direct a lot of my life in that now when the

280
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,279
question is asked, who are you? It's about substance. It's about integrity. It's about

281
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:12,039
character. You know, it's, it's value-based descriptive words of what's important to me

282
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:18,519
and who I believe I, I am in my best rather than, um, Fergus, what's a former footballer and, you

283
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:23,900
know, the founder of Bastion. And what a brilliant story that full circle later, uh, you come back as,

284
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:29,559
as the CEO. And, and I think anyone who met Jim Stines can't help but be affected, uh, by Jim,

285
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:35,779
playing against Jimmy a lot and spending enough time. And it's, it's great that that incredible

286
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:42,279
when you get someone who's so unique and so inspirational like Jim is a foundation like

287
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:46,920
reach really going to only be through Jim. So, you know, when you catch up with Jules Lund or

288
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:53,880
Sam Cavanaugh's, uh, there's so many alumni out of reach, um, like you have gone. And as you said,

289
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,960
change the trajectory of your life. And so it's brilliant that, you know, you're back in that role

290
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,299
and that, um, leadership role and continuing that legacy. There is a step. I am blown away by how

291
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:07,259
many people you speak to who say, you know, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going

292
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:12,000
to say, Oh yeah, I remember when reach kind of my school and did that, you know, and, and you're

293
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,180
talking most of the time, it's like one 90 minute workshop, you know, in a, in a year nine class,

294
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,400
I was, I'm going to get a sandwich out of the office the other day. And I was walking back

295
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,680
and two girls were walking past the reach office, which is in Collingwood, very colorful. It stands

296
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:28,059
out. And the girls are going, that's reach. Oh, in year nine, they came to my school. And like,

297
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:32,220
I was trying to listen as they walked past and, uh, you know, and they start recanting

298
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:37,099
these stories and that sort of stuff. And reach over 30 years has really,

299
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:43,859
impacted a huge amount of young Australians who are now, you know, roughly around my age,

300
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:49,099
a lot of them, um, or younger and, you know, has, has made a big impact on people's lives.

301
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,240
And I love your language, you know, around preventative health. It's something that,

302
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,680
um, you know, we need to understand better and, you know, intuitively people do,

303
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:03,660
but we know that the funding goes elsewhere. But really, if you want to be serious about,

304
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:07,259
you know, youth mental health and mental health going forward, it's got to start,

305
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,839
at that preventative level, isn't it? Well, mate, 99% of all funding,

306
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,839
all health funding goes into reactive and intervention work. So what that means is-

307
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:18,220
Crisis care and that, yeah. If you're already self-harming,

308
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:24,359
if you're already clinically depressed, if you're already got some sort of mental health diagnosis,

309
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,440
you're already in a bad way, we'll throw billions of dollars at you.

310
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:32,359
And we know that's important, but it's a really hard path from there, isn't it?

311
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:35,799
Well, it's, it's like anything. It's like, if you wait for someone to be sick to then throw money

312
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,259
out of, we know it costs 10 times the money. Yeah.

313
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:37,839
10 times as much. Yeah.

314
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:43,099
You know, we know it's, it's ultimately less effective. It doesn't mean it's not

315
00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:49,259
completely required because people in need, need the, the care, right? But at some point we're

316
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:54,119
going to, as a society, we're going to change our view and say, well, let's stop people from

317
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:59,940
getting there in the first place. And you know, 50% of all young people in this country don't

318
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:04,640
feel confident about their future. Now that's a stat not only talks about most of the time,

319
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,259
it's dismissed as young people just got to suck it up or, you know,

320
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:13,920
all this stuff. But the reality is that lack of confidence, that lack of self-belief,

321
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,460
that lack of self-understanding and lack of understanding their place in the world

322
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:23,480
means that they're basically on a knife's edge that they can get tipped into mental ill health.

323
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,519
You know, when, you know, anything, anything could happen, you know, it could be a, they get

324
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:31,359
laughed at in class when they ask a question. It could be the parents get divorced. It could

325
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:34,400
be the girlfriend dumps them. It could be any of these events. And these things start to cycle

326
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,119
them out. But they also means that...

327
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,819
If you don't have that confidence as a young person, then your ability to take advantage

328
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:46,920
of good stuff, the confidence to take advantage of that, that next opportunity to recognize

329
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,880
where that opportunity is there to go for it, you know, we're less likely to grab onto

330
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,059
those things as well. And that impacts purpose and impact, you know, you know, like purpose

331
00:25:56,059 --> 00:26:01,319
on their life and those sort of things. Um, so it's a really important thing to sort of

332
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,319
focus on.

333
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,319
Oh, it's massive, isn't it? And you, and you look at now, you know, the anxiety, depression,

334
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:11,819
uh, numbers are a car crash and, and heading that way. And the world's got more complex,

335
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:16,160
not less complex, hasn't it? We speak about in this forum all the time for, you know,

336
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:21,519
I know you're a father of three now, as a father of four, the, the algorithms on phones

337
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,339
and, and, and how to deal with that from a parenting point of view. And so, you know,

338
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:31,039
to, to, to not understand that the power of programs like REACH and others do is, is a

339
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,000
bit naive, you know, isn't it? I know it's your passion and your focus now, but we need

340
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,299
to seriously ramp up the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

341
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,519
the expertise in that space.

342
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,960
Well, and it's changing, like, you know, you look at the way the education system works.

343
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,480
I mean, of all the people I've ever employed, I'm not sure I've ever read, I don't care

344
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,720
where you go to university. I don't really care what your degree is. In fact, I don't

345
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,279
care at all what your degree is. Now, if you're a lawyer or an accountant or something, then

346
00:26:54,279 --> 00:27:00,559
there is some requirement on that. But, you know, the, the ability, a good worker is,

347
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,599
you know, emotionally intelligent. They're self-assured. They're, they're, they've got

348
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,299
leadership capability. They're good managers. They're good managers. They're good managers.

349
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:12,160
You know, all these things that we can create value for in the world. A good parent, the

350
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:17,220
understanding of, you know, of, of, is empathetic. You know, a lot of it being about being a

351
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,960
good parent, and I'm very new to the whole parenting game, but a lot of it's being able

352
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,519
to understand, you know, where they're coming from and, you know, all that sort of stuff.

353
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:31,059
That all comes from understanding yourself inherently. So if we don't teach it, it's

354
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:34,779
not just like mental health we're talking about. It's the ability to be a good parent,

355
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,299
a good husband, you know, a good wife.

356
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:40,299
You know, is the divorce rate one in three if every young person comes out of school

357
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:44,819
content, happy, self-assured, self-confident, and able to self-analyze emotionally?

358
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:49,799
Well, we'll never know, probably, because, you know, it's a massive undertaking, but

359
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,079
I would suggest probably not.

360
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:57,539
No, it's a, it's a conversation that I, you know, I know you're passionate about. It needs

361
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:01,559
to be had. I'm passionate about it myself. I want to drill into you from a leadership

362
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:06,299
point of view. I'm a young age now. You've had a lot of people relying on your leadership

363
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,660
skills, really, when you think about it, when you've expanded businesses. How would

364
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,140
you describe yourself as a leader?

365
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:21,859
I'm, I think, brutal. I think I'm, I am very, very relentingly focused.

366
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,660
When you say brutal, what do you mean?

367
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,579
From a high performance perspective, you know, like I'm very direct. I think that's probably

368
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:35,220
what I mean. I'm very direct. And if we're all on the path to achieve something, like

369
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,299
I am, like, I'm very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

370
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:41,200
you know, like I can't think of anything else. Like, and trying to understand that

371
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,000
other people aren't like that, um, is not always the easiest thing in the world. But

372
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,180
I'm also very empowering on, and allowing other people to do it and getting out of the

373
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:59,000
way. That's a, that's a really significant component of the way I lead is I employ you

374
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:06,099
to do a job, go and do it. Like, you don't need to check in with me every day. I am completely

375
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:11,460
empowering you to go and do it. Um, knowing full well that this is where we're going and

376
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,660
you're on the train and I've told you exactly what's happening here and here's your job

377
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:20,880
and you go and do it. And if you don't do it, well then, you know, you don't do it and

378
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,119
that's, you know, but I'm not going to micromanage you the whole time. And that's a really important

379
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:33,519
sort of, um, component in terms of the way I do it. So, um, it's, uh, you know, I think

380
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:36,079
it, it works really well for some people and not so well.

381
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:48,920
How about in the context of, of now in a, in a not-for-profit in the rich space, are

382
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,839
you finding you've had to have some, uh, some nuance around that or is it the same principles

383
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:54,539
apply for you?

384
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,259
The same principles apply. I've had a lot of discussions about, you know, not-for-profits

385
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:03,660
don't operate like this and stuff like that. And I said, well, this one does. Um, and,

386
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,859
and, you know, I've, I've, there's certain not-for-profits that have different commercial

387
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:12,440
models, you know, some just raise a lot of money and give it all away. Um, and, and,

388
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:17,099
and so there's different commercial models. Ours is a bit different because schools pay

389
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:21,279
us to do work, corporates hire us to run team building work, leadership work, connection

390
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:27,480
work with their, their, their employees. Um, so we, we run a service business in many ways.

391
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:33,140
Um, and so it's all based around capacity of our facilitators and, and sales funnels

392
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:38,759
and normal service business stuff. Um, and so that's been a really big focus. And then

393
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:41,599
also building out, building out, um, the brand.

394
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:47,680
But again, um, you know, like I've been there seven or eight months now where the, the, um,

395
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,880
all the metrics in, in the business have totally changed and we're, we're really propelling

396
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:57,700
forward. And it's now in the position where it's like, okay, like everything we've done

397
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,599
over the last five months, it's now up to you to go and go and run the thing, you know,

398
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:07,200
and I'll get out of your way. And, and, um, you know, it's, it's a bit scary sometimes

399
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:07,920
as a leader doing that.

400
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,140
So you see yourself again as making yourself redundant again in this role?

401
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:15,259
It has to be the job because otherwise you don't move forward. So when I talk about

402
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:19,940
making myself redundant, it doesn't mean I leave. It means, uh, you know, on a, on a

403
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:25,859
consistent cycle, if I'm required to deliver the operations of the business, then I'm not

404
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:31,380
waking up in the morning thinking about the future. And that's where I should be. Um,

405
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:36,480
that's what I'm good at. It's also where, it's what I believe a good CEO does is they

406
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,480
wake up in the morning with a clean inbox, a team that is operational.

407
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,599
Yeah.

408
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:46,039
Relationally delivering, getting some right, getting some wrong, you know, all that sort

409
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:50,599
of stuff. Focusing on how do we grow this exponentially, you know, instead of just a

410
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:54,940
little 5% growth every year or 10% growth, how are we looking at 100, 200% growth and

411
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,420
what does the next five years look like? That's where my mind is.

412
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:02,500
And that's a, a clear message and a clear lesson. I like it. I'm sure that, you know,

413
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,579
will resonate with a lot of people. I want to ask you one question. You've been in the

414
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:09,599
world of marketing and advertising and, and, and serious expertise. For those listening

415
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:10,599
who are, everyone that's got a business that's got a business that's got a business that's

416
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:11,599
got a business that's got a business that's got a business that's got a business that's got

417
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,299
a business they want to grow, what's the secret to, to marketing your business?

418
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:17,299
Oh.

419
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:19,099
There's a simple answer for you.

420
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:25,519
Yeah. Right. It is hugely dependent on the size of the business and all those sort of

421
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,519
things. But if we're talking about small business primarily, then.

422
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:32,980
There's some fundamental things that you, you would, in your mind, from what you've

423
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:38,240
seen if you don't get certain things right or is it really bespoke depending on the story.

424
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,440
A stated belief and why you exist.

425
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:41,559
Yeah.

426
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:47,259
So, um, you know, you always talk, you hear people talking about what, why and how and

427
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:51,039
all that sort of stuff, but the why you're in business is the thing that matters.

428
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:57,559
The product you have, unless you are one of the very, very few where your product is genuinely

429
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:01,960
unique and genuinely game changing and you can just sell off the back of your product.

430
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,880
I mean, you're Steve Jobs, right?

431
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,400
Like there's really not many of them.

432
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:05,619
Yeah.

433
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:12,559
Um, how you deliver it is around customer service and, you know, your distribution channels

434
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,779
and some of those sorts of things.

435
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:15,920
And there is some uniqueness around that.

436
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,200
So if you've got a unique distribution channel, I'm a big believer that that makes an enormous

437
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:25,099
difference in being able to have business success and because you can get your product

438
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:28,559
into market, you know, you know, somewhat unique, efficient sort of streamlined way.

439
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:29,779
Um.

440
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,299
What's an example of that then?

441
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,599
Um, I'm a partner in a beer called Leishman Largo.

442
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:38,180
Um, with Mark Leishman, the golfer, right?

443
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:42,640
And there's, and we have a unique distribution model because we sell into golf clubs.

444
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:43,319
Yeah.

445
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,140
So we're an Australian golf beer.

446
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,779
Targeted at golf clubs.

447
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:50,940
Targeted at golf clubs, made by Art Golfer.

448
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:53,759
It's all about golf and we sell to golf clubs.

449
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,099
Yeah.

450
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,079
And no one else has that.

451
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,380
Yeah.

452
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,599
Does anyone else have a mid-strength beer?

453
00:33:58,799 --> 00:33:59,079
Yeah.

454
00:33:59,299 --> 00:33:59,940
Heaps of people.

455
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:02,619
Is ours wildly different than the next guy?

456
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:05,500
Well, you know, the guy who created our recipe will say, yeah, definitely.

457
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:08,099
But it's, you know, you'll like a particular beer.

458
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:09,019
I like particular beers.

459
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,260
You know, it's the ability to distribute it, um, uniquely into golf clubs.

460
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:20,179
Um, but the thing that really matters is the passion around why do you exist?

461
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,760
Why is, what's the thing emotionally that people are going to connect to?

462
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:31,440
Um, and then if you're marketing that with a $50 million marketing budget, or you're

463
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,519
marketing that with just you behind the coffee machine, you know, um, making

464
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:35,599
coffee.

465
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:39,059
The feeling should be the same.

466
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,460
And that's what people connect to, is they connect to businesses through an emotive feeling.

467
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,300
Uh, that should be the focus.

468
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:50,059
And people are smart enough to pick up authenticity and not, there's degrees of, isn't there?

469
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:50,780
People get it.

470
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:52,940
Oh, they feel it.

471
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:53,559
Yeah.

472
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:58,860
You know, it's, they don't, um, if you're trying to make them understand a product,

473
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,940
like, you know, it's like the coffee guy will tell you why this coffee bean is the greatest

474
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,739
coffee bean ever.

475
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:04,679
And, you know, blah, blah, blah.

476
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:06,079
I drink heaps of coffee.

477
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,719
I couldn't care less, you know?

478
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,940
And I understand some people do, but that's a, that's a small fraction of the market.

479
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:16,719
So if he's in there telling you all about the coffee bean, you'll walk in, you go, thanks

480
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:16,960
mate.

481
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,880
I just, I just got to get on with my day.

482
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,739
If he talks, tells you a funny story, he's, he's emotively engaging you, you go in, you

483
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:29,880
get your coffee and you feel good because of the belief of the brand, the experience,

484
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,420
everything else.

485
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:33,519
You leave moving on into your day and he's made your day better.

486
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,320
Yeah.

487
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,340
Yeah.

488
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:34,360
Yeah.

489
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,380
Yeah.

490
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:34,400
Yeah.

491
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:34,420
Yeah.

492
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:34,440
Yeah.

493
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:34,500
Yeah.

494
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:34,519
Yeah.

495
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:34,539
Yeah.

496
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:34,639
Yeah.

497
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:37,159
It's normally the job of the cafe in the morning, right?

498
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:37,960
That gives you your coffee.

499
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,840
Um, and that is ultimately the focus should be.

500
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,039
I like it.

501
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:48,900
Uh, Fergus been asking, um, dimensions of leadership is, is something we're passionate about in,

502
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:50,039
in the leadership business.

503
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:54,599
We create a cool leader and we're seeing what I would describe as sort of 21st century leadership,

504
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:58,800
but there is a new face of leadership and you, you would have experienced it in footy.

505
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,079
That was a different time.

506
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,360
And we're seeing footy coaches, I think, you know, with a very different set of, of,

507
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,199
um, the way they go about leading and same in business and same in not for profit.

508
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:11,760
And I love sitting down with different people because, you know, their thoughts on it.

509
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:16,000
And we think it starts for everyone who's got a sense of, of leadership with, with self

510
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,719
leadership, their own sense of self leadership.

511
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,099
What does that mean to you?

512
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,000
Um, leadership for me is the ability to, you've got to have a vision of where you want to

513
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,300
go.

514
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:31,500
So you've got to have, um, you've got to be highly motivated on achieving that vision,

515
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:33,260
getting people to come with you.

516
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:40,099
Um, but the people that come with you are the ones that are ultimately going to do it.

517
00:36:41,019 --> 00:36:48,320
So the, the, being able to lead them and motivate them to do that is the most, is really the

518
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:48,980
most important thing.

519
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:53,639
Um, I, I, I'm a big believer that it comes from vulnerability.

520
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,360
You know, it comes from a motive vulnerability.

521
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:01,360
Now there's certain behaviors that you can't do as a leader.

522
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,219
Um, and there's certain behaviors.

523
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:04,159
There's certain behaviors that you must do.

524
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,480
So there, there needs to be some restriction on your behavior as a leader and you need

525
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,599
to be well aware of that.

526
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,159
Um, but at the same time, you need to be phenomenally authentic.

527
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:21,800
I mean, there's no margin for error on authenticity and vulnerability.

528
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,340
And if you're having a rough day, be honest about it.

529
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,519
You know, no one expects you to be this perfect leader.

530
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:31,719
And, you know, when you talk about modern leadership, that's the thing I think about

531
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,940
is it's not.

532
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:38,380
Um, you know, the old footy coach, like rah, rah, rah, this is what's going to happen.

533
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,099
And, you know, they never made a mistake in their life and all that sort of stuff.

534
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:43,539
It's people connect with the realness of it.

535
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:47,119
It doesn't mean they don't look up to you when you admit that you stuffed it up.

536
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:47,440
Yeah.

537
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:48,500
Yeah.

538
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:52,539
I, um, you know, it's a profound answer and it, and it, and it makes sense is that you

539
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:56,780
can't without that authentic understanding of yourself, very hard to lead others.

540
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,239
And I think people, as I said before, uh, pretty astute at picking when someone's putting

541
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,199
on a mask and not being.

542
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:05,039
It pours out of them.

543
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:08,400
What are you, what are you seeing in, in the leadership side of things in that?

544
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:13,159
Just that big shift to, to, to exactly that is that the hierarchy is gone.

545
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,780
You know, that, um, you know, you probably, even in the military sense, you know, you

546
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:21,019
speak to military leaders now and you think that would be the ultimate hierarchy.

547
00:38:21,219 --> 00:38:24,019
They worked out that you have to be collaborative.

548
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,159
You have to listen to people, even in, you know, life and death situation of that.

549
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,679
It doesn't work anymore.

550
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,179
People don't feel as though they've got ownership in there.

551
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:37,780
They don't feel like they've got a voice or they're listened to the next generation

552
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,340
just disengage immediately.

553
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,960
And so if you haven't, as a leader, got an understanding and understanding of people

554
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,840
in your environment about the whole person, not just, Hey, I've built this group called

555
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,199
Bastia and there's 300 people there.

556
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,519
And there were, I got to actually genuinely have this sense that people know that I care

557
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:54,800
about them and their improvement.

558
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,320
And I, you know, it sounds like you're ahead of the game in that, but, but it's still

559
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,880
uncommon, you know, there's still organizations, as you would know, well, and truly haven't

560
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,159
got that.

561
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:07,400
And I think there's a massive gap to improve with it, with that space.

562
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,860
Well, people don't get taught it, do they?

563
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:14,519
Like, it's like, you know, it's, I always, it's always fascinates me that you got the,

564
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:18,300
you know, the best sales person in the team and then they make them the manager of the

565
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:18,760
salespeople.

566
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,480
You go, hang on, where'd they learn the management skills?

567
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:23,340
Did that ever happen?

568
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:24,559
Did they get taught that?

569
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:27,480
Did they get taught how to, you know, transition and progress?

570
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:28,639
Do they understand?

571
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,559
You know, we see this cycle of two, two and a half years where people flip out of their

572
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:33,159
jobs and go to their jobs.

573
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:37,760
I'm a big believer that it's not because they can't do their current job.

574
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:41,139
It's because they're not emotionally ready to go to the next one.

575
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:41,619
Right?

576
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,079
But no one tells them that.

577
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,400
No one really sort of educates them on that.

578
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,119
And how do you get them emotionally ready?

579
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:51,980
So the person sitting in the seat hasn't done this work themselves because they never did

580
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,460
it at school.

581
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,599
They're sitting there saying, I've been doing this job for two years.

582
00:39:55,699 --> 00:39:57,940
Like I can do this stand on my head.

583
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,719
Like I'm a bit bored and I keep asking for a promotion and they won't give me one.

584
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:07,420
And there's this disconnect, you know, and so you go, well, it's not because you can't

585
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,039
do your current job.

586
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,800
It's because you've got to develop all these leadership skills and management skills and

587
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,920
emotive development and emotional intelligence because your next job is not about just doing

588
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,320
the work.

589
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,440
It's about managing the three people underneath you, you know, and we don't teach anyone that.

590
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:20,860
It's madness.

591
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,119
And often what happens, you've seen organizations, if you're there for an extended period of

592
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:27,719
time, you fall into a leadership role just by being in the chair long enough.

593
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:31,679
And often then, as you described, without any skillset and neither should you.

594
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,119
I mean, if you haven't been taught it.

595
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:33,239
Well.

596
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:38,960
Then, but suddenly you're managing a hundred people and often then through your own insecurity,

597
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:44,480
you know, you manage up okay to keep your role, but down you can cause a lot of pain,

598
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:46,019
a lot of misery to a lot of people.

599
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:46,519
Absolutely.

600
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:52,559
And you get, you know, you get leaders that have got friction and ego and all this sort

601
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:52,860
of stuff.

602
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:56,739
Most of the time, I mean, almost a hundred percent of the time, it's not because they're

603
00:40:56,739 --> 00:40:57,420
bad people.

604
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,519
Like people are, I don't know.

605
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:02,980
It seems a bit ridiculous.

606
00:41:03,179 --> 00:41:05,480
I think all the time, but I can't really think of a time it's not true.

607
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:07,019
They're trying to do the right thing.

608
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,880
They just don't know how to do it.

609
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,619
And I agree with you.

610
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:12,960
And I think often those people get misconstrued as really bad people because their behavior

611
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,059
has become really bad.

612
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:18,280
And this podcast is born out of an extension of, of that effectively.

613
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,940
The work, you know, we do as part of the solution we serve.

614
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,719
If you put leaders from diverse backgrounds together to share and connect and learn and

615
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:30,719
ultimately hold each other accountable, it's not a bad place to start because you've got

616
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:31,820
to then reflect around.

617
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:33,159
And then also take that back.

618
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:36,219
Take some survey and feedback around how you are, what impact you're having in your

619
00:41:36,219 --> 00:41:36,500
environment.

620
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:41,219
If you don't actually go and do that and listen to it and then try and better yourself with

621
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:43,579
other role modeling, how can you get better?

622
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:44,800
Well, I think that's exactly right.

623
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,300
And we talk about the depth of the question, right?

624
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,820
So if you're a leader, most of the time, there's a, there's a couple of superficial questions

625
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,400
and then, okay, this is what I need from you.

626
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,219
Same with our friends.

627
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,199
We do it with our friends, right?

628
00:41:57,219 --> 00:41:59,039
We have this, how you doing?

629
00:41:59,199 --> 00:41:59,800
I'm good.

630
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,599
What did you do on the weekend?

631
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,840
Oh, I did this.

632
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:02,800
Oh, that's interesting.

633
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,139
I did this.

634
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:03,599
I did that.

635
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,320
And it's like this tennis match of superficiality, right?

636
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:14,159
Whereas if you actually are asking, I'm listening to your answer and then I'm asking you a question

637
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:17,199
based on what you've told me, we go a bit deeper.

638
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:19,980
And then I ask you another question and we go a bit deeper.

639
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:21,280
And I ask you another question.

640
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:26,420
You ask five questions in a row to someone based on what they've told you, you'll actually

641
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:30,960
get to the point of how they're feeling, what's really going on for them.

642
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,099
And they'll start thinking about things.

643
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,199
You'll start thinking about things.

644
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:38,599
And the byproduct of that is they will feel more connected to you, right?

645
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:40,960
Because you care about them because you're listening to them.

646
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,940
You'll understand more about them.

647
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:46,960
So you'll be able to be a better leader for them, you know, and you'll be more connected

648
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,380
to them.

649
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:56,920
And, you know, it's this disconnect where the focus should be on the question, not sort

650
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,420
of the overall bravado and all the other stuff that sort of comes out of leadership.

651
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:01,820
Yeah, it's a great way to describe.

652
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:02,159
Yeah.

653
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:02,179
Yeah.

654
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:02,219
Yeah.

655
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:02,239
Yeah.

656
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:02,260
Yeah.

657
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:02,280
Yeah.

658
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:02,300
Yeah.

659
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:02,340
Yeah.

660
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:02,360
Yeah.

661
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:02,380
Yeah.

662
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:02,619
Yeah.

663
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:02,639
Yeah.

664
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:02,659
Yeah.

665
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:02,699
Yeah.

666
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:02,760
Yeah.

667
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:02,860
Yeah.

668
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:02,940
Yeah.

669
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:03,239
Yeah.

670
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:03,280
Yeah.

671
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:03,320
Yeah.

672
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:03,340
Yeah.

673
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:03,360
Yeah.

674
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:03,420
Yeah.

675
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:03,440
Yeah.

676
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:03,900
Yeah.

677
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:03,920
Yeah.

678
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,000
Yeah.

679
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,079
Yeah.

680
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:04,119
Yeah.

681
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:04,280
Yeah.

682
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:04,300
Yeah.

683
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:04,519
Yeah.

684
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:04,579
Yeah.

685
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:04,619
Yeah.

686
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:04,679
Yeah.

687
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:04,780
Yeah.

688
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:04,800
Yeah.

689
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,219
Yeah.

690
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:05,619
Yeah.

691
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:05,659
Yeah.

692
00:43:05,659 --> 00:43:05,760
Yeah.

693
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:05,780
Yeah.

694
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:05,860
Yeah.

695
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,019
Yeah.

696
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:06,059
Yeah.

697
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:06,320
Yeah.

698
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:06,500
Yeah.

699
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,500
In any form of their life, in their relationship at home, their relationship, they're sitting

700
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:15,739
permanently at the tennis match and the superficial level, and you never get that proper connection

701
00:43:15,739 --> 00:43:16,059
ever.

702
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:21,320
And, you know, we know how much life is enhanced when you have that, whatever setting it is.

703
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,480
The next dimension I want to talk to you about is how leaders, we see again, they're

704
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,539
really conscious, and it's almost the answer that you had, they're conscious of how they

705
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:32,900
positively impact someone every single day. In your environments, how have you gone about

706
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:40,400
that? Well, it's very deliberate in terms of the

707
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,920
impact you have on people every day is every moving part. I've been lucky because I've

708
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:52,159
been a CEO since I was 22, 23, right? So I sort of don't know any other way. I didn't

709
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:56,820
know this at the start, but I've been exceptionally lucky. I was having a conversation with one

710
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:01,519
of our staff members the other day, and we were talking about this and this sort of awareness

711
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:07,400
that you have to have as a leader because every move you make, people look at it, you

712
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,199
know, rightly or wrongly. You know, they talk about, staff talk about the CEO more than

713
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:16,440
they talk about anyone else. Like, unless you're aware of that, you're not aware that

714
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:22,000
every move you make as the leader is having a significant impact on all those around you.

715
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:22,139
So yeah.

716
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:27,579
So for me, I've been very aware of it. I had to learn it quickly because I, you know, I

717
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:34,840
didn't understand it early. So I had to learn it quickly. And then I make sure that it's

718
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:41,980
always about them. If it's ever about me, if I'm ever frustrated and, you know, speaking

719
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:48,139
from a frustrated perspective, I'm the only one frustrated here. That's on me, you know?

720
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,119
If I am stern and direct,

721
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:59,340
and I'm doing that on purpose, then no problem at all. That has value. If I'm stern and direct

722
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:06,380
and emotional, it doesn't hold value. So, you know, because then it becomes emotional conversation

723
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:11,400
and that then is about me, not about them. So everything I ever try and do, and I don't always

724
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:20,659
get it right, is ensure that whether I'm happy, empathetic, you know, mad, sad, direct, good,

725
00:45:20,659 --> 00:45:21,320
bad, or indifferent.

726
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:27,199
It's on purpose because I'm trying to get the best out of them always.

727
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:33,099
Yeah. Fascinating. And so you've clearly got a gift for creating a vision and then

728
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:37,920
been able to execute it and the Bastion story is proof to that. And already, you know, eight

729
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:44,039
months into REACH, it's clearly having an enormous effect. You know, talk, can you give

730
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:48,159
some insight into how you've gone about creating that vision and sharing the visions that you

731
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,159
have?

732
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:50,159
At REACH, in Bastion Crossroads?

733
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:51,159
In general, yeah.

734
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:58,880
I will first say that from a Bastion perspective

735
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,940
and also in outreach, it only works because there's a good team

736
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,719
that can then deliver and execute it, right?

737
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:12,119
Like that is an absolute, like that has to be very clear in lights

738
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:14,280
that anything I do only works because there's a good team.

739
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,519
Did Bastion, did you have that, you know, worldwide, you know,

740
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:20,420
leading agency in the country?

741
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:22,159
Did that evolve or did that?

742
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:27,300
Oh, it certainly wasn't like some set strategy or any of that sort of stuff.

743
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,860
It was just sort of get through the day.

744
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,400
But whenever I'm asked, like, did you think you'd ever get this big,

745
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,599
I was always like, well, yeah, I kind of did.

746
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:38,820
But it's not like I set out to have a set plan with a set size

747
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,699
and all that sort of stuff.

748
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,059
It was just, well, of course it was going to be a success.

749
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:47,639
You know, like that has always been, like I play golf not often anymore

750
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:48,480
because I've got three kids under.

751
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,019
But whenever I play golf, I'm not a very good golfer.

752
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,099
I play off 18.

753
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,900
And my mates always laugh at me because they stand over the ball like,

754
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,380
you know, oh, my God, I'm going to shank it.

755
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:02,460
I stand over the ball thinking I'm going to hit this bombing draw.

756
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,400
It's going to land in the middle of the fairway.

757
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:06,739
It's going to be, you know, it's like it's Tiger Woods-esque.

758
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:10,980
And then I'll shank it off into the trees and I'm surprised every time.

759
00:47:13,179 --> 00:47:18,280
And, you know, so I think that's been a strength of mine.

760
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,659
I heard a podcast years ago because we had a business in London fail

761
00:47:23,659 --> 00:47:25,579
and I was flying back from London.

762
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:29,460
And it was a pretty traumatic sort of time.

763
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:34,280
And I was flying back from London and I was sort of almost past it.

764
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:37,440
And only, like, we shut it down like a day before, you know,

765
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,260
or two days before.

766
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,340
And I thought, there's something wrong with me.

767
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,780
Like, I can just, like, end these things and just move on.

768
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,800
And I heard Richard Branson just serendipitously had a podcast I was

769
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,460
listening to with Richard Branson.

770
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:54,900
And he said, you know, they had virgin brides and virgin collar and virgin

771
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:55,760
this and virgin that.

772
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:59,519
He says, he goes, the minute the decision is made that we're going to shut

773
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:02,599
this down, he said, I don't care if I put a billion dollars in it or two

774
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:04,719
dollars in it, he said, I'll forget about it the next day.

775
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,420
He said, like, that's it.

776
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:10,260
And it was a great learning for me because it was like we keep trying

777
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,739
things, you know, and failure, failing, there's nothing wrong with failing.

778
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:16,260
It just hasn't worked, you know.

779
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,300
As long as you've given it all, you've had a crack.

780
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,800
You know, it just didn't work.

781
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:22,320
So don't beat yourself up about it.

782
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,960
Just flick a switch, move on and go do the next thing, you know.

783
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,360
And that's always been ingrained in sort of my DNA in doing that.

784
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,679
I think a lot of that came from footy.

785
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,960
Getting that brutal start.

786
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:37,880
And you hear that a lot, you know, from all the people that have genuine

787
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,800
success is, you know, the Americans talk about failing quickly, don't they?

788
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,159
And they had a good culture with that in America.

789
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,280
We're not so good here in Australia.

790
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:44,800
Blue in America.

791
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,039
Is that they see that as part of doing business.

792
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:51,559
We see it as, you know, ultimate shame in some ways and something we need

793
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:53,940
to get better at in this part of the world.

794
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,519
Mate, I've never had a bad meeting in America, ever.

795
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,400
I walk into every meeting and when we first start, you know,

796
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:03,519
I was thinking about starting American, I was doing the trips and I'd have

797
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:05,019
10 meetings a day and all this stuff.

798
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:07,380
I used to leave chest out.

799
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:10,860
I'm a genius.

800
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:13,460
I've just been told how good I am for the last three weeks

801
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,639
and then nothing happens, you know.

802
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:17,019
And it's very American.

803
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:19,619
It's a very American culture, but they will pump you up.

804
00:49:19,739 --> 00:49:21,059
They'll wrap up your success.

805
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:22,760
They will get around you.

806
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:26,260
You know, it's a very empowering culture to be part of.

807
00:49:26,679 --> 00:49:26,900
Yeah.

808
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:31,460
It's, you know, I quote the Greg Norman philosophy of the time.

809
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:33,059
He's in the news big time, isn't he?

810
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:35,559
The shark was what he's doing with Lou Gold.

811
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:37,260
But he talked about if you buy a nice car in America,

812
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,380
someone walks past and says, hey, man, nice car.

813
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,039
In Australia, someone runs the keys down the side of the car,

814
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:46,139
which sums that conversation up for me.

815
00:49:46,139 --> 00:49:46,659
We see.

816
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:49,739
Again, talking about what the trends in leadership for us around,

817
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:51,099
curiosity is a big thing.

818
00:49:51,219 --> 00:49:55,039
Leaders are genuinely curious and they use that curiosity approach

819
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:55,820
how they get better.

820
00:49:56,739 --> 00:49:57,960
How does that apply to you?

821
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,260
Well, I think that's absolutely right.

822
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:04,099
And I think it goes down to the, you know,

823
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:06,699
the question asking technique and a lot of the ability

824
00:50:06,699 --> 00:50:13,280
to sort of facilitate that you can't do that without being curious.

825
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,280
You also can't.

826
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:20,480
Growing a business, doing exactly the same thing,

827
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:24,920
just more of it, I think is inevitably a difficult thing to do.

828
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,739
Now, there's some businesses that can scar really quickly on that.

829
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,480
But most of the time, if you've got one product,

830
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:32,739
you sell three times as much of it next year as you did this year,

831
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:34,539
cash flow issues.

832
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:35,860
There's all sorts of other stuff that come up.

833
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:38,920
So you've got to find ways to diversify that product set.

834
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,679
You've got to find ways to, whatever it might be.

835
00:50:41,719 --> 00:50:46,260
If you're a drink that sells a beer to a pub, what else can you sell?

836
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:50,219
You know, and how creative can you get in diversifying that product set?

837
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:55,039
And how curious are you about what is really of need for them?

838
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,420
And whatever that might be.

839
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,900
In our game in marketing, it was, you know,

840
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,360
it was the ability to market and sell.

841
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:03,199
We used to talk about selling more stuff.

842
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,639
Like all the client wants to do is sell more of their own stuff.

843
00:51:05,719 --> 00:51:06,699
That is it, you know.

844
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,239
So we've got to find ways to create greater value for them

845
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:11,159
to be able to sell more of their own product.

846
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,960
At Reach, we're a support.

847
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,380
We're the curriculum, you know.

848
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,500
We're a support to teachers.

849
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:21,760
And teachers are the most,

850
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:24,980
they're the definition of underpaid and overworked, you know.

851
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:29,639
Like these teachers deal with so much stuff on a day-to-day basis

852
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:31,699
that's just not teaching the kids.

853
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:35,679
And so we're here to support them.

854
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:42,039
So we're here to make a streamlined service that can integrate.

855
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:45,239
And we need to be curious around what's really in it for them,

856
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,239
not how.

857
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,960
Not just what we do, you know.

858
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:50,139
And that's where curiosity and leadership comes, I think.

859
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:54,219
We see communicating with clarity, again, is a really common thing.

860
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,559
Leaders really understand.

861
00:51:55,719 --> 00:51:59,159
And you've got a brilliant way of communicating your message.

862
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,980
Did you give that some thought?

863
00:52:01,099 --> 00:52:02,260
Was there some strategy in that?

864
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,019
How did you go about that?

865
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,739
I learned it because I did it badly.

866
00:52:07,019 --> 00:52:13,500
And I would be, I would say things like, yeah, we can do that.

867
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:13,920
Sure.

868
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,079
And then that,

869
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,400
came across as like a directive, you know,

870
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:21,019
because I hadn't thought about my words, you know.

871
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:24,519
And effectively what was happening was someone was pitching an idea

872
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:26,059
and I said, yeah, great, let's do it.

873
00:52:26,139 --> 00:52:28,199
And like, didn't even think about it, you know.

874
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:31,500
All I thought was, yeah, seems like a cool idea, you know, whatever.

875
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:32,119
Maybe, yeah.

876
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:32,599
Maybe, yeah.

877
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:34,219
But my language was poor.

878
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:41,260
And I've, because I move on very quickly in my head,

879
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,639
I can be bad at that.

880
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:45,019
I was actually having a,

881
00:52:45,019 --> 00:52:51,559
a, a blue with my missus the other day and not a blue, a discussion.

882
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:57,639
And, and she said, she was like, what do you mean?

883
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:59,360
Like you, you've got this opinion on this.

884
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,000
Like we have spoken about this for months.

885
00:53:01,059 --> 00:53:03,119
And I said, yeah, but we had a conversation last night.

886
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:06,019
And I, like in my head, that was it.

887
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:06,619
It changed.

888
00:53:06,699 --> 00:53:07,239
It was done.

889
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,380
And then, so this whole thing that happened the next day,

890
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:13,760
it was just, it was confusion on her end.

891
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,000
Cause I was living in an old,

892
00:53:15,019 --> 00:53:17,639
alternate universe cause I'd moved on, you know,

893
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:19,860
and just communicating terribly.

894
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,880
And then when it came to, she was like, oh, well, God,

895
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,880
that could have all been avoided.

896
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:26,340
Couldn't it?

897
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,019
If you'd have just communicated properly.

898
00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:31,579
So I would say I'm guilty of being bad at that.

899
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,980
Cause I flick the switch in my own head.

900
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,219
I don't tell anyone else.

901
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:40,079
And when it comes on the home front, you get that feedback very quickly.

902
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:44,320
And we've all, we've all been there before on that space, isn't it?

903
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:44,940
But understanding,

904
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,260
and again, you know, you, you got the strong sense of self and self-awareness to,

905
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:52,940
to be able to understand that, uh, collaboration we see as the final dimension.

906
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:56,940
I want to talk to you about, um, Bastion Collective is all about collaboration and,

907
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:00,099
and, you know, you can tell from your youngest possible age,

908
00:54:00,099 --> 00:54:03,860
but we see leaders now genuinely value collaboration more than ever.

909
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:04,900
Does that resonate with you?

910
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,059
Yeah, absolutely.

911
00:54:06,099 --> 00:54:14,400
Well, that's been, that's been our whole world is, is collaboration and integrated solutions.

912
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:14,800
You know?

913
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:20,800
And because if you're an expert at one particular thing, like if you're an actual subject matter

914
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:27,500
expert on something, chances are you are not a subject matter expert on probably, probably

915
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,099
anything else.

916
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:33,559
So the ability, especially in marketing, I used to make two TV ads and you'd stick them

917
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:37,360
on channel nine, 10 and seven, and you'd get 80% of the population, you know, or you'd

918
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,800
put an ad in the Herald Sun of the Asian, you know, the, the national papers and that'd

919
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:41,699
be it.

920
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:44,699
Now you've got to make 80 ads all different.

921
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,039
Sizes, shapes, different con, you know, it's like, it's totally different.

922
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,699
Um, and you'll do PA, you'll do social, you can do all these other things.

923
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:58,400
And so the only way to do that properly is to have very clear subject matter experts

924
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,199
all collaborating and all working together to provide one solution.

925
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,579
Um, and that, I think you see that now with, you know, with, um, with different brands,

926
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:12,920
like I've got a part of, um, Rick's Eyewear, which is a sunglass company and we collaborate

927
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,679
with different brands all the time because.

928
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:19,599
You can put sunglasses on your head, but it's a bit dependent on what you've got on your

929
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,619
body, you know, and what kind of shoes you're wearing and that sort of stuff.

930
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:25,659
So you've got to have these brand collaborations and those sort of things.

931
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:31,019
So it's a really important part of business and ultimately part of leadership as well.

932
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:34,440
Who has been, uh, the greatest leader in your life?

933
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,039
Uh, I would say my dad.

934
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:43,380
Um, he is, he, yeah, he's an exceptional leader.

935
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:43,440
Yeah.

936
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:43,480
Yeah.

937
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:43,500
Yeah.

938
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:43,559
Yeah.

939
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:43,579
Yeah.

940
00:55:43,579 --> 00:55:43,639
Yeah.

941
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:43,699
Yeah.

942
00:55:43,699 --> 00:55:43,760
Yeah.

943
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:43,780
Yeah.

944
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:43,840
Yeah.

945
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:43,900
Yeah.

946
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:43,920
Yeah.

947
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:43,940
Yeah.

948
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:44,000
Yeah.

949
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,019
Yeah.

950
00:55:44,019 --> 00:55:44,039
Yeah.

951
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:44,099
Yeah.

952
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:44,119
Yeah.

953
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:44,139
Yeah.

954
00:55:44,139 --> 00:55:44,159
Yeah.

955
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:44,179
Yeah.

956
00:55:44,179 --> 00:55:44,219
Yeah.

957
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:44,260
Yeah.

958
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:44,920
Yeah.

959
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,239
Yeah.

960
00:55:57,239 --> 00:55:57,300
Yeah.

961
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:57,619
Yeah.

962
00:55:57,619 --> 00:55:57,699
Yeah.

963
00:55:57,699 --> 00:56:01,480
Well, we have like he, um, you know, the, the St. Kilda thing was interesting.

964
00:56:01,579 --> 00:56:08,000
He was, uh, in these sort of end of his CEO stint when I got there and then he finished

965
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,340
as a CEO, you know, that, that was a unique, that added a whole nother dynamic to my football

966
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:14,780
career.

967
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:19,400
You know, having my dad as the CEO of the club that I got traded to for a first round pick

968
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,659
and then never played one game, like that adds a whole nother dimension.

969
00:56:23,659 --> 00:56:24,659
Yeah.

970
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:25,659
Right.

971
00:56:25,659 --> 00:56:30,920
Um, and then when I got Bastion going, you know, I was ringing him five times a day going,

972
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,920
what the hell do I do here?

973
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,920
And how does this work?

974
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,920
And what does that look like?

975
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,920
And you know, whatever else.

976
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:40,280
Um, and then we had an opportunity to acquire a PR company, which was our first acquisition

977
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:44,760
in, I sold my apartment and bought my share and he bought a share.

978
00:56:44,760 --> 00:57:00,500
And then, you know, and he played the sort of chairman role, the kind of non-exec sort of gray hair sort of oversight role for, I don't know, years, seven, eight years, and still does to this day, you know, significantly lesser extent.

979
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:10,159
But he's always provided that great mentorship and advisory, you know, and he was that whole thing around empowerment.

980
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:14,380
You know, I remember many, many times where I'd say, I'm doing this, and he'd go, really?

981
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,599
And I'd go, yep.

982
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,159
He goes, you sure you want to do that?

983
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:18,119
I go, yep.

984
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:19,360
He goes, okay.

985
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:21,079
And then two months later, I go, that didn't work.

986
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:22,400
He goes, yeah, really?

987
00:57:24,199 --> 00:57:25,179
But never stopped you?

988
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,980
Never, never.

989
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,139
Like, like, never.

990
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:38,079
And a couple of times when we've had some big losses, you know, and I've made some big mistakes, I've sat there and I'm sort of self-pitying my,

991
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,079
you know, like, how?

992
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:46,360
Him and other, you know, other advisors that we had, it's like, surely they knew, you know?

993
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:52,599
And, but if they'd have stopped me, I wouldn't have listened anyway, for starters.

994
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,760
And secondly, I wouldn't have learned, you know?

995
00:57:55,860 --> 00:58:04,239
And so he's always been, my man's been very good at that my entire life, is just, you know, sort of make your own mistakes and, you know, support me through them.

996
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:05,219
What a gift that is.

997
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:10,039
My dad played with his father's son and it wasn't until he passed away a couple of years ago.

998
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:17,920
He didn't once ever, despite having enormous, and watch me really closely, never once ever overlaid anything to me.

999
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:20,179
And I played a lot of really crap games, mate.

1000
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:27,679
He would have had to have bitten his tongue, but it was such a, when he looked back and went, for you not to, just that was all my own mistakes to make.

1001
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:30,539
And, you know, I think you end up parenting the same way.

1002
00:58:30,579 --> 00:58:33,599
I know I certainly try to because it's, it's a gift.

1003
00:58:33,699 --> 00:58:36,760
Sometimes you look back and think, geez, he could have helped me avoid a bit of pain there.

1004
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,539
But not to be.

1005
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:40,559
Yeah, and I sort of respect that.

1006
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,460
It's got to be brutally hard as a parent.

1007
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:50,800
We see it with Rach when young people come out of these, because they come out of these workshops and they've had this sort of transformative experience, you know.

1008
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:57,239
And then the parent comes in with this sort of question that it's like, what, really, like this stupid question.

1009
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,579
And you can see the kid switch off, you know.

1010
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:03,039
And it's just not the parent's fault.

1011
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:06,019
Like these poor parents, like it is so hard.

1012
00:59:06,019 --> 00:59:09,460
And most of the time I see it come from this.

1013
00:59:09,539 --> 00:59:16,260
You know, they're in a position of just immense care and love and desire for their kid to live the best life they can live.

1014
00:59:18,019 --> 00:59:25,360
But, you know, it's just got to be the hardest gig in the world, you know, being a parent of a teenager and letting them make their own mistakes.

1015
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:27,980
It's got to be that difficult, I reckon.

1016
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:29,699
Yeah, good luck when that comes your way.

1017
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,260
Yeah, I might have to catch up with you again on that one, mate.

1018
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,760
It's a, it's a puzzle that you're trying to put together the whole time.

1019
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,860
And I love talking about it because there's no perfect answer.

1020
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:39,260
And everyone.

1021
00:59:39,539 --> 00:59:48,260
You know, works their way through it the same way in, in, we love the spirit of collaboration and, you know, you're clearly passionate about it.

1022
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:56,019
And all your areas, whether it's reach or back to best, has there been one person you thought, God, if we could connect with that person, we get interesting answers on this question.

1023
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,380
Is there anyone you've felt like I'd love to collaborate with?

1024
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:05,579
Oh, um, no, no one springs to mind.

1025
01:00:05,579 --> 01:00:07,559
I've, I've been very fortunate.

1026
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:08,960
Um.

1027
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:30,159
That in Bastion, we have an immense breadth of clientele and network, you know, so we've had some amazing people be part of our organization that just for all rights, shouldn't have given us the time of day, you know, um, and, and, and they, and what they've done is connect us to a whole bunch of other people.

1028
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:39,519
So within our network, you know, not that my network individually is necessarily anything amazing, but within the Bastion network, we have had great forties.

1029
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:49,099
So there's, there's just so much, you know, culture and that anytime we go, geez, I'd love to speak to that person, you know, it's like two calls away, one call away, you know, um, there's no one that there's no one that sort of jumps to mind.

1030
01:00:49,159 --> 01:00:50,760
So I think I've been very fortunate in that.

1031
01:00:51,519 --> 01:01:01,219
Um, uh, I think what's, what's interesting now is a thing comes to my head is, is in reach, building the profile reach is a very, very important thing.

1032
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:09,219
Um, so, so, you know, people out there, I'll probably give you a more thought people out there that, um,

1033
01:01:09,539 --> 01:01:13,260
can help with the growth of that profile and those sort of things,

1034
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:16,800
that will make a significant difference to our organisation.

1035
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:18,719
That's a good note to finish on.

1036
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:22,940
I appreciate your time and to have you at the helm

1037
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:25,000
of something as important as REACH and what it means

1038
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,639
to the community here in Melbourne.

1039
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:30,239
As I said, I had the great love and affection and privilege

1040
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:33,119
to have known Jimmy Steins and the Steins family.

1041
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:36,800
It fills you with joy to know that it couldn't be in better hands.

1042
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,539
As you started there at 15, you've gone back full circle

1043
01:01:39,539 --> 01:01:42,780
to run an organisation that makes massive differences

1044
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,199
in the lives of so many kids and then, by extension,

1045
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:46,380
our community and the family.

1046
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:49,460
So if you're out there and you want to invest in something,

1047
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:52,360
give Fergus a call and support REACH.

1048
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,619
It couldn't go much better than that, mate.

1049
01:01:54,699 --> 01:01:55,059
Congratulations.

1050
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,519
It's been an incredible experience going through your life

1051
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:00,619
and catching up with you and thanks for spending the time.

1052
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:01,199
Thanks, mate.

1053
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:01,599
Really good.
