1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:12,300
Where does the passion come from to use your own success as a means to support others less

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,160
fortunate? And what are the inbuilt qualities that make someone so consistently good at

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:25,980
positively impacting others in their environment? Today, it's Luke Darcy. The idea of self-improvement

4
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,780
and leadership, both on and off the field, has been a lifelong passion of mine. With one of my

5
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,859
oldest friends, we created a leader collective. I've had the privilege of working with thousands

6
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:40,399
of leaders in education, sport, industry, and the arts that have helped shift to what we see

7
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,820
as the 21st century style of leadership where everyone has a voice. In this podcast, we hear

8
00:00:46,820 --> 00:01:05,799
stories from these iconic leaders. Jeff Harris was a founding partner of Flight Centre in 1982,

9
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,060
investing $3,000 to open the first Flight Centre in Melbourne. Flight Centre, prior to COVID,

10
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,280
was the third largest retailer in Australia behind West Farmers and Woolworths with 22,000 staff and

11
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,519
a turnover of $22 billion.

12
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:24,000
Including 2,200 company-owned stores in 14 countries. Jeff's business life is full of

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,159
numerous success stories, including taking a 25% stake in Boost Juice, supporting Janine Ellis

14
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,060
in growing from a handful of stores to several hundred. Jeff has made an enormous contribution

15
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,879
in the philanthropic world, purchasing a warehouse in Collingwood in 2002 to serve

16
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:44,760
as headquarters to the legendary Jim Steins' Reach Foundation, leasing it back to Reach for $5 per

17
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,060
year on a 50-year lease. Reach runs courses for the company, and Jeff's business life is full of

18
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,620
over 13,000 at-risk kids a year. Jeff's generosity and business acumen have supported many social

19
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,280
enterprises that have real impact, particularly in the homeless housing and youth at-risk space.

20
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,040
Jeff is the Vice President of the Hawthorne Football Club, serving the maximum nine years

21
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,120
from 2004 to 2013, and arguably the most successful period in the club's history.

22
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,139
Jeff has an Honorary Doctorate of Business from Swinburne University, and in 2019

23
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:15,960
was awarded an Order of Australia. Jeff Harris, great to see you.

24
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,680
Thank you, Lou.

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,539
Appreciate you.

26
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:17,819
Thanks very much.

27
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,580
Hello, everyone.

28
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,939
Appreciate your time. It's an extraordinary life of success and contribution. When I read that

29
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:26,699
back to you, Jeff, what are your thoughts? What are your reflections?

30
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:31,139
Well, I guess it's pretty amazing, because as we were saying before, Luke, I mean, I left school

31
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:36,120
at year 10, so all of my stuff has been just lessons from the real life, I guess. Nothing

32
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,060
really from university or whatever. It's just real life experiences that I've found what's

33
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:46,900
worked and what hasn't worked. And I was very fortunate. I had a strong father figure in my life.

34
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:53,280
And at 14, I was badly bullied at school one year. And if it wasn't for that father figure,

35
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,240
I would have been in all sorts of trouble. But he helped me a lot. And that's one of the

36
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,259
reasons why later on in life, when I'm now 70, I've always had an interest in youth at

37
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:05,300
risk and young people. And that was a bad case of bullying. So trying to help out where

38
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,240
I can, and kids with real issues these days, it's always really resonated with me. Because

39
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,379
I was lucky enough to have a strong male role model, and boys need that. A lot of young

40
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:14,879
boys don't.

41
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,379
Was that your own dad, Jeff?

42
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:16,879
My father.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,120
Yeah. And he stepped in as a 14-year-old and realized that you're in-

44
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,340
He was there for me at the time when I needed someone, yeah.

45
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,800
Yeah. And practically, that just helped you work through. You said you left school in

46
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,719
year 10. What was he like when you decided-

47
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,060
Oh, I left school. I went and worked in an advertising agency, basically sweeping the

48
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:40,199
floors and what have you as a kid, as a male boy. And then I started at RMIT. I did a marketing

49
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,639
course after hours, basically, but started off as a kid.

50
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:46,620
You go back to 1982, Jeff, and you've stumped up $3,000.

51
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,219
That's right.

52
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:51,080
To start this thing called Flight Centre. And I, in the intro, described it's one of

53
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,360
Australia's greatest ever business success stories. When you look back, did you have

54
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,900
any sense that you were creating something that big? And what was the secret to its success?

55
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:08,599
I was lucky enough, I went overland in 1972 to London. Interestingly, spent $658 for a

56
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:16,040
seven-month trip hitchhiking from Darwin through India, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, how I survived,

57
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,560
I've got no idea.

58
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:16,860
Yeah.

59
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,740
Got to London in 1972 and I met two fellows called Bill James and Graham Turner

60
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,779
who are running a company called Top Deck Travel in London.

61
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,660
And we've become really good mates.

62
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,740
And in the early 80s, after working in London for that decade,

63
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,860
we come back to Australia with the idea of selling cheap flights

64
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,680
based on what the Europeans call bucket shops in Europe,

65
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,160
which is essentially selling cheap airfare.

66
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,639
So we kicked off here in Australia.

67
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,139
I lived in Melbourne, Graham in Brisbane, Bill in Sydney,

68
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,879
and basically we kicked off with one store in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane,

69
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,639
about three to four grand for our fit-outs.

70
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,420
And we knew nothing about travel, but we had a good, I guess,

71
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,079
business sense in terms of we needed to maximise sales per square metre.

72
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,100
So we put in a counter in the stores rather than having two desks or three desks.

73
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:03,459
We had a six-person counter so we could get more sales per square metre.

74
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,079
We had people on incentives, on commission, on profit share,

75
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,379
a whole bunch of things we did which were quite different in the industry.

76
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:14,819
But anyway, it took off just as jumbo jet travel was starting to take off in Australia as well.

77
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,860
And we were very profitable.

78
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,680
We had everyone in the company on a profit share from day one, staff and managers,

79
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,279
and we were very, very, very transparent in terms of our financials with all our staff

80
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:31,459
and both the incentive, i.e. profit share on the outcomes of the stores,

81
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,019
which all staff shared in it, and recognition systems with recognition,

82
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:39,660
which we had both monthly what we call buzz nights, getting new people,

83
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:42,379
welcoming new people up on stage in front of all the staff.

84
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,459
They'd have to introduce themselves, scull a beer or whatever,

85
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:47,439
tell their story, so they all felt part of the team.

86
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,160
And then we had an annual awards night as well.

87
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,800
So getting that incentive and recognition system was really important as well from the early days.

88
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,899
And we almost created a sort of a cult-like following internally because we actually won the Employer of the Year three years in a row.

89
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,779
So we had a very, very strong culture and it was a really egalitarian set up as well.

90
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,860
We never had any corner offices or fancy head offices.

91
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,759
We never, ever, in entire groups developed, any of us have a PA.

92
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:18,040
Because we expected the store managers to run their own business exactly the same way,

93
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,379
that they didn't have PAs or sit out the back in a corner office.

94
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,720
They had to be at the front selling with the team.

95
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:26,220
So we adopted that sort of egalitarian structure from day one.

96
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,459
And it seems like you still run your commercial world the same way.

97
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,600
You respond to your own emails.

98
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,800
Yeah, I've got a mobile.

99
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,839
That's my PA.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,420
And it's the same for Graeme Turner, still the CEO of Flight.

101
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,399
That's all he has is a mobile.

102
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:44,360
And he runs the entire global team of 22,000 up to last year with a team of six.

103
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,540
Mobile and that's underneath that.

104
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,540
There's a whole lot of stuff that goes on that enables that.

105
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,959
Yeah, it's extraordinary.

106
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,180
We're digressing because there's so much of interest, Jeff, in talking to you.

107
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,579
You're a founding partner, still the CEO 40 years later.

108
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,660
I mean, that is an extraordinary Australian success story.

109
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,040
What makes him such a great CEO?

110
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:08,779
He's incredibly resilient.

111
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,319
He doesn't get stressed.

112
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,680
It's very difficult in a business as a startup.

113
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:18,120
It's very difficult in a startup then to go from small to medium to large.

114
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:22,199
It's almost an impossible skill to transition those three things.

115
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,899
And he's managed to navigate that.

116
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:31,860
I left full-time executive role in the early 2000s because I didn't want to be on a plane all the time

117
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,220
and I wanted to do some other things in my life.

118
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,500
But Graeme stayed on.

119
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:40,959
So it's resilience, it's optimism, it's can-do, and he'll be carried out in a box.

120
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,680
It's his whole life.

121
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,399
And he's absolutely fantastic at it.

122
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,800
We'll talk about.

123
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,740
We'll talk about some of your mantras in life, which I want to get to shortly.

124
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:51,939
But you mentioned having a father figure that was incredibly important for you,

125
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:54,360
having experienced some challenges when you were young,

126
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,360
and then you now having an interest in youth at risk.

127
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:02,100
But there's so many people I've met that have come across and said,

128
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:03,120
Jeff Harris changed my life.

129
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,660
Jeff Harris was such a great mentor.

130
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:08,899
Janine Ellis on this podcast, she mentioned you as one of the great mentors in her life.

131
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,040
We share a mutual friend who worked at Flight Centre for many years, Alison Crabb,

132
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,199
who I spoke to.

133
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,639
She talked about you and she said, changed my life, Jeff Harris.

134
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:22,879
So when I say that back to you, I can see you're almost sitting back in your chair.

135
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:25,399
I mean, clearly you've had a skill for mentoring people.

136
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:26,180
Where did that come from?

137
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:31,920
Look, I think at the end of the day, you've got to communicate very clearly.

138
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,960
I mean, to put it back into perspective, I suppose when I was in the executive chair

139
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,480
at Flight Centre, I used to go out to the store three days a week.

140
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,639
I wasn't in a head office environment.

141
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,320
I was out there.

142
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,519
I'd go to a store.

143
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,779
I wouldn't visit the manager first.

144
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,779
I'd visit the rookie, the newest employee.

145
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:48,559
If they'd only been there a day, I'd sit them down, say, g'day, how are you going?

146
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,320
What did you do beforehand?

147
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,779
What was the induction program like compared to what you've had previously?

148
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,500
How can we learn?

149
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,759
So it was sort of like I was really sort of transparent in terms of communication.

150
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,460
I was reasonably tough in terms of rights and responsibilities, but I was really generous

151
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,419
in terms of looking out for people and having their back.

152
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,879
So I think those two things are really important.

153
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,320
You can be tough as a leader, but also you've got to be very, very generous and make sure

154
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,679
you've got your back.

155
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:14,779
You've got to be very, very generous.

156
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:15,440
You've got to look out for people's back.

157
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,320
If they follow, you're part of the team and they do the right thing, you've got to be

158
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,259
really generous as a leader to make sure those people are looked out for, both professionally,

159
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,299
but more importantly, personally as well.

160
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:25,740
Yeah.

161
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,480
Alison shared a story with me in preparation for this conversation.

162
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,620
She had a really tough day in the office and you may remember this story and without getting

163
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,759
too personal, there was actually a criminal matter that affected her really personally

164
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:42,159
that she'd been on the receiving end of some serious injustice.

165
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,120
She's in tears in the office.

166
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,659
She said, you see her?

167
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:49,379
You put her in a cab home, but she said afterwards, her colleagues told her that you picked up

168
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:58,179
the phone and started lobbying on her behalf for change and she said never, ever lost on

169
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:00,720
her how important it was that you had people's back.

170
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,340
Was that just something that came naturally to her?

171
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:02,700
Yeah.

172
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,139
I mean, you just have to do it.

173
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,120
You're part of the team.

174
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:06,779
You've got to do whatever it takes in that regard.

175
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:07,899
Look, you'll learn.

176
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,740
I mean, I made every mistake known to mankind, but at the end of the day, if you look out

177
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,539
for your people and you're in business at the end of the day, you've got to do it.

178
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:15,259
You've got to make a profit.

179
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:17,519
The profits will take care of themselves if you look out for the people.

180
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,639
So I think that's really, it's just good business sense, really.

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,639
I wanted to move on to just quickly your philanthropic passion and you've done some extraordinary

182
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,039
stuff.

183
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:33,039
I mean, Flight Centre was an amazing financial and commercial success, but it feels as though

184
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:35,919
you've approached your philanthropic works in the same way.

185
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:39,679
I mentioned in the opener, the Reach Foundation, and you're on the board there for seven years

186
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,059
and you bought a building in Collingwood that still serves as its headquarters.

187
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,320
You helped open family.

188
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:48,220
Another national youth at risk charity, a major sponsor of Street, which is an incredible

189
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,120
social enterprise.

190
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,559
You bought them a headquarters for severely disadvantaged people that enables them aid

191
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:59,539
to work and a self-funded model in that space.

192
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,399
Where did that passion come from and how do you approach it?

193
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,460
I think the Street model is very interesting for everyone out there listening.

194
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,759
I mean, that's a social enterprise.

195
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:13,220
Now, in Australia, there's about 60,000 charities and there are about 30,000 social enterprises.

196
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,120
Now, a social enterprise.

197
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:18,320
A social enterprise is essentially a charity with a charitable license, so a government

198
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,299
license to operate as a charity, but it uses private enterprise to produce its own income.

199
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,259
So, rather than a business producing profits for dividends for shareholders, it produces

200
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:35,519
revenue to keep that charitable enterprise going and then plough those funds back into

201
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,980
growing more courses or whatever it is that they're trying to do.

202
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:43,259
So, in the Street model, it was looking after kids with severe, like at the absolute bottom

203
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:43,759
end of the pile.

204
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:44,519
No one wanted to look.

205
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:52,220
No one wanted to look out for either suicidal, drug-dependent, in jail, in a court system,

206
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:52,519
whatever.

207
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,139
And it was set up by a lady called Rebecca Scott.

208
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,600
She's an ex-scientist, a woman in her late 30s, early 40s, just a wonderful person.

209
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:07,580
And I met her about eight years ago and I was an inhabitant as a business person about

210
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,100
how you can use business to solve social problems.

211
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,299
So, Street had just started up and are in a very infancy.

212
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,440
And again, I thought, well, gee, why?

213
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,620
Can't we apply the REACH model in terms of buying a head office building?

214
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,399
So, what we did, we looked around in the Richmond area and we actually found a building actually

215
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,200
just nearby in Collingwood in Cromwell Street.

216
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:30,419
It was an operating brothel, Luke, and listeners, I'm sorry about that, close your ears, but

217
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:30,960
it was a brothel.

218
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,279
And indeed, the brothel had just been closed the day before by the police.

219
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,720
There'd been some sort of drug raid there.

220
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,980
And so, it still had pink satin sheets and high heels and dildos, God knows whatever

221
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,259
else.

222
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:43,980
There was a machine on the wall with chains.

223
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,879
So, it was actually, it was exactly the same as that.

224
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,139
It was up for sale.

225
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:53,279
So, I bought it, it was about $2.2 million.

226
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,620
And then we got a social loan from Westpac, a low interest loan of a million dollars.

227
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:01,220
And then we got donors of another million dollars and we've refurbished it.

228
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,100
And again, I put Street on a 50-year lease for $5 a year.

229
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,539
I also did a deal with the state government on land tax.

230
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,539
So, we're forgiving the rent to Street to do their social good.

231
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:11,840
Yeah.

232
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,840
We did a deal with the state government to forgive land tax.

233
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,299
So, we didn't have to pay the 100-odd grand land tax.

234
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,580
And we did a deal with council to forgive rates.

235
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,399
So, essentially, Street gets a free building.

236
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:26,799
All they've got to do is pay that small interest component of that $1 million, a free building

237
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,159
for $5 a year.

238
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,779
We own, our Harris family, own an inner city building for the next 50 years.

239
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:33,059
Yeah.

240
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,820
Achieving social outcomes.

241
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,080
Yeah.

242
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,539
But it's going to grow in capital gains.

243
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:40,779
So, it's an asset, but achieving social outcomes.

244
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,220
So, we structured, I think, really well.

245
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:50,299
And also, Street being a social enterprise, they had a coffee roasting division, a catering

246
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:54,539
division, a bakery, and a large cafe there, and had four other cafes as well.

247
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:01,279
Pre-COVID, January 2020, they were at 82% self-funding from all their businesses, all

248
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,539
the profits of the businesses, to get about 800 kids a year through their courses.

249
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,700
And they were budgeting to be fully self-funded, 100% self-funded, no philanthropic, no government

250
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,419
money, no donations by 2022.

251
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:18,779
By now, to have all those kids through, not $1 of government money, how good's that?

252
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,559
That's the power of social enterprise.

253
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,919
And there are about now 30,000 in Australia.

254
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:28,139
So, they are the disruptors of traditional charities, whereby traditional charities have

255
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:33,580
to raise about 90, 95% of their funds every year from government, philanthropy, donors.

256
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,019
So, it's a model that's not sustainable, really.

257
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:38,259
So, that's why I love the social enterprise sector.

258
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,679
And I can hear the passion, you know, come out in your voice.

259
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,220
You sit up in your chair, Geoff, when you talk about it.

260
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:43,340
Yeah.

261
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:43,399
Yeah.

262
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:47,480
I interviewed a guy recently on this podcast called Dan Flynn.

263
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,000
He started Thank You Water.

264
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,480
And effectively, what he was trying to do was to use products that everyone buys, the

265
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,659
big multinationals have access to, and he got shelf space.

266
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:03,259
The community said, I'll buy Thank You Water because it's a social enterprise and the proceeds

267
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:08,720
go back to his passion is about extreme poverty and trying to end extreme poverty.

268
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,299
Massive goal.

269
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:13,340
He was also saying that sometimes we hold...

270
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,080
The social enterprise is up to a level that we don't hold the commercial work.

271
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:20,220
If Flight Centre want to invest in a new technology and spend $50 million, it doesn't work.

272
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,059
Well, that's an investment.

273
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:21,480
Yep.

274
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:24,620
But you don't get afforded that luxury in the social enterprise.

275
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,700
Is that a problem with it or not?

276
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,399
It is a difficult space.

277
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,000
In fact, I had a book published about three years ago called Dollars and Cents, and it

278
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,440
was a book on social enterprise and 40 case studies around Australia.

279
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,379
And the reason being is that governments don't treat social enterprise seriously.

280
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:41,559
The Minister of Small Business federally doesn't have social enterprise under their wing, whereas

281
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,379
in the UK, the Minister...

282
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,440
Or a small business in a federal government there has a social enterprise section where

283
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,220
there's legal tax rules and standardisations and systems.

284
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:52,000
There's nothing...

285
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,220
We didn't even know how to approach that.

286
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,620
The tax office didn't know how to approach social enterprise in terms of taxing any profits

287
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,480
because it was registered as a charity.

288
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:01,259
And yet it was a business.

289
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,860
So there was all these things that we need more work in the social enterprise sector.

290
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,320
The other great thing about the street model was that we got dozens of kids a year jobs

291
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,559
once they'd come through the courses.

292
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,320
So unemployable through the street program.

293
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,019
Then into full award-based jobs.

294
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:18,960
And one of the businesses we're involved in is Fonda, which we're a 25% shareholder with

295
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,779
eight Fonda restaurants around Melbourne and two in Sydney.

296
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:24,440
We gave kids job scholarships at Fonda.

297
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,820
There's been about 15 through the last few years who went through the program and then

298
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,259
they were fully employed in no store.

299
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:33,360
So that's when you're making a real difference.

300
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,919
Find Mexican food, Fonda, of attended regularly.

301
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,820
And you branch off into so many areas, Geoff.

302
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,019
I mean, it's fascinating to see.

303
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,759
But I can see the logic that you apply to all the things you do, whether it's charity,

304
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:49,580
whether it's being on the board of the Hawthorne Football Club.

305
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,379
Now, I'm going to branch off.

306
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:55,799
I normally, I love, and I could talk to you for hours in a whole range of different directions.

307
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,240
But you sent me an email in preparation for this, Geoff, that I've become a bit obsessed about.

308
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,639
And then this was the headline.

309
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,399
Just sent me one line.

310
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,359
You said some very basic leadership points, Geoff Harris, you may be interested in.

311
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,680
And there's 20 points, Geoff, that to be honest with you, I would describe more as a masterclass

312
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,940
in leadership.

313
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,319
And it's so on point with what this is.

314
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:17,079
This podcast is about empowering leadership, a new range of leadership.

315
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,319
It feels to me as though you're very much ahead of your time.

316
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,240
Now, I asked you beforehand, I said, would you be comfortable in sharing those 20 points?

317
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:25,640
You said, look, it's open source.

318
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,440
I've never really published them.

319
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:31,619
But if you do want to look them up, we will, Geoff's been kind enough, we'll share them

320
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:32,299
in the show notes.

321
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,000
I'll put them out on Instagram, LukeDarcy14.

322
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,920
I'll put them out on LinkedIn as well if Geoff's kind enough to do it.

323
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,680
But Geoff, rather than sort of going through the top 20, but I want to touch on as many

324
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,140
as I can.

325
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,220
Have you got a top five?

326
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:46,059
Have you got a top five of your points on leadership that resonate the most?

327
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,099
Well, I'll have to start off with the mighty hawks, Luke.

328
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,440
How do you feel about that?

329
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:50,539
Are you going to let me talk about that?

330
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,940
I'll give you a couple of minutes.

331
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:53,200
You're on a short leash on that one.

332
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,460
Okay.

333
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:59,220
Because the first one was really, I guess, for any organisation, being it a school, a

334
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:04,119
business, a radio station, whatever it may be, it's setting a clear and compelling vision.

335
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:11,480
And the great lesson or the most successful, succinct vision I'd ever been a part of was

336
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,299
in the Hawthorne Football Club in 2002.

337
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:21,019
In 2004, when Clarko, Alistair Clarkson was appointed as coach, Hawthorne Football Club

338
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:22,019
was second last.

339
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,680
It was losing about a million dollars a year.

340
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,220
One o'clock forward, we won a premiership in 2008.

341
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:33,119
But in 2008, the board then, which I was vice president of, set a vision and it was called

342
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,579
5-2-50.

343
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:37,660
So we hadn't won a premiership in 19 years.

344
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:41,619
We'd had 12,000 members in 2004.

345
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,299
And we'd had 12,000 members in 2004.

346
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:47,940
So the five years was, in five years, 5-2-50, in five years, we wanted to win two premierships

347
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,920
and have 50,000 members.

348
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,180
5-2-50.

349
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,500
People laughed at you at the time.

350
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,119
They laughed at us.

351
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,299
Laughed you out of town.

352
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,299
They laughed us out of town.

353
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:54,960
You've got to be joking.

354
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:56,960
In five years, two premierships, 50,000 members.

355
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:58,680
We set that as our vision.

356
00:18:58,819 --> 00:18:59,299
That was it.

357
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,359
5-2-50.

358
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,299
Everyone knew it.

359
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,900
Every single staff member can understand it.

360
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,440
And we asked anyone, they knew exactly what it was.

361
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,099
We won the premiership that year.

362
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,019
We got to 52,000 members.

363
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:14,240
At the next year.

364
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,119
And we played off Sydney in 2012 at the end of the fifth year.

365
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,480
We were in front 10 minutes ago.

366
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,700
We lost by eight points.

367
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:21,880
And I'm still grimacing about that.

368
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:24,740
But if we had it, and we're at 62,000 members there.

369
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,440
So in five years, we won one premiership, nearly won two.

370
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,240
We achieved our 50,000 members.

371
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,339
That was a very simple vision.

372
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,319
It was compelling.

373
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:35,779
It energized people.

374
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,759
And it raised the bar of success.

375
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:40,400
So I guess my challenge to anyone in any organization,

376
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:42,380
what is your organization's vision?

377
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:43,279
Does it matter?

378
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:44,240
Everyone know it.

379
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:47,700
Has it been set, not by the board in some remote location

380
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,859
and put on a plaque and a foil and no one has any ownership of it,

381
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,900
but does all the teams had a skeletal draft of that vision?

382
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,779
Have they workshopped it?

383
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:56,700
Have they got ownership of it?

384
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,940
And then it comes back and two, up to the board or management team,

385
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:02,539
back to the teams within the organization.

386
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:05,519
And then you set on it and then you'll haul up your flag and go for it.

387
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,500
And then you give all the various divisions, like a membership division,

388
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:12,779
we doubled their resources, increased their advertising and marketing.

389
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:16,839
We gave the footy department more resources, et cetera.

390
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,680
But we knew what we wanted to achieve.

391
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:21,259
And if we had have actually beaten Sydney,

392
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:24,359
that 5-2-50 would have been perfectly implemented.

393
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,140
But it still is the most successful and simple vision

394
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,279
of any organization I've ever been a part of.

395
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,380
And what people who maybe don't follow Australian rules football as closely

396
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,559
as others may not understand is that after that particular vision,

397
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,299
Hawthorne won three premierships in a row and continued on into arguably

398
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,279
the most successful period.

399
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:45,380
And Australian rules football history.

400
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:47,019
And I don't want to jump ahead of your points,

401
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,380
but if I could jump in for a moment because you also appointed Alistair Clarkson

402
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,420
as part of that, who, for those listening,

403
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:56,599
has now etched his name as one of the great modern coaches.

404
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,539
But it was controversial at the time.

405
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:00,579
A lot of people thought he wasn't a fit.

406
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:04,940
And some of your proud Hawthorne past players weren't happy about it.

407
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,619
I mean, was that a hard decision?

408
00:21:06,819 --> 00:21:09,880
Well, I was on the interview committee at that time,

409
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,940
and we'd interviewed Rocket Ede, Gary Ayres,

410
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,619
Dermot Brayton, who were unbelievable footballers.

411
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,500
Terry Wallace might have been.

412
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,720
Terry Wallace was another one.

413
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,059
Terry Wallace.

414
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,220
Sorry, not Dermot Brayton.

415
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:20,680
Terry Wallace.

416
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,359
Dermot was on the committee, I think.

417
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:23,140
Terry Wallace.

418
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,799
All unbelievable football people, very good senior coaches.

419
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:33,140
And he then walked a bloke from Adelaide just about eating a football with passion,

420
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,660
banged the door down with enthusiasm, was left field in his thinking.

421
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,099
But more importantly, the board took the strategic decision to go young on our list.

422
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:43,220
We were going to go.

423
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:45,740
Very deep in the draft with young talent, young men.

424
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,079
So by definition, we need an educator.

425
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:52,220
We need someone who could cut through and teach young men about football and about life.

426
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:55,099
Clarko had an MBA and a teaching degree.

427
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,380
So then it become very clear, as well as him being passionate and a young man who was hungry,

428
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,039
he was the obvious person for the job.

429
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:05,960
So we put him on a short term contract, two years if he can't coach, we can get in a Lee Matthews

430
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,519
or a Terry Wallace or whatever, but he ended up being one of the great coaches of all time.

431
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:13,259
So, but that education factor was fundamental in getting that young

432
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:17,759
group, uh, off to the races that were, and the other thing we did also, I'd been to Kokoda

433
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,259
twice before and I insisted to the board, then one thing you can do to create a greater

434
00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:25,559
spirit of core was to send the entire list off to Kokoda, uh, a 44.

435
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:26,160
And we did that.

436
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,019
And that was fundamental also as part of trying to help create a culture and a, and a rich

437
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:32,640
sort of togetherness amongst the group.

438
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,779
I mean, one of my great life regrets that Jeff, I have to say, uh, I was passionate

439
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:39,579
about the history of Kokoda, had tried to organize a trip.

440
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:42,980
I was playing through that same era, uh, or a little bit before it.

441
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,720
And the club decided it was too risky that the potential to get, you know, malaria and

442
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,519
they knocked it on the head.

443
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:51,500
And I watched the Hawthorne players come back and I know that you were the champion of that

444
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,740
with this great life experience.

445
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:54,119
So I always looked on that with jealousy.

446
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,500
Oh, just to jump in because 0.7 on your list, speaking of Alistair Clarkson, and I encourage

447
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,259
anyone, if you're listening from a small business background, if you're listening from whatever

448
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:09,839
education or leadership space you're in, look up Jeff's 20 points, 0.7, because I referenced

449
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,619
this in relation to Clarko.

450
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:12,819
You say in the list, you said.

451
00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:12,839
Yeah.

452
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,640
You sent me staff are your greatest asset.

453
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:15,200
Bullshit.

454
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:19,039
You say only the right staff, A graders and the right roles are your asset.

455
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,400
Poor performing staff or staff in the wrong roles are your biggest liability.

456
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:27,900
Aces in places, higher on positive attitude, cultural fit, teamwork, determination to succeed

457
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,099
fire on negativity, poor performance, poor values, poor attitude.

458
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,299
As you said to me before we started recording, it's not rocket science, but when you put

459
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:38,819
it down and you're so clear on it, you can create extraordinary results.

460
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,819
Again, going back to Hawthorne footy club example, uh, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000,

461
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:46,200
2004, second last, uh, broke losing a million bucks a year.

462
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:48,779
We, we had 15 people in the football department.

463
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,039
Uh, we got rid of 14 out of the 15.

464
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:58,059
Uh, we had, we, we placed the CEO, the president, uh, half the board, uh, football manager,

465
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:00,359
fitness manager with the best people you can find in the world.

466
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,720
Simply just the best of the best.

467
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,119
Uh, so we had A graders in all the key slots, uh, and we climbed the mountains that were

468
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,240
a wonder flag in four years.

469
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,039
So, so if you're going to have a strong vision, you need A graders to implement that vision.

470
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:12,420
Yeah.

471
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,660
It's a logical next step.

472
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:13,940
Yeah.

473
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,960
And if you've got B graders or someone's a bit negative or doesn't want to be there

474
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,720
as a leader in your organization, you have to make the change.

475
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,759
It'll be expensive with, uh, working conditions in Australia, having to pay people out, but

476
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:28,240
it's much cheaper than those people staying on and affecting the morale of the entire

477
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,740
organization.

478
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,599
If they're not working quite often, they'll be happy for it because they'll know that

479
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,539
they're not the right fit anyway.

480
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:36,880
And practically Jeff, have you done that in your businesses in flight center and all the

481
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,579
other enterprises?

482
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,299
There's, there's many that you've been involved in.

483
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,400
If you see someone's not the right fit, you're quite quick to say.

484
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,380
We're not for you and you're not for us.

485
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,420
Well, certainly, probably not enough in the early days because we're learning, but become

486
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:48,940
obvious later on.

487
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:54,779
I think aces in places or A graders in your key driving slots of the organization, it

488
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:55,779
is a non-negotiable.

489
00:24:56,119 --> 00:25:00,019
So you have your strong vision and then you might have, say the leader of the organization

490
00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:03,859
might have, say six key reports and they are all absolutely A graders in those various

491
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:04,380
disciplines.

492
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:05,500
Brilliant.

493
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:11,240
And then, and then you, you, you, you delegate to the nth degree to those people and let

494
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,799
them get on with it.

495
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,380
You don't micro.

496
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:12,819
Manage.

497
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:13,240
Yeah.

498
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,079
Empower them.

499
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:14,680
Empower them.

500
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,960
To, to, to, to run their role.

501
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:18,500
So I've taken you off the top five of your top 20.

502
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:19,619
What, what's next on your list?

503
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:22,259
Okay.

504
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,420
So, uh, I would go then that, um, number, where are we?

505
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,480
Number, number three really is the, is the, the delegation to those A graders.

506
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,559
And I would, I would, I would equate that with being, if you're, if you're working in

507
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:39,099
a business and then you're appointed as leader, you, let's say you're the leading, one of

508
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:41,960
the leading players in the business or leading part, one of the leading players in a football

509
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,240
team.

510
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,660
I'd equate it to being like a, a, the lead violinist in an orchestra.

511
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,279
You're one of the lead, leading people.

512
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:51,559
Then you're going to go from lead violinist in the orchestra or the team to the conductor.

513
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,180
From the lead violinist to the conductor.

514
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:58,740
So you go from the senior person in the organization to the CEO or the conductor.

515
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:03,559
You, then you need those aces in places that the conductor can wave the baton to.

516
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,019
And then you've got to give those aces in place, the resources to succeed.

517
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,680
They have a formal plan.

518
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:11,500
You have a quarterly, monthly or quarterly one-on-one.

519
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,000
And then hold them to account based on the outcomes you want for those people.

520
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,559
So I think that's probably a pretty good analogy for that one.

521
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:23,259
And how practically in the spaces when you say, you know, holding people to account and

522
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:28,440
quarterly and annual, did you have really set, you know, objections and key results?

523
00:26:28,579 --> 00:26:30,220
Was there, was there a system that you used in that?

524
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,880
Yeah, I think you've got to have for each of those key people, then you've got to have

525
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,460
sort of measurable outcomes that are not subjective bullshit, but objective targets that they

526
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,180
know clearly they have to go.

527
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,380
So if it's a football coach, a lineman.

528
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,240
It's getting blokes from X speed to Y speed or X tackling numbers to Y tackling numbers

529
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,000
within that quarter.

530
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:53,920
Say, whatever the conductor or the leader wants to have improved within that particular

531
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:59,420
discipline, that person working that discipline as team leader has to know clearly what their

532
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,160
tasks are.

533
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:02,460
If they don't, well, they're wandering around like a headless chook.

534
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,460
And then it's up to the leader to hold them accountable, give them the resources that

535
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,259
they've got the tools to do that.

536
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:11,480
And then have the, okay, by next quarter, Luke, I want to see you have.

537
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,799
This, this, and this in place.

538
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,500
Is that okay?

539
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,299
And then you've got a specific plan.

540
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,519
I'll look at the plan to make sure.

541
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:17,539
Yes, I think that's realistic.

542
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,319
You're on the right track.

543
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,420
And then we'll sit down.

544
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,839
You might be in front of two or way behind on one when we have that quarterly meeting.

545
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,200
And then we can reassess that.

546
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,559
I'm not going to whack you over the head and say, okay, well, we're behind on that.

547
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,240
What do you think we can do to catch up on this particular one?

548
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:33,359
Do we need the extra resources from head office or whatever it may be?

549
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:38,740
And you're crystal clear, you know, the communication element I'll come back to, but I've got plenty

550
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,980
I want to jump into, but what's next on your list?

551
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,299
Well, look.

552
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:47,319
I guess fourth was, and again, going back to Clarko, clearly communicating rights and

553
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,660
responsibilities to your team.

554
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:53,920
So discipline, standards, performance, values, punctuality, and teamwork, people crave for

555
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,119
it.

556
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:59,579
And if people are not prepared to follow, then it's FIFO or it's death by a thousand

557
00:27:59,579 --> 00:27:59,900
cuts.

558
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:01,799
FIFO meaning first in, first out.

559
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,559
Fit in or.

560
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,279
Fit in or.

561
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

562
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,019
Or F off.

563
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:06,579
Or F off.

564
00:28:06,579 --> 00:28:10,599
So, and again, I'll use Alistair Clarko as an example.

565
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:16,619
He got all the players down to Kerford Road Beach in his first few weeks on a, running

566
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:17,480
the sand and swimming.

567
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,039
And I think the first morning was six o'clock.

568
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:23,000
The 44 blokes were down there and one bloke was late.

569
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,200
Blokes, I told you about six o'clock.

570
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,740
They did the workout, coming back at five o'clock the next morning.

571
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:30,559
I think legend has it that might've been Shane Crawford who was late.

572
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:30,920
Could have been.

573
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:32,619
I'm not saying anything.

574
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,720
The next morning they get there, they do the workout, two blokes turn up late.

575
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:37,339
Sorry, boys.

576
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,660
We're back at four o'clock tomorrow morning.

577
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:40,259
And some blokes are scratching.

578
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:40,519
He said,

579
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,559
this has got nothing to do with footy.

580
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,119
This is bullshit.

581
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,660
And he gets them all back to the room.

582
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:43,859
He said,

583
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,240
I know it's got nothing to do with football, but it's about punctuality.

584
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:49,039
That was one of my rights and responsibilities, boys.

585
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,900
You have rights, but you've got responsibilities.

586
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:53,940
If I call you a team meeting at nine, you will be there at nine o'clock.

587
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:54,799
Do you understand me?

588
00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:57,779
Or if you've got to go to rehab, you will be there at rehab.

589
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,279
Unlike last year when some blokes weren't turning up to rehab.

590
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,660
So the leader set the rights and responsibilities very clear.

591
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,099
It's like a parent-child relationship.

592
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,779
The kids need to have boundaries.

593
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:10,019
And what I learned when I wasn't tough enough early on,

594
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:10,480
and my leader,

595
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:13,740
if you don't do that, it's death by a thousand cuts.

596
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:15,920
And if the leader doesn't then follow through on that,

597
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,539
and those standards start to slip,

598
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,680
people start to say,

599
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:19,799
what the hell is the boss doing?

600
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,680
So you have to make sure if you're going to set those things,

601
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:25,640
they're reasonable, everyone understands them,

602
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,640
and everyone has buy-in,

603
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,400
and they are implemented and followed through.

604
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:28,960
Because otherwise,

605
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:31,000
if you start having leadings and people turn up late,

606
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:32,759
and you let them turn up late like Brown's cows,

607
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,480
you're whistling Dixie.

608
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,140
Yeah, death by a thousand cuts.

609
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,900
That was your number one point around clearly communicate your rights

610
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,319
and responsibilities.

611
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,039
But when you say that,

612
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:44,519
that unravels if there's not clarity in terms of the boundaries,

613
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:47,180
people are confused in organisations.

614
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,779
Individual and team boundaries, what we stand for as a group.

615
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,859
And some people say, look, that's not fair.

616
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:54,319
Well, obviously it's not for you, this organisation.

617
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,180
I wish you all the best.

618
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,039
We'll support you to get jobs elsewhere.

619
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:58,740
But these are our standards.

620
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,759
And as I said, it's like a parent-child relationship.

621
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,720
We have standards for our kids.

622
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,900
So why wouldn't we have them for our people?

623
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,259
And what I've found is that most people want to work within standards

624
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:08,859
and disciplines.

625
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,259
And they're confused.

626
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:13,079
They're comfortable working in a structured environment

627
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:15,920
whilst having input and flexibility around the edges.

628
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:20,660
But people like having that sense of belonging within some sort of structure.

629
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,180
It can't be totally laissez-faire.

630
00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:23,160
People know the boundary.

631
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,160
You feel comfortable and you can thrive within that environment.

632
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,140
So I've got my list on your list.

633
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,339
So I'll let you keep going.

634
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,420
Well, I guess the fifth one I had underneath those other points was

635
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,700
you've got your A graders in place.

636
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:37,619
You've delegated well.

637
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,779
You've got your rights and responsibilities.

638
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:45,019
And you've set your strategy, and then I've got to spend equal time on the strategy,

639
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:50,240
50% strategy, but 50% execution of practical and communicate endlessly to all staff.

640
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:54,559
I remember an advertising campaign one of the big four banks had about five years ago.

641
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,019
It was on TV and radio.

642
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,539
And customers were complaining when I walked into the bank branches,

643
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,440
the tellers hadn't heard of it.

644
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,700
A classic example of the strategy might have been brilliant, rocket science.

645
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,480
But guess what?

646
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,359
They didn't tell their people.

647
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,940
The execution was appalling.

648
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:13,779
And master's hardware stores come to Australia about five years ago to take on Bunnings.

649
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,660
They adopted the American model to Australia.

650
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,319
The strategy was fine.

651
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,960
Let's take on Bunnings and grow a hardware business in Australia.

652
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:25,859
But the execution, none of them bothered to come out here and test the market in one store under their nose,

653
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,420
say in Melbourne, maybe a couple of stores, fine-tune it from the American model,

654
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,019
the Australian model, test various things, make sure they've got Aussies loving it

655
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:34,660
and they've got the right product mix for Australia.

656
00:31:34,819 --> 00:31:35,440
Didn't do that.

657
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,660
They rolled out 70 stores from day one, and they were losing.

658
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:45,259
I think $75,000 a day, a day per store after five years, because their execution was appalling.

659
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:49,200
So equal time on strategy for those leadership group.

660
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:54,859
And then, so 50% strategy, 50% execution, and talking through the execution,

661
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,799
making it really clear and debating it amongst your team members,

662
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:01,079
the practical side of the execution so it can be executed well.

663
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,380
And when you were up and running in, say, back to the flight centre days,

664
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,220
and you say 50% strategy and the creative time,

665
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,059
have discipline around that 50%.

666
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:14,220
Did you have, literally, allocate time in the week to say,

667
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,160
hey, this is about being creative and innovative?

668
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,240
We broke up the entire 22,000 staff into teams of six and seven,

669
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:28,619
and tribes of 150, based on anthropological studies of, well, I'll talk about this.

670
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:35,880
In 2000, sorry, in 1989, we set up a store in Elizabeth Street.

671
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:38,619
It had 100 square metres.

672
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,319
So I had six staff the first year and made $200,000 profit.

673
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,660
Phones ringing, people lined up.

674
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,980
I said, all I've got to do is double the number of staff.

675
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,259
I'll make $400,000 profit.

676
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:47,740
This is easy.

677
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:51,839
We went to about 12 staff and made $200,000 profit again the next year.

678
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:52,920
Still really busy.

679
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:54,380
We then went to 19 staff.

680
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,279
The profits went down to $120,000.

681
00:32:57,099 --> 00:32:59,900
And at the same time, one of the boys read a book on anthropology.

682
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:05,039
And this is when we'd gone from a start-up to about 2,000 staff.

683
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,960
At the same time, we were getting calls from our staff.

684
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:08,640
We can't do that.

685
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:09,839
We can't contact you like the old days.

686
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:10,779
You're always on a plane.

687
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,259
You're not there like the good old days.

688
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,759
We can speak to you directly.

689
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:22,279
So what, and this book on anthropology talked about American Indians, tribal chiefs of tribes of about 150 people.

690
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:26,740
It talked about Aboriginals hunting and gathering in pods of about, sustainable pods of about 30.

691
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,900
And it talked about mum, dad, and three or four kids was about the right family model.

692
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:34,779
So we broke the company up into family, villages, and tribes.

693
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,200
And so with 1,000 staff.

694
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:52,799
With 1,000 staff, you'd have about seven tribes of 150, each tribe, which is about eight stores, each tribe would have their own general manager, accounting, marketing person, their own flag, their own name, and they'd compete against other tribes.

695
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,059
So in Victoria, there might have been, say, 10 tribes competing against each other.

696
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,819
Each tribe would employ new people.

697
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,180
They'd get them up at the monthly buzz nights, which were for recognition.

698
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,460
And they'd welcome new people to the tribe.

699
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,440
They'd tell their story.

700
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,940
And in that 150, you'd know everyone.

701
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,179
If it's 1,000, you'd listen.

702
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:08,599
You'd lose track.

703
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,280
You don't know who's in your community.

704
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:16,480
So breaking up business into smaller teams also, we found, was fundamentally important.

705
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:22,900
And we found conclusively that any more than seven people in a team had started to break down economically on outputs.

706
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:32,400
So whether it's a board team, a shop team, an accounting team, a radio team, that six or seven should be about the maximum.

707
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:37,780
So even in the end, pre-COVID, we know two years have devastated the travel industry.

708
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,639
And Flight Centre hasn't been immune to that.

709
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:45,440
But 22,000 staff, you're still able to just replicate that seven-team model.

710
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:48,139
And it's served you well, even at that scale.

711
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:48,699
Well, yeah.

712
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:55,619
Well, having said that, Luke, the COVID thing has decimated travel and the tourism industry and hospitality, as you're very well aware.

713
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,079
Very much so.

714
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:03,780
But Flight Centre has managed to hang on and indeed is now very, very busy.

715
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,159
So – and they're trying now to get more people back into the industry.

716
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:08,820
Yeah.

717
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,400
That's the biggest I've tried to find, people.

718
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:21,659
So I'm going to jump around on some of – and as I said earlier, you know, please, you know, if you're listening and Jeff's been kind enough to share these 20 dot points on leadership.

719
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:26,619
And, you know, I look at it as a real masterclass of someone who's spent their life in leadership.

720
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,880
So we'll give you the links of how to look that up.

721
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,539
As I said before, I'll put it out on Instagram, LukeDarcy14.

722
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:32,500
We'll put it in the show notes.

723
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,679
Right down the bottom, point 20, and it leads – have fun.

724
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,079
Be proud of your organisation, your town, your country.

725
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,340
Enjoy the journey and the things that success brings.

726
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,079
You've been a good celebrator along the way.

727
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:47,320
Tell me, you've always – I remember the Flight Centre parties were legendary.

728
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,199
I think I attended a Flight Centre ball at one stage.

729
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:53,179
I got a rogue invitation, which was good fun.

730
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,099
So you see that as being pretty crucial.

731
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:58,139
Well, look, if you can't have fun in business, what's the point in doing it?

732
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,420
And all of us, especially these days with COVID and bloody, you know, wars in the Ukraine or what have you, there's been so much sort of nasty stuff around.

733
00:36:05,659 --> 00:36:07,340
I think we have to sort of get back to the basics.

734
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:08,099
And, you know –

735
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:08,880
Enjoy each other.

736
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:10,739
Enjoy – make sure families have fun.

737
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:17,239
The basics in life, whether it's a little kid or whatever, we just enjoy those simple moments because life's too short not to.

738
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,760
And certainly, we put a lot of emphasis in all the various businesses.

739
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,300
We had award nights, both six-monthly and annually.

740
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,219
At Flight Centre, prior to COVID, we had 3,000 people at our global awards.

741
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,900
So it was – two years ago, it was at Berlin.

742
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,880
3,000 people from all over the world, we flew them to Berlin for five days.

743
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,699
So can you imagine the cost of that?

744
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:51,360
But the cost of not doing it was substantial because that was part of the glue of the culture that people were striving to achieve their outcome because they'd get to Berlin if they achieved their various successes in their businesses.

745
00:36:51,619 --> 00:37:01,119
So I think that's a really important thing, getting incentives in organizations, clear incentives for people, measurable on outcomes, and then having recognition systems commensurate as well.

746
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,159
So you recognize – some people love being recognized.

747
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,599
They don't care about the money or the incentives.

748
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,599
Some people don't care about the recognition.

749
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:09,079
They just want the money or the incentives.

750
00:37:09,219 --> 00:37:20,920
So if you can have very simple incentives in the organization and a very clear and fun recognition system, recognizing people on a great job in front of all the team, those two things are really important to think about.

751
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:26,559
And you think that covers, as you said, people who are remunerated in different ways, aren't they?

752
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,099
As you said, people value different things.

753
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:35,320
You found that system worked well where recognition and financial reward probably covered most people as incentives?

754
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,039
Well, no question.

755
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:37,619
We run a very, very strong program.

756
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:41,059
We have a profit share system at Flight Tennis where everyone was on a profit share in the teams.

757
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,179
And I'll tell you a great story about when we listed the company in 95.

758
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:50,960
So here we were a startup as a startup, and I thought, God, this – and we opened the doors, and that was my last dream to have been involved in my own business.

759
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,780
And that's another thing for all of you out there.

760
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,480
If you want to get involved in the business and you're thinking about it, don't be an old man or an old lady in your rocking chair at 80 saying, I wish I had.

761
00:37:58,519 --> 00:37:59,039
I was a gunner.

762
00:37:59,079 --> 00:37:59,519
I might have.

763
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:04,380
If you want to have a crack, you put the capital aside, you take the risk, and you have a crack.

764
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,260
And if it fails, you've learned.

765
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:07,679
You've won because you've learned.

766
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:11,500
You dust yourself off, and then you go and do something else or have another crack down the track.

767
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:13,300
But don't not have a crack because that is a failure.

768
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,559
Where were we, Luke?

769
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:15,739
Sorry.

770
00:38:15,739 --> 00:38:16,420
That's a great point.

771
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:23,599
Well, I think that's another one of your points, and I love it because so many people – I'm passionate about the small business space, Jeff, as well.

772
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,900
And you take on some risks.

773
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:30,619
You take a few deep gulps, and you're inevitably going to fail at some stage, or it's not always successful.

774
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:31,820
You mentioned the hospitality industry.

775
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,000
We've been in for a long period of time.

776
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:36,679
You have – but the joy of being able to create something yourself.

777
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,679
So I love hearing people.

778
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:40,019
I love hearing people like you say, have a go, you know.

779
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,980
And clearly, you would have had – in the numerous things you've done, some haven't.

780
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:51,099
Is there an example of one that you could say, I back this idea in just to humanize your story, Jeff, because it is full of success?

781
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:51,659
Was there one that –

782
00:38:51,659 --> 00:38:52,699
We've only got an hour, haven't we?

783
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,000
Of course.

784
00:38:54,159 --> 00:39:01,480
Look, people are going to make mistakes, but I guess what I'm saying, if you're looking at doing something for the first time, I'll take a step back to the flights in a day.

785
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,559
I've met some guys in London who I knew were very good.

786
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:05,559
They'd run top-debt travel.

787
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,679
We were talking about a concept here in Australia.

788
00:39:07,699 --> 00:39:09,559
I knew – I was committed.

789
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:10,699
I was committed.

790
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,460
I knew that it'd work.

791
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,320
I'd put some money aside.

792
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,619
If I'd lost that, it wasn't the end of the earth, what did I have to lose?

793
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:21,500
I was 28, energy, passion.

794
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,639
It didn't matter.

795
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:23,619
Would it have been a learning curve?

796
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:26,360
So I think if you're providing – you're not going to sell the farm, as it were.

797
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,679
You've still got some assets elsewhere.

798
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,519
You put that money aside, you devote two or three years of your life, and you have a go because you'll regret it if you don't.

799
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:36,079
Life's too short not to.

800
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,579
So I think that's really important.

801
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:42,760
Everyone out there – and Australians are as good as anyone in the world, I can assure every one of you out there.

802
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,380
We said – I remember going to London, setting up shops, Canada, South Africa.

803
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,300
We can eat – America.

804
00:39:49,699 --> 00:39:51,739
I mean, jeez, we're so far in front of the X.

805
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:57,719
Aussies are as can-do and as good as anyone in the world, so do not discount what you can achieve.

806
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,659
Point eight on your list is Mandela's leadership legacy.

807
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:11,820
Take on your base when needed, i.e. Invictus.

808
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,860
Leaders' courage to change.

809
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:14,900
That's what I'm talking about.

810
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,420
Conventional wisdom.

811
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,880
What are you referencing there?

812
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:19,460
Invictus is one of the great movies.

813
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:24,820
Nelson Mandela – and we had 150 stores in South Africa, so I know that story over there pretty well.

814
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:29,280
We set up before Mandela was – whilst he was still in jail.

815
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:35,860
It was either going to be a civil war when he got out or tourism was going to grow dramatically because they were going to release all the embargoes due to apartheid.

816
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,139
We invested prior to Mandela was released, and it ended up being a fantastic, successful business, flights into South Africa.

817
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,059
But what I'm saying there is that Mandela and his presidency –

818
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:46,900
Black South Africans

819
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,219
Their passion was soccer

820
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:50,179
That was their sport

821
00:40:50,179 --> 00:40:52,079
The white man's sport was rugby

822
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,420
That was the Africana sport

823
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:57,539
The people that had terribly abused Black South Africans

824
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:00,039
And given them no chance in the social systems

825
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:01,800
Whatever due to apartheid or separate development

826
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,659
Mandela said to his Black African base

827
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:07,619
I want us to go to the Rugby World Cup

828
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:09,179
And I want to hand out the cup

829
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:11,440
And I want to back our rugby team

830
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,800
And his base said to him

831
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,500
You cannot do that, Madiba, leader

832
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,380
We are soccer people

833
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,219
And we don't have nothing to do with those white guys who have trashed us

834
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:21,219
And Mandela said

835
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:24,179
We have to reconcile this country and bring everyone together

836
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:26,559
So the leader took on his base

837
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:28,800
And then he converted his base

838
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,539
And sold them the vision of

839
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:31,519
We are all going to be

840
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:32,719
For South Africa to work

841
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:35,699
The whole of South Africa had to be together

842
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:36,880
And he was there

843
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,159
He handed over the cup to Francois Pinoir

844
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:42,559
The Afrikaans

845
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:45,780
White man who was Afrikaners

846
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,480
Were the people who were doing all sorts of things

847
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,219
Unfortunately to Black Africans

848
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:50,880
South Africans

849
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,500
He handed over the cup to him

850
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,900
And that was a fundamental moment

851
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,300
And white South Africans were cheering that Black president

852
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,019
Because he did that

853
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:01,340
So the moral of the story is

854
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,940
It's up for you as a leader

855
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,780
If you know something is wrong

856
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,659
Or your industry or your government

857
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:09,260
Or your business is going in the wrong direction

858
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,480
You have to have the courage to change that conventional wisdom

859
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:12,539
And you have to have the courage to change that conventional wisdom

860
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:14,480
And go left when everyone else is going right

861
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,239
And prosecute your case

862
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:18,800
So that was Mandela's leadership legacy to me

863
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,320
Yeah I'm not sure why my mind

864
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,079
As you're saying that

865
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:24,219
How can you compare to Nelson Mandela

866
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:26,099
And what he did in that moment

867
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:27,980
As you said to have the vision to understand

868
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,219
That that was going to unite the country

869
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:31,699
And don't often reference politics

870
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:33,719
But what John Howard did

871
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:34,880
Taking on his base

872
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,659
When we had the tragedy down in Port Arthur

873
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:40,639
And his people didn't want

874
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:42,460
A ban on

875
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,860
Guns and automatic weapons

876
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,579
And to me that was an incredible bit of leadership as well

877
00:42:46,579 --> 00:42:47,480
Politically to say

878
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,860
Hey this is the right thing to do

879
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,340
And you think of what happens in other parts of the world around that

880
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,360
Sometimes you've got to educate your own base around

881
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,860
What is right and what is wrong

882
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,579
It's called leadership

883
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:58,920
And it's very difficult to do

884
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,139
But I think you have to have

885
00:43:00,139 --> 00:43:03,599
Once you've got a particular mindset

886
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,639
That you fervently believe in

887
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:06,820
That's the leader's role

888
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,219
It's not about being popular

889
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,739
Sometimes it's about taking people where they should be

890
00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:12,380
Not where they want to be

891
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,320
And that's the leader's job

892
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,440
To navigate their people under them

893
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,579
Be it a politician or a leader

894
00:43:18,579 --> 00:43:21,199
And explain the reasons why we're going where you should be

895
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,420
Not where you want to be now

896
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,139
Because this would be better for us as an organisation or as a country

897
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:27,079
Takes great courage Jeff

898
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:29,239
Part of what we've been doing in the work

899
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,099
At a leader I was talking to you about

900
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:32,099
Before we started today

901
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,559
Is seeing these traits that we see great leaders

902
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:36,539
Like you ahead of your time

903
00:43:36,539 --> 00:43:38,139
But modern leaders are really

904
00:43:38,139 --> 00:43:40,639
Identifying with similar traits

905
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:41,739
And that's why I was

906
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,440
So fascinated in your 20 point document

907
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,639
And I keep referencing

908
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:47,400
And there's going to be a lot of crossover here

909
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,019
But I'm going to ask you a series of questions

910
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:50,559
We've been asking all the leaders on the podcast

911
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:51,739
And so please expand

912
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:53,880
And I'm sure it overlays with some of your

913
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,300
We see leaders really

914
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,880
Are clear on their own sense of self-leadership

915
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,860
What does that term mean to you?

916
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,599
Self-leadership

917
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:04,280
I feel almost embarrassed

918
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,559
I don't feel like a leader at all

919
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,960
I guess it's how others perceive you really

920
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,320
I really don't know how to answer that Luke

921
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:11,980
Because as I said

922
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,360
Other school leaders don't know how to answer that

923
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,880
So I'm not formally educated in leadership

924
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,800
I think it's more just being

925
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,780
Totally honest and transparent with people

926
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,719
Doing the right things

927
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:24,300
What comes around goes around

928
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,760
And people will see through you

929
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,380
If you're not genuine

930
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,360
And you're not communicating directly

931
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,380
And honestly with them

932
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,300
And as I said

933
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,099
And have their backs as well

934
00:44:36,099 --> 00:44:37,760
That's the basics really

935
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,820
It's hard for me to explain

936
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,480
Jeff you know I find that fascinating

937
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,360
And it has been

938
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,059
A common response

939
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:44,980
With people like you

940
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,659
Who clearly have had

941
00:44:45,659 --> 00:44:46,699
An extraordinary life of leadership

942
00:44:46,699 --> 00:44:47,679
The humility to say

943
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:49,400
I don't see myself as a leader

944
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,659
But as I asked that question

945
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:51,639
I look at some of your

946
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:53,860
Points on your document

947
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,420
Point nine

948
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,340
Leaders must radiate

949
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:55,900
Optimism

950
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,559
Enthusiasm

951
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:57,420
A can-do spirit

952
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,039
Point ten

953
00:44:58,039 --> 00:44:59,239
Leaders must raise the bar

954
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:00,199
Lift expectations

955
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:02,159
Set a clear and compelling vision

956
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:04,000
So many of the things

957
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,300
That you clearly have done

958
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:05,860
Throughout your life

959
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,059
Can I mention that point

960
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:08,380
In a clear life example

961
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,800
Again this was Jeff Kennedy

962
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,400
Who's president

963
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,360
And Jeff you know

964
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:11,920
He's got people

965
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,820
People love him

966
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,400
People hate him

967
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,059
But he was a crash through leader

968
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:15,780
As a politician

969
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,960
And I remember in 2008

970
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,860
When he was president

971
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:19,559
Of Hawthorne Football Club

972
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:20,199
I was next to him

973
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:20,780
As vice president

974
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,460
On a board meeting

975
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,420
And we'd won the first

976
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,500
Nine games that year

977
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,179
The Hawks

978
00:45:25,179 --> 00:45:26,119
Great Luke

979
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:26,739
It was fantastic

980
00:45:26,739 --> 00:45:30,519
And we had the youngest

981
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,219
Listen to com

982
00:45:31,219 --> 00:45:34,019
And conventional wisdom was

983
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:34,800
Geelong was going to win

984
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,380
The grand final

985
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:35,840
Because they'd won

986
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,440
The previous year

987
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,519
In 2007 if you remember

988
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:39,119
And they had the oldest list

989
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,139
Most experienced

990
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:41,900
Most successful team

991
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,400
Around but

992
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,320
All the media

993
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,139
Was saying Geelong's going to win

994
00:45:44,139 --> 00:45:45,739
So we'd won the first nine

995
00:45:45,739 --> 00:45:47,199
And Clarko and Chris Fagan

996
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:48,059
The footy manager at the time

997
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:48,960
Come in for a board meeting

998
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,420
To report

999
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,559
On one of our monthly board meetings

1000
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:51,679
And Jeff was there

1001
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:52,300
At the end of the table

1002
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,239
And they're doing the report

1003
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:54,639
On nine zip

1004
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:55,940
And all of a sudden

1005
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:56,559
Jeff

1006
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:58,320
He's fidgeting with his papers

1007
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,679
And he bangs the table

1008
00:45:59,679 --> 00:45:59,960
And he says

1009
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,099
Okay I've heard it all

1010
00:46:01,099 --> 00:46:02,179
What do we need

1011
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:03,000
To win the premiership

1012
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,480
And we all sort of

1013
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,000
Looked at each other

1014
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,199
And he said

1015
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:07,019
What resources

1016
00:46:07,019 --> 00:46:07,900
Do you need extra

1017
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,739
This is our year

1018
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:10,320
To win the flag

1019
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:10,980
We might never get

1020
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:11,559
That opportunity

1021
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:11,900
But we've got to win

1022
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,960
How are we going to do it boys

1023
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,380
What extra resources

1024
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:14,679
Do you need

1025
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:15,099
So he said

1026
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:16,340
Do you need any other physios

1027
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,380
Whatever you need

1028
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,539
We will supply it

1029
00:46:19,539 --> 00:46:20,639
But this is our year

1030
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:21,500
To win the premiership

1031
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,119
I expect us to win it

1032
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:23,539
So

1033
00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:24,340
And it was sort of

1034
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,420
Not exactly that language

1035
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:25,619
But

1036
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:27,719
The moral of the story was

1037
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:29,420
The leader raised the bar

1038
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,039
The leader raised the bar

1039
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:31,340
And us

1040
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:31,800
Me and Mort

1041
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,360
Were looking around

1042
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:32,940
Well shit

1043
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,559
We're not competing

1044
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:34,119
For the premiership

1045
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:35,099
Now we are expected

1046
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:36,380
To win the premiership

1047
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,820
So what that did was

1048
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,000
The leadership group

1049
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,519
In the football department

1050
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:41,280
The players

1051
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,900
Took it apart

1052
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,400
Upon themselves

1053
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,039
To get in

1054
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:44,460
Stuart Chu

1055
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,579
Who'd been with

1056
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:46,320
Port Adelaide

1057
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,420
In the grand final

1058
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:47,719
And said

1059
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:49,239
We're expected to win

1060
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:49,559
The premiership

1061
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:50,340
We think we can win

1062
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,099
The premiership now

1063
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,079
We're not just competing

1064
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,980
Because the favourites

1065
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:54,440
Are going to win

1066
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,559
What do we need

1067
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:56,260
To win the premiership

1068
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,599
And so all that sort of

1069
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:58,460
Stuff started to happen

1070
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,659
And we won the flag

1071
00:46:59,659 --> 00:47:01,099
So the moral of the story

1072
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:01,780
Is the leader

1073
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,099
Has to set the tone

1074
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:04,000
In terms of where

1075
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,900
The organisation's going

1076
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,440
And that goes

1077
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,219
It was fantastic

1078
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:07,619
It was really a wonderful

1079
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:08,239
Bit of leadership

1080
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:09,719
How did the coach respond

1081
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:10,639
Across the board table

1082
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:11,000
To that

1083
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,760
Because that's a delicate

1084
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,739
Relationship at times

1085
00:47:12,739 --> 00:47:13,260
Well it was

1086
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,019
But I think Clarke

1087
00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:15,199
Was a fantastic coach

1088
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,000
And leader in many ways

1089
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,539
But sometimes

1090
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:16,960
They're that

1091
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,719
Imbued in the fog of battle

1092
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:20,880
It's hard to look

1093
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,760
Above the parapet

1094
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,659
So I think

1095
00:47:22,659 --> 00:47:23,559
Someone clearly

1096
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:25,219
Setting the expectations

1097
00:47:25,219 --> 00:47:26,360
And the fact that

1098
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,500
Yes you are good enough

1099
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,000
Coach yes

1100
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,980
We have the player list

1101
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:29,920
And these boys

1102
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,599
These young boys

1103
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:31,260
Might never get

1104
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:31,920
An opportunity

1105
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,500
You know

1106
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,960
We have to seize the moment

1107
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,480
That was a mantra

1108
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,079
Seize the moment

1109
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:37,739
So I think that was

1110
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:38,739
Yeah that was wonderful

1111
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:39,500
And one of the great

1112
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,679
Grand final wins

1113
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:41,480
That was fantastic

1114
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,860
We see leaders

1115
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,820
Are really conscious

1116
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,820
About how they positively

1117
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:47,460
Impact others

1118
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,480
And I mentioned this before

1119
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,380
The amount of people

1120
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,260
That I've heard

1121
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,920
That have spoken about you

1122
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,019
In a life changing way

1123
00:47:54,019 --> 00:47:55,000
I mean

1124
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,139
Have you consciously

1125
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:56,940
Thought about

1126
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,719
How you positively

1127
00:47:57,719 --> 00:47:58,460
Impact others

1128
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,920
Not really

1129
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,579
I mean I've just been

1130
00:48:00,579 --> 00:48:01,179
Pretty lucky

1131
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:01,480
I suppose

1132
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,360
I guess the only

1133
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,360
The only other message

1134
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,000
I can put there

1135
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,380
Is that if doors open

1136
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,199
And you can see

1137
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:07,000
A positive there

1138
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,920
And that door being open

1139
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,900
You've got to have a crack

1140
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,780
And walk through the door

1141
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,199
Yeah

1142
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:11,440
Because

1143
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:11,920
, you know

1144
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,300
Life's too short not to

1145
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,039
So don't

1146
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:15,440
Don't discount your ability

1147
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,840
Whatever station you are in life

1148
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,420
Doesn't matter if you haven't

1149
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:18,000
Got a degree

1150
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,579
Or you're not

1151
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:19,619
On the right side of town

1152
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:20,820
With your black, white

1153
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:21,340
Pink

1154
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,400
With pink spots

1155
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,139
Male or female

1156
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:23,820
It doesn't matter

1157
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,079
If the door opens

1158
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:25,639
For an opportunity

1159
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:26,619
Have a crack

1160
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:28,119
Because you just don't know

1161
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:28,780
Where that can lead

1162
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,179
And if that

1163
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:30,539
If I look back on anything

1164
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:31,019
That was

1165
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:31,940
When I decided

1166
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,699
To have a crack

1167
00:48:32,699 --> 00:48:33,739
With Graham and Bill

1168
00:48:33,739 --> 00:48:34,360
And Flight Centre

1169
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,760
We walked through the door

1170
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,500
We risked everything

1171
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,800
And that was

1172
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,079
You know prior to

1173
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:40,000
In the first Gulf War

1174
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,739
In 1990

1175
00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:41,420
To put this into

1176
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:41,900
Perspective

1177
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,519
And taking a risk

1178
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:43,760
That was when

1179
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,079
George Bush the Elder

1180
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:45,739
Was bombing

1181
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:47,340
Saddam Hussein

1182
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,280
In Iraq

1183
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,699
Because Iraq

1184
00:48:49,699 --> 00:48:50,679
Had invaded Kuwait

1185
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:51,619
And there was

1186
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:52,659
A live war

1187
00:48:52,659 --> 00:48:53,199
On CNN

1188
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:54,199
For the first time

1189
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:55,019
Where bombs were dropping

1190
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:56,340
We had about

1191
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,440
500 shops

1192
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,000
At that stage

1193
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,920
A privately owned company

1194
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,820
Prior to listing

1195
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,440
And it was like

1196
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,039
A run on the banks

1197
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:02,880
People were queued up

1198
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,639
To get refunds

1199
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:04,460
So all they're doing

1200
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:06,179
Is getting refunds

1201
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:07,239
We lost about

1202
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:07,920
300 grand

1203
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,139
In that November

1204
00:49:09,139 --> 00:49:10,440
Another 300 grand

1205
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:10,980
In December

1206
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,420
We had

1207
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,260
200,000 of cash

1208
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:13,960
Left in the bank

1209
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,559
We had a million dollars

1210
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:16,079
Overdraft

1211
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:16,880
Which was maxed out

1212
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,079
Our dogs, cats, wives

1213
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,000
Houses mortgaged

1214
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,579
So everything

1215
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:21,099
Mortgaged

1216
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:21,539
A million dollars

1217
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:21,900
Overdraft

1218
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,179
And I sat down

1219
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:23,960
At the kitchen table

1220
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,960
When that war was on

1221
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,380
All of our shop leases

1222
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,300
We had 56 million dollars

1223
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,480
Of personal guarantees

1224
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,699
On shop leases

1225
00:49:30,699 --> 00:49:31,400
To shopping centres

1226
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,139
You know five years

1227
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:33,719
$50,000 a year

1228
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:34,460
250,000

1229
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,280
Buy all those shops

1230
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,519
56 million bucks

1231
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:37,239
Of personal guarantees

1232
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:37,800
A million dollars

1233
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,139
Overdraft

1234
00:49:38,139 --> 00:49:39,239
200 grand cash

1235
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:39,980
Or about a week's

1236
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:40,420
Cash to go

1237
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,400
So we had

1238
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,340
That's stress

1239
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,119
But

1240
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,000
We

1241
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,519
We

1242
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:45,320
We

1243
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:45,679
We

1244
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:46,800
Oh and another

1245
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,460
Moral of the story

1246
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,280
Is so the shit

1247
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:48,719
Excuse me

1248
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:49,460
The proverbial

1249
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,039
Had hit the fan

1250
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:52,639
And Thomas Cook

1251
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,000
In Europe

1252
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,460
Had sacked

1253
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,179
About 20%

1254
00:49:54,179 --> 00:49:54,840
Of their workforce

1255
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,760
Because this war

1256
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,280
Was going on

1257
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,280
Staff were coming

1258
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:57,800
Out and saying

1259
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,920
Is our job safe

1260
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,639
Yes your job's safe

1261
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:02,000
All the other companies

1262
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,940
Are cutting staff

1263
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,000
So we said

1264
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,880
Your jobs are safe

1265
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,059
We then had

1266
00:50:06,059 --> 00:50:06,880
Town hall meetings

1267
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,800
In various states

1268
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,619
And we got all our staff

1269
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:09,900
And said

1270
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,159
We need your ideas

1271
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:11,539
And how we're going

1272
00:50:11,539 --> 00:50:12,280
To trade out of this

1273
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,579
We will guarantee

1274
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:14,360
Your jobs are safe

1275
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,480
No one's going to get the boot

1276
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,639
We're all in this together

1277
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:17,900
We either all sink together

1278
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,739
Or we all prosper together

1279
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:21,320
But everyone's job is safe

1280
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,820
We invited the teams

1281
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:23,380
To go back

1282
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,420
Discuss ideas

1283
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,780
And how they can trade better

1284
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:26,599
Make more

1285
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:27,980
And try to bridge that loss

1286
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,960
So we can last longer

1287
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,559
Because we were very transparent

1288
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:30,780
We said

1289
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,539
Here's the state of our books

1290
00:50:32,539 --> 00:50:33,639
Here's how much money

1291
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:34,219
We've got left

1292
00:50:34,219 --> 00:50:35,360
We've got everything

1293
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:35,760
Mortgaged

1294
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,940
We cannot do anymore

1295
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:37,420
As directors

1296
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,039
We've put everything

1297
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:38,579
On the hock

1298
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:40,739
We need to somehow

1299
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:41,139
Get out of this

1300
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:42,820
They come back

1301
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:43,739
To us with a bunch of ideas

1302
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:44,059
And we had

1303
00:50:44,059 --> 00:50:45,320
Like a South Melbourne store

1304
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:45,699
Come to me

1305
00:50:45,699 --> 00:50:45,820
And said

1306
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:46,460
Can we operate

1307
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,699
They had six staff

1308
00:50:48,699 --> 00:50:49,360
Nine to five

1309
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,280
Monday to Friday

1310
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,019
And nine to twelve

1311
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:52,800
On Saturdays

1312
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,500
Can we work shifts

1313
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,360
Can someone start at twelve

1314
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:55,980
Finish at eight

1315
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,239
Can someone work on weekends

1316
00:50:57,239 --> 00:50:58,400
Wednesday, Thursday

1317
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:58,860
And Friday

1318
00:50:58,860 --> 00:50:59,739
Because they had kids

1319
00:50:59,739 --> 00:51:00,239
Blah, blah, blah

1320
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:02,099
That opened the store

1321
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:03,199
Another thirty-two hours

1322
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:03,739
For that week

1323
00:51:03,739 --> 00:51:04,360
Because they were working

1324
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:04,800
On shifts

1325
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,619
So they went from

1326
00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:07,360
Forty-two hours

1327
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,940
To another thirty-odd hours

1328
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:10,500
Opening

1329
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,000
Yeah

1330
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:11,739
It's on their input

1331
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:12,380
Their idea

1332
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,699
If we'd have told them

1333
00:51:13,699 --> 00:51:14,079
We would have opened

1334
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:14,760
Another thirty-odd hours a week

1335
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,239
They would have laughed

1336
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:15,500
Yeah

1337
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,000
So we had all these ideas

1338
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,280
Of their ownership

1339
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,659
On how they could

1340
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:20,920
How we could survive

1341
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,960
And we put them all

1342
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,380
In a pot

1343
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:22,920
And gave everyone

1344
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,599
Those ideas

1345
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:24,699
Within

1346
00:51:24,699 --> 00:51:26,280
About a week

1347
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,280
The war was finished

1348
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,619
And we had

1349
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:29,679
Incredible

1350
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:31,039
March, April, May

1351
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:32,119
June record profits

1352
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:33,380
But what we had

1353
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,239
Is everyone knew

1354
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:35,000
We had their back

1355
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,860
And that's when

1356
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:36,519
We won the employer

1357
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:36,900
Of the year

1358
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,699
For the next three years

1359
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:39,059
We'd created a cult

1360
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:40,539
We didn't realise it

1361
00:51:40,539 --> 00:51:41,480
Because those people knew

1362
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,380
That whatever happened

1363
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,139
We were there for them

1364
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:45,019
But we got their input

1365
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:46,139
So when the proverbial

1366
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:46,699
Hits the fan

1367
00:51:46,699 --> 00:51:47,420
In your organisation

1368
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,699
You go to your people

1369
00:51:48,699 --> 00:51:48,860
And say

1370
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:49,760
How can we dig ourselves

1371
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,300
Out of the hole

1372
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,019
And you're absolutely up front

1373
00:51:52,019 --> 00:51:53,400
You're totally transparent

1374
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,659
With whatever's going on

1375
00:51:54,659 --> 00:51:56,239
They knew the state of play

1376
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:57,119
They just

1377
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,619
They knew we'd given

1378
00:51:58,619 --> 00:51:59,420
Everything to it

1379
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,780
But we needed them

1380
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,039
For their IP

1381
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:02,719
Their knowledge

1382
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,380
Their feedback

1383
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,300
The brilliance of that

1384
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,739
Is Stan

1385
00:52:06,739 --> 00:52:07,099
I love

1386
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:07,960
One of your points

1387
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,099
Is about total transparency

1388
00:52:09,099 --> 00:52:09,519
On everything

1389
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:10,380
And you've lived your life

1390
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,199
That way

1391
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:11,820
But I often

1392
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:12,239
You know

1393
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:13,320
In the commercial places

1394
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,900
That I've been exposed to

1395
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,559
You often see

1396
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:17,000
These great ideas

1397
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,440
But people are never asked

1398
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:18,920
They're never

1399
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,260
It's only a small group

1400
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,119
In effectively

1401
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:22,860
The leadership group

1402
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,239
That tend to hold

1403
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:24,960
All the ideas

1404
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,239
So it seems

1405
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:26,900
A great lesson

1406
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,340
You know

1407
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:28,739
To give everyone

1408
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:29,800
A voice in their environment

1409
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,519
For a start

1410
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:31,539
It empowers people

1411
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:32,679
To want to make a deal

1412
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:33,059
As you said

1413
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:33,960
Suddenly staff are saying

1414
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,539
How can we work more for you

1415
00:52:35,539 --> 00:52:36,019
Without more

1416
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:36,579
Exactly

1417
00:52:36,579 --> 00:52:37,420
When I'm talking about

1418
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,360
That vision thing before

1419
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,079
I mean we provided

1420
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:40,159
Everyone with a skeletal

1421
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:41,059
Draft of what we thought

1422
00:52:41,059 --> 00:52:41,619
It could be

1423
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:42,679
And then we got amongst

1424
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:43,900
All the teams debating

1425
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:44,619
And then they added

1426
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,360
Meat to the bone

1427
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,019
Of the skeletals

1428
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:47,019
So they had ownership

1429
00:52:47,019 --> 00:52:47,539
Yeah

1430
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,659
But we led them to water

1431
00:52:48,659 --> 00:52:49,679
With a skeleton draft

1432
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:50,579
And then they

1433
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:51,440
They cobbled it together

1434
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,280
All those good ideas

1435
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:52,820
Come together

1436
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:53,659
So everyone

1437
00:52:53,659 --> 00:52:54,340
Owned that vision

1438
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,079
It's the same thing

1439
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:55,420
What happened

1440
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,380
At flight centers

1441
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:56,980
And so I guess

1442
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,280
If everything's not doing well

1443
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,059
It's having your entire team

1444
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:01,260
Together trying to come up

1445
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:01,559
With ideas

1446
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:02,179
And how you can

1447
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,579
Once you're totally

1448
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:04,739
Transparent with what's happening

1449
00:53:04,739 --> 00:53:06,239
Then they own the problem

1450
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:07,000
And then they can come up

1451
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:07,619
Help you

1452
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:08,219
The leader

1453
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:09,699
Come up with better ideas

1454
00:53:09,699 --> 00:53:10,639
Well that was the next dimension

1455
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:11,559
The leadership wanted to ask you

1456
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:12,579
About how do you go about

1457
00:53:12,579 --> 00:53:13,619
Creating and sharing your vision

1458
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:14,480
I don't think you can get

1459
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,000
A better story than that

1460
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,079
Of what you just told

1461
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:18,119
You told the Hawthorne story

1462
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:18,920
Beautifully about

1463
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,559
Really crystal clear vision

1464
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:20,860
I mean

1465
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:21,960
Is that applied in

1466
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:22,960
In everything

1467
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,019
In your personal life

1468
00:53:24,019 --> 00:53:25,099
In your charity space

1469
00:53:25,099 --> 00:53:25,480
Is it

1470
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,099
We always tried to

1471
00:53:27,099 --> 00:53:28,719
Going back to my flights

1472
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:29,420
In the days we had

1473
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:30,719
Personal goal setting

1474
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:31,360
In the early days

1475
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,539
For all of us

1476
00:53:32,539 --> 00:53:33,699
Had an A4 sheet

1477
00:53:33,699 --> 00:53:34,940
With our business goals

1478
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,000
And then we developed that

1479
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,900
For personal goals

1480
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:37,579
For everyone as well

1481
00:53:37,579 --> 00:53:38,460
When we did one-on-ones

1482
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:39,440
And then that

1483
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:39,679
More

1484
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:40,159
We morphed into

1485
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:41,039
Two things we did

1486
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:42,099
Which were really successful

1487
00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:43,400
We set up a thing called

1488
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,699
Money-wise and health-wise

1489
00:53:44,699 --> 00:53:46,780
So the money-wise thing was

1490
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:48,119
In your personal goals

1491
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:48,800
We want to see

1492
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,219
How you're going financially

1493
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:52,199
So you know

1494
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:53,539
Luke you're investing in shares

1495
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:54,300
Or you've got any real estate

1496
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:54,460
Whatever

1497
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,239
So the money-wise thing

1498
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:57,079
We hired some

1499
00:53:57,079 --> 00:53:58,500
Financial planners

1500
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,480
That the company did

1501
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,480
And their job was

1502
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,239
To do a one-on-one

1503
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:01,880
Every six months

1504
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,820
With every staff member

1505
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,380
So it's fine to earn that

1506
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,179
X dollars a year

1507
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:07,460
How are you investing

1508
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,079
Saving

1509
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,579
What does that share

1510
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:09,659
Make you

1511
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,039
What does that real estate mean

1512
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:11,739
What's a

1513
00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:13,300
All those things

1514
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,539
Coaching them on those things

1515
00:54:14,539 --> 00:54:15,679
And then we

1516
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:16,840
And then that developed

1517
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,840
From money-wise

1518
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,059
We set up health-wise

1519
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:19,980
So every head office

1520
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:20,800
We put in a gym

1521
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,219
We did a one-on-one

1522
00:54:22,219 --> 00:54:22,860
Every six months

1523
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:23,760
For their health planning

1524
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,360
With blood pressure

1525
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,519
Doctors checks

1526
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:27,599
If they needed it

1527
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:28,860
All those sorts of things

1528
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,099
So those two things

1529
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:30,420
And then

1530
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,699
And one of our

1531
00:54:31,699 --> 00:54:32,860
Our very loud

1532
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,039
Female store managers

1533
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:34,539
In Brisbane

1534
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:35,539
Then set up another division

1535
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:36,579
Called Naughty Wives

1536
00:54:36,579 --> 00:54:38,219
So all the stories

1537
00:54:38,219 --> 00:54:38,900
From conferences

1538
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,579
Were published

1539
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:41,480
We sort of turned a blind eye

1540
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,099
And looked the other way

1541
00:54:42,099 --> 00:54:42,400
From that

1542
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,739
But the health-wise

1543
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:44,599
And money-wise things

1544
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:46,019
Were personal coaching

1545
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:48,000
On people's personal lives

1546
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,699
And that had a big impact

1547
00:54:49,699 --> 00:54:51,079
And they were in-house programs

1548
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:51,739
They were in-house programs

1549
00:54:51,739 --> 00:54:52,380
Totally fun

1550
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,019
And what have you

1551
00:54:53,019 --> 00:54:54,420
And even that

1552
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,139
And interestingly

1553
00:54:55,139 --> 00:54:55,920
That health-wise

1554
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,260
Developed into a business

1555
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,360
Active travel

1556
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,260
Which does

1557
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,460
Organises marathons

1558
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,599
Because there's so many flights

1559
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:01,960
And the people

1560
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,820
Are then booking

1561
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:03,699
Into half marathons

1562
00:55:03,699 --> 00:55:04,199
And marathons

1563
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:04,679
We organise

1564
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:05,940
We set up a separate company

1565
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:06,579
To book marathons

1566
00:55:06,579 --> 00:55:07,099
At Berlin

1567
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:08,739
Blah blah blah blah

1568
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:09,559
And London etc

1569
00:55:09,579 --> 00:55:10,659
I love it

1570
00:55:10,659 --> 00:55:11,139
Incredible

1571
00:55:11,139 --> 00:55:12,280
We see leaders

1572
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,400
Who are really curious

1573
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,940
And through that lens

1574
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:16,920
That's how they approach

1575
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,800
Their learning and development

1576
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,480
And point 18

1577
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,440
On your list

1578
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,579
Probably sums this up

1579
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:20,719
Jeff

1580
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:21,039
I'll ask you

1581
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:21,760
Leaders are readers

1582
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,000
They seek out new ideas

1583
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,579
By learning off

1584
00:55:24,579 --> 00:55:25,579
Other successful people

1585
00:55:25,579 --> 00:55:26,980
Find a mentor

1586
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,199
How do you think

1587
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,079
About curiosity

1588
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:30,039
In that space

1589
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:30,559
Well that's

1590
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,500
It's fantastic

1591
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:31,980
I mean

1592
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,099
I've tried to read

1593
00:55:34,099 --> 00:55:35,239
I read that

1594
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:36,679
Barack Obama

1595
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:38,039
Had his

1596
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:38,800
New resolution

1597
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:39,500
Two years ago

1598
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,579
Reading a book

1599
00:55:40,579 --> 00:55:41,400
Every month

1600
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,760
So I've adopted that

1601
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,079
So I lock myself away

1602
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:45,800
Every second or third night

1603
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,260
In the study

1604
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,780
And I read for about

1605
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,460
Half an hour

1606
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:50,559
And the current book

1607
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:50,880
I'm reading

1608
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:51,500
Is on Bitcoin

1609
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,920
And I've got no idea

1610
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:53,760
What it's about Luke

1611
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,780
Absolutely no idea

1612
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,079
And I'm halfway through it

1613
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:56,900
And I still haven't

1614
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:57,739
Understood a thing

1615
00:55:57,739 --> 00:55:58,900
But I'm trying to

1616
00:55:58,900 --> 00:55:59,940
Get my head around

1617
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:00,780
Blockchain

1618
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:01,699
And all that sort of stuff

1619
00:56:01,699 --> 00:56:02,559
And how Bitcoin's

1620
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,039
Disrupting traditional currencies

1621
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:05,699
But mainly

1622
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:06,179
The books

1623
00:56:06,179 --> 00:56:07,260
I can't read

1624
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,019
Anything

1625
00:56:08,019 --> 00:56:08,579
But factual books

1626
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:08,619
I can't read anything

1627
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:08,659
But factual books

1628
00:56:08,659 --> 00:56:08,699
I can't read anything

1629
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:08,739
But factual books

1630
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:08,800
I can't read anything

1631
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,480
But factual books

1632
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,980
So I try to read a book

1633
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,179
On success stories

1634
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:12,579
Business

1635
00:56:12,579 --> 00:56:13,380
Personal

1636
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,539
Sports people

1637
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:15,480
How they've been successful

1638
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,460
And you'll always pick up

1639
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,139
One or two points

1640
00:56:17,139 --> 00:56:18,940
So as I've said

1641
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:19,400
They're leaders

1642
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:19,920
Or readers

1643
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,320
If you want to learn

1644
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,639
You have to read

1645
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:23,400
Real life stories

1646
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,199
About other people

1647
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:25,579
And what they've done

1648
00:56:25,579 --> 00:56:26,119
In their lives

1649
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:27,280
You'll always pick up ideas

1650
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:27,659
And I think

1651
00:56:27,659 --> 00:56:29,280
As a leader

1652
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,380
Do not discount

1653
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,559
The power of mentoring

1654
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:32,860
That mentor

1655
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,260
Mentee relationship

1656
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,539
Is fundamentally

1657
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:36,820
You can change

1658
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:37,539
A young life

1659
00:56:37,539 --> 00:56:38,539
Around

1660
00:56:38,539 --> 00:56:39,159
By simply

1661
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:40,179
Taking the time

1662
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:41,260
To sit down

1663
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,079
And talk to people

1664
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:43,300
And giving them

1665
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,539
The benefit of your experience

1666
00:56:44,539 --> 00:56:45,960
That's what life's all about

1667
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,260
It's not that parent-child thing

1668
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,679
But formally doing that

1669
00:56:48,679 --> 00:56:49,280
Under your watch

1670
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,280
That you have that

1671
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:51,840
And it might be

1672
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,420
In a community organisation

1673
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,099
You're with

1674
00:56:54,099 --> 00:56:55,360
Or within your own business

1675
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,079
Or organisation

1676
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,019
That you have

1677
00:56:57,019 --> 00:56:58,019
You try to adopt

1678
00:56:58,019 --> 00:56:59,539
Some form of

1679
00:56:59,539 --> 00:57:00,840
Formal mentoring process

1680
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,800
Within the company

1681
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,179
I love that you're reading

1682
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:04,300
About cryptocurrency

1683
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,460
With all the success

1684
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,039
That you've had

1685
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:07,199
That your mind

1686
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:07,880
Is still curious

1687
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,019
On what is a

1688
00:57:09,019 --> 00:57:10,039
Disruptive space

1689
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:10,559
At the moment

1690
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:11,960
And halfway through the book

1691
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,280
And I've got

1692
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:12,960
Absolutely

1693
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,199
Is there

1694
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:16,139
Can I ask

1695
00:57:16,139 --> 00:57:17,239
Is there a book

1696
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:18,019
As a

1697
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:19,380
Obviously a passionate reader

1698
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,380
Is there a book

1699
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,039
That stands out

1700
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:21,619
That you could recommend

1701
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:21,900
To people

1702
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:22,480
One I've just

1703
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,199
When I've just finished

1704
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,800
Was on Winston Churchill

1705
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,579
And Clement Attlee

1706
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:26,599
In the Second World War

1707
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:27,940
And if you witness

1708
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,000
Our national cabinet

1709
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:29,780
We had with COVID

1710
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,579
Winston Churchill

1711
00:57:31,579 --> 00:57:32,800
Set up a team of six

1712
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,000
He as

1713
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,380
Prime Minister

1714
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:36,460
Chairing the cabinet

1715
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:37,579
His vice chair

1716
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,380
Was Clement Attlee

1717
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:38,880
Who was the leader

1718
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,719
Of the Labour Party

1719
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:40,840
Clement Attlee

1720
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:41,940
Ran the domestic side

1721
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:42,260
Of England

1722
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:43,159
While England was at war

1723
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:43,820
For six years

1724
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:45,519
And Churchill ran the war

1725
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:46,500
They had three

1726
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,500
Conservative leaders

1727
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,659
And three Labour leaders

1728
00:57:48,659 --> 00:57:49,500
As other delegates

1729
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,300
Other board members

1730
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,480
And they ran

1731
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,500
They were the war cabinet

1732
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,159
So if you think

1733
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:55,219
Through what Morrison did

1734
00:57:55,219 --> 00:57:56,000
For the national cabinet

1735
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,139
What we should have done there

1736
00:57:57,139 --> 00:57:58,019
Is what Churchill did

1737
00:57:58,019 --> 00:57:58,980
Is invited

1738
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,579
The Greens

1739
00:58:00,579 --> 00:58:02,099
Albanese from Labour

1740
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:04,000
In the war cabinet

1741
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,260
Our war was on COVID

1742
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,639
And then so

1743
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:08,440
The entire political system

1744
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:08,719
Would have

1745
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:08,860
Out of control

1746
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,539
Had ownership

1747
00:58:09,539 --> 00:58:11,059
Of the drugs

1748
00:58:11,059 --> 00:58:13,420
What they brought in

1749
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:13,980
What timing

1750
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:14,940
And then you've got

1751
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,059
The enemy inside the tent

1752
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:16,599
Peeing out

1753
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:17,099
Rather than outside

1754
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:17,679
Peeing in

1755
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:19,920
And there's total ownership

1756
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,539
From the leadership group

1757
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:22,219
Within Australia

1758
00:58:22,219 --> 00:58:23,840
And no one can blame each other

1759
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,400
And I think that was

1760
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,619
A strategic blunder

1761
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:26,800
By not doing that

1762
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,599
Based on their book

1763
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:28,440
I almost feel like

1764
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,179
This might sound like

1765
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:30,079
A ridiculous thing to say

1766
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:30,599
But politically

1767
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:32,539
Every fourth year

1768
00:58:32,539 --> 00:58:33,639
You should have

1769
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:34,920
A combined year

1770
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,219
Where you bring all that

1771
00:58:36,219 --> 00:58:37,179
You know

1772
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:38,420
Warlike cabinet together

1773
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:38,719
And then

1774
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,960
Maybe set aside

1775
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,519
Certain things

1776
00:58:40,519 --> 00:58:41,199
Like infrastructure

1777
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:42,099
Or education

1778
00:58:42,099 --> 00:58:42,639
Or part

1779
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:43,039
Where you

1780
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:43,760
Where you can

1781
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,179
Agree on things

1782
00:58:45,179 --> 00:58:45,920
Rather than the

1783
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,599
Point scoring

1784
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:47,420
I look

1785
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,199
People from overseas

1786
00:58:48,199 --> 00:58:48,659
That rang me

1787
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:49,079
Friends of mine

1788
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:50,179
It's an island

1789
00:58:50,179 --> 00:58:51,119
That you live on down there

1790
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:52,119
You mean to tell me

1791
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:53,559
You can't get into

1792
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:54,539
The west of Australia

1793
00:58:54,539 --> 00:58:55,559
And that policy

1794
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:56,099
Is different

1795
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,179
When you think about it

1796
00:58:57,179 --> 00:58:57,579
Logically

1797
00:58:57,579 --> 00:58:59,039
It's insane

1798
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:00,199
It was allowing the states

1799
00:59:00,199 --> 00:59:01,599
To go their own way

1800
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,840
And if I had my own way

1801
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,860
I'd abolish all the states

1802
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:06,780
And councils in Australia

1803
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:07,219
And I'd create

1804
00:59:07,219 --> 00:59:08,119
The Germanic system

1805
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:08,559
With about

1806
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,139
30 provincial governments

1807
00:59:10,139 --> 00:59:11,340
Have a strong

1808
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:11,920
Federal government

1809
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,019
And Victoria

1810
00:59:13,019 --> 00:59:13,400
Would be say

1811
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,019
Greater Ballarat

1812
00:59:14,019 --> 00:59:14,599
Greater Bendigo

1813
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:15,280
Greater Shepparton

1814
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:15,780
Greater Western

1815
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:16,699
Greater Melbourne

1816
00:59:16,699 --> 00:59:17,860
With a provincial governor

1817
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:18,559
Governor S

1818
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:19,400
And those

1819
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,840
Those provincial governments

1820
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:21,860
Would handle the old

1821
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:22,699
Council functions

1822
00:59:22,699 --> 00:59:23,559
Filling in potholes

1823
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:24,880
And old state

1824
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,639
Government functions

1825
00:59:25,639 --> 00:59:26,460
So you get rid of

1826
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:27,139
One level of government

1827
00:59:27,139 --> 00:59:27,559
Overnight

1828
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:28,920
And that's day one

1829
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:29,599
If I was a dictator

1830
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:30,320
And day two

1831
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,679
I would ban one level

1832
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:32,199
Of bureaucracy

1833
00:59:32,199 --> 00:59:33,119
And health and education

1834
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:33,599
At the moment

1835
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:34,320
It's jointly held

1836
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:34,920
By the feds

1837
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:35,420
And the states

1838
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:36,219
I would push

1839
00:59:36,219 --> 00:59:37,440
All those levels

1840
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,280
Those two

1841
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:39,059
Those levels

1842
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:39,880
Of education

1843
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:40,719
Back to the provinces

1844
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:42,280
Or I'd give it

1845
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:42,519
To the

1846
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:43,219
Only

1847
00:59:43,219 --> 00:59:44,400
Or to the feds

1848
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:44,699
Only

1849
00:59:44,699 --> 00:59:45,780
So both health

1850
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,340
And education

1851
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,239
And take that

1852
00:59:47,239 --> 00:59:48,099
One level out

1853
00:59:48,099 --> 00:59:49,679
So that's

1854
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:50,039
One level

1855
00:59:50,039 --> 00:59:51,219
Of bureaucracy

1856
00:59:51,219 --> 00:59:52,099
Entire bureaucracy

1857
00:59:52,099 --> 00:59:52,820
And health

1858
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,219
One level

1859
00:59:53,219 --> 00:59:53,940
Entire bureaucracy

1860
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:54,579
And education

1861
00:59:54,579 --> 00:59:55,460
And one level

1862
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:55,940
Of government

1863
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:56,940
And then I'd marry

1864
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,039
Those provincial governments

1865
00:59:58,039 --> 00:59:58,840
With the federal government

1866
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,800
Five year terms

1867
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,360
And voting electronically

1868
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,599
Might have to get you

1869
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:02,980
And your mate

1870
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:03,659
Geoff Kennett back

1871
01:00:03,659 --> 01:00:05,059
And have a go at that

1872
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:05,780
You'd have to change

1873
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:06,420
The constitution

1874
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:07,639
But we are woefully

1875
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:08,159
Over governed

1876
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:08,420
And I think

1877
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:09,360
The states proved that

1878
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,039
Where they're all going

1879
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:11,159
Off in their own way

1880
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:11,900
And we didn't have

1881
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:12,559
The federal government

1882
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:15,320
That could manage it

1883
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,900
From one best way

1884
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:17,739
Across the whole country

1885
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,000
Fascinating idea

1886
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,920
That the other dimension

1887
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,280
That I wanted to move to

1888
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,440
Is leaders communicating

1889
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:23,980
With clarity

1890
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,380
And all your points

1891
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:26,059
In your document

1892
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:26,639
You sent me

1893
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:27,400
Point one

1894
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,019
And you mentioned

1895
01:00:28,019 --> 01:00:28,940
Clearly communicate

1896
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:29,980
Rights and responsibilities

1897
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:30,500
You mentioned that

1898
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,179
Point two

1899
01:00:31,179 --> 01:00:32,360
Total information sharing

1900
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,420
Communicate everything

1901
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:34,139
Don't bullshit

1902
01:00:34,139 --> 01:00:35,880
Tell it how it is

1903
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:36,820
I mean clearly

1904
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:38,119
They're at the top of your list

1905
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:39,300
How you communicate with people

1906
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,860
And again that Gulf War thing

1907
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:41,619
That total information

1908
01:00:41,619 --> 01:00:42,619
We had a whiteboard up

1909
01:00:42,619 --> 01:00:43,360
There was no screens

1910
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,239
And we just wrote in

1911
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:45,980
Our financials

1912
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:46,559
And they just knew

1913
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,900
We only had a week or so

1914
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:48,579
To go with cash

1915
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:50,679
So that was very

1916
01:00:50,679 --> 01:00:51,480
And you know

1917
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,400
If there's problems

1918
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,039
In the organisation

1919
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:54,340
You've got to be transparent

1920
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:55,400
And if the issue is you

1921
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:55,920
As leader

1922
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,400
Okay I've stuffed up guys

1923
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,039
I made a mistake

1924
01:00:58,039 --> 01:00:58,500
I'm human

1925
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,000
Show your vulnerability

1926
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,659
As a leader

1927
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:01,500
People

1928
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,579
We're all human beings

1929
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:03,400
We're going to stuff up

1930
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,059
That's life

1931
01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:05,300
Was there some nervousness

1932
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:05,900
In doing that

1933
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,119
When you had that many staff

1934
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:07,440
And you say

1935
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,039
Hey we've got your

1936
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:08,440
Back

1937
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,320
But literally

1938
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,199
We're going to run out of cash

1939
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:11,179
We had no choice

1940
01:01:11,179 --> 01:01:12,239
We were going to run out

1941
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:12,760
Of cash anyway

1942
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,039
So we didn't want to tell them

1943
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:14,780
To put people off

1944
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:15,519
Would have been disastrous

1945
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:17,460
So it was either

1946
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,760
All sink together

1947
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,719
Or prosper together

1948
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:20,780
And we absolutely prospered

1949
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:21,559
Because they knew

1950
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:22,300
We had their back

1951
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,519
We see modern leaders

1952
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:24,000
Jeff

1953
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,800
Really value collaboration

1954
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,300
Perhaps more than ever

1955
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,340
I mean how do you think

1956
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:29,800
About collaboration

1957
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,420
How important

1958
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:31,219
Has that been for you

1959
01:01:31,219 --> 01:01:32,099
Look obviously

1960
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:32,980
You know

1961
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,420
Involving your people

1962
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,320
In the decision making

1963
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,800
You can't have the lunatics

1964
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,659
Running here silent

1965
01:01:37,659 --> 01:01:37,920
I think

1966
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:38,019
But you know

1967
01:01:38,019 --> 01:01:39,480
You can involve people

1968
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:39,920
And give them

1969
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,000
Your strategic thinking

1970
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,360
And then invite people

1971
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,239
To add value to that

1972
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:44,000
And certainly your team

1973
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,780
Of six under you

1974
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,880
They should be fundamental

1975
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:46,539
In the direction

1976
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:47,659
Of how the organisation's going

1977
01:01:47,659 --> 01:01:48,559
And the other thing

1978
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:48,980
I'd put in

1979
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:49,920
I think it's really important

1980
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,539
Within that is

1981
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:51,639
Point 15

1982
01:01:51,639 --> 01:01:52,380
I think is banning

1983
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:53,199
Externalisation

1984
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:54,619
So it's easy for people

1985
01:01:54,619 --> 01:01:55,400
In society

1986
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,079
To blame

1987
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,880
Whatever it is

1988
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,400
Governments

1989
01:01:59,400 --> 01:01:59,860
Leaders

1990
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:01,739
The fact that

1991
01:02:01,739 --> 01:02:02,280
It was on drugs

1992
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,039
At the end of the day

1993
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:06,659
It's your responsibility

1994
01:02:06,659 --> 01:02:07,119
You know

1995
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:07,900
What are you going to do

1996
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:08,239
About it

1997
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:09,139
And how are you going to change

1998
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:10,219
So if it's to be

1999
01:02:10,219 --> 01:02:10,840
It's up to me

2000
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,420
So I think that

2001
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:12,679
If it's coaches

2002
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:13,800
Whinging about umpires

2003
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:14,460
Or if it's leaders

2004
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,340
Whinging about the weather

2005
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,659
Or whatever it is

2006
01:02:16,659 --> 01:02:17,860
If it's to be

2007
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:18,300
It's up to me

2008
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:18,739
As leader

2009
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:19,780
You have to ban

2010
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:21,480
Externalisation yourself

2011
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,579
And look inwards

2012
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:23,300
On how you're going to

2013
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:24,039
Solve those issues

2014
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:25,320
And if you're a footy coach

2015
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,059
And you lose a game

2016
01:02:26,059 --> 01:02:27,119
You'll learn more from that

2017
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:27,980
Than winning a game

2018
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:29,820
So it's not

2019
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:30,559
Blaming the umpires

2020
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:31,199
Or blaming the weather

2021
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:31,960
If you've lost the game

2022
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:32,739
It's how do we learn

2023
01:02:32,739 --> 01:02:33,519
To kick straighter

2024
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:34,219
How do we do

2025
01:02:34,219 --> 01:02:35,059
More tackles

2026
01:02:35,059 --> 01:02:35,780
More pressure acts

2027
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:35,920
Whatever

2028
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,059
Then we might get to a victory

2029
01:02:37,059 --> 01:02:37,960
So I think that's

2030
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:38,940
A really important point

2031
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,420
To put in there

2032
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:41,559
And also really

2033
01:02:41,559 --> 01:02:43,099
Inculcating an innovation

2034
01:02:43,099 --> 01:02:44,360
Culture in a business as well

2035
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,260
So you're constantly

2036
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:47,079
Looking at ways

2037
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:47,880
To turn left

2038
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:48,360
When everyone else

2039
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,039
Is going right

2040
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,599
And be prepared to

2041
01:02:50,599 --> 01:02:51,900
Bring those new ideas

2042
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:52,579
Into the organisation

2043
01:02:52,579 --> 01:02:53,440
And trial them

2044
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,340
You might trial them

2045
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:55,360
Within a small area

2046
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:55,739
Of the business

2047
01:02:55,739 --> 01:02:56,659
So it's not at the hub

2048
01:02:56,659 --> 01:02:57,960
But it's at the end of the spoke

2049
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:58,659
And trial that

2050
01:02:58,659 --> 01:02:59,679
Radical idea

2051
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:00,860
And it might be

2052
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:01,780
The new Frappuccino

2053
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:02,480
Like Starbucks

2054
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,800
Trial in one of their stores

2055
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:04,960
And took off globally

2056
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,179
So you have to have

2057
01:03:06,179 --> 01:03:06,760
An innovation culture

2058
01:03:07,059 --> 01:03:08,579
That's deeply embedded

2059
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:09,099
In the business

2060
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:09,719
That you're prepared

2061
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:10,380
To try new things

2062
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:11,119
All the time

2063
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:12,460
And invite your people

2064
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:13,619
To come up with those good ideas

2065
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:14,840
That we will take them on board

2066
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:15,980
So if someone comes up

2067
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:16,300
With that idea

2068
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,400
Look okay I'm not sure

2069
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,219
But let's give it a crack

2070
01:03:18,219 --> 01:03:19,000
If you think it's good enough

2071
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,039
It's incredible

2072
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:21,239
Shared wisdom Jeff

2073
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:22,519
Right across your life

2074
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:23,260
I've been asking

2075
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:24,619
All the leaders

2076
01:03:24,619 --> 01:03:26,239
These final two questions

2077
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:28,179
And take some time

2078
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,860
As long as you possibly like

2079
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:31,739
But the first one is

2080
01:03:31,739 --> 01:03:33,159
Who's been the greatest leader

2081
01:03:33,159 --> 01:03:33,840
In your life?

2082
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:37,940
I used to drive to work

2083
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:39,800
Listening to Winston Churchill tapes

2084
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,940
Because at the height of the war

2085
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,059
No one gave Germany any chance

2086
01:03:44,059 --> 01:03:44,300
It was

2087
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:45,340
I'll fight them on that beach

2088
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:46,219
I'll fight them on the hills

2089
01:03:46,219 --> 01:03:46,900
And I used to get the air

2090
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:47,619
In the back of my neck

2091
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:48,519
Standing up

2092
01:03:48,519 --> 01:03:52,420
It's an interesting question

2093
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:53,760
I think Barack Obama

2094
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:54,539
For his oratory

2095
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:55,639
Was quite inspiring

2096
01:03:55,639 --> 01:03:58,579
I think

2097
01:03:58,579 --> 01:03:59,539
Probably

2098
01:03:59,539 --> 01:04:00,619
Kennedy in Victoria

2099
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:01,300
Whether you love him

2100
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:01,880
Or hate him

2101
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,639
Was a crash

2102
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:03,519
Or crash through merchant

2103
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:03,820
And I think

2104
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,039
Got a lot of stuff done

2105
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,440
Which was incredibly controversial

2106
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,079
But had the

2107
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:08,139
The proverbials

2108
01:04:08,139 --> 01:04:08,980
At least to do it

2109
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:10,860
What he said he did

2110
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:11,599
So he implemented

2111
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:13,559
Exactly what he said

2112
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:14,139
He was going to do

2113
01:04:14,139 --> 01:04:18,599
And I think

2114
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:19,480
Obviously Mandela

2115
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:19,960
For his

2116
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:20,840
Forgiveness

2117
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:21,780
In terms of

2118
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:22,820
What

2119
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:24,400
The Afrikaan race

2120
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,159
Did to black people

2121
01:04:25,159 --> 01:04:25,900
For generations

2122
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:26,699
And his forgiveness

2123
01:04:26,699 --> 01:04:27,719
And inclusiveness

2124
01:04:27,719 --> 01:04:29,579
Was an amazing message

2125
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:30,340
For that country

2126
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:33,000
And we were over there

2127
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,360
Two years after he was released

2128
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,739
I remember going over there

2129
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,280
And the most

2130
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,179
Died in the war

2131
01:04:38,179 --> 01:04:40,320
White Afrikaan people

2132
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,380
Revered Mandela

2133
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,019
Even though

2134
01:04:43,019 --> 01:04:44,179
Two years before

2135
01:04:44,179 --> 01:04:44,800
They would have seen

2136
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,300
They were thinking that

2137
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,639
He was going to be

2138
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:48,599
A communist leader

2139
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:49,619
And he was going to be

2140
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:51,099
Probably another civil war type thing

2141
01:04:51,099 --> 01:04:52,579
So his inclusiveness

2142
01:04:52,579 --> 01:04:53,440
And ability to

2143
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,519
To forgive

2144
01:04:54,519 --> 01:04:55,980
Was I think

2145
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:57,400
An amazing story really

2146
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,460
Incredible stories of leadership

2147
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:00,800
All of the ones that you referenced

2148
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,440
If you could collaborate

2149
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,719
With anyone in the world

2150
01:05:03,719 --> 01:05:05,280
On anything Jeff

2151
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:05,460
It's a diverse group of people

2152
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,199
It's a diverse life

2153
01:05:06,199 --> 01:05:07,079
That you've lived

2154
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:09,699
Is there a person

2155
01:05:09,699 --> 01:05:11,199
Anyone that springs to mind

2156
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:14,389
Richard Attenborough

2157
01:05:14,389 --> 01:05:16,530
I think he's absolutely inspirational

2158
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:17,369
In terms of what he's done

2159
01:05:17,369 --> 01:05:18,449
For our global environment

2160
01:05:18,449 --> 01:05:19,949
And he's leading us

2161
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:20,789
To thinking about

2162
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:22,010
Climate change

2163
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:23,150
And how we should be doing

2164
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:23,949
So much more

2165
01:05:23,949 --> 01:05:25,769
Globally

2166
01:05:25,769 --> 01:05:27,510
And

2167
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:29,570
In terms of investing

2168
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:30,570
In green technology

2169
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:32,250
In terms of setting a vision

2170
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:33,289
For green technology

2171
01:05:33,289 --> 01:05:33,570
And

2172
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:35,010
I mean for instance

2173
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:36,110
Down the east coast of Australia

2174
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:37,090
There's a bunch of coal mines

2175
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:37,150
Which are

2176
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:37,530
Which have been

2177
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:38,469
Controversial in Australia

2178
01:05:38,469 --> 01:05:39,250
People saying

2179
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:40,090
They're going to lose their jobs

2180
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:40,730
Well okay

2181
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:41,510
Why couldn't we

2182
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:42,349
As the leader of Australia

2183
01:05:42,349 --> 01:05:44,030
Saying okay coal miners

2184
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:45,590
We will transition you

2185
01:05:45,590 --> 01:05:47,349
From coal to

2186
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:48,409
Whatever it may be

2187
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:49,210
Wind, solar

2188
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:50,369
Maybe even nuclear

2189
01:05:50,369 --> 01:05:51,349
Portable nuclear power

2190
01:05:51,349 --> 01:05:53,050
So whatever it may be

2191
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:56,429
So there's no stuff going up

2192
01:05:56,429 --> 01:05:57,829
There's no crap going up

2193
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:58,210
In the atmosphere

2194
01:05:58,210 --> 01:05:59,369
We will transition you

2195
01:05:59,369 --> 01:06:00,329
We'll pay your wages

2196
01:06:00,329 --> 01:06:01,150
We will train you

2197
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:02,130
And we will transition you

2198
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:04,030
In that five or ten year journey

2199
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:06,170
To that new green technology

2200
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:07,150
Your jobs are going to be

2201
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:07,650
As a safe

2202
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:09,789
We will wean coal

2203
01:06:09,789 --> 01:06:10,829
Wean you off coal

2204
01:06:10,829 --> 01:06:11,969
And we'll invest in these

2205
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:13,570
And invite global capital

2206
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:15,190
To invest in these technologies

2207
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:15,889
But you are

2208
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:16,510
We are

2209
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:17,449
We've got your back

2210
01:06:17,449 --> 01:06:18,650
You're not going to lose your job

2211
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:20,590
So we needed a transition plan

2212
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:21,289
Not just

2213
01:06:21,289 --> 01:06:22,849
That's this sort of constant

2214
01:06:22,849 --> 01:06:24,070
Well we're going to back the coal miners

2215
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:24,909
Because you're going to lose your job

2216
01:06:24,909 --> 01:06:26,449
Well why should they lose their job?

2217
01:06:26,789 --> 01:06:28,050
We'll back them into new industries

2218
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:29,150
And let's have a ten year plan

2219
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:30,309
JFK said

2220
01:06:30,309 --> 01:06:31,090
We're going to send a moon

2221
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:32,769
Send a man to the moon in ten years

2222
01:06:32,769 --> 01:06:33,650
Not because it's easy

2223
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:34,289
Because it's hard

2224
01:06:34,289 --> 01:06:35,590
We should be doing the same thing

2225
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:36,969
We've got heaps of sunshine

2226
01:06:36,969 --> 01:06:38,610
We should be the world's biggest exporter

2227
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:39,070
Of sun

2228
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:40,570
Sun power

2229
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:42,110
To Southeast Asia

2230
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:44,550
Invite capital from all over the world

2231
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:45,289
Via tax breaks

2232
01:06:45,289 --> 01:06:46,530
To invest in solar energy

2233
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:47,969
And be the leaders in the world

2234
01:06:47,969 --> 01:06:48,929
In solar technology

2235
01:06:48,929 --> 01:06:50,250
And solar exporting

2236
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:52,610
And migrate all those coal miners to that

2237
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:54,010
But we need a ten year vision for it

2238
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:54,869
We saw

2239
01:06:54,869 --> 01:06:55,630
You know

2240
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:56,949
Mike Cannon-Brooks from Atlassian

2241
01:06:56,949 --> 01:06:57,570
Try and buy

2242
01:06:57,570 --> 01:06:58,449
AGL

2243
01:06:58,449 --> 01:06:59,090
AGL

2244
01:06:59,090 --> 01:06:59,650
Which is

2245
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:00,449
You know

2246
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:01,769
To fast track

2247
01:07:01,769 --> 01:07:03,010
What you're talking about

2248
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:04,349
In that space

2249
01:07:04,349 --> 01:07:04,869
Yep

2250
01:07:04,869 --> 01:07:05,090
Yeah

2251
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:06,409
It's a brilliant thought

2252
01:07:06,409 --> 01:07:06,929
And every time

2253
01:07:06,929 --> 01:07:08,690
I hear you go off on a tangent

2254
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:09,610
It seems to be

2255
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:10,349
You know

2256
01:07:10,349 --> 01:07:11,190
With some deep thinking

2257
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:13,110
And as I said at the start

2258
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:14,030
Jeff

2259
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,349
A supplementary question

2260
01:07:15,349 --> 01:07:16,750
Before I wrap up

2261
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:17,829
Because as someone who's

2262
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:20,110
Been one of the most successful people

2263
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:21,230
In the global travel business

2264
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:22,610
Where's your favourite place to travel

2265
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:24,309
When Jeff Harris goes for a break

2266
01:07:24,309 --> 01:07:24,769
Where do you go?

2267
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:26,590
Well I've got a place at Noosa

2268
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:27,050
I love it there

2269
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:27,969
But in terms of overseas

2270
01:07:27,969 --> 01:07:29,030
I love London as a town

2271
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:30,050
Because it's so cosmopolitan

2272
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:31,050
There's so many great bars

2273
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:31,429
And restaurants

2274
01:07:31,429 --> 01:07:34,710
My favourite travel memory

2275
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:35,989
Was when I went over

2276
01:07:35,989 --> 01:07:36,809
When I was in

2277
01:07:36,809 --> 01:07:37,389
Europe

2278
01:07:37,389 --> 01:07:38,869
Working on the buses

2279
01:07:38,869 --> 01:07:40,630
With Bill and Graham

2280
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:42,789
My co-founders at Flytus

2281
01:07:42,789 --> 01:07:43,710
That ran Top Deck Travel

2282
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:45,650
I was working for an opposition company

2283
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:46,489
In the 18 to 30s

2284
01:07:46,489 --> 01:07:47,250
Bus space

2285
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:48,289
Like Contiki tours

2286
01:07:48,289 --> 01:07:48,750
Those sort of things

2287
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:50,030
Not with Contiki

2288
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:50,630
But another company

2289
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:52,690
And I did three Russia scandies

2290
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:54,230
And I remember being in Russia

2291
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:57,110
In 1974, 75, 76

2292
01:07:57,110 --> 01:07:57,690
On three trips

2293
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:59,289
In the depths of communism

2294
01:07:59,289 --> 01:08:02,130
And then I went back home one summer

2295
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:03,730
Via New York to Australia

2296
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:06,250
Seeing Moscow in the depths of communism

2297
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:06,489
And a lot of people

2298
01:08:06,489 --> 01:08:06,789
And I remember

2299
01:08:06,809 --> 01:08:07,250
A month later

2300
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,130
Seeing New York

2301
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:09,389
The depths of capitalism

2302
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:10,610
And comparing it to

2303
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:12,130
That was my favourite memory

2304
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,630
Probably politically

2305
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:15,150
And in terms of countries

2306
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:16,090
When I went overland to London

2307
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:18,310
Being in Afghanistan in 1972

2308
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:19,710
It was the most feudal

2309
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:21,489
Backward country you'd ever see

2310
01:08:21,489 --> 01:08:22,510
But fascinating

2311
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:23,409
Because it was so backward

2312
01:08:23,409 --> 01:08:24,390
Probably for me though

2313
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:25,369
And in terms of

2314
01:08:25,369 --> 01:08:26,289
Just a leisure place

2315
01:08:26,289 --> 01:08:27,689
San Sebastian in Spain

2316
01:08:27,689 --> 01:08:29,029
I think it's an amazing place

2317
01:08:29,029 --> 01:08:29,289
To go to

2318
01:08:29,289 --> 01:08:29,949
The Basque territory

2319
01:08:29,949 --> 01:08:30,710
Of northern Spain

2320
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:31,590
I love that

2321
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:33,029
Geoff, it's been

2322
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:34,289
An incredible opportunity

2323
01:08:34,289 --> 01:08:34,750
To catch up

2324
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:35,310
I'm really grateful

2325
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:36,010
That you were prepared

2326
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:36,350
To sit down with me

2327
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:36,789
And to sit down

2328
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:37,109
With me

2329
01:08:37,109 --> 01:08:37,770
And also

2330
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:39,170
Thank you for being

2331
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:39,989
Generous enough

2332
01:08:39,989 --> 01:08:41,329
As I said

2333
01:08:41,329 --> 01:08:42,890
I see it as a masterclass

2334
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:43,750
Of your life

2335
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:44,449
The 20 points

2336
01:08:44,449 --> 01:08:45,550
We will get them out

2337
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:45,949
And share them

2338
01:08:45,949 --> 01:08:46,770
If you're comfortable

2339
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:47,270
With that Geoff

2340
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:48,149
I'm sure people listening

2341
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:49,449
Will be inspired

2342
01:08:49,449 --> 01:08:50,750
By your thoughts

2343
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:51,310
And how clear

2344
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:52,069
They're not rockets

2345
01:08:52,069 --> 01:08:52,750
They just might be

2346
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:53,489
One or two points

2347
01:08:53,489 --> 01:08:54,289
That might help people

2348
01:08:54,289 --> 01:08:55,770
People can take on board

2349
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:56,869
Your humility comes through

2350
01:08:56,869 --> 01:08:57,569
In everything you do

2351
01:08:57,569 --> 01:08:58,210
So we'll put them

2352
01:08:58,210 --> 01:08:58,810
In the show notes

2353
01:08:58,810 --> 01:08:59,369
I'll put them out

2354
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:00,670
On Instagram as well

2355
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:02,189
