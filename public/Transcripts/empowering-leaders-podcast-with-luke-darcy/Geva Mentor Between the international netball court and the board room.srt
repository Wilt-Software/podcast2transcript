1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,259
You think you're doing things differently, but actually you're doing things very similar

2
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:04,059
to everybody else.

3
00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:08,220
And I think the biggest thing that draws upon me is just staying curious, having the courage

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,800
to kind of put yourself out there and being able to evolve with the different environments

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,400
that you put yourself in, the different groups that you see yourself with.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,920
And I think at the end of the day, you don't always get it right.

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,420
And I think that's where the courage comes to be able to put your hand up and navigate

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,579
and evolve around that.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,239
I'm sure you're going to love this week's episode of the podcast with a legend of world

10
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,559
netball, Jeeva Mentor.

11
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:37,039
And she has some great advice, including her advice to parents on trying to figure out

12
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,780
what sport to put their kid into.

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,840
A little hint on that one, as many as possible.

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,780
She also talks really passionately about how we need to keep more young girls in sport,

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,780
how she has engaged the tool of visualization as a teenager and how that's worked really

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,579
strongly for her.

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,039
Talks about the routine she's got in place to execute her role as a captain and the similarities

18
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,039
and synergies she sees between the sporting field.

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,679
And the boardroom.

20
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,659
It's a chat that's full of wisdom, a remarkable success story, an athlete.

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,939
I'm sure you're going to enjoy this chat with Jeeva.

22
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:12,239
It's people like Jeeva Mentor that we are really privileged and proud to have in our

23
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,480

28
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,689
Jeeva Mentor is regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of her chosen team,

29
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:32,609
sport of netball.

30
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,629
Her track record of success is quite incredible.

31
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:39,849
She competed for England six times at the Commonwealth Games, winning gold in 2018,

32
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,090
won back-to-back netball Super League titles in the 2005 and 2006 seasons, representing

33
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:46,790
Team Bath.

34
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,810
And in the ANZ Championship, she won premierships in Adelaide in 2010 with the Melbourne Vixens

35
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,549
in 2014 and back-to-back titles as captain of the Sunshine Coast in 2017 and 2018.

36
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:01,230
She first represented her country at senior level as a 16-year-old.

37
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,310
Jeeva Mentor is regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of her chosen team,

38
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,090
going on to captain England in 2019 and was appointed a commander of the Order of the

39
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,210
British Empire for her services to netball.

40
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,270
Jeeva, it's always great to see you.

41
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,110
You must feel proud when you look back.

42
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:13,909
It's been an amazing success story.

43
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,090
It really has.

44
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,289
And yeah, lovely to be able to speak to you as well, Darce.

45
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:18,870
And I do love hearing the bios.

46
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:20,469
Everyone sums it up so perfectly.

47
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,930
And then I get on stage and have to send my bio and I'm just, I jump everywhere because

48
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,310
there has been so many amazing things that have happened.

49
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,990
I've got so many wonderful memories and so many events that I cherish.

50
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,810
As well, it's just trying to sort of compile them all into something that people want to

51
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,370
hear about.

52
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:39,870
One of the ones that I mentioned there is as a 15-year-old, you're in your first senior

53
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,909
England squad at 16, your debut against New Zealand.

54
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:47,969
That must have been incredible going back to school after you're playing for your country

55
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:48,870
at international level.

56
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:49,550
What was that like?

57
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,870
I guess at that age, I was probably quite naive to it all.

58
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,250
I was a keen athlete.

59
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,930
I played many sports and actually got into netball quite late.

60
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,449
So I kind of didn't really know what was happening.

61
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:00,469
And I remember my first England trials.

62
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,289
You know, of an England team then, and we didn't have as much social media or social

63
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:07,490
presence, particularly with the England Roses back then.

64
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:08,889
So I kind of rocked up.

65
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,169
I did fitness tests and did the trials and sort of made the team and then even being

66
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:18,189
able to be selected to go away and receive my first cap when I was eventually 17 after

67
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:22,370
sort of sitting a year and a half on the bench in the setup and finally getting that opportunity.

68
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,150
And yeah, I came back into A-levels at the time.

69
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,930
And I think for me, the biggest difference was I was studying at school, but then when

70
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:30,949
it came time to exam.

71
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,849
I was on international duties.

72
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:37,870
I remember taking my first set of A-levels in a university in New Zealand, in Dunedin,

73
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,710
because we were travelling at the time and they arranged, they sent my papers over.

74
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,430
I was in this room all by myself with a monitor on me.

75
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:46,830
So I think I just did things differently and I just kind of took it in my stride.

76
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:50,169
And I think that's probably what helped me just kind of ease into it because I was quite

77
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:51,129
naive with it all.

78
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,530
Jeeva, you mentioned you were a keen athlete and did a range of other sports.

79
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,409
Was there one that maybe might have taken your attention other than netball?

80
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,310
Yeah.

81
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:00,349
Yeah.

82
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,689
I laugh when I say this one, because when you look at the attributes for this particular

83
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:06,430
sport, I definitely don't meet those.

84
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,229
And trampolining was my first love.

85
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:13,210
And you tend to find those athletes a lot more sort of shorter and compact and on the

86
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,909
taller, the taller range of being just over 6'3".

87
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:20,829
So it kind of got to a stage when I was about 13, 14, I had numerous accidents.

88
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,250
The difficulty of moves I had to do meant that I had to go a lot higher and get my limbs

89
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,170
in tightly to be able to rotate and twist.

90
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,870
And I remember her.

91
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,189
Coming off numerous times, being in hospital in a neck brace, fracturing my cheekbone.

92
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:38,689
And I think mum kind of called it and said, you know what, Jee, let's try and find a sport

93
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:40,350
that kind of suits your attributes.

94
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,610
And yeah.

95
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:42,949
And then for me, that was about it.

96
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,170
But I've always loved a trampoline.

97
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,410
And now you see them everywhere.

98
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,509
So you see something like bounce and I want to go along and I want to hop on.

99
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,790
I've got some of my skills, but I haven't got all of them anymore.

100
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,329
So there's not too many 6'3 Olympic trampolines, I'm assuming.

101
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:00,110
Height was a deterrent there, but you clearly had the athletic traits and within yourself

102
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,750
to succeed.

103
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,610
Can you work out why you've been able to be so successful?

104
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,649
What are the things within yourself that gave you that drive?

105
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:07,350
Yeah, I think that's what I often say.

106
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:09,149
I do a lot of coaching now, side of things.

107
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:11,629
And I try and tell parents, I know it's as hard as it is.

108
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,689
And you've obviously, father of four, trying to take your kids along to different sports.

109
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,129
And I'm like, parents, try and take them along to as many as possible.

110
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,410
Don't pigeonhole them into one particular sport, particularly at a young age.

111
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:24,889
Because for me, I feel like the trampolining gave me that spatial awareness, which I'm

112
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:27,610
really able to use on court, particularly in my position at goalkeeper.

113
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,509
Having that peripheral vision, having that vision down court.

114
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:34,769
And what's going on alongside me has really helped from my trampolining days, having that

115
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:35,970
core and that composure.

116
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,149
The basketball that I played at a young age, I was in the boys' teams.

117
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:41,050
We didn't have girls' teams.

118
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,149
I guess that gave me that aggression and that team sport element.

119
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,990
Athletics gave me that overall fitness.

120
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:50,350
Living on the coast, I did a lot of sailing and kayaking.

121
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,230
I think that just gave me the courage to be able to combat the element.

122
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,050
So I think as many sports that you can do, they have so many great attributes that come

123
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,350
with it.

124
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,110
And that's just talking about the physical side.

125
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,470
You've also got, I guess.

126
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:03,449
The mental side, the personality traits that come with that.

127
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:09,389
And I think that sport really gives you those sort of values within behaviour and how to

128
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:12,189
deal with different things in life that don't just happen in sport.

129
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,490
And I think that gave me a good foundation.

130
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,170
That's for sure.

131
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:18,170
Often references, JV, the conversation comes up.

132
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,750
There was a famous book Malcolm Gladwell wrote about the 10,000 hour rule.

133
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,350
And they thought, you know, the Tiger Woods with his dad giving him a golf club when he

134
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,870
was two months old and trying to create the perfect athlete.

135
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:30,449
But there's a great study now.

136
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:34,529
Exactly what you're talking about and range and that having a diversity of interests not

137
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:38,449
only makes you healthier and happier in the longer run, but creates the biggest and best

138
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:39,230
success stories.

139
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,949
It's something you obviously subscribe to that sampling bits of everything has been

140
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:43,370
beneficial.

141
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,350
Yeah, definitely.

142
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:48,069
And I mean, I had the support of my parents as well who encouraged me and they were very

143
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:48,389
athletic.

144
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,029
So I kind of followed in their suit.

145
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:51,670
And I think you'll have different upbringing.

146
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,329
You'll have sort of parents that will push you more, some that will really want you to

147
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:57,490
have that balance between education and sport as well.

148
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,529
And then some that will just sort of let you be.

149
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:00,389
And I think.

150
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,550
Everyone has come from different backgrounds.

151
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,149
There's no sort of one particular that works.

152
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,490
I think it's just really down to you as a person.

153
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,750
But for me, yeah, I just think that I've always gone along with the philosophy.

154
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,290
If you love what you do, you're going to put as much as you can into it, 110 percent into

155
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,110
it, so to speak.

156
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,069
So and that's exactly what I've done.

157
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:22,290
If I've enjoyed it, I've put my all into it and I've been happy to kind of ride out the

158
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,850
highs and lows that come with that.

159
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:29,189
And Jeeva, sport has been an incredible part of your life and still is to this very day.

160
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:29,250
Yeah.

161
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:29,310
Yeah.

162
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:29,329
Yeah.

163
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:29,350
Yeah.

164
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,370
Yeah.

165
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:29,389
Yeah.

166
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:29,410
Yeah.

167
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:29,430
Yeah.

168
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,449
Yeah.

169
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:29,470
Yeah.

170
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:29,509
Yeah.

171
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:29,529
Yeah.

172
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:29,769
Yeah.

173
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:29,810
Yeah.

174
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:29,829
Yeah.

175
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:30,850
Yeah.

176
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,730
Yeah.

177
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:36,009
Yeah.

178
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,550
Yeah.

179
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,470
I mean, I don't know the statistics and I don't know the actual evidence behind it

180
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:42,610
all.

181
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,170
But there was always a lot of talk around.

182
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:50,449
And I've obviously been a young girl very many years ago, that time where boys do come

183
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:54,170
on the scene, where the social events of actually missing out on things.

184
00:07:54,329 --> 00:08:00,050
For me, I chose to play sport and travel and compete, so I wasn't able to go to my school

185
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:05,610
got proms or parties and I missed out on so many events and I can see that sort of as there's so

186
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,029
much peer pressure nowadays that young girls unless they decide what they want to do they're

187
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:14,170
kind of steered towards you know I'll tamper with a bit of makeup or I want to hang out with my

188
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:19,449
friends and whether that's still the case I'm not sure whether I know they're still finding and

189
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:23,930
struggling with their identity I think the biggest thing for us is just making it as open as possible

190
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,829
and that's where we can flip peer pressure on its head in terms of well you know what bring your

191
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:31,430
friend along bring your group you know I've got a big enough car let's let's stick as many of you

192
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,669
in as possible and let's go along and have a fun and and see who else we can interact with and I

193
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:41,049
had a father that came up to me at a leadership conference I spoke at recently and he said I've

194
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:46,389
got a 14 year old daughter I really wanted to continue in sport but I can see that I don't

195
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:49,570
know if she wants to hang out with dad anymore I don't know if she wants to go and I literally

196
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,429
just said the same I said you know what put these events in there and say bring your friend it

197
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:57,590
doesn't just have to be father-daughter time and just get her along and then that

198
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,809
interesting

199
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,690
well then and we always say about that buddy system going on to the gym if you get someone

200
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,710
else who's keen they're going to drag you in those days that you're not so much they'll

201
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:11,269
they'll motivate you too so there's definitely um stuff out there that limits um young women

202
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:16,490
and girls staying within sport and um I just hope there's enough of us that can keep um motivating

203
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,429
them and encouraging them and just showing them there's different avenues and it can be social

204
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:25,009
or competitive no matter what stream they want to um keep involved in it's great point isn't it

205
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:27,590
you've got one other friend your your chance of sticking

206
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:34,210
is probably a factor of five or more and so it's a great piece of uh advice that that you have given

207
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,850
you mentioned you're talking at a leadership conference which I'm not surprised you

208
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:43,190
kept in your country you kept in premierships and seems like you're a leader from a very young age

209
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:48,350
did you always see that in yourself no not at all and even now today I still think I've got a

210
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,129
a lot of improvement I'm not the best speaker although I feel like I've I've listened to so

211
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:57,429
many wonderful people who really articulate themselves beautifully and I think wow if

212
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:01,389
only I could be like that and I love I love reading quotes but I can never remember them

213
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:06,250
um and it's just it's one of those that um I need to have I need to have the words out in front of

214
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,830
me to articulate but I think for me the biggest thing and I've said that as I've kind of matured

215
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:18,009
through my sport um and through the ages is um just try to stay true to myself um and the things

216
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:23,029
that I've noticed about and also being part of a leader and the program that um that you set out is

217
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:31,149
you're doing things very similar to everybody else and I think the biggest thing that draws

218
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:34,870
upon me is just staying curious having the courage to kind of put yourself out there

219
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:39,970
um and being able to evolve um with the different environments that you put yourself in the different

220
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:45,070
groups that you see yourself with and um I think at the end of the day that you don't always get

221
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,870
it right and I think that's where the courage comes to be able to put your hand up and and

222
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:53,070
navigate and evolve around that and we've been really privileged to be able to connect with you

223
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,269
in in the leader program that you just mentioned and with some other um

224
00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:01,509
unbelievable athletes uh from around the globe Patrick Cripps is a Brownlow medal winner in the

225
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:05,809
AFL test match and captain of the Australian basketball team Mitch Marsh has had probably

226
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:11,490
the greatest period of all time Mitch he's uh won the Alan Borda medal for Australia's best

227
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,649
cricket player Daley Cherry Evans is a superstar of rugby league can you tell us a bit about

228
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:22,110
getting together sitting down with group a group like that on a on a monthly basis what what's it

229
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,870
been like for you it's been phenomenal actually and it's funny you just talk about Mitch there

230
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,350
we feel like we've all kind of

231
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:31,870
ridden the journey along with him right from the start and knowing before things became public with

232
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:36,389
him making the team and then making captaincy and how he sort of navigated his leadership role

233
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:41,529
within that and um as I spoke about a little bit before in this is that we're doing things

234
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:46,269
that actually are very similar to each other in a way that we kind of gather our team we deal with

235
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:51,549
situations that happen within groups um and I think it's really reassuring as a as a leader

236
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:56,649
that you are on kind of the right track and um yes we play different sports and yes we're kind

237
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:57,409
of from some

238
00:11:57,429 --> 00:12:03,610
different generations but um being able to still navigate and lead and gather the troops um but

239
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,769
yeah I mean Paddy's phenomenal he's one that remembers quotes and I often find we come off

240
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:12,830
his sessions and we're all writing down and um when we kind of review or um just go through what

241
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:17,169
sort of stood out for us it's often some amazing book that he's read and a quote that he's pulled

242
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:22,990
from it Mitch is just beautiful he seems quite sort of shy and reserved but then um he's he's

243
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,309
got quite a personality about him and it's just been great to see him evolve into this

244
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:35,429
um confident leader um Tess is always learning um and um she's praying for Olympic campaign and

245
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:40,250
um just surrounded by some phenomenal things and had some interesting situations that happen within

246
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:46,529
female basketball as well in Australia and um and then Daly is just um obviously a champion

247
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:51,070
again been around for so long got so many caps under his belt and just the way he's navigated

248
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,429
those different sports but I think for me the biggest thing I've taken from it is I've got

249
00:12:55,429 --> 00:12:57,409
genuine friends now I've got these people who are really kind and kind of who I've got really

250
00:12:57,429 --> 00:13:02,269
that I can not only call upon if I need some advice or support along the way and we throw in

251
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:07,269
our I don't know questions or prompting things to kind of handle and navigate and work through so

252
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:10,990
you've got that support line there but you've also got some people that you end up following like

253
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:16,769
when the news comes on when the social media scrolling goes through and you find that genuine

254
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:21,250
interest because you feel so close and connected to them and you feel like their biggest sort of

255
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:26,529
advocate and supporter as well. Beautifully said Jeeva and we talk about those inspiring

256
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:31,649
connections inspiring people and that leadership can be lonely at times there are not all that many

257
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:36,610
places to turn have you felt like having people that are probably at a similar stage of you in

258
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:43,990
lots of ways that that's found some common ground? Yeah definitely and our moderator is Stacey and

259
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:49,230
she's done very well with sort of connecting us all and keeping us all together but I think for me

260
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,750
I went through some really challenging times as a leader last year with Collingwood Magpies and

261
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,049
having our team kind of debunked

262
00:13:56,049 --> 00:14:01,450
partway through our season and just trying to find motivation for the group in terms of what

263
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:06,850
they're now playing for and I really leant hard on the group to kind of what I could do and if

264
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:12,549
they'd had any sort of experiences that I could learn from and be able to kind of share and

265
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:17,490
connect and support my group around that so yeah I mean there's been some personal cases that

266
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,610
happened I like to think I've also been able to sort of share some advice as well and I think the

267
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,009
beautiful thing with it it goes both ways and we are always learning and evolving and

268
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:31,929
I think from our first session right till now we've really come on as a group and yeah it's

269
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:35,769
really nice to see it then the funny thing about it is we haven't actually met up in person in one

270
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:39,350
room I mean some of us have been able to sort of catch each other on different sporting grounds

271
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,870
and situations but to have that connection and it's all online has been wonderful. That would

272
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:49,330
be a good dinner and I suspect Mitch Marsh will be holding court if you get together holding up

273
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:54,629
the bar at some he likes to celebrate Mitch in a fine way and thanks for the shout out to Stacey

274
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:56,029
Morlang who's a bit of a champion.

275
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:59,809
In our world she's a great facilitator captain the Australian women's lacrosse team and I know

276
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:05,389
she's really passionate about you Jeeva and your group and what you do I want to ask you sort of

277
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:11,129
a qualified school teacher and you studied you know amazing that you were doing exams in other

278
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:17,129
countries in year 12 while playing for England what about the skills that sport has taught you

279
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:21,789
has that helped you finding as you transition into the next chapter of your life? Yeah I definitely

280
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:25,769
put my hand up I probably wasn't the most academic at school I'd rather be out on the field and

281
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:31,669
running around and doing something else but I did apply myself and it took me seven and a half

282
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:35,850
eight years to get my Bachelor of Education primary but finally got it alongside playing

283
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,950
sport and Commonwealth Games and World Cups and actually be back out in Australia this year to

284
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,769
graduate and I'm going to make that flight because I want to be there it's taken it's taken that long

285
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:49,710
to sort of dedicate myself to it and achieve it and for me it's definitely a personal achievement

286
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:55,509
but I can't reiterate how important sport has been for me and sculpturing me to who I am today and I

287
00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:00,990
so many attributes that you can take from sport that can work in other aspects of life whether

288
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:09,269
it's lifestyle whether it's business whether it's just navigating situations that arise I feel like

289
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:13,990
the discipline that you get within sport and being able to sort of apply yourself being able to ride

290
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:19,450
out the highs and lows that come from that the situations that that crop up but also you really

291
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:24,169
have to dig deep within yourself and know who you are to be able to handle those things also to be

292
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:29,289
able to help make you feel comfortable and to get to where you are and to be able to be able to

293
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:32,389
understand that everyone operates differently and so you might be able to see yourself through a

294
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:37,210
journey and out the other end but people alongside you who are part of that makeup and you achieving

295
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:42,090
your goal whether that's in sort of another industry business or lifestyle or whatever

296
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:47,610
happens throughout life I think you may be fine with that but then it's also about being able to

297
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,850
sort of bring those people along with you and finding their way and knowing that they may not

298
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,750
go into the same groove as you but helping them realise their potential and I definitely think

299
00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:00,230
feel that that's what sport has done for me it's opened my eyes and as I said before there's so

300
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:07,289
many attributes I can and values I can be able to take from what I've learned into the next chapter

301
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:11,930
and for me sport will come to an end eventually and I like to think that those qualities that

302
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,309
I've sort of picked up along the way I'll be able to utilize. It's a brilliant message and I think

303
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:20,470
all former athletes need to hear what you said because I think a lot of athletes forget that

304
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:24,569
they have maybe focused on that part of their life but they're great team players they're open

305
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:30,430
to feedback resilient all the words that you used make them incredibly capable often in the second

306
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:35,329
part of their life. We have this saying too that success leaves clues and I love asking these

307
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:40,589
questions around what we think great leadership looks like starting with the idea of self-leadership

308
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:44,970
that we think it's hard to lead someone else without an understanding of yourself what does

309
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:49,410
self-leadership mean to you? Yeah I think for me as I spoke up before it's definitely making sure

310
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,650
you don't lose sight of who you are so staying true to yourself I think you've got to be able

311
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,269
to be vulnerable.

312
00:17:54,569 --> 00:18:00,730
And by being vulnerable you've got to be self-analytical you've got to be able to look

313
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:08,029
first within to see where you can improve and be better and help and then from that I think comes

314
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:14,250
courage to be able to sort of take those actions put yourself out there lead by example and then

315
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:19,549
I think what what makes a great leader a great leader is you have these sort of common themes

316
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:22,890
but then you've also got something that's a little bit quirky about yourself you may be a bit of a

317
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,549
comedian in the group you may be a bit of a comedian in the group you may be a bit of a comedian in the

318
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:29,410
group you may be the one that is a fantastic speaker and really articulates things well or

319
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:35,990
you may be the one that can kind of lead by example so I think that's the important thing

320
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,130
that it's all these different ingredients but not every template is the same there's the foundation

321
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,430
there but I think then it's important that because people can see through the bullshit

322
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:49,690
to be honest so it's about it's about knowing that you are who you are but then you can you

323
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,470
can draw upon those of those foundations. Yeah I love the way you said that and it's come up a couple

324
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:57,529
times in your language being authentically yourself and if you're trying to be someone

325
00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:02,130
else you're going to get found out pretty pretty quickly so what what was your quirk then that

326
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:09,490
do you think helped you in uh in those roles? Oh gosh um I've been known to have a bit of a filthy

327
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:20,190
mind um as we move through the evolution because it's not very easy um I have to pick

328
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,490
my audiences now um but I do have a few good innuendos that

329
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:30,869
this podcast gone a different direction David I'm uh I've got a whole heap of questions

330
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:37,990
that I uh I'm not sure right I'm gonna go with but I love it I love it give me one give me one

331
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,809
like I'm with the Leeds Rhinos netball team at the moment up in north of England and um we have

332
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:47,190
team talks before we're about to go out on court and play and the coach comes in and speaks to us

333
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,890
all and um ramps us up with a pre-game thing and then she made the mistake of going around and

334
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,549
asking each individual um sort of what they're feeling and then she's like I'm going to go out

335
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:58,349
and how they're going and um what's what their what their main thing they want to get out of the

336
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:02,369
game is and I've just sort of gone on this new nutrition plan and I was so thirsty of me I just

337
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:08,190
said I just want to keep my lips moist uh well the whole changing room erupted and it was just

338
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:14,190
great because it broke the nerves we went out and had the first quarter I love it I love it uh

339
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:18,289
brilliant next dimension I wanted to talk to you about having a positive impact on others and it

340
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:22,670
seems like you do that in every room that you're in I can see that that's something that just

341
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,390
happens when you're around

342
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:28,490
thought about that that impact you have on those in the groups that you're in it's probably not

343
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:34,349
till until I guess recently um and as I've been able to kind of take a step back um obviously

344
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:37,569
been playing that in Australia for the last 15 years in a professional environment and then

345
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:42,289
moving back to England where netball super league is looking to go in that direction but it's not

346
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:47,170
yet um so the pressures and the stresses have been off I've been able to kind of sort of take a step

347
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:53,650
back and reflect and yeah I've been able to kind of um just assess where things are at um and see

348
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:54,549
the impact that I can have on others and I've been able to kind of take a step back and reflect and

349
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:57,529
see the impact that I can have on others and I've got a really sort of young team that I'm a part of

350
00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:01,990
now and how important it is to nurture them how important it is what I say and the interesting

351
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:06,589
thing is in a few meetings and stuff that we have afterwards I hear them reiterating what I've said

352
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:10,309
to them a few weeks before and I'm like oh my gosh they're listening I need to make sure everything

353
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:16,930
I'm saying is is is really valuable um and so I've kind of taken on board myself and I guess mentor

354
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:23,289
by name mentor by nature um into that role of just being able to kind of um lead and know that

355
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:24,549
the impact that I have on others and I've got a really sort of young team that I'm a part of now

356
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:30,509
others is is so important and and also trying to reflect back on what I found was useful when I was

357
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:35,869
maybe their age and or what I could have maybe needed to help open doors earlier to get to where

358
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:41,029
I wanted to be so um yeah I've definitely probably taken it on board a little bit more now with the

359
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:45,210
impact that I can have on others and I think at the end of the day I've always come back to

360
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:50,710
being um having that genuine care um and for me probably empathy is when we speak about those

361
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:54,549
leadership qualities um not all leaders I think have empathy but I think they

362
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:59,769
can associate with it but I think I've definitely had that genuine care along the way and so I will

363
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:04,130
look at the person first and make sure they're in a better place to be able to then combat whatever

364
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:09,250
issue normally within sport that's going on for them and do we see people who've had success like

365
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,190
you have almost everywhere you've gone success has followed have got a really clear vision

366
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:18,150
and understand how they create that and how they share it with others in their team have you got

367
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:23,710
some thoughts on creating and sharing a vision oh um there's something I listened to recently

368
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,529
and they said visualizing the future of the sport and I think that's a really good point

369
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:30,589
is so key to achieving things in success especially within sport and I didn't really

370
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:34,089
think about it too much but it is something that I do a lot of and it actually stemmed right from

371
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:37,609
my trampolining days before we went on the trampoline used to visualize the routine the

372
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:42,049
10 moves that you would perform before you got out closing your eyes got out then onto the

373
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:46,890
trampoline and did that and I feel like the same with within sport yes netball is a long 60 minute

374
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,930
game there's lots of passages of play but you can still get out there and imagine the statue you're

375
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,250
going to take what you're going to do how you're going to sort of present yourself and

376
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:59,069
that is definitely um something or a tool that I've sort of picked up and not realized that it's

377
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:04,329
been quite useful um along the way as I spoke about before it's been able to it may not work

378
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:09,309
for everybody but it's been able to kind of share and help people sort of um unlock what their

379
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:13,970
potential and what their capacity is and what they need to be able to I guess be their best version

380
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:18,230
I dealt with that a little bit more I'm interested so now is that something you're consciously doing

381
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,289
you get up in the morning and visualize the way you're going to play or visualize the success

382
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:24,250
that you want to have you you do that

383
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:27,329
consciously is it part of a routine or is it just something that naturally happens

384
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:31,890
it's actually a fine balance between it for me because I get incredibly nervous still

385
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:36,329
um playing and performing so if I think about things too much I'll stress myself out so I'm

386
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:41,269
a very chilled person come game day some people say I'm so laid back I'm horizontal like I love

387
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:46,630
my neck um I like to switch off so there's an element of that I think for me I'm a big one on

388
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:50,869
making your bed so making sure that that's um nicely done and you've obviously achieved something

389
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:54,529
um when you start the day like that and I think there'll be moments in the day where you're like

390
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:58,890
hey that I will find myself going back to thinking about what I need to do and how I need to execute

391
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:04,589
my game and perform the best for my team as as a player and as a captain and then I'll switch

392
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:08,890
myself off that and I think that's the important part of that being able to switch off because if

393
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:13,190
you stay switched on the whole time you're going to burn energy that you're going to need later on

394
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,230
and that's probably been something that I've learned over the years and as I've been able to

395
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:21,589
handle my nerves whereas before I probably stressed about things so much I got so nervous I

396
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:24,390
over visualized everything that when it came to

397
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:29,890
the performance I sort of crashed or crashed and burned pretty pretty spectacularly a lot of the

398
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:35,329
time you mentioned the word curiosity before it's a common word that that we see in this environment

399
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:40,289
and through curiosity we see people like you always learning and developing themselves

400
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:46,470
does curiosity ring true with you oh absolutely um I think as a leader and yes a grand old age

401
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:50,730
and whatever I've been through um is that you've got to still keep learning um you've got to keep

402
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,529
growing I remember is it last year or so when I'm calling my magpies

403
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:59,269
coaches said to me gee you're a great person to coach you'd think someone with your experience

404
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:03,329
would just come and be like no this is how I've got to do it but she would give me advice and I'd

405
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:08,289
take it on board and we work on different things and I think that's literally it is if you can if

406
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:12,369
you improve to yourself that you can keep evolving and keep growing and keep aiming to get better and

407
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:17,589
yes as an athlete you go over a period of time where you may reach your peak pinnacle physical

408
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:22,769
but that's when your mental can definitely step in and find and fill up those gaps and maybe even

409
00:25:22,769 --> 00:25:24,529
improve yourself as an overall coach.

410
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:28,730
athlete and for me that's that's definitely it I'm staying curious because I want to learn I want

411
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,789
to be better and I find myself moving into different aspects where I'm reading a little

412
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:38,009
bit more I'm just um wanting to learn off more and more people um and that's where leaders being

413
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:42,470
great and but I also think now I'm looking and turning to more the management and the board

414
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:48,509
level and actually these people have similar qualities that I can see within sport but yet

415
00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:54,150
they use it in a management and a business model and yeah so I'm just I find myself just

416
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:59,970
intrigued with life and people and um how I can take little bits from what they're doing and bring

417
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,869
it into where I want to see myself going and what I'm doing now.

418
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:07,950
So we see uh leaders are really conscious of how they communicate with clarity you mentioned

419
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:12,069
earlier that that was a maybe a work in progress for you when you first started out but you're

420
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:17,950
incredibly clear thinking you get your words out uh in a very articulate way is that something

421
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,509
you've worked on?

422
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:21,589
Oh thank you um no I'm still working on

423
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:24,289
yes I think

424
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:28,930
very clear and very sort of probably stubborn knowing what I want to do and where I want to go

425
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:35,970
um but I think it's as I said before I'd love I I get stuck sometimes with those one-liners

426
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:40,009
and fall back on that where actually I just want to stay true and present my words but sometimes

427
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:45,170
they don't make sense to people so I go back to the the one-liners or the generic phrases but um

428
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:50,089
yeah I think for me as I said it's an area that I'd love to improve on because I have got so much

429
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:54,329
up there and as I spoke about before like with the bio there's so much I want to put into that

430
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:58,569
actually what's interest what can people take from that and that's probably the element I'm at in my

431
00:26:58,569 --> 00:27:04,910
life where it's actually just um pulling it all together and putting it in a package or in a way

432
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,710
that people can can take and learn from it as well and and I feel confidently about giving that.

433
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:12,329
How important has collaboration been for you?

434
00:27:12,829 --> 00:27:17,809
Oh it's been huge and um they often say whether you're a sort of an individual player or a team

435
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:21,829
player and I'm definitely a team player through and through and I've really thrive off working

436
00:27:21,829 --> 00:27:24,529
with others um and I've got a competitive edge and I've got a competitive edge and I've got a competitive

437
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:29,490
side but sometimes I just want to see others do well too um I mean don't get me wrong when I'm on

438
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:35,930
the court with my team I want to win um having said that I yeah I just I love the banter the

439
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:41,210
camaraderie that you get within a team sport and um and those memories are often they're the ones

440
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:45,910
that you kind of yes you remember that standing on the podiums and receiving the medals around

441
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:50,549
your neck or holding up the trophies yeah it's the lead up to that and they often and that's

442
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:54,509
this is another cliche one that it's sort of enjoy the journey not just sort of the

443
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:58,029
ending that's definitely something that's run true to me no matter what the goal or the

444
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:02,890
the ending is that as long as you've appreciated and loved and enjoyed and cherished the journey

445
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:09,390
to it um then whatever the goal or the outcome will be um it will be successful um and I've

446
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:14,730
definitely got a lot of memories with some wonderful people um over the years which is um

447
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:21,950
I all hold very true and long into my retirement and post um netballing career um will definitely

448
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,450
um I guess just just

449
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:28,710
uh provide me with those sort of warm fuzzy moments when you go through tough times

450
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:33,650
you've got plenty of those to uh to draw back on uh java who's been the greatest leader in your life

451
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:39,630
oh I struggle with this one because I think I've obviously had some fantastic captains within my

452
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:44,609
sport and I've seen some amazing leaders um being part of multi-organizations and seeing people in

453
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:50,130
um those roles but I've actually been surrounded by some really sort of strong empowering women

454
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:54,490
in my life um I can't go past my mum my auntie and actually my brother's

455
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:57,809
godmother and I was trying to sort of think about the qualities that they have and

456
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:03,069
um they're very strong empowering women they're very organized but they're also very

457
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:09,289
empathetic they're very caring um and almost will go above and beyond um and I think it's

458
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:15,190
those attributes that they have that I see as great leaders because not only can they organize

459
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:21,009
and get things done they can also empower those around them to um find a way through whether

460
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,230
they're going through a tough time or not or um support those without

461
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:29,890
so taking lead and I think it's that aspect that I like and um there's been some things over the

462
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:34,230
years where it's actually as a good leader you actually listen first before you speak and I

463
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:40,190
think that comes into case with with some of those um attributes in a great leader uh for me in terms

464
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:45,049
of being able to um not just go in head first I know the answer follow me everybody but actually

465
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:49,369
just sit back and see what that individual or group needs before you then take action

466
00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:53,890
what a brilliant stroke of luck to have those influences in your life java it sounds like

467
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:58,990
and and you said the godmother of your brother and and auntie to have those power and the words

468
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:04,829
you use to me that's what you are I think all those words the empathy and the care and empowering

469
00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:10,130
others it sounds like uh they've had not only uh a uh an influence but they're going to impact you

470
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:14,650
long lasting by the person that you are it's um it's brilliant to hear if you could collaborate

471
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:18,190
like asking this question final question if you could collaborate with anyone on anything and I

472
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:23,349
know sports been huge part of your life have you thought god love to connect with that person could

473
00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:24,490
be on another passion that we'd like to hear from you and I think that's a great question

474
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:29,670
don't know about is there a name that comes to mind you know what there's probably no name it's

475
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:35,289
probably more industry um and it's someone that's completely away from sport as it is so whether

476
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:40,950
it's a sort of a high rolling ceo or managing director of a big business but someone who's

477
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:47,130
had to kind of gather the team but then inspire be innovative in what they're doing and as I said

478
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,569
I'm in that phase of my life where I'm really just intrigued by people and particularly people

479
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:54,430
away from sport because I feel I see so many similarities and synergies between that

480
00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:59,349
um so no I don't have any I don't have any particular names um but I definitely have

481
00:30:59,349 --> 00:31:02,930
like titles and roles like people within that that next realm

482
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:06,930
is there a specific industry that you're curious about or a bit of everything

483
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:13,769
yeah probably a bit of everything but definitely um definitely business I think also um around like

484
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:19,289
it's quite funny but stock market can be very um individualized but I think it's like a very

485
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:24,490
high risk pressured situation so people in those those situations I know we're

486
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:29,589
I've spoken to a few people from sort of armed forces and um who have had sort of life or death

487
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:33,509
situations I think they're very inspiring people so it's probably an element a little bit back from

488
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:37,990
that but still people who are having to make some really tough decisions um but then gather

489
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:43,730
the team around them. JV you're incredibly inspiring in everything you do we feel really
