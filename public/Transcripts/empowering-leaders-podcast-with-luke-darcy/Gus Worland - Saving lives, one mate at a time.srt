00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,899
A Listener Production.

2
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:09,279
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

3
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:13,179
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,939
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,859
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,600
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,760
in education, sport, industry and the arts

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,739
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

9
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,199
where everyone has a voice.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,780
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:53,579
Gus Wallen is a much-loved Australian television and radio personality.

12
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:55,579
Alongside his great friend Hugh Jackman,

13
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,880
Gus created the Aussie Go series for Foxtel.

14
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,439
For more than a decade, Gus hosted the grill team

15
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:02,179
on Triple M Breakfast Radio in Sydney

16
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:05,439
with rugby league legends Matty Johns and Mark Guyer.

17
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,040
Following the death of a great friend and mentor to suicide,

18
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,959
Gus has become a passionate advocate for men's mental health.

19
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:15,459
In 2017, Gus founded the Gotcha for Life Foundation

20
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:18,260
to support better mental health outcomes for men

21
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:18,959
running professional sports.

22
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,260
He has led programs in communities right across Australia.

23
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:24,340
Gus's leadership in breaking down old stereotypes

24
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,680
of what it is to be a real man has credited positive change

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,959
and led to men connecting better and breaking the silence around suicide.

26
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:35,420
Gus, I genuinely love catching up with you, mate.

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,280
I always feel inspired and I suppose wanting to be better, mate,

28
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:41,340
every time I'm around you.

29
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,120
Thanks for joining me today, mate.

30
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,939
It's a pleasure, mate.

31
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,379
I've loved your series and I really do feel honoured that you have me on.

32
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:48,879
You've had so many wonderful leaders chatting,

33
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,920
so I feel blessed, thank you.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,719
Well, your legacy already is incredible.

35
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,379
Can I go back to that moment?

36
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:58,099
I have spoken to you before.

37
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,480
You lose a great friend.

38
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,879
He's maybe more than that.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,120
He's a mentor, he's a big brother, he was your boss at one stage.

40
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,120
I truly loved him.

41
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:13,280
And I think your thought was if this happy, connected, smart person

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,379
can take his own life, we're all vulnerable.

43
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,699
Can you tell us about it?

44
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:17,099
Yeah.

45
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,939
He was my cousin.

46
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:19,560
He was my cousin's boyfriend.

47
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,800
Then he was my cousin's husband.

48
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,120
And on the day that his third and final child finished their HSC,

49
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,439
which is the year 12 in New South Wales, he took his own life.

50
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:34,300
And up until the moment that he took his own life,

51
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,460
he was thinking about others.

52
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,180
And I think that sort of sums him up.

53
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,340
He had status inside of work, status outside of work.

54
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:46,319
He was good looking, if that matters, wife, three children, much loved.

55
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,560
1,500 of us at his funeral a week later,

56
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,979
we'll tell you how much people loved him.

57
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:55,099
But when it came to the crunch, he couldn't ask for help.

58
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:58,319
He couldn't put his hand up and say, can you help me?

59
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,439
And I think looking back now, all these years on, I think he thought that

60
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,520
his whole existence was about helping others.

61
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,379
And if he showed any vulnerability that would perhaps take a little bit away

62
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:14,280
from him, but of course, as we know now, I'd love to have that moment with him

63
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,180
to say, Hey, I may not be able to fix your brother, but I am on the journey with you.

64
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,360
Let's go and find some solutions.

65
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,759
And that would have been a really cool thing to do because he helped me,

66
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:30,379
Das, with relationship issues, workarounds at work, just times when you're growing up.

67
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,699
And I didn't have a father figure.

68
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,860
My dad had left the family home when I was quite young.

69
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,039
So he was it.

70
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,939
I did my year 10 work experience with him.

71
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:42,180
Then when I was soul searching a bit in my twenties, not quite knowing what to do,

72
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,240
he said, come and work with me at Toshiba.

73
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,520
I ended up working all around the world for him.

74
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:47,879
And, uh,

75
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:51,300
when I got that phone call that day, I was at, in the UK, in London.

76
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,039
And I just literally couldn't believe it.

77
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:54,719
I dropped the phone.

78
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,659
I didn't even hear that he had taken his own life.

79
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:01,879
All I heard was Angus is dead and I collapsed and I, not until I got home,

80
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,939
uh, 20 minutes later, a friend drove me home.

81
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,199
Um, did I realize he had taken his own life?

82
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,039
I got on the next plane to Australia and I went straight to the police.

83
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,259
I said, there's just no way someone like him would take his own life.

84
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:17,819
And Das, that was my first real moment.

85
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:22,379
When a leader within the police put his arm around me and said, I can see you're upset.

86
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,160
Let's just go and have a cup of tea and I'll tell you what the stats are.

87
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,040
And I'll tell you what, what's happening in this country around suicide.

88
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,579
And, uh, that's when I first heard the stats for the first time, seven blokes

89
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:38,500
every day, two women every day, and one every 28 seconds attempting suicide in Australia.

90
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,899
Now, for any of your listeners, you, if you didn't know that they're shocking stats.

91
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:45,839
And I realized then that suicide doesn't discriminate.

92
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:47,699
And the numbers, Gus, you.

93
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:51,779
You've gone to that immediately because I think people still aren't aware.

94
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:54,199
It's the number one killer, 15 to 54 year old males.

95
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:59,279
The most likely thing you'll die from in Australia as a male is of suicide.

96
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,480
You know, we talked to you about the construction workers, the farmers, blue

97
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,500
collar workers are two and a half times the national average, uh, the indigenous

98
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,279
and Torres Strait Islander population is, is just a disaster.

99
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:17,759
And, and then if you factor in the other, uh, groups like the LGP TQI plus community

100
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,259
as well, their, their, their numbers are horrific in this space.

101
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,660
You were angry at your mate initially, weren't you?

102
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,199
You were, you were pissed off.

103
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:31,300
Yeah, I still, on the day that we celebrate, if that's the right word or remember, um,

104
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,339
him taking his own life to us, I, I still shout and scream at the heavens.

105
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:36,319
I, I think he's up there.

106
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,360
I'm not a particularly religious person, but I think if you're, if you're a half decent

107
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,360
person down here, why not think that there's something up there, you know?

108
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,899
Um, so I shout at the heavens and I say to him, why?

109
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:51,839
Nine grandchildren now that he hasn't seen, uh, just one example, his son's just

110
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,740
about to open his fourth coffee shop in the States, you know, two of them in New

111
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,319
York city because he turned up there as a backpacker and couldn't get a decent cuppa.

112
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,959
So he built a young man that didn't then whinge and whine about it.

113
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,980
Went, okay, I reckon I can make a cafe filled with Aussie backpackers as the

114
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:13,459
waiters make, um, Vegemite on toast for these New Yorkers and make a living,

115
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,279
found a beautiful American wife and now is living in the States.

116
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:16,579
So.

117
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:22,899
that's the type of man he was. And I just can't believe that on that particular son's,

118
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:29,120
you know, last day of school, he would take his own life. It just, it saddens me. And I was angry

119
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,579
initially, but that's like everything you learn stuff, don't you? When you, well, hopefully people

120
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:39,319
learn stuff out of tragedy. Well, this is what I love about you, Gus, is that a lot of people have

121
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,220
tragedy in their life. Everyone does really at some point in time and your leadership is

122
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,819
incredible. You know, you can get angry. You've changed your whole life on the basis of that.

123
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,680
You've founded the Gotcha for Life Foundation. It's an incredible contribution. Can you tell us

124
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,100
about what that's about and why that was your answer to it?

125
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:03,060
Well, I basically, as you would know, I was on the same time as you, Triple M Breakfast in Sydney,

126
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,439
when you were on in Melbourne. And we pretty much, I think we started on the same day, actually. Ed

127
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:13,180
and I were, Eddie McGuire and I, the month before we all started, we're off trying to get advertisers

128
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,199
for the shows and stuff. And I was on the same day as Eddie McGuire and I, the month before we all

129
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:21,180
So you and I have been very sort of in sync there. Six years into our breakfast show, I said to

130
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,920
Maddie and MG, who are both big, boofy rugby league players, I said, guys, do you reckon we could spend,

131
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,660
I don't know, a couple of breaks every now and again, talking about a bit of vulnerability.

132
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,160
And they're looking at me going, where's he going here? Because I always will on my heart and my

133
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,220
sleeve. But I said, we've all got bits of ourselves that are either dropping off or not working as

134
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,879
well as they used to. We've all got teenage children. We've all been married for 20 plus

135
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,180
years. We talk about off air about, you know, we've all got bits of ourselves that are either

136
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:50,040
the struggles we have and the difficulties we have. Why can't we talk about that on air? And

137
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,399
they were like, yep, we can do it, but you go first. So I told the story about my friend and

138
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:00,220
the lines at Triple M Sydney lit up. We could not answer the phones quick enough. And we did

139
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,120
something we've never done on Triple M before where we didn't take, we took only phone calls

140
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,399
for an hour and a half. We finished at nearly 10 o'clock in the morning and it wasn't people

141
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:14,120
necessarily ringing me and saying, or ringing us and saying, oh, thanks Gus. It was, oh,

142
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,899
we've got permission this morning to talk about something that we normally don't have permission

143
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:23,060
for. Is this a safe place to put our hand up and go, I lost a friend or I'm worried about a friend

144
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:29,379
or I've lost a family member. So all of a sudden I went, wow, this is pretty cool. And then I was

145
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:34,240
able to get some funding from Movember and they did the man up program with me, which was

146
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,100
challenging masculinity in this country, why we lose so many blokes. And it was my journey on

147
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,559
trying to find out why my friend did what he did. And then at the back of that, as you know,

148
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:49,500
we speak to so many blokes on Triple M. I said, I've got to do more. And I started Gotcha for Life

149
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,120
and we've just ticked over $10 million given away to people that work in suicide prevention. It's

150
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,960
all about preventing, it's stopping people jumping in the river, not fetching them out downstream.

151
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:06,299
It's about letting people know that it's all right to challenge the rules on what it takes to be a

152
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:09,940
man and a woman in this country. It started off very much male, but now it's all Australians.

153
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:13,019
And we need to teach people through education,

154
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:16,759
that it's all right to challenge a few of these rules because they are archaic.

155
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,820
One of them, for instance, just as an example for you and your listeners,

156
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,059
emotions, why we keep burying them. Why can't we talk about them? And it's all about

157
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:29,019
doing it at the right time, of course, still having resilience and hard work, but

158
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:33,340
actually going, no, no, I need to find someone I can talk to about how I feel because

159
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,559
it was really affecting my life. And you're a great living example. You get a

160
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,639
guswell and hug when you're in your old company, mate. It makes me smile every time. And even that

161
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,460
is a breaking down of...

162
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,500
Of stereotypes.

163
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,960
No more handshakes, mate.

164
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,940
Mate, I love it, mate.

165
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:47,960
Let's have a cuddle.

166
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:51,200
I'm not a natural hugger, but you make me a natural hugger when I'm around you.

167
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:54,480
I must say, Darce, you could work on your hug a little bit.

168
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,519
I've got to take feedback.

169
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,779
You're a little stiff.

170
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:57,440
A little bit stiff.

171
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,340
A little stiff, but hey, you've got potential.

172
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,539
It's a work in progress, mate.

173
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:03,200
It is, yeah.

174
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,139
There's probably four or five mates in my life like you who are huggers, and it's great because

175
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:13,159
you just know that's part of the deal and it should be. And then these are the stereotypes,

176
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:18,779
you said, Gus, that we joke about. I want to come back to Triple M and how we've been

177
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:23,500
accused in lots of ways of being part of the problem in the past as opposed to part of

178
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,539
the solution. But those stereotypes are literally killing males, aren't they?

179
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:34,799
Absolutely. It's a stereotype that is literally killing males and females. Don't forget, it's

180
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:41,159
seven-two in terms of per day, but the one every 28 seconds, they're predominantly females.

181
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:43,360
So it is a problem...

182
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,659
Those are the attempts to take...

183
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:44,899
Correct.

184
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,399
So females do that more than males.

185
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,820
Correct. More of a cry for help from the girls from a lot of the time, but their numbers are

186
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,220
much higher in terms of trying to attempt. So that's an issue for all of us and everyone in

187
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:56,460
between.

188
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:59,799
65,000 Australians a year attempt to take their life is the status.

189
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:04,899
That's right. So you think about it, 65,000 people on top of the nine a day that are taking

190
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:10,019
their life. And we celebrated for a New York Minute a month or so ago when the numbers came

191
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:13,279
out for 2020. We had a 5.4% drop in.

192
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,860
Yeah.

193
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,799
And we were losing 3,000 people on the roads. We were losing 3,000 people less than the

194
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:21,419
year before, but still over 3,000 people. So if we were losing 3,000 people, Dars, on

195
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:26,320
the roads, they would make cars illegal. Simple fact is this is happening and most people

196
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,360
don't even know about it.

197
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:33,700
And the old mentality was you don't talk about suicide because it will encourage other people

198
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,639
to think about it. We know that the data on that is complete rubbish.

199
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:37,919
Yeah.

200
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:38,500
We have to...

201
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,779
Let's normalise the conversation.

202
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:41,139
We have to have these conversations, Gareth.

203
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:41,419
Yeah.

204
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:43,320
We're not that big on breaking down that silence on suicide.

205
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,679
Correct. And you've been a massive help on your program on the House of Wellness, being

206
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,259
able to come on like we do and have the support that we do to be able to do our work. To go

207
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:57,500
on like Channel 7 and to be able to talk about suicide, that's the new S word. You can say

208
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,980
S-H-I-T more than you can say suicide. So we need to break down that stereotype, normalise

209
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:08,779
the conversation. And like I said, it comes back to prevention through education. That's

210
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:13,019
the only way I reckon we can move forward. Leaders like yourself, a lot of people you'd

211
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,840
call friends who are leaders in the community, them stepping up and putting their hand up

212
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,700
and saying, you know what? It's all right to lead with some vulnerability because I'm a

213
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,980
human being. That's the key. That's what we need to get through to people.

214
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:27,879
So Gus, let me go back to the shared space where you and I have crossed over in Triple

215
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:34,639
M Radio and unashamedly, it's blokey, unashamedly, the audience is talking to majority of males

216
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,899
and occasionally people from the outside will say, well, hang on a minute. You guys think

217
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:42,940
that you're the new age open version of yourselves, but all you do is hang shit on.

218
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:48,019
Now, to me, coming out of sport, that is our humour. That is the sense of humour. But

219
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:52,639
have we got that wrong? Can you do what we do, Gus? Because when you're working with

220
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,320
Matty Johns and Mark Dyer, I'm working with Mick Malloy and all my mates from calling

221
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,620
the foot in the weekend, that is part of how we connect with each other. Is that still

222
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,299
okay as long as there is that emotional connection as well and support? Where's the balance?

223
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,340
Yeah, it's a tough balance to have. And I understand people and I sat up in front of

224
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,779
people at Triple M in Sydney the other day, all our big sponsors, you know, all the ones

225
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:21,639
that you'd hear on the station. And I actually said to them, we need to change the way that

226
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:25,960
we are. And then we had an incident in Sydney, whether your listeners know about it or not.

227
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,659
Good friend of yours, Anthony Maroon. Is that the one you're talking about?

228
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,240
Exactly.

229
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,580
Who decided that he'd had enough and that had gone too far and the on-air sledging,

230
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:38,820
he walked out and has decided not to come back into that slot. So that clearly went

231
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,879
too far in his mind.

232
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:42,980
Yeah. And I'd heard back the audio and I get where

233
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:46,799
everyone's coming from. But at some stage, we've got to realize that if someone says,

234
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,519
no, I'm not comfortable anymore, then that's the end of it.

235
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:50,820
Yeah.

236
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,779
And then, and you, as you know, you can have a discussion on air. Then we go to a song every

237
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,340
four or five minutes, right? Well, maybe not so much with you and Eddie, because he'd

238
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:03,039
wrap it on for longer. But the point is there is a moment there where that ends and you

239
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:07,639
can have a song and you can take your headphones off and you can say, hey, you've gone too

240
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:12,639
far there. You know, you've been very strong in a very emotional moments that we don't

241
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,000
have to go back and forth.

242
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,960
We don't have to go back over with Adam Goodes when you were really strong under a lot of

243
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,039
pressure. Because I know how easy it is to support your mate on air because that's what

244
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:26,299
you're meant to do. But if you absolutely know who you are, you should be able to draw

245
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:30,460
a line and a barrier to say, okay, we've gone over it now. Or you know what? Today's not

246
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,179
the day. You know, I've had an emotional day and whatever. And that means you need to be

247
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:38,600
a bit flexible and fluid. Triple M have got to understand that being a man is different

248
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,600
now than what it was when we were born in 1980. It doesn't mean we have to, you know,

249
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:47,539
have a deep and meaningful every time we talk or have a burst down in tears. But it

250
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:52,039
means that we've got that level now of understanding and a bit of vulnerability so we can push

251
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:56,320
the ante, but don't go over the top of it. Especially, Das, when someone says, I've had

252
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,100
enough today. You've got to respect the barrier. I've spoken to Hamish and Andy's. You would

253
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:06,620
have a lot, you know, radio icons in this country. And they had a rule because their

254
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,919
version of that was equally brilliant. They would constantly be winding each other up

255
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,000
and blindsiding.

256
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:17,200
Blindsiding each other on air and, you know, incredible radio people, great people to meet.

257
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,899
But they had this rule. Like if, if they stepped them up, they didn't go back on air, even

258
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:25,340
they meant they played three songs. We're going to sort out, we'll never go back without,

259
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,840
if I feel like you've overstepped the mark. And so, as you said, it means that there is

260
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,340
an opportunity, isn't there?

261
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,340
Yes.

262
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:37,120
To be able to discuss something and say, okay, we're all good now and move on. And I, I had

263
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,019
the view that, you know, you're not trying hard enough if you're not having fun in that

264
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:42,019
space.

265
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:43,019
Yeah.

266
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,019
Yeah.

267
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:47,019
But at the end of the day, I mean, who wants to, who wants to hurt someone to the point

268
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:49,620
when they want to continue to work? I mean, there's no fun in that.

269
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,940
No, exactly. And a few people just need to understand that we're not living in a locker

270
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,200
room either. Like I'm a sports fan and I've always worked with sporty people at the moment,

271
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:04,019
Jude Bolton, Wendell Saylor, like you say, Matty and MG beforehand. I watched as many

272
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:08,059
games as they played. I loved watching them play. Sometimes I was for them, sometimes

273
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:12,820
against them, but as a supporter, but I don't understand that locker room. I don't understand

274
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:17,779
that. And I've had plenty of times with Matty where I go, Matty, I don't know what's going

275
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:22,440
on today. Like, are you joking? Or because I'm, you know what it's like in brekkie, you

276
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,200
know, and I don't mind putting my hand up and saying, I'm just really confused today.

277
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,700
Like are we mate still, or are you just in a bad mood or whatever? And we had, we were

278
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,080
on air together for eight years and we had a couple of blow ups. But as soon as I put

279
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:40,820
my hand up and said, mate, I don't know where we're going here. Can you help me with this?

280
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,820
He would go, I'm sorry, mate.

281
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,659
And I thought we were still having a laugh because he didn't know. I haven't come from

282
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:50,779
your world. I would love to have played a game of test cricket for Australia or a game

283
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:56,299
of footy or play for the Hawks or whatever, but I wasn't. So you've got to give us non-sporty

284
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:59,320
blokes a break because it's a different world to where we came from.

285
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,840
And Gus, it's a really good point because you're in a competitive environment, in a

286
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,279
locker room, it's as robust as you could possibly imagine. And so your exchanges aren't really

287
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,279
normal.

288
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,279
That's right.

289
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,799
Sometimes, even though I always felt there was a lot of love and a lot of, um, you know,

290
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:16,440
friendship below it, perhaps, you know, not using the language as well as, as you're teaching

291
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,579
us to do now, Gus, but then someone else from outside comes in and it's a bit like, what

292
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,579
the hell is going on here?

293
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,579
That's right.

294
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:28,119
You know, that was, you know, a term of endearment that maybe isn't perceived that, that way.

295
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,799
So you, you've gone out and spoken in communities. You've gone into the Kimberleys and spoken

296
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:39,160
to the toughest of, of cowboys and regional and rural area. Are we finding a way, Gus,

297
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,799
for, for, for males to understand that?

298
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,279
Do we need to speak up?

299
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,480
I definitely think so, Darce, a hundred percent. But the longer you stay in that uncomfortable

300
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,759
silence and vulnerability, the better you'll end up being, because at the end of the day,

301
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:58,099
we are all human beings and just underneath the surface, everywhere I've been, literally,

302
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:03,039
if you scratch that surface and then you stay in that safe place enough, people will tell

303
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,539
you the truth. They will tell you how they truly feel. And they will fear, and they will

304
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:11,700
tell you straight up that they are trying to be something that they're thinking that

305
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,039
they've got to be, but really at the end of the day, they are just a human being and

306
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,759
they've got these feelings and they've got these thoughts. And it just depends if it

307
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:23,380
comes out in 10 minutes or it comes out in 10 days, or I've had people that I've spoken

308
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,640
to and a year later, they go, I get exactly what you feel now, because I was, I showed

309
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:35,640
enough courage to tell someone how I truly feel. And now my life is so much lighter.

310
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,359
The simple fact is we don't do that enough. You know, and I say to people, just find one

311
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:41,480
person in your friendship group.

312
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,480
Yeah.

313
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,559
And make them special. That gotcha for life friend, that one person you can talk to warts

314
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,920
and all about anything. You don't need to tell everyone because some of your mates just

315
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,160
won't get it. But if you start building those relationships, then you'll never worry alone.

316
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:00,279
And to us, worrying alone and leaders in particular, they worry alone all the time. So if you find

317
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:05,000
someone you can just be normal with, warts and all conversation with no judgment, then

318
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,400
you are so much better off than everyone else who worries alone too much.

319
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,819
It's a great line that you've got. I mean, I love the whole concept of gotcha for life.

320
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:11,319
Yeah.

321
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,099
Isn't it? And if you have got a friend in your life like that, you don't take that for

322
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:21,299
granted anymore because you articulate it really well. And that worrying alone is where

323
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:26,200
you lose great people like your great friend Angus. And so that is the message you've been

324
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:33,420
pushing, isn't it? Is to find someone. A great friend of yours, Hugh Jackman, has been one

325
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,759
of those gotcha for life friends, I assume, Gus, right the way through. Can you tell me

326
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,480
about that special friendship for you?

327
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
Yeah.

328
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
So five years old, Pimble Public School, up in the hard school.

329
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,480
Yeah.

330
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:47,619
In the streets of the North Shore of Sydney, which believe me, we're not. And we remember

331
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:52,660
the first day when the kindy teacher, Mrs. Fairbrother said, okay, grab one of you, grab

332
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:58,599
one of the other students and by the hand and walk into the class. And I happened to

333
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:03,519
get hands with the Wolverine. And we went all the way through, best man at each other's

334
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:09,720
wedding, did our 18th birthdays and 21st birthday speeches. And when I had Jack before he had

335
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Oscar, he was godfather.

336
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,319
Yeah.

337
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:16,700
Godfather. And I'm Oscar, his first adopted child's godfather. I spoke to him only an

338
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:22,460
hour or so ago. He just, in fact, today it was no show for him because it was Sunday

339
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,500
night, but he'd just gone for dinner with the kids and was getting some New York cheesecake

340
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,960
and they were going to watch Big, the movie Big. Like he's just very normal. You wouldn't

341
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:37,000
expect that probably. But we became great friends right from the start. And I suppose

342
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,460
our friendship has never, ever been anything but like a best friend.

343
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:47,119
And now even more so. And he spoke at a big relationship summit only the other day. And

344
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,740
I got all these new followers all of a sudden because obviously he spoke about our relationship

345
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,980
and that I literally, I chipped him a few times. You know, I said, you know, not contacting

346
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,940
me for a week is not good enough. Like I've got stuff on and I've contacted you and you

347
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,480
haven't contacted me back. And it sounds like a bit needy, but you should be a bit needy

348
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,299
with your best friends. I don't mean being vulnerable and saying, I need your advice

349
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:09,599
today.

350
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:14,940
Like I'm struggling. I'm tired. I think I might make a blue if I show too much emotion.

351
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,319
So call me back. And all of a sudden that our relationship, he went, you know what? He's

352
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:25,920
never had anyone since he became Wolverine tell him what to do except Deb. But you know

353
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:31,240
what I mean? He's like, he's the most wonderful person, literally the most wonderful person,

354
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,539
the most generous person in the world, but he's not perfect. And as me, as a friend,

355
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:39,539
I needed something. And that was five years ago. And our friendships continued.

356
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,440
And I'm very fortunate that we've been able to have a relationship. And I'm very fortunate

357
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,460
that we've been able to have a relationship. And I'm very fortunate that we've been able

358
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:41,599
to have a relationship. And I'm very fortunate that we've been able to have a relationship.

359
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,680
The way that we treat each other, the way that we just are honest with each other and the

360
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,099
way that we respect each other. Um, yeah, I'm very fortunate.

361
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,539
He's a board member of, of got you for life. You film your first series for Foxtel. He's

362
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,819
the producer behind it, Gus.

363
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:01,640
Well, that was one of the great stories because he was doing a movie for Woody Allen in London

364
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,380
and he rang me up. He said, I've just met Ricky Ponting. I said, Ricky Ponting, are

365
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,579
you kidding? He goes, man, I'm walking along the street, going down, you know, I'm walking

366
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,299
to Harrods. Ricky Ponting comes out of the department store with his wife. He said, I

367
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:18,039
just can't believe it. And he was just, I said, slow down. He goes, okay. Okay. Takes

368
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:21,019
a breath. He goes, he said, can we go, do you want to come to the cricket on Saturday?

369
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:23,880
The boys would love to see, why don't you come in after the test match and meet the

370
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,039
boys, have a beer. And I said, are you telling me that Ricky Ponting said that we can go

371
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:30,400
to Lords? Cause I put the Royal We in there, right?

372
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,400
I'm in here.

373
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:36,680
Yeah, I'm in. I was in Lincolnshire. So I was only in my head. I'm already on the, on

374
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,220
the, on the train down to London. This was on a Wednesday.

375
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,640
And he goes, yep. He said, there's going to be tickets left at the gate. And then at

376
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:49,240
the end of day's play, here's a number for the assistant manager. Meet at this gate and

377
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,839
you come.

378
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,000
See, I love the fact that Hugh Jackman's that excited to meet Ricky Ponting. I mean, that's,

379
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:57,059
people wouldn't understand. You're both cricket fanatics.

380
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,500
Absolute cricket tragics, right? So Jacko goes, so he goes, you win. I said, mate, absolutely.

381
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:06,700
I'll come down on the Friday. This was a Saturday, 2005 series. So that was going to be day four

382
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,380
of the test match. Beautiful. He said, I'll get my,

383
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:09,579
my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,

384
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:12,700
my brother and my uncle to come as well. So the four of us there, we're watching the

385
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,680
cricket, Australia on top, about four wickets left to get the next day. So the test match

386
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,200
was pretty much over, go one nil up, 2005 series, which ended up being one of the great

387
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,759
series. We walk around and everyone chickens out except Jacko and I. The uncle goes, I

388
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,400
don't want to be in the Australian dressing room because he's a pom. And Ralph, Jacko's

389
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,339
brother, who's an absolute legend. If you think Jacko's good, then Ralph's even nicer

390
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:36,759
bloke. Anyway, he goes, I just don't feel comfortable. I think the dressing room's for

391
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:39,319
the Australian cricketers. And I'm like, all right, see you later.

392
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:45,180
So up the stairs we go and we open up the door and all of a sudden all these idols,

393
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,339
like Warnie was in the nude. Brett Lee was in an ice bath. Stuart McGill at the time

394
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:53,920
was wandering around getting on drinks. Hayden and Langer in the corner, just talking cricket.

395
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,660
McGrath was over there talking to Gillespie. And we're looking around and they look up

396
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:04,339
and it's like, they're looking at Jacko going, oh my God, Hugh Jackman's here. And then Jacko's

397
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:07,839
looking around going, oh my God, the Australian cricketer's here. And then Ricky Ponting comes

398
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:08,940
over with a towel around him and goes.

399
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:14,539
G'day Hugh, thanks so much for coming. And I'm going, oh my God, that's Ricky Ponting.

400
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,099
And I'm looking around this. Anyway, two and a half hours later, he's taken every photograph

401
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:25,359
with them. They've taken photographs with him. Players have rung up their wives and

402
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,259
said, Hugh Jackman's in the dressing room. I'll put him on. It was this mutual love in.

403
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,099
And I spent on that old balcony that you would recognise from watching the cricket, that

404
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:37,559
little balcony where the players sit. Ricky Ponting still with his towel around him. Hadn't

405
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,200
gone to the shower. Two and a half hours later.

406
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:42,500
Two and a half hours later, talking to us out on the balcony. For at least an hour of

407
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,539
that, it was me. And I must've said four times to him, I don't want to hold you up if you

408
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:50,539
want to have a shower. And he goes, no, no, mate, I'm all good. And we just chatted. We

409
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:54,259
both left with a Matty Hayden, grey nickels cricket bat. And we were like shadow boxing

410
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:58,359
as we're waiting for Jacko's limo to come around the corner to pick us up that had been

411
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:02,839
waiting there since six o'clock. This is 8.30. They had to go because they still needed four

412
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:08,700
wickets the next morning. So we then go home. Jacko then goes, you know what? We've got

413
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,299
to give everything.

414
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:13,559
I'm an Australian cricket supporter like you and I, that experience, if we can. I wonder

415
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:18,079
how we can do that. Nothing else has spoken about for a year. We end up losing that test

416
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:22,799
series. Jacko's back in Australia, reading the Daily Telegraph in Sydney. And it says

417
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,799
one year to redemption. It was one year before the Poms were coming back out again. Got him

418
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:32,660
thinking and goes, rings me and goes, I reckon we can pitch a show to Brian Walsh at Foxtel.

419
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:37,579
Why don't we call it like an Aussie goes, Bahami, or you can live with the Bahami. I go,

420
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,299
what? Did you say you can live?

421
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:43,960
I guess, mate, you're 38 now. You've always wanted to be on telly. I reckon we can do it.

422
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,680
And I'm like, you reckon? Anyway, a couple of months later, David Ginjo at the time was

423
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,539
with this production company. Jacko pitched it to Brian.

424
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,319
Brian said yes.

425
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:54,599
Channel 9 at the time. Yeah, of course.

426
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:59,200
Exactly. And all of a sudden we are up and running and I leave my job at Toshiba. They

427
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,079
give me six months off because everyone thinks this is going to be a lead balloon and whatever.

428
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,740
Anyway, six months later, that show comes out and Aussie goes, Bahami, it goes well.

429
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,019
Yeah.

430
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:14,140
And Aussie goes, Bali, which I went to India, which is where Andrew Simons and I became

431
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:18,220
really close because we had the monkey gate over there and I was there and we got the

432
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,460
footage of them doing what they did to him and me just abusing him back. And he saw that

433
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,200
and that got us really well connected. And then an Aussie goes, Calypso, where we went

434
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,599
to the West Indies. And then I was actually in these studios here at Triple M Melbourne

435
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:35,960
promoting an Aussie goes, Calypso. And the boss of Triple M was in a cab at the time,

436
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,299
Dobbo, Guy Dobson, who was a weird lead.

437
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:44,920
In his own right. Coming in in a taxi from the airport to the radio station. And he said,

438
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,819
that bloke can tell a story. We need a new breakfast show in Sydney. So I'm going to

439
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:54,140
offer him the breakfast show gig. And that's how it all started. So from 38 nothing, now

440
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,900
53. That's how all that experience came.

441
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:02,900
It's boys own annual stuff there, Gus, isn't it? To get on the inside. And I love it, isn't

442
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:08,420
it? Because you can tell me how normal Hugh Jackman is and clearly the friendships you

443
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,259
form in the Australian cricket.

444
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:14,059
And what I love also now, that continues on. Steve Smith's got a great relationship

445
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:18,299
with you, another Australian cricket legend. He's been kind enough to go with you into

446
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:22,460
schools. I've seen some of the vision of that, Gus, getting back to your passion for mental

447
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:27,579
health space, to see superstar cricketers with the next best batting average alongside

448
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:31,779
Don Bradman come into a school and talk about his own battles with mental health. Tell us

449
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:36,220
about how important those stories are and what it's done for some of the next generation.

450
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,299
Yeah. So Smithy, obviously, with what happened in South Africa.

451
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:45,700
Got the year ban. He had 100 hours as part of that ban to do community service. And he

452
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,980
rang me and said, look, I just don't want to go and do what would be easy, like just

453
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,119
go to clubs and show kids how to bat and that type of stuff. I actually want to tell him

454
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:58,220
a story. Do you reckon there's something we can do around Gotcha for Life? Because he's

455
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:03,980
always been a fan of that. And I said, Smithy, the only way this will work is if you're

456
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:08,880
fair dinkum. If you walk in there to a school and you waffle a little bit and you don't

457
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,299
quite answer.

458
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:12,940
Answer all the questions. It's a complete waste of time for everyone. And it's just

459
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:19,079
a ticking of the box on the hundred hours. You've got to literally tell the truth and

460
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:24,180
give these kids a lesson on what it takes to be a proper leader, i.e. putting your hand

461
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:28,039
up and going, I made a mistake and this is what I'm going to do about it. And I'm going

462
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,240
to cop what's coming my way. You've also got to remember that it was a much bigger deal

463
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,640
in Australia when it happened than what was over in South Africa. By the time he arrived

464
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,079
back from South Africa with Bancroft.

465
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:45,099
And, and Warner, the ICC had given them a one match ban. That was it. So all of a sudden

466
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:48,099
we've got Turnbull, the prime minister at the time saying, well, they've got to be sacked

467
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:52,839
and they should never play for Australia again. It was a huge thing over here. He walked into

468
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:57,579
that and went, oh my God, this is much bigger than I thought. But he had his dad, he had

469
00:28:57,579 --> 00:29:02,940
his manager, he had his best mate at the time, his fiance now wife, all of them saying to

470
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,759
him, get ready for this. We're here for you, but this is going to be bigger than you think.

471
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:08,880
So he told that story in front of kids.

472
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,319
In front of kids. The moment when he broke down, if people can remember, any of your

473
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:16,160
listeners, remember them breaking down at the press conference at Sydney airport when

474
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,259
his dad put his hand on his shoulder, showing that vulnerability. He cried two or three

475
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:24,180
times when I was with schools. We've done 48 schools together now. His hundred hours

476
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,579
was over years ago. He's been back on the team for three years. He just goes, Gussie,

477
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,759
I've got a week off here and there because his schedule's ridiculous. Book us in a school,

478
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,599
book us in, let's do a video so we can send out to all the clubs in Australia. Like he's,

479
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,859
he's now producing what he wants to do.

480
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,059
What he wants to do with us, but it only comes because he's fed income. Never worn

481
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:47,539
his heart on his sleeve as much as he has done over the last few years. And when he

482
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:51,900
got the captaincy from Pat Cummins in the Adelaide day night test match, when it, when

483
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:58,200
Cummins had the COVID, I cried in the triple M dressing room that morning. I then got a

484
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,700
chance to interview him after the test was won. He is such a better leader now and a

485
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,859
better human being now because of what he went through. However, he's now, he's now

486
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,700
the perfect deputy for someone like Cummins, who's exactly what cricket needs. So he's

487
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:18,480
tucked his ego aside and he's worked out leadership comes through vulnerability. And that's really

488
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,960
what I talk to a lot of leaders about now is it's all right to puff your chest out.

489
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:27,720
It's great to be resilient and hardworking, but vulnerability and being human and being

490
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,059
authentic, that's where people want to be led now, especially the younger generations.

491
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,500
It's a great conversation, Gus, and you're so well equipped for this conversation because

492
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,880
you spend a lot of time on it.

493
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:37,980
Thank you.

494
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,000
Thank you.

495
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,019
Thank you.

496
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:38,039
Thank you.

497
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:38,059
Thank you.

498
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:38,119
Thank you.

499
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:38,180
Thank you.

500
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:38,200
Thank you.

501
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,220
Thank you.

502
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:38,259
Thank you.

503
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:38,279
Thank you.

504
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:38,299
Thank you.

505
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:38,339
Thank you.

506
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:38,359
Thank you.

507
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:38,420
Thank you.

508
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:38,859
Thank you.

509
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:38,920
Thank you.

510
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:40,140
Thank you.

511
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,259
Thank you.

512
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:40,299
Thank you.

513
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:40,339
Thank you.

514
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:40,440
Thank you.

515
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:40,460
Thank you.

516
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:40,599
Thank you.

517
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:40,680
Thank you.

518
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:40,740
Thank you.

519
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:40,759
Thank you.

520
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:42,519
Jesus, it's a hard task now, isn't it?

521
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:47,480
Because we need to be vulnerable, but we need to also, you know, be strong at times as well.

522
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:50,920
You know, the best description I've heard of it, and I think about it all the time, Steve

523
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,420
Biddle for the legendary author, Raising Boys, Raising Girls, sold 4 million books.

524
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,960
He's on my board as well.

525
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,079
Is he watered champion?

526
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:58,920
If you can get hold of him, mate.

527
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:00,759
He's on his farm in Tassie.

528
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,380
He was kind enough to join me on the podcast.

529
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,059
Did he come in here?

530
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:04,819
It was here in Melbourne.

531
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:05,660
Didn't get him in Melbourne.

532
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,660
great way of describing this because as you know legend he's gone around and spoken to thousands

533
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:19,319
and millions of people and he tells a story about predominantly female audiences for him

534
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:23,559
wanting to learn about parenting he asked the girls what what makes the perfect man he said

535
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:27,839
you know they start off with brad pitt or gus warman yeah at the start and then and then they

536
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,359
when they break it down they start saying i want someone who's got some empathy i want someone with

537
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:36,140
some vulnerability but i don't want to you know but it's soft cock either i wanted to have some

538
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:41,880
you know and so he he describes it as you know heart and spine or heart and backbone i think of

539
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,259
the two it's not a bad way to think about is it for us males it's also it's important but if we

540
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:51,940
don't leave with some heart along the way yeah we're not really going to be anything it's confusing

541
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:56,400
though it's really confusing at the moment i remember talking to my grandfather before he passed

542
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:02,220
and he goes it was easy for me i put on my suit put my hat on i went off to work i read the paper

543
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,119
on the tram or the train depending on where he was living at the time i went to work

544
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:12,079
i brought home a pay packet i put i went got home and your grandma had dinner on the table

545
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:19,259
the house was tidy blah blah blah and he looked around at our life before he passed and he's like

546
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:24,400
wow there's a lot going on here my wife's working i'm working kids are a little bit all over the

547
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,819
shop the house doesn't look in that flash it doesn't bother me but for him it was like so

548
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:34,160
confused he goes so who does what i go whoever can do whatever they can do whenever they can

549
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,099
do it and if things don't get done that's okay

550
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:42,359
but that's when i talk to a lot of blokes now they are they're sad they're confused and they

551
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:48,099
are worried that they'll never quite be good enough and that's the thing that makes me sad

552
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:53,460
about talking to as many blokes as i did as i do i spoke to a really posh school up in sydney the

553
00:32:53,460 --> 00:33:01,319
other day it was a day it was a dad son night 230 dads 230 sons at this school that had always said

554
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:06,099
no to any mental fitness which is what i call mental health they they said

555
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:09,599
you know what we've got our own stuff we don't need you thanks very much but they brought us in

556
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,200
i walked out with the headmaster two hours later he walked me to his car

557
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,220
he said that could be the most significant night that i've ever had as a teacher now this bloke

558
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:24,920
is a headmaster now has been through 30 years of experience to see dads walk in looking as about

559
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:31,180
as interested as or disinterested i should say as as you can imagine to an hour and a half later

560
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,920
looking their sons in the eyes crying hugging some of them getting up at

561
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:41,259
too much and then coming back again and realizing what a moment this was this connection where you

562
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:47,119
could actually just be human that's the key being human for some reason we've thrown away

563
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:52,420
what it takes to be human we've just gone well this is these are the rules no no these are the

564
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:56,519
rules that you can set now i go to schools and say what an opportunity for you guys and your

565
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:00,720
generation to go we're not doing it that way anymore we're doing it this way and you can

566
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,819
teach granddad you can teach dad that that what an opportunity that must be when i went through

567
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:12,599
153 i got put in my box do your bloody job if not you're out now these kids have got this sort of

568
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:17,900
fluid thing use it as an opportunity rather than something that's too confusing but you know i live

569
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,059
in this space i understand that's easier said than done the beauty of it gus is it is a learned

570
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:27,260
skill again isn't it we're having a lot of these conversations on this format uh this this this

571
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,000
piece around you're actually going to learn to connect again you've got to do what you do i mean

572
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,099
you get a text message from gus just checking in mate how are you you know i've got you for life

573
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:42,179
you know they're they're stuff that's practical that you can do and you think about the upshot

574
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:47,480
you know i look at our generation and how connected we are to our kids you know you're a father of

575
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,659
three you know i feel sorry for our grandparents and because they you know they had it easier in

576
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:59,820
one way but they probably didn't get in and get the genuine joy that we get by actually having

577
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:05,000
some equity around the family and tell me about about that gus your leadership as a dad i know

578
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,920
you're a passionate father

579
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:13,559
how do you approach that well das i've had my life has changed so much since the man up program

580
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:18,579
and i gave myself an uppercut one morning and went mate you're going down the wrong path here

581
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:23,000
trying to be a little bit you know like this is the way it is you know my way or the highway type

582
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,139
thing so i remember and if people watch the man up program it's brilliant by the way thank you

583
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:32,559
you can do it abc i view you yeah they've still got it five years later still got them streaming

585
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:41,460
amazing we gave the way to the world through covid and a lot of people i think found a podcast

586
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:47,559
found a book found a tv show in in in lockdown or in moments where we slowed down a bit to go

587
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:51,579
i need a bit of help here i wonder if i can find something we'll find this if you haven't

588
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:57,519
before it's a brilliant three-part series mate i loved it educational what why do you need to

00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:04,739
give yourself an uppercut because episode two i'm sitting off camera watching my son and 15 of his

590

good to go because my wife's a teacher so she went i went and saw the headmaster he seems a nice

597
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:42,539
let's give it a go so i'd known these boys in this piece for oh since primary school so six or

598
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:46,900
seven years and i saw this facility out of tom harkin and when you're talking about leadership

599
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:53,159
you should talk to him he is a boy whisperer he's incredible how he makes a room safe enough to boys

600
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:59,460
to feel safe and he sat down and i'm off camera looking through a monitor and i see my son and all

601
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:04,940
these boys that i love his best mates in floods of tears within 20 minutes they walked in thinking

602
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:10,199
this is a goof off a couple of hours off school and they just went they just knocked them for six

603
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:15,039
once boys being vulnerable talking about their feelings talking about the problems i have at

604
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:19,539
home with mum and dad not so well or someone not being someone being sick or the relationship's

605
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:25,619
just about to burst and seeing my son who i'd never thought have have any drama all of a sudden

606
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:30,699
to realize he was worrying alone about all this stuff yeah so i went home with him that afternoon

607
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:34,920
and i said mate i saw what happened because he didn't see me i was in another room and i was

608
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:41,400
watching it on a monitor and he goes oh yeah and i go so what is it that you worry about brother like

609
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,739
you know that mum and dad are always here for you we love you whatever you need and he goes i know

610
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:50,639
all that dad but i just don't know if i'm going to be a man or like if i'm going to be a good man

611
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:58,380
and i'm like what do you mean in this full-on thing conversation for an hour and he says at

612
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:04,519
the end of it i honestly thought dad at 18 i needed to have all the answers and i said mate

613
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:10,239
still fumbling and bumbling my way through life like you ask me a question i will bullshit you

614
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:15,079
more than actually knowing the answer but i'll use some experience and i'll use a little bit of

615
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:19,260
knowledge and common sense and i'll give you oh you know i'll give you a decent ride along and

616
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,420
i'll probably be able to help you with that stuff but you don't need to worry about having answers

617
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:28,559
mate he goes yeah but you gotta drive you gotta vote you gotta drink you gotta i said yeah it

618
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:34,699
takes ages like forever to actually know what you're talking about to us the pressure that

619
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:34,920
came from me and dad was like i don't know what you're talking about i don't know what you're

620
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:34,960
talking about i don't know what you're talking about i don't know what you're talking about

621
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:41,820
off my son's shoulders that day i could just see it he just went oh it's okay and i went yes it is

622
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,619
and that's just so many boys at the moment probably looking at fathers that are listening

623
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:51,119
to your podcast who are looking at their dads thinking their dads are absolutely james bond

624
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,280
or absolutely this is the way that you need to lead your life because those fathers have never

625
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,420
been truly human with them to say hey i'm doing my best here and you know what the most important

626
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:04,860
thing is your mother your your brother you and your sister whoever the makeup

627
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,780
might be having those conversations where you're actually vulnerable all of a sudden

628
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,940
the pressure's off your kid you don't want to keep putting pressure on your kids i

629
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:21,059
that's like i spoke to a father the other day who had four acceptances at university in front of him

630
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:25,579
on the coffee table on one side of the coffee table he's on the other this boy had taken his

631
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:31,519
own life before his hsc results had come back he thought that he had failed because of the exams

632
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,739
and how they went and now this father whose wife has left him

633
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,940
because she believes that he put too much pressure on the child

634
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:43,300
he's now got these four acceptances sydney uni union new south wales like all the big ones

635
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:50,420
in new south wales and his son didn't even hang around for the results that's the type of pressure

636
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:55,260
a lot of these kids are going through so my my way of looking at things is having vulnerable

637
00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:06,969
conversations just takes that little bit of pressure off it's a tragedy mate it just breaks

638
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:11,110
your heart to hear to hear that story and i think you know you'll never be the same

639
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:16,670
again you just can't you can't recover from that can you mate and and i know you know for you to be

640
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:21,550
open enough to say i think you know we all one level think you're trying your best but these

641
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:25,070
are important conversations for me because immediately you cast your eye back to your

642
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:29,989
own and you want to make sure are we inadvertently putting pressure on absolutely we are yeah we

643
00:40:29,989 --> 00:40:34,829
didn't understand so i don't know your kids from a bar of soap if they walked in now i wouldn't

644
00:40:34,829 --> 00:40:40,449
know them right but i can guarantee that your kids would look at you and go look at dad he's good

645
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:46,690
you look like a man you look strong you've done well you've been on billboards you've been on the

646
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:51,309
telly they hear your voice on the radio they hear your voice on the telly you've made a bit of coin

647
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:57,510
you've got your life sort of but they actually don't know all the vulnerabilities you have

648
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:02,909
shortcomings and the you know the moments where securities and the you know am i good enough and

649
00:41:02,909 --> 00:41:07,429
and all that and have you spoken to them about that well you know that's a it's a really good

650
00:41:07,429 --> 00:41:11,090
point gus because i can't say i have you know and i i you'd like to think

651
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:15,929
and you know i'm reflecting as you're talking to me now it came from uh a junior footy game just

652
00:41:15,929 --> 00:41:20,489
just before our conversation and i and i'm sitting there our youngest is playing and you don't

653
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:26,010
realize you do but you don't there is a reflective pressure because the fact that you played the game

654
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:30,849
at the highest level and back at our style is very much we love you no matter what we're here

655
00:41:30,849 --> 00:41:35,789
to support you we don't overlay any language around you know in fact one of my favorite things

656
00:41:35,789 --> 00:41:39,429
around particularly around the junior sport is a study i read a long time ago the only thing i say

657
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:47,250
nothing else nothing more no coaching no uh because you know it doesn't matter so long as

658
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:51,230
they're connected and happy but you're right and so the thing is that he how does he feel that's

659
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:55,170
right you're doing that your missus is doing that all that stuff but he's sitting there going and

660
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:59,250
the little kid that goes into the huddle and goes oh yes your dad there he was a legend you're never

661
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:03,889
going to be as good as him because the big brother or the dad has said that on the way oh you're

662
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:10,469
playing luke darcy's son today that's right and all of a sudden it's like oh what it's true man

663
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:16,449
they hear and see everything yeah and without that open conversation my dad played as well

664
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:21,010
gus and i can remember that too you know i was a father son i can remember hearing that whispering

665
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:24,929
going on i look i've had a look at him he's nowhere near as good yeah that's right and

666
00:42:24,929 --> 00:42:29,730
you know it's terrible kick on the kid yeah that's right you should have seen his dad yeah

667
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:35,110
exactly it doesn't look very courageous this version yeah um i i use that for it looks way

668
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:40,070
too pretty to play footy i'll use that for a bit of fuel along the way but that's what i love about

669
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:45,489
conversations too catching up with you we want to be challenged we want to try and be the best

670
00:42:45,489 --> 00:42:51,449
version of ourselves and that that makes an incredible uh amount of sense gus we are really

671
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:56,789
passionate i am around what leadership looks like in all different forms and shapes and so i see

672
00:42:56,789 --> 00:43:01,170
your leadership story as being incredible and it continues to be like today you've challenged me

673
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:06,469
today in a really good way to go home and and think about that and act on it and but we're

674
00:43:06,469 --> 00:43:09,989
identifying these sort of common traits of leadership gus starting with self-leadership

675
00:43:09,989 --> 00:43:11,130
as a term we say we're going to be the best version of ourselves and we're going to be the

676
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:17,650
real uh self-aware leaders are thinking about what does that mean to you i suppose for me is to

677
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:21,750
really strip myself down and that's probably what i did that day with jack to realize that i needed

678
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:27,110
to give myself an uppercut but then continually work on myself and not not looking at working on

679
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:31,150
myself is selfish time because that's definitely what a lot of blokes when i speak to them about

680
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:35,849
it i haven't got a couple of hours a day or i've got a couple hours a week to meditate and to

681
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:40,250
think about that or whatever and i'm just it's all about stripping your life down to realize

682
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:44,130
what you're not really trying to do with it and that way this is what helps me right if i'm frustrated

683
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:47,869
you know your more than, mean, soaked, my background is.

684
00:43:47,869 --> 00:44:05,010
your more than, a beautiful and we have to work on

685
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,710
right.

686
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:08,690
um

687
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:09,750
i don't think there's anythingthe there's

688
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:10,949
not

689
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:14,949
it's the greatest thing I've ever heard. I love this. So I was like, you've got room for another

690
00:44:14,949 --> 00:44:18,909
one. Absolutely. And then one of his mates wants to come and his dad's come. All of a sudden we're

691
00:44:18,909 --> 00:44:22,550
up and at them, we're going next month. So I didn't want to be the dad at the end of the line

692
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:26,150
that everyone was waiting for all the time. I wanted to sort of be the middle of the pack at

693
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:32,590
least and so forth. So work on myself in terms of trying not to yo-yo with my weight, meditating 20

694
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:37,309
minutes in the morning, 20 minutes at night, making sure that I pay forward at least once a

695
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:41,929
day. Like I was over at the cafe before I saw you here in Melbourne and I just said the next $20,

696
00:44:42,489 --> 00:44:47,170
whatever it is, if it's someone buying a sandwich or the next five coffees or probably in Melbourne

697
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:55,250
next three coffees for 20 bucks, I'd like to do that. And I've just set these rules up now that

698
00:44:55,250 --> 00:45:05,570
are just non-negotiable. So water, so hydration, breathing, sleep, and generosity. So they're the

699
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,050
things that I have to do every single day.

700
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:07,150
Yeah.

701
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:07,289
And if I'm not doing that, I'm not going to be able to do it.

702
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:07,309
Yeah.

703
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:10,710
And if I don't, then I'm failing myself. So that's what I'm doing.

704
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:15,010
That is serious self-leadership, Gus. I love it. You know, I've spoken to you about meditation

705
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:15,949
before as a passion.

706
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:21,510
Yeah, well, you were one of the reasons why I was like, I can do it. Then I can do it. Then I found

707
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,250
a guru that's helped me with it.

708
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:27,650
Well, mate, going back to our Triple M days when I started, one of the questions is, as you would

709
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:32,230
know, leadership in media is an interesting space. We've had some discussions around it and someone

710
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:37,110
asked me in this space, we know you played footy, we know you're passionate about a number of things.

711
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:41,329
What else do we not know? I said, oh, I'm a passionate meditator. And they said, oh, don't say

712
00:45:41,329 --> 00:45:45,789
that. Whatever you do, don't say that on air because people won't want to listen to you. And

713
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:51,829
I've been combative, sort of said, how about I say whatever I decide? And if you don't, then you can

714
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:56,250
hire someone else. And of course it came up in conversation, but it was a bit like your story

715
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:00,989
around opening up and having an hour and a half of talk about it. We found it was the truck drivers

716
00:46:00,989 --> 00:46:05,829
and the guys on the work side who were saying, shit, I've thought about that. I could do that

717
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:05,989
now.

718
00:46:05,989 --> 00:46:06,929
You gave them permission.

719
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:08,289
It opens up conversations, Gus.

720
00:46:08,289 --> 00:46:12,949
See, that leadership of the person that said that to you, and I got a feeling I might know who it

721
00:46:12,949 --> 00:46:13,230
was.

722
00:46:13,889 --> 00:46:15,190
Can we name a name today?

723
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,650
No, not today.

724
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:16,989
Not today, no.

725
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,809
No, remember kindness.

726
00:46:18,969 --> 00:46:19,230
Correct.

727
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:25,730
Kindness. But that type of stuff is just so old fashioned and just BS. So you actually standing

728
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:33,030
up, Jacko's been meditating for 25 years. I remember in 2000, I was on the set with him in

729
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:37,090
Los Angeles of, I was with John Travolta. What was the movie?

730
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:37,530
What was the movie called?

731
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:39,010
Some good name dropping here.

732
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:46,170
Yeah, I know. Well, that was a great night with JT. I call him JT. But he was on, we're on the film set

733
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:52,869
there and Jacko just said to me, Swordfish. And Jacko said to me, mate, I just need to meditate

734
00:46:52,869 --> 00:46:58,150
for 10 or 15. And I was like, what? He goes, I've got to meditate. I went, no worries at all. So I

735
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:03,909
sat in his trailer, not as big as JT's, I must admit, but I was just sitting there and he literally

736
00:47:03,909 --> 00:47:07,090
lay on the floor, put his legs up on the chair. And for about 10 minutes, he was like, I'm going to

737
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:13,829
10 minutes. He just got into this zone. Anyway, woke himself up after about 10, 11 minutes and he

738
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:17,389
goes, I literally feel like I've had a proper night's sleep. And I said, so this is how you

739
00:47:17,389 --> 00:47:21,449
can do it. This is your energy levels. Cause he then had to do a whole lot of car chase scenes

740
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:26,570
that night. Um, had they'd, they'd, you know, closed off the streets in LA to shoot this

741
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:31,769
wonderful car scene with guns and all that jitter jazz. And I just stood on the sideline, just

742
00:47:31,769 --> 00:47:36,989
watching it all exhausted. And there he was doing all his stuff. And he goes, mate, I've been doing

743
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:37,070
it. I've been doing it. I've been doing it. I've been doing it. I've been doing it. I've been doing it. I've been

744
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:41,989
it. A bloke told me about it. And 25 years later. So that story, and I have read a lot about this

745
00:47:41,989 --> 00:47:47,269
as someone who, who learned nearly 20 years ago, David Lynch, the legendary Hollywood film producer

746
00:47:47,269 --> 00:47:52,309
who is iconic over there, put $50 million into a foundation around teaching transcendental

747
00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:58,309
meditation. And then Hugh Jackman, your mate, and, and almost everyone have worked out because

748
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:03,010
the research is incredible. You know, 20 minutes of that, the equivalent of four hours of deepest

749
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:06,989
sleep. There's so many independent studies. And so once you work out, you know what,

750
00:48:06,989 --> 00:48:10,170
that 20 minutes actually, you know, even if you believe what I say, if you think I'm not

751
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:14,889
bullshitting with that, and I'm a great skeptic on everything. Once you work out, it gives you

752
00:48:14,889 --> 00:48:19,389
that sort of energy and that sort of clarity. Well, I've never, I've never been, I've never

753
00:48:19,389 --> 00:48:25,150
been busier, literally. And it's emotional busy too, like literally emotional busy. Start my day,

754
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:29,210
finish my day with a lot of emotion, doing the drive show where you've got to be a half a smart

755
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:34,369
ass all the time and be thinking really clearly. And then doing keynotes and so forth around emotion

756
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,550
like I am with gotcha. And I've never,

757
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:40,889
I sleep well, I wake up before the alarm and it's all because of meditation.

758
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:44,429
Right. And you're looking great, Gus. You're looking as good as I've seen you for forever.

759
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:45,070
Thanks, mate.

760
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:49,849
We see this version of leaders in the 21st century now really conscious around

761
00:48:49,849 --> 00:48:53,670
how they positively impact others in their environment. That, that is you to me. Like

762
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:57,130
you have a positive impact on everyone that, that you are around. Is that something you've

763
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:01,949
consciously thought? I mean, what you did before in the coffee shop, it doesn't surprise me, but

764
00:49:01,949 --> 00:49:06,610
is that, has that always been you? I've always worn my heart on my sleeve and I'm

765
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:11,050
told by people that you're just like you were when the first time I met you or you go to an

766
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:17,070
old boys do 35 years, it'll be, but would have been COVID. So it's coming up this year. Um,

767
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:21,429
they're like, Oh, Waller, where you just always smiling, always happy. You know, you were the

768
00:49:21,429 --> 00:49:25,690
bloke and you know, I was at the tuck shop a lot as a youngster. And they'd always say you'd buy

769
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:29,789
an extra something, or if you had an extra 20 cents, you'd give it over. And so I did that

770
00:49:29,789 --> 00:49:36,090
without really thinking. I think I got that from my mom. Who's very giving. And, um, do I,

771
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:41,969
I listened to a lot of smart people and I try to put in place stuff that they tell me to do

772
00:49:41,969 --> 00:49:46,849
a lot of successful people. And I, but my grandfather said something to me,

773
00:49:46,869 --> 00:49:52,289
Das, before he passed, I loved my grandfather on my, on my mom's side. And he said to me,

774
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:55,849
people will tell you that you can sell ice to Eskimos. You're a born salesman.

775
00:49:56,289 --> 00:50:00,969
That's what I've given you. Cause that was his genes. But he said, you will never be able to

776
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:05,289
sell something unless you believe in the product. And he's absolutely right. Like I tried car

777
00:50:05,289 --> 00:50:06,590
salesman for a while. I've been a car salesman for a while. I've been a car salesman for a while.

778
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:10,170
I'm just hopeless. Like, you know, I'd never sold a car and people were like,

779
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:14,469
thought you'd be good at that. And it's because I didn't like the brand of car that it was at

780
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:18,829
the time. And I actually knew that the Toyota across the road was going to be better. So I

781
00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:23,590
just went, well, check across there, the Corolla, you know, and people go, well, you can't let a

782
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:28,349
customer go. And I'm like, I just, it just didn't get it. But Toshiba, I went to, which is where

783
00:50:28,349 --> 00:50:33,329
my friend, you know, who passed away, who took his own life. That's where he was when he took

784
00:50:33,329 --> 00:50:36,590
his own life. He, um, he said to me, these products are the best. And I'm like, well,

785
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:42,510
we went to the, went to Japan, went to the factory, saw how they're made quality stuff,

786
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:46,590
right? So I could literally stand up and go, these are the best laptops out there. They're

787
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:52,269
more expensive, but total cost of ownership will be this over a period of time. And that being

788
00:50:52,269 --> 00:50:57,489
authentic, people just went, I believe him. And I was very successful. No one had ever won

789
00:50:57,489 --> 00:51:04,190
a sales award more than once. I won four years running because I just absolutely believe that

790
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,570
the Toshiba laptop was the best one. They're not even around anymore.

791
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:10,769
Like I'm shattered for that. They're dino book now, which I do work for them and they help me

792
00:51:10,769 --> 00:51:15,650
with gotcha for life. Cause that's the connection between my friend and I, but yeah, absolutely have

793
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:23,070
to be authentic. And I reckon Dars, with 2022 now, authentic has got to be the word. Surround

794
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:27,429
yourself with people that get you for who you are. No more bullshitting anymore. Leadership

795
00:51:27,429 --> 00:51:32,369
will come down to being fair dinkum and human. Brilliantly said, mate. And, and, and shared

796
00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:36,550
values, isn't it? So, you know, if you've got that alignment, someone authentically around,

797
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:38,789
you, who you value is a gift in life.

798
00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:43,309
I'll tell you what Dars, it was one of the big banks. I won't say what it, who it was.

799
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:46,650
There was 28 of their executive team. They got me to come and talk to them. And I've

800
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:50,150
got this chat at the moment called the village, all about the people that really mean something

801
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:53,969
to you. You can love a thousand people. You and I love each other, but I'm not in your

802
00:51:53,969 --> 00:51:57,690
village. If you actually wrote down the people you love and adore, and you cannot imagine

803
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:03,050
living without, I'm not in that. So everyone listening, write down your village. So they

804
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:06,469
was talking to this group about that. And I said, who's the big dog in the room? I had

805
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:11,409
no idea, female, male, who was actually the big dog in the room and everyone's giggling

806
00:52:11,409 --> 00:52:16,929
and laughing and so forth. And this bloke goes, oh, I suppose I am. I said, okay. And

807
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:20,550
as I'm saying this to him, as I'm looking at him and going, this is going to be not

808
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:24,309
good for me. He's not going to pay the invoice. I'm thinking I'm pushing this bloke too far.

809
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:29,710
He was a bit of an old school guy. And I said, everyone be quiet. No one speaks except you

810
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:33,269
for the next two minutes, but you've got to tell us something that you've never told your

811
00:52:33,269 --> 00:52:36,599
team before and just left it.

812
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:37,599
Yeah.

813
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:44,059
45 seconds of silence in that situation is a lifetime. There was silence in that room

814
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:49,380
and everyone going, what's going to happen? And he looks at me after 45 seconds and goes,

815
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:53,820
you're not letting me off the hook. I said, I'm not. He took a big breath. He put his

816
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:59,340
big boy pants on and he went, okay. And he spoke about his son. And I won't tell you

817
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:05,699
the story because that was for our room. Everyone in that room got up. Everyone waited in line

818
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:07,780
and everyone gave him a cuddle.

819
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:12,820
And when we all sat down and gathered ourselves and wiped away the tears, I said, does anyone

820
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:16,579
not want to work for this man anymore? Is anyone not going to do an extra couple of

821
00:53:16,579 --> 00:53:21,360
hours if he asks you to? Is anyone not going to run through a brick wall? And everyone

822
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:26,400
nodded. And I said, that is leadership. You've just shown vulnerability for the first time

823
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,760
in your life to the important people in your world in terms of work. Do more of that.

824
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,639
Yeah. It's brilliant, mate. I can hear the emotion again. And you, when you retell that

825
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:40,760
story, I had the great pleasure of talking to Brian Hartzell, who was a former CEO of

826
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:46,739
the West Cap Bank, went through the Royal Commission into the challenges with the banking

827
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:52,880
industry. And you don't normally think of bank CEOs in the vulnerable, open, accountable

828
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:59,239
space. I just had so much admiration for him after spending some time exactly like that.

829
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:04,300
And those people touch 40,000 people. They're employees. So if the culture gets set, and

830
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,300
Gus, if you can influence leaders who are successful, who are successful, who are successful,

831
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,719
and who are really proud and who are really, really, really, really proud, who are historically

832
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:12,019
were the opposite of that, and that allows all of those people, because we know if you

833
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:16,500
go to work and the leader shows that sort of vulnerability and that sort of opener,

834
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,599
then you go and pass it on to your own family. The ripple effect is enormous, isn't it?

835
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:25,639
Oh, absolutely. But you got to take a little bit of a leap to vulnerability from

836
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:28,800
the old school, like you say, puffing the chest out and making out that everything's

837
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,360
okay when it perhaps isn't. Like I said, it goes back to it. We're not bursting into tears

838
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,340
every five minutes. We're not having deep and meaningfuls all the time, but that happens.

839
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,340
There is a level of vulnerability that he has to take. But I think that is a fundamental

840
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:39,800
all the time, but all of a sudden you're working for a leader that's human and that's who we are.

841
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:44,460
Let's not keep forgetting that. And you know, they care and then you can care in return. It

842
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:50,300
sounds simple, but you know, it's hard. Creating and sharing a vision is something that we see

843
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:56,280
leaders are really conscious of. Gotcha for Life is an incredible vision and you do communicate

844
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:02,300
that particularly well. Have you gone about getting that message across? Well, there's a

845
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,340
whole lot of different ways you can get your message across now. You know, I'd love to throw

846
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:10,019
mobile phones, tablets and social media in the bin, but it's here to stay, right? So we need

847
00:55:10,019 --> 00:55:15,400
to use that. So we haven't been as good as I'd like to be with getting our message across on

848
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:21,659
those platforms, which are very, very well watched by people now, whether it's Facebook or Instagram

849
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:27,219
or Twitter or LinkedIn or whatever. So that's a constant battle for me. Also, when you've got a

850
00:55:27,219 --> 00:55:32,179
non-for-profit, finding people, good people that you pay much less money to. Yeah. It's

851
00:55:32,179 --> 00:55:32,280
difficult. It's difficult. It's difficult. It's difficult. It's difficult. It's difficult.

852
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:36,599
Right. So you need to find people that have got a passion, need a bit of purpose and are happy to

853
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:40,480
cop a little less money because they certainly deserve in the corporate world a lot more in the

854
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,159
open market. So that's one thing that I'm continually working on. But for me, Das, it's,

855
00:55:45,219 --> 00:55:49,300
you know, got my own podcast series, which I'd love you to come on next series, which would be

856
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:56,199
great called Not an Overnight Success. And it's all about, I suppose, stripping down these people

857
00:55:56,199 --> 00:56:00,880
that well-known people like Hugh Jackman was the first one, Karl Stefanovic, Lisa Wilkinson,

858
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:02,260
people like that.

859
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:07,659
Lane Beachley, who we look upon as these successful, magical people. How many rabbit

860
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:13,179
holes they went down before they found what they were doing or how much imposter syndrome they have

861
00:56:13,179 --> 00:56:17,059
sitting on their shoulder and the little voice that we all have saying, you're not good enough

862
00:56:17,059 --> 00:56:20,920
for this. Don't do it. You're not good enough for this. There's no way you're going to win today.

863
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,619
There's no way you can go out on that stage and do what you're meant to do. All that sort of stuff

864
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:31,400
is normalizing it. So a podcast series, obviously my radio show, social media and so forth. But the

865
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,260
most important stuff,

866
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:37,980
is me living in a way that people go, he's actually living the way that he thinks is the

867
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:43,019
best way. And being a good example for my three kids, like I've got Jack, 22. I've got two daughters,

868
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:48,280
20. Ella's in London at the moment. There's a constant with her, like she's just like me,

869
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:54,500
but a smaller version and 20 and female. But we have a break in our radio show, like what's Ella

870
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:59,400
up to today? Because there's always something that I find on Instagram that I'm shaking my head at.

871
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:02,260
But the other day, Das, if I can just take a moment,

872
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:07,340
to explain this to your listeners. She walks out of this concert, there's a bloke called Stormzy or

873
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:11,099
something like that. He's a rapper, right? And he's a bloke that would come to Australia once

874
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:15,739
every five years. But in London, where he lives, he's on every couple of nights, right? So she

875
00:57:15,739 --> 00:57:19,760
can't believe she's seeing Stormzy in a small little place. And she's done that. She walks out

876
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:25,239
and she sees a cop car with the lights going, but no sound, with a bloke with his arm behind his back

877
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:30,659
on the bonnet of the car. And the cop is talking to him, putting the cuffs on him. She looks around

878
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:32,059
to the left and there's a lady there,

879
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,480
lying with a lady constable. So most people, what would you do in that situation?

880
00:57:36,739 --> 00:57:39,199
Yeah, you might sort of think, oh, I'll give some space here,

881
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,340
Gus, and let the police do their job, potentially.

882
00:57:41,539 --> 00:57:42,039
Would you think?

883
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:47,599
Yeah, I think 99.9% would. But however, my daughter walks over to the girl and goes,

884
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:52,739
are you okay? And the girl straight away goes, oh, you know, I'm not too well. My boyfriend

885
00:57:52,739 --> 00:57:58,559
just hit me. And I run the police on him and we're having this argument and the cops have come and

886
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,260
this is what's happening. So Ella walks over and this bloke's up against,

887
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,320
the bonnet of the car is going, you shouldn't be treating your girlfriend like that. You're a

888
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:10,400
bloody disgrace and give it to him. And he's going, where are you from? Who are you? And she goes,

889
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:14,539
I'm from Australia. And that's not how you treat women. He goes, why don't you fuck off back to

890
00:58:14,539 --> 00:58:18,940
Australia? They had this full of discussion. The cop is there going, um, ma'am, ma'am, we don't

891
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:23,420
need to, we don't need you involved here. There's enough going on. Anyway, she spends three hours

892
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:30,039
with the girl, right? The bloke goes off. The copper comes back to check on the girl and she's

893
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:32,260
all okay. And then the copper goes, okay, girls,

894
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:36,500
if everything's all right, I'll, I'll leave you. And Ella goes, no, you need to drop us home.

895
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:42,980
And he goes, well, it's not really my job. He goes, the tube's finished. And actually both of

896
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:47,519
us are quite hungry. So all of a sudden he goes, well, I got no room in my cop car. So they both

897
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:52,420
get in. So this girl that he hasn't, she's never met before. Who's had this horrific night. Ella

898
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:56,760
stayed with her. They get in the back, they get like in the, like the jail bit, whatever that bit

899
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,980
is of the car. In the divvy van part. Yeah. And then the, the bit gets open from the driver through

900
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,760
the back of the bit. And she's going, there's a little chippy down here on the corner. So in the

901
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,380
end, the copper, the girl that got attacked and Ella are sitting in a chippy shop at one o'clock

902
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:14,960
in the morning. And then 20 minutes later, he drops the girl home and then, and Ella's in the

903
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:19,739
car with, and he goes, I don't want to be in the back bit now. So move your radar and everything

904
00:59:19,739 --> 00:59:23,920
out. So she sits in the front with him and she goes, why don't you whack on the siren? Come on,

905
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:28,760
I've always wanted to do that. So by then this bloke's laughing along and I'm like, Ella, this

906
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,260
is exactly why you should be over in England.

907
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:37,400
And having a great time changing the world. I want to buy shares in Ella Wharton. What a

908
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:42,440
legend. To the cracker. And no surprise. Where does she get that from, mate? That sounds very

909
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:47,119
close, close to home. What a brilliant story. I want to follow along. What's Ella been up to?

910
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:52,179
Yeah. We see curiosity, Gus, as a great dimension of leadership. A lot of leaders

911
00:59:52,179 --> 00:59:56,719
have that really in common and they approach their own development through curiosity. Does

912
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:01,099
that resonate with you? Definitely. For me, is it curiosity?

913
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:08,059
Is it curiosity or is it, I suppose it is. I mean, the way that I look at it, Das, is I look at

914
01:00:08,059 --> 01:00:12,380
people that I think are authentic, that are good leaders, and I try to sort of find traits from

915
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:17,320
them. So I suppose I am curious whether or not I can put stuff that they've put in place into my

916
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:21,579
life. But the one thing I've noticed, and having a friend, having my best friend like Jacka, who

917
01:00:21,579 --> 01:00:26,059
probably we looked upon as, you know, would he be the most famous, famous Australian?

918
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:30,780
He'd have to be, wouldn't he? Like he's right up there with the Russell Crows and Thor at Hemsworth

919
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,059
and Cate Blanchett.

920
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,059
Cate Blanchett and-

921
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:33,960
He's in the conversation.

922
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:34,739
He's in the convo.

923
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,579
Most loved Australian, I reckon it'd almost be Hugh Jackman.

924
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,139
Yeah. Grandma wants to bed him, so does the mother and maybe the daughter as well.

925
01:00:42,199 --> 01:00:42,940
And your son too.

926
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:50,059
Yeah, that's right. And I see how much he works on himself. So it's taken away a bit of curiosity

927
01:00:50,059 --> 01:00:54,059
because when it's happened so close to you, you actually go, well, I can simply do that.

928
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:59,360
Like he sent me this book, which I absolutely would say to anyone who's listening should buy,

929
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:02,260
it's called The Second Mountain. And it's all about how you,

930
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:07,900
you actually believe that you've done all you can in your life and you've been successful and

931
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:13,619
success in inverted commas. You tick all the boxes and so forth. And then all of a sudden

932
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:18,440
at some age you go, oh, this is actually not what I'm meant to be doing. And if you're brave enough

933
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,860
and curious enough, I suppose, to go, actually, I'm going to have a little look. You would,

934
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:27,800
your football career would be looked upon as success. Going into media after that's probably

935
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,860
a bit of a given. You sort of went, well, that's, I'm going to stick in the game. I'll get paid

936
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,260
quite well.

937
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:37,639
Well, I've got a face for TV, voice for radio, and you're all good. You're ticking a few boxes.

938
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:42,260
All of a sudden doing what you're doing spiritually is a little bit of a second

939
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:46,860
mountain. All of a sudden you're going outside of where you're being boxed in. No matter how

940
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:50,360
successful you are, your second mountain is actually you and your wife going,

941
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:56,900
how much joy you get when you walk into your resort. How, how at peace you feel,

942
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:02,099
how much your wife and you are absolutely on the same point. Second mountain is key.

943
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:05,800
And I suppose being curious enough and brave enough to have a crack at that

944
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:11,960
is certainly where I, I'm proud of myself for not just doing that man up job and going, okay,

945
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:17,639
I'm going to go back to Brekkie radio, which as you know, can be lucrative. Um, two years later,

946
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:22,199
I'm like, I just got to get out of here. Yeah. And it's incredible sense of purpose

947
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:26,139
that you've got, mate. And, and, um, you know, it's a, it's a point where I want to just go

948
01:02:26,139 --> 01:02:32,039
and look at Gotcha for Life. We need to fund people like Gus to make sure that they can do the

949
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:35,900
work that you're doing. So check out Gotcha for Life. I know you've got some great partners and

950
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:39,539
some great sponsors, but that is a constant ongoing challenge. I'd love some government

951
01:02:39,539 --> 01:02:43,079
help brother. Yeah. Like a little bit from the New South Wales government. There's a wonderful,

952
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:49,000
there's a wonderful Bronnie Taylor, who's an MP with passion. And, but I've went down with the

953
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,800
last government and sat with, with, with ScoMo and sat with a few other ministers, a minister

954
01:02:54,800 --> 01:03:00,139
for education, minister for health and so forth, and just got basketballed around and not a brass

955
01:03:00,139 --> 01:03:06,639
razzoo. And I'm like, we fund mental health so much. Why don't we look around at a few more

956
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:12,500
people you can fund? Like I sat on a meeting once with Beyond Blue and Black Dog Institute and all

957
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:16,559
these wonderful organisations. And they said, Oh, what would you like to be done? And I said,

958
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:21,460
well, rather than giving them 20 million, can you give them 19.5 million? Give me half a million

959
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:27,699
and let me prove to you that I can do some really good work and look at a whole different, um,

960
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:30,119
suite of products that are available rather than,

961
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:33,739
than just having the one or two biggies. Because a lot of that is about awareness and

962
01:03:33,739 --> 01:03:38,239
capturing people as they're about to jump off the bridge effectively, whereas what you're doing is

963
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:43,059
tackling it at the prevention end. Awareness. And in, in person delivering programs,

964
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,179
get behind gotcha for life. Awareness is, if you don't know that there's a problem,

965
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:51,380
Dars, then I don't know where you've been living. Yeah. It's action. There's what we need. We need

966
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:56,440
to get into schools, get into sporting clubs, get into corporations and say, there's a new way of

967
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,079
doing things. Here's something to think about. And just getting back to that human thing,

968
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:04,159
taking away the white coat, taking away the wellness and actually talking about being a

969
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:10,619
decent human being and being kind. That is the key. And that's the best, I believe, um, lesson

970
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:14,340
that you can teach your kids moving forward. The World Health Organization tell us that this

971
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:19,480
is going to be the greatest issue facing mankind in the coming years. We cannot have enough

972
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:24,980
resources and we've got evidence-based programs like, uh, Gus and Gotcha for Life that simply

973
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:29,300
have to be funded going forward. Communicating with the clarity is a, is a dimension we

974
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:34,659
see as a common to all lady. You're an incredible natural communicator, Gus. Have you, have you

975
01:04:34,659 --> 01:04:38,619
thought, have you thought about it? Have you worked on how you communicate your message or?

976
01:04:38,739 --> 01:04:44,639
I try to be, now that I'm doing more keynotes, I'm trying to be as simple as possible. Not a slide,

977
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:49,280
not an opening, not, not even, you know, if they might put up Gus Warland and Gotcha for Life

978
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:54,260
as I walk up onto the stage, but there's not another slide, not another quote. It's just me

979
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:59,139
talking. And it's more of a facilitation rather than a presentation. Cause I don't think

980
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:03,400
anyone wants to be lectured to, but people want to have some takeaways from anything

981
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,480
that they're being presented. So no one will ever argue if you're a little bit shorter

982
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:12,019
than longer. That was something that I got taught at a very young age. Don't talk for

983
01:05:12,019 --> 01:05:16,780
45. If you don't need to talk for 45, give everyone a chance to go to the loo, give everyone

984
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:21,500
a chance to check their phones and their emails or go and get a water or whatever it might

985
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:27,840
be, but also being authentic and giving them a really simple takeaway. So for the end of

986
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,280
every time I talk.

987
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:34,159
People will know really clearly that they can do something which won't take them very

988
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:39,079
long that will allow them to not worry alone and build up the emotional muscle to be mentally

989
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:43,539
fit. That's it. And at the end of the day, if I'm entertaining and if I'm emotional,

990
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:49,820
then that'll come naturally. But takeaways are the key. People, like I talk a lot, but

991
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:54,460
people don't want to hear me just talk. They want something that's clear and manageable.

992
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:58,619
And that's really what I'm trying to work on. But sometimes Das, I'm sure you're the

993
01:05:58,619 --> 01:05:58,920
same.

994
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:04,980
I'm doing a big summit chat tomorrow in front of over 10,000 people in Sydney. I hope I

995
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:10,019
go well tomorrow. It's a big audience and I really want to nail it. Whereas last week

996
01:06:10,019 --> 01:06:15,960
I spoke to 12 blokes who had all lost their kids to suicide. I can guarantee that I'd

997
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:21,139
saved someone that night and made them feel at least an opportunity to build moving forward

998
01:06:21,139 --> 01:06:25,219
because it's such a hard thing to do. The car park conversations, the most important

999
01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:29,159
I have when someone walks out with me, doesn't want to talk in front of the crowd and I'll

1000
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:34,539
spend 45 minutes by the door of my car trying to help them because they're telling me something

1001
01:06:34,539 --> 01:06:37,039
that perhaps they haven't told anyone else.

1002
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:40,860
We're very multicultural in this country. I'll go into different clubs where it's not

1003
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:46,719
Australian as their first language or English as their first language or their parents were

1004
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:52,420
born in another country. Das, you've got no idea how those people feel about what I'm

1005
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:56,159
talking about and how difficult it is for them, even though they see value in it, to

1006
01:06:56,159 --> 01:06:57,039
actually change the way that their grandfathers and fathers were raised.

1007
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:57,159
Yeah.

1008
01:06:57,159 --> 01:06:57,260
Yeah.

1009
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:57,360
Yeah.

1010
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:57,460
Yeah.

1011
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:57,519
Yeah.

1012
01:06:57,519 --> 01:06:57,579
Yeah.

1013
01:06:57,579 --> 01:06:57,639
Yeah.

1014
01:06:57,639 --> 01:06:57,699
Yeah.

1015
01:06:57,699 --> 01:06:57,760
Yeah.

1016
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:57,860
Yeah.

1017
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:57,920
Yeah.

1018
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:57,940
Yeah.

1019
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:58,039
Yeah.

1020
01:06:58,039 --> 01:06:58,059
Yeah.

1021
01:06:58,059 --> 01:06:58,159
Yeah.

1022
01:06:58,159 --> 01:06:58,239
Yeah.

1023
01:06:58,239 --> 01:06:58,320
Yeah.

1024
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:58,380
Yeah.

1025
01:06:58,380 --> 01:06:58,460
Yeah.

1026
01:06:58,460 --> 01:06:58,480
Yeah.

1027
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:58,960
Yeah.

1028
01:06:58,960 --> 01:06:59,159
Yeah.

1029
01:06:59,159 --> 01:06:59,239
Yeah.

1030
01:06:59,239 --> 01:06:59,260
Yeah.

1031
01:06:59,260 --> 01:06:59,420
Yeah.

1032
01:06:59,420 --> 01:06:59,500
Yeah.

1033
01:06:59,500 --> 01:06:59,519
Yeah.

1034
01:06:59,519 --> 01:06:59,900
Yeah.

1035
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:00,019
Yeah.

1036
01:07:00,019 --> 01:07:00,079
Yeah.

1037
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:00,199
Yeah.

1038
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:00,219
Yeah.

1039
01:07:00,219 --> 01:07:00,420
Yeah.

1040
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:00,519
Yeah.

1041
01:07:00,519 --> 01:07:00,539
Yeah.

1042
01:07:00,539 --> 01:07:00,639
Yeah.

1043
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:00,659
Yeah.

1044
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,659
They want to change, but it's just, it's disrespectful not to do what they do traditionally.

1045
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:12,199
So there's so much to unpack there, but I always leave people hopefully feeling like

1046
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:17,380
they've got my attention and I care enough about them to, to have given them the best

1047
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,360
knowledge that I can give.

1048
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:20,039
Excuse me, mate.

1049
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:25,659
That's, I love the, the idea of that action to take away as, as part of your communication.

1050
01:07:25,659 --> 01:07:27,199
I can, I can feel that in what you're saying.

1051
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:28,719
How important is collaboration?

1052
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:32,440
motivation for you, Gus. We see that as being a real common trait now for leaders.

1053
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:36,679
And in mental health, there's way too many egos. There's way too many people out there doing it.

1054
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:41,519
Like we need to all get together and go, Gus, you're really good at that. Beyond Blue, you're

1055
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:45,659
really good at that. Black Dog, when it comes to research, no one's better than you. We should all

1056
01:07:45,659 --> 01:07:50,159
be talking together and actually saying, you know what, we're in this area next week. How can we all

1057
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:58,699
help each other make the most insightful impact? We just don't do it. You know, I go into

1058
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:03,300
areas and they go, oh yeah, we had someone from blah, blah, blah. And they dropped a whole lot

1059
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:07,280
of leaflets off at the school. It's like, well, that's just a waste of time. You've got to keep

1060
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,460
going back to communities. Otherwise they don't trust you. This letterbox dropping and all,

1061
01:08:11,539 --> 01:08:16,579
as we proved in the election, you can't just shoot someone, parachute someone into it because

1062
01:08:16,579 --> 01:08:21,039
people go, no, I want authentic someone that lives in this space. I'm not just voting for a big name.

1063
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:26,119
That's what life is about. And every community we go to, we go back every three months and we do

1064
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:28,399
that over years and years and years. All of a sudden,

1065
01:08:28,699 --> 01:08:32,960
year three, they start trusting you. Year four, they'll start turning up to one of your events.

1066
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:37,260
Year five, they go, I don't know what we did without you. That's what we've got to keep doing.

1067
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:43,899
Not just letterboxing or saying, oh, here's a website, crack on, there's all that info. No,

1068
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:49,399
that's not what we want. And that's your authentic leadership coming in, Gus, as you said. You can

1069
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:54,220
sell so long as you know that the purpose is there. And I love that about everything that you're

1070
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:58,659
doing. Question we've been asking everyone, Gus, that's come on, who has been the greatest

1071
01:08:58,659 --> 01:08:58,680
leader in the world? Who has been the greatest leader in the world?

1072
01:08:58,699 --> 01:08:59,840
Who has been the greatest leader in your life?

1073
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:08,359
Oh, wow. Well, it'll be an easy one to say, Jacko, because he has, in the last five years,

1074
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:17,159
given me so much good advice that has kept me on my path because I have had so many emotional

1075
01:09:17,159 --> 01:09:22,180
moments where I felt, you know what, I can't do this anymore. But I'd have to say my mum,

1076
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,100
and she learned it so much from my granddad on her side, her dad.

1077
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:37,880
Um, that authenticness, that level of care comes from my mum. Um, I spoke about it with Ian Roberts,

1078
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:44,060
who people don't know was a big, tough rugby league player. Um, and he's the first and only

1079
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:49,899
rugby league player to come out as gay. And I had him on my podcast a few weeks ago. And it's the

1080
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:55,239
first time I've spoken about it openly that my father's gay. And I normally speak about it with

1081
01:09:55,239 --> 01:09:57,079
people and then I edit it out. But I've never spoken about it openly. And I've never spoken

1082
01:09:57,079 --> 01:10:00,319
about it openly. But I rang my dad and I said, I just spoke to Ian Roberts. And I actually spoke

1083
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:05,119
about the fact that you're gay and that your partner Ian and you have been together for 40

1084
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:10,279
years. And I found out as an 18 year old, and I really struggled with it until I spoke to you and

1085
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:16,119
asked you some difficult questions and got some difficult answers. Well, from my point of view,

1086
01:10:16,199 --> 01:10:24,619
Dars, having those type of conversations where you are completely vulnerable is where I grow the

1087
01:10:24,619 --> 01:10:28,659
most, where I feel the most awkwardness, when I feel the most out of control, when I feel the

1088
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:33,439
most out of control, is when I grow out of my comfort zone. And my grandfather and mother,

1089
01:10:33,779 --> 01:10:38,420
because they were so close, they taught me that. Wear your heart on your sleeve, your friends will

1090
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:42,600
come. And if people are baggy or whatever, well, it saves you the drama of getting to know them,

1091
01:10:42,659 --> 01:10:46,380
then giving them the flick. You know what I mean? That's always been their process.

1092
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:50,859
And it has hurt me a lot. Telling girlfriends I love them after two and a half hours after

1093
01:10:50,859 --> 01:10:54,979
when we've been sitting in a movie and we haven't even actually properly chatted, but I just feel so

1094
01:10:54,979 --> 01:10:58,479
in love and connected, you know, like, believe me, it hasn't been all,

1095
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:05,439
fantastic. But gee, I've got a great bunch of mates who totally know who I am and there's no

1096
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:09,659
BS amongst us. And I think they would tell you that our friendship group is better because of

1097
01:11:09,659 --> 01:11:15,960
that. And that all comes from my granddad and my mum. Great, great leadership and, and encourage

1098
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:19,140
you to go and listen to Gus. I mean, they're brilliant conversations, starting with Hugh

1099
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:24,539
Jackman and Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson and Ian Roberts as well will be something that

1100
01:11:24,539 --> 01:11:28,659
you'll learn an enormous amount from, from Gus. In the spirit of collaboration,

1101
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:35,000
Gus, we are passionate about the idea of leaders collaborating extensively. If there was one

1102
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,159
person in any part of your life, Gus, that you could collaborate with, is there any name that

1103
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:43,680
springs to mind? Oh, wow. You know what, you know, who was that person? And I've had a chance to do

1104
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:49,899
it, Das, was Mark Burris, because I am all about passion, but not so flash on the finance. So I

1105
01:11:49,899 --> 01:11:54,279
just grabbed him one day and spoke to him and he goes, this is what you do. This is what you do.

1106
01:11:54,359 --> 01:11:57,659
This is what you do. And all of a sudden it was all great. For those who don't know Mark Burris,

1107
01:11:57,659 --> 01:12:02,279
Wizard Home Loans was the business that, along with the Packer family to great success and Yellow

1108
01:12:02,279 --> 01:12:07,439
Brick Road. Now, yeah. An amazing individual success story. So yeah. And he's got a, he's

1109
01:12:07,439 --> 01:12:12,079
got a podcast called The Mentor and he mentors businesses and so forth. So that was great. But

1110
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:16,979
there's actually a bloke called Earl Evans from Shore and Partners Financial Services who support

1111
01:12:16,979 --> 01:12:22,699
my body. And he gives $10,000 away to any guest that comes on our podcast, as long as you give it

1112
01:12:22,699 --> 01:12:27,500
to the charity of your choice and you can show what that 10 grand will mean. It's a brilliant

1113
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:27,640
idea.

1114
01:12:27,659 --> 01:12:30,800
I think it's the only podcast in the world. I've searched this. I don't know if I'm right,

1115
01:12:30,859 --> 01:12:34,260
but I think we're the only one in the world. So far we're given 300,000 away.

1116
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:36,420
It's an amazing contribution that guest.

1117
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:41,539
And he, I literally was having coffee in Collaroy, which is on the Northern beaches of Sydney.

1118
01:12:41,819 --> 01:12:45,720
And he tapped me on the shoulder and he goes, can you give me a call? I'm Earl from Shore and

1119
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:49,500
Partners. I think I can help you. And I turned around and went, yeah, of course. But he kept

1120
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:54,079
walking, right? There was no proper conversation. So then I'm going, is it, was it Earl? Like I'm

1121
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:57,319
trying to write it all down. Cause when you weren't running on for profit, if someone says

1122
01:12:57,319 --> 01:13:00,899
they're going to help you, you, you call, you call them as soon as you possibly can.

1123
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:03,479
You gotta regret this Earl. I'll be calling you in 10 minutes time.

1124
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:08,380
Correct. And he's become a really good friend and confidant. And he also has a really good

1125
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:13,399
attitude to life is you're only here once you can't take it with you. So have a goddamn crack

1126
01:13:13,399 --> 01:13:19,020
and make sure you're proud of yourself at the end of the day. And so he's been a great person for me

1127
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:26,500
just when I needed someone to let me know that it's okay to not have all the answers. Like I've

1128
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,199
got to take some on my own.

1129
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:35,319
Sometimes like I get sad if I feel like I'm not doing as well as I feel I can, but it's just life,

1130
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:40,220
right? I have good days and bad days. And I was down at point Lonsdale this Saturday night and I

1131
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:44,600
was just, I'd had a couple of beers. I wasn't drunk, but I certainly was, I couldn't drive

1132
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:49,479
for that way, but I wasn't drunk. I'm a God daughter's 21st and I'm on the dance floor

1133
01:13:49,479 --> 01:13:57,119
and I am the happiest that I've been that I can remember. And I have no idea why.

1134
01:13:57,319 --> 01:14:01,960
But I was just in this feeling of like, I'm just in a good place at the moment, you know?

1135
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:08,100
And I just was smiling. And the photograph that was taken of me that I saw the next day,

1136
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:15,020
it's just this unbridled peace. And you would feel that with your meditation and the fact that

1137
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:19,760
you do all the work you do with your resort. It's just finding a bit of peace, knowing that you're

1138
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:24,920
on the right path and it's not always going to be awesome, but you're getting there. That's

1139
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,340
probably where I'm at at the moment.

1140
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:27,260
And Mo, what a great,

1141
01:14:27,319 --> 01:14:31,600
a note to finish on. I said at the start, it's always inspiring to catch up with you. And I feel

1142
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:38,239
that every time I bump into you, mate, and full of joy for what you do. I love the work that you're

1143
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:43,060
doing. And when you're doing stuff that's changing people's lives, I'm not surprised you're feeling

1144
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:47,979
that sense of joy, mate, because you deserve every bit of it. Gotcha for Life is an incredible

1145
01:14:47,979 --> 01:14:53,319
organization that's come straight from Gus's heart. Look it up, find out about it. Try and

1146
01:14:53,319 --> 01:14:57,300
find a friend that you can have Gotcha for Life, mate. If you're listening out there,

1147
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:03,979
and you're another Earl that wants to tap Gus on the show, give Gus a call. It will be as good of

1148
01:15:03,979 --> 01:15:06,680
money as you could spend on anything. Thanks, mate. I really appreciate it.

1149
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:11,539
Pleasure, mate. And we'll keep working on your hug, eh? We'll have one in a minute. Before we

1150
01:15:11,539 --> 01:15:13,319
leave, we're having one, but you've got to- Less stiff.

1151
01:15:13,479 --> 01:15:19,060
You're so tall, right? It's hard. So you've got to just sink down a little bit and not so stiff.

1152
01:15:19,319 --> 01:15:20,159
Get rid of the stiffness.

1153
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:25,819
Well, being stiff's not always where you need to be, Darce. Good on you, mate.

1154
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,260
Thanks, mate.

1155
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:26,579
See ya.

1156
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:30,100
Okay, then let me teach you your tool, right?

1157
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:36,520
That's it. And then a little- That's it. That's it. A little shimmy. A little shimmy.

1158
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:43,300
