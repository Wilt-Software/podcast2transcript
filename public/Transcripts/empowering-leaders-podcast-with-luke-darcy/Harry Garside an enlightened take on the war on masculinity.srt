00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,419
I'm sure you're going to love this episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast

2
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:09,080
with Olympic boxer Harry Garside.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,939
Hard to believe, Harry, he's only 26 years of age.

4
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:15,099
Found the wisdom that he brings around masculine energy

5
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:17,399
and how he's committed to staying true to himself

6
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:20,660
in order to help others do the same is very inspiring.

7
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:25,760
He's a big believer in the fortunes and following the universal energy

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,620
that keeps him on path and the right things appearing in his life

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,420
at the right times.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,160
He's full of wisdom.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,079
The way he views his idols, interesting.

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,100
Matthew McConaughey as opposed to David Goggins.

13
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,359
You want to listen to Harry's explanation as to being careful

14
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,659
who you follow and who you idolise in life.

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,420
He explains the biggest influence in his life being his mum and dad.

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,200
Harry's qualified for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games in the Australian boxing team

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,039
and I bet you, you see him on the top of the podium.

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,880
It is people like Harry Garside who inspire our work at Alita.

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,219
Love you to have a look at our signature program called Alita Connect.

20
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:01,140
We bring people together.

21
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,740
We bring people together in bespoke groups of five or six

22
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,780
to learn, to share and to collaborate.

23
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,319
Head to alitacollective.com to check it out.

24
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,420
We hope you can join your leadership journey with us very soon at Alita.

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,599
Big thanks as always to the team at Temper Bedding.

26
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,180
Thanks to Jason Nicholas and his team.

27
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,739
A mattress like no other.

28
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,000
Great leaders.

29
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,480
Olympic boxers like Harry Garside understand that sleep

30
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,579
may be the most important thing that you can do.

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,219
So investing in a mattress like Temper will be a decision that will change your life.

32
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,209
Harry Garside.

33
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:45,569
Became the first Australian Olympic boxing medalist

34
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:46,930
in more than three decades,

35
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:49,890
winning a bronze at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.

36
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:52,349
He's delayed his professional boxing career

37
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:55,450
to chase an Australian first Olympic gold in boxing

38
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,629
at the Paris Olympics in 2024,

39
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:00,730
having previously won gold at the Commonwealth Games in 2018.

40
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:04,310
Harry is a great leader and role model for young males in particular,

41
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,209
comfortably wearing nail polish as he is today

42
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:08,770
in his Olympic campaign

43
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,289
and openly leading the conversation on gender stereotypes

44
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:13,150
and the importance of masculine and feminine

45
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,669
energy in all of us.

46
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,770
Harry, it's a great pleasure to meet you.

47
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,210
It's inspiring to see what you've done.

48
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:19,650
Congratulations.

49
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,289
Thanks for having me on, Dars.

50
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,409
Great to see you.

51
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:24,569
You dedicated yourself to doing something no Australian

52
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:26,210
has ever done before.

53
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,030
That's Olympic gold in boxing.

54
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,930
Can you see yourself on the top of the podium?

55
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,789
It's so interesting because prior to the last Olympics,

56
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:33,469
Tokyo Olympics,

57
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:36,729
visualisation is a massive part of what athletes do

58
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:38,150
and many high performers do.

59
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,250
And I could always visualise myself on the podium,

60
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,990
but I can never see myself in the middle.

61
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,189
And it is a great feeling to visualise myself now.

62
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,650
I've been doing it for the last few months

63
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,770
and I can see myself in the middle.

64
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:50,490
And I'm sure over the next few months,

65
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,810
there'll be times where I don't see it,

66
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,930
but a massive portion of my time now,

67
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:56,009
I can see myself in the middle of the podium,

68
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:57,210
which is a nice feeling.

69
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,590
That's fascinating to me,

70
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,310
even with all the preparation

71
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,289
and bronze is an extraordinary achievement,

72
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,330
something that has been incredibly hard to come by.

73
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:07,449
But somewhere in your mind,

74
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,870
you think there was a hurdle that stopped you

75
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,629
from going that extra bit?

76
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,129
Yeah, I've always thought in my life,

77
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,930
that I've had this inferiority complex.

78
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:17,629
And I think it's not what's actually true in your life.

79
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:18,969
It's the stories that you believe, right?

80
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:20,810
And I believe that for a massive portion of my life,

81
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:21,629
that I'm not good enough.

82
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:23,469
And I think that played out

83
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,789
when it comes to the Tokyo Olympics.

84
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,330
And I think there was something inside of me

85
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,430
that thought that I couldn't beat Andy Cruz Gomez,

86
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:31,169
the Cuban who I lost to in the semifinal.

87
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,810
And I think that's why I couldn't see myself

88
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,650
in the middle of the podium.

89
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:36,610
And it's nice, I guess,

90
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:38,669
now to do the work since 2021

91
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:40,349
and to be in the position I am now.

92
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,930
And I guess you have a bit more self-confidence

93
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,129
and a bit more confidence in yourself.

94
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,289
And I have a stronger relationship with self,

95
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:45,849
which is nice.

96
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,870
And Harry, I understand the work started for you

97
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,210
as a 16-year-old,

98
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,969
as part of the Reach Foundation,

99
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:53,129
which is an incredible legacy.

100
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,490
The great Jimmy Steins,

101
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,870
who are fortunate enough to play against

102
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,650
and spend a lot of time.

103
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:58,990
One of the most inspirational people

104
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,090
that I've ever met, Jimmy.

105
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,729
And I suspect, I don't suspect,

106
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,789
I know he would be incredibly proud of you,

107
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,210
the person you are and the way you handle yourself.

108
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,370
Did you ever meet Jimmy?

109
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:09,449
And can you tell us about what Reach did for you?

110
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,370
No, unfortunately, I didn't get the opportunity to meet.

111
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:12,669
But,

112
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,290
his legacy lives on so strong in Reach.

113
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,050
And the impact they had on my life personally

114
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,290
and the impact that I've seen

115
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,050
that it has had on many young people

116
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,790
is honestly so profound.

117
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,550
I think the organization

118
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,689
and organizations like that are so powerful

119
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:30,490
because I think you catch a kid

120
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,009
at the right moment, right time,

121
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:33,350
you can change their life for the better.

122
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,149
And that's what organizations like Reach do.

123
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,529
And I'm so grateful that they met me.

124
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:39,029
And I truly, I always say this,

125
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:40,389
but I wouldn't be the man that I am now

126
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:41,089
if it wasn't for them.

127
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:42,230
Well, you're living, breathing,

128
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,610
proof of it for me, Harry.

129
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:44,589
I'm blown away.

130
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:46,790
I'm sitting across from a 26-year-old young man

131
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,149
who's got what I think is an incredible sense of self.

132
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:52,529
And you can express that in ways

133
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:54,730
that most of us aren't comfortable with.

134
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,670
We're in the most alpha of male sports.

135
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,389
Boxing is the ultimate combat sport for me.

136
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:00,730
And I've got that much respect

137
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,750
for anyone who gets in the ring.

138
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:03,490
But at the same time, as I said in the intro,

139
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,370
you're comfortable wearing your nail polish.

140
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:07,430
You're comfortable putting on a skirt

141
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,230
and that wisdom that you've got

142
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,790
around expressing what masculine and feminine energy is.

143
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,209
I've got my,

144
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,230
I'm 48, Harry.

145
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,310
Most of us don't have any idea of ourselves

146
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,490
still at this age.

147
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:19,550
How did you get that sense of self so young?

148
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,649
Yeah, I've always been really curious.

149
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,629
And I guess I've always asked,

150
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:25,509
I think it's the high-performing nature

151
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:26,389
of being an athlete.

152
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:28,290
I'm sure you realize this in your AFL career, right?

153
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,529
Like you're always asking more of yourself,

154
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:32,550
always reflecting on self and your performance

155
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,250
so you can be better.

156
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:35,430
And I know being in an individual sport,

157
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,430
I'm always searching myself for more answers.

158
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:39,769
And I guess that has also transitioned

159
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:41,569
into other parts of my life,

160
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:42,170
which is amazing.

161
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:42,449
Right?

162
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,230
So through the help of REACH

163
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,329
and my sporting career,

164
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,430
just always asking myself more,

165
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:48,230
being curious,

166
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,029
wanting to grow,

167
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:49,810
wanting to be better,

168
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,569
wanting to discover more.

169
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:54,389
And I realized that I'm searching for the edge.

170
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,730
I'm searching for the answers

171
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,290
and I hope I never find them

172
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,750
because it will just keep me searching.

173
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:00,189
And I love that, Harry.

174
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,550
Again, it's wisdom that,

175
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,050
you know, a lot don't get.

176
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,610
You know, the Japanese talk about

177
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,490
constant never-ending self-improvement.

178
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,149
The people I see are the 80-year-olds

179
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:11,829
that are on the path of still learning and curious.

180
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,389
And I'll ask you about curiosity

181
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:15,610
a bit across this podcast.

182
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,589
But I love this quote from you.

183
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:18,370
You know, you said,

184
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:20,829
and I'll get it hopefully right,

185
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,389
I'm a boxer with a mullet and tattoos

186
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:24,310
who's a plumber who does ballet.

187
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,269
I hope a young person sees this

188
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:28,189
and thinks I can be whatever I want to be.

189
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,850
That is incredibly inspiring, Harry.

190
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,670
You must be proud of that.

191
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:33,329
Yeah, it's so interesting.

192
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,649
And I truly believe that

193
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:37,110
every human has that inside of them.

194
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:38,310
We have things that coexist

195
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,370
and we have things that we like one thing

196
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,129
and then we don't like

197
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:45,290
and it's actually totally fine to have that.

198
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:46,069
And that's the most beautiful,

199
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:47,329
I believe the most beautiful thing

200
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:48,269
about being human is

201
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:51,089
you can have conflicting interests inside yourself.

202
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,569
And I think we often,

203
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:54,110
it's hardwired in us,

204
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,089
but we like to stereotype,

205
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,209
we like to generalize

206
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:57,370
because it's easier for our brain.

207
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:57,930
I get that.

208
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:00,389
But to like think that someone does this job

209
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:01,930
so that must mean they act like this.

210
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,269
It's like, I don't think that's true, right?

211
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,290
We're so complex and unique and beautiful

212
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,129
and you can do a job like this

213
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:09,410
but then also be very fascinated in history

214
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,129
or the performance arts.

215
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:12,089
That's totally fine.

216
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:13,930
And I'm really grateful

217
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,250
that I guess I have that mindset

218
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,350
of like just expressing and exploring

219
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,290
whatever comes up.

220
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,730
And in 10 years time,

221
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,949
I could be interested in something

222
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:22,610
that I have no interest in right now.

223
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,550
That's totally fine too.

224
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,949
And we're all weird, aren't we?

225
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,629
When you think of that,

226
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,490
we're all strange.

227
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:28,370
You know, you just got to courage

228
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,709
to express that more.

229
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,629
If you delve into everyone's private life,

230
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,709
there's strange stuff going on for all of us.

231
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:34,810
And we, you know,

232
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,589
some people have their deepest, darkest seat.

233
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:37,790
When you say them out loud,

234
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:40,050
it sort of takes the myth out of it, doesn't it?

235
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:41,430
It's like discrimination or anything.

236
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,170
It's strange.

237
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,050
Why would you discriminate against someone

238
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,389
because of their sexual preference

239
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:48,050
or because they wear nail polish?

240
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,370
It's bizarre when you think about it,

241
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,250
but it's caused so much hatred.

242
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:55,350
You seem to be able to tread that better

243
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,490
than almost anyone I've seen.

244
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:57,069
Thank you.

245
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:58,009
I find it really,

246
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:00,689
I guess for some of the stuff that I do,

247
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:02,050
I guess being in a super masculine,

248
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:03,730
male-dominated sport like boxing,

249
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,110
I cop a lot of criticism

250
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,509
for wearing the nail polish

251
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:07,790
or being in dresses sometimes

252
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,509
and stuff like that.

253
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,550
Does it ever get you?

254
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,709
Oh, there it's,

255
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:11,329
I'm human.

256
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:11,750
Right?

257
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:13,449
There is times where you're writing back

258
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:13,810
and commenting,

259
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,949
it's just stuff you, mate,

260
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,170
but then you delete anything, mate.

261
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,209
Don't, just, just,

262
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:17,970
it's okay.

263
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:18,550
It's part of it.

264
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:19,250
It's part of the nature.

265
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,430
But I actually think what it is,

266
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,610
what is actually playing out

267
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,110
for those people who write those comments

268
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,670
or who try and bring people down,

269
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:28,490
it shows where they're not free in their own life

270
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,269
and where there is something internal,

271
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:31,430
whether they know it or not,

272
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,429
but there's something internal

273
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,610
where they look at me and go,

274
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,470
he's free to express himself

275
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,570
however he sees fit.

276
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:38,370
I want to do that,

277
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:39,730
but I can't

278
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,950
because I'm so scared

279
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,409
of other people

280
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:41,870
and other people's opinions.

281
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,049
I'm so scared

282
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,090
of what people might think of me.

283
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:44,750
I'm so scared

284
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,029
of my dad's criticism

285
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:47,929
or my partner's criticism,

286
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:48,929
my friend's criticism

287
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:49,669
if I did this

288
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:50,490
or did something different.

289
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,710
So they don't.

290
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:52,610
They stay in line

291
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,730
and they critique people.

292
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:54,009
Right?

293
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,070
And that's what I think it is.

294
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:55,889
I'm just trying more people

295
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:56,769
to explore themselves

296
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,090
and whatever comes out,

297
00:08:58,149 --> 00:08:58,750
that's fine, right?

298
00:08:58,769 --> 00:08:59,850
As long as you don't hurt anyone else,

299
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:00,750
like that's all that matters.

300
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,570
Like life is made to enjoy

301
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,350
and experience things

302
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,210
and do wild things.

303
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:05,250
And you walk into a room,

304
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,429
Aaron,

305
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:06,169
and you've got joy,

306
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:06,830
you know,

307
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:07,429
about you.

308
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:08,409
You've got an energy about you

309
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:09,389
that makes you smile

310
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:10,590
sitting across from you here today.

311
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:11,190
And I think you're right,

312
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,370
isn't it?

313
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,230
When we're judging someone else

314
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,029
and we all do it,

315
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,970
I'm guilty of it all the time

316
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:16,370
where you go,

317
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,990
oh, that person really shits me,

318
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:18,769
you know,

319
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:19,490
because X, Y.

320
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:20,570
I don't like that about behaviour

321
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,710
but if I stop and think,

322
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:22,330
I go,

323
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:22,590
shit,

324
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:23,549
there's a bit of me in that.

325
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:25,970
There's a bit of what I'm not good at

326
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,049
and I'm reflecting that on them.

327
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:30,269
Is that part of how you see it as well?

328
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:32,009
I always see that with my dad, right?

329
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:33,250
Me and my dad are so similar

330
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,269
and I love him to bits

331
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:35,389
but there's often times

332
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:36,429
where I will judge

333
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:38,049
or criticise him internally.

334
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:39,370
Sometimes I'll let him go

335
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:39,389
and I'll let him go.

336
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,710
And I think that's because

337
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,669
it's where I'm not free

338
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:43,330
in my own life

339
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,409
and the things that I'm trying

340
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:45,169
to work on myself

341
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,409
and I see that in my dad

342
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:47,470
and I'm sure that happens

343
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,529
on a large scale as well

344
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:50,470
in society.

345
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:50,889
And Harry,

346
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,690
life always throws a hand grenade

347
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,090
no matter what is coming along

348
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,049
and we then get the chance to do it.

349
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,269
You get off a plane from South Africa

350
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,110
returning from shooting

351
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,509
a reality TV show,

352
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,269
you land in Sydney,

353
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,570
you get arrested at the airport,

354
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,950
you've since been cleared

355
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,789
of all the charges.

356
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,269
Can you explain

357
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:09,370
just how tough that was

358
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:09,909
at the time?

359
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,590
For me personally,

360
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,110
that was the hardest period

361
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,669
of my life.

362
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:14,470
I actually,

363
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,070
I always do like a little recap

364
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:16,769
at the end of the year,

365
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,870
especially going into December.

366
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:19,529
I'll view all my memory

367
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:20,070
from the year

368
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,730
and my photos

369
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,730
and I was viewing some videos

370
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,490
that I made,

371
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,330
especially in the three weeks

372
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,250
post, I guess,

373
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:26,830
my arrest

374
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,309
when I was going through the process

375
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:29,529
and the charges hadn't been dropped

376
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,309
and some of the videos

377
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:32,090
were so confronting

378
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,070
just seeing how low

379
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,929
and flat

380
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:37,330
and I'd never experienced

381
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,610
anything that serious

382
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,230
in my life

383
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,870
and the voices

384
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,730
inside my head,

385
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:43,549
words will truly

386
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:44,230
never articulate

387
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,370
what was going on, right?

388
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:48,049
But it's in those moments

389
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:48,870
where you find out

390
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,830
who you are, right?

391
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,830
It's in those moments.

392
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:51,549
It's in those,

393
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:53,610
you never want tough times

394
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,269
when you're in them

395
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:55,830
but like now that I'm through it,

396
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:56,990
I'm so grateful that happened.

397
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,230
And so when you look back on that,

398
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:00,769
you know,

399
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,289
you get into a dark space

400
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:05,149
and I suppose you find

401
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:06,169
out who your friends are

402
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:06,950
pretty quickly, don't you,

403
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,230
in that situation as well?

404
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:08,669
Did that,

405
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:09,509
happen?

406
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,629
Did you find out people

407
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:11,690
deserted you

408
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,690
at your toughest moment?

409
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:14,250
Yeah, it's so interesting.

410
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,149
It's the world we live in

411
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:15,970
right now too, right?

412
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:16,830
This cancel culture

413
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,370
and it's so interesting.

414
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:18,830
There's like,

415
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:19,590
there was brands

416
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,830
who backed me prior to that

417
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,370
and there was,

418
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:22,470
there was podcast,

419
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,909
one of my favorite podcast shows

420
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:24,870
deleted the episode

421
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,309
and I was friends

422
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:27,029
with the people, right?

423
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,950
And I'm thinking

424
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,330
like that none of them

425
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:29,830
messaged me,

426
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:31,009
none of them checked in,

427
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:31,549
none of them.

428
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:31,830
Wow.

429
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:33,929
Organizations that they,

430
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:34,929
they have all these

431
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:36,230
or brands, sorry,

432
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:36,850
that were backing me,

433
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:37,649
they have all these things

434
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:38,909
about supporting your bros,

435
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,710
and they support Movember

436
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,909
and do stuff like that

437
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:44,090
and they don't check in on you

438
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:44,789
when you're going through

439
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:45,549
tough times.

440
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:46,009
It's like,

441
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,389
you realize that

442
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:48,909
there's a lot of people

443
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:49,730
who do this stuff

444
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,950
just to make themselves look

445
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,370
like they have integrity

446
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,389
and look like they,

447
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:54,169
you know,

448
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:54,769
they're keeping up

449
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:55,429
like everyone else.

450
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,009
They're good,

451
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:56,710
they're good brands

452
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,289
and good people,

453
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:59,230
but when push comes to shove,

454
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,970
I guess you realize

455
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,490
who's real

456
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,409
and someone who

457
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:02,970
I'll talk so highly of,

458
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,429
the girls from,

459
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:05,230
from Swiss Multivitamins

460
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:07,169
and Hamish McLaughlin,

461
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:08,470
he stood by me

462
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,210
when,

463
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,149
we recorded something

464
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:10,529
early,

465
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,509
earlier in the year

466
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:12,750
and when I went through that,

467
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,529
apparently his producers

468
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:14,169
called him and said,

469
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,409
what are we going to do about Harry?

470
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,370
We're going to release the episode

471
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:16,690
and he's like,

472
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:17,210
always,

473
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,090
he's like,

474
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:18,909
I'm going to stand by him

475
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:20,570
and I'll always love

476
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,690
Hamish McLaughlin for that

477
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,429
because he had no loyalty to me

478
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:24,450
but he showed his,

479
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,169
his true colors

480
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:26,309
and showed the type of man

481
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:26,769
that he is.

482
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,009
It's great to hear.

483
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:28,830
A great friend of mine

484
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,350
I worked with on the week

485
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,610
and not surprised at all

486
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:31,909
and I,

487
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,529
and I think,

488
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:33,490
you know,

489
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:34,149
the scar tissue

490
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:35,009
that's left Harry

491
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:35,769
from those events,

492
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,129
I mean,

493
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:36,389
it's,

494
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:37,570
people read the headlines,

495
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:38,409
they don't then

496
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:40,549
see cleared of all charges.

497
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,450
Do you feel like

498
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,610
that's just part

499
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,429
of what happens in you?

500
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,529
Can you move on completely

501
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:45,289
from something like that?

502
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:45,990
Yeah,

503
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:46,289
it's,

504
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:46,789
it's interesting.

505
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:47,210
I think,

506
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:48,490
I think I'll probably notice

507
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,870
the scars the most

508
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,889
when I probably date again.

509
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:51,370
I'll probably,

510
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,590
that's the area where

511
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,230
absolutely there's a few wounds

512
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,330
that I'll probably have to address

513
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:55,590
when,

514
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,549
when that time comes.

515
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:57,549
Of course,

516
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,110
I'll always,

517
00:12:58,289 --> 00:12:58,509
I guess,

518
00:12:58,529 --> 00:12:59,529
hold something inside.

519
00:12:59,669 --> 00:12:59,870
Like,

520
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,710
we're all like,

521
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:01,090
oh,

522
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,590
maybe,

523
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,570
maybe this is just me

524
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,009
but we're all like

525
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:03,850
a little bit spiteful

526
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,330
or resentful for,

527
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,730
I guess,

528
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:06,750
things that happen to us

529
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,070
but you realize

530
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:08,570
who's real

531
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,250
and you realize

532
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:09,929
who's not right

533
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:11,009
and then my circle

534
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:11,909
got smaller this year

535
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:12,429
and I guess

536
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:13,509
I'm grateful for that too.

537
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:13,789
Like,

538
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:14,190
that's,

539
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,409
I'm at the age now

540
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:15,710
of 20,

541
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:16,850
I just turned 26 this year

542
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,210
and I think

543
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,169
you start realizing

544
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:19,710
that life's not about

545
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,490
having heaps of friends,

546
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,009
it's about having

547
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:21,649
quality friends

548
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:22,490
and I'm really grateful

549
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:22,850
for that.

550
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:23,470
And to me,

551
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,509
you're a great beacon

552
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:26,990
of what's a huge challenge

553
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,889
for the world at the moment.

554
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,250
It feels like

555
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,389
there's a mental health epidemic

556
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:29,629
now,

557
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:29,889
young,

558
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,389
anxiety,

559
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:31,669
depression,

560
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,450
eating disorders

561
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,509
at record numbers

562
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:33,990
and,

563
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,389
you know,

564
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:35,049
tragically,

565
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,950
that's the case

566
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,049
but it seems like

567
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:39,190
you're this great leader

568
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:39,929
for the generation

569
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:41,149
of living an authentic life.

570
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:41,909
What's your advice

571
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:42,990
to young people

572
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,169
who are maybe

573
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:45,049
struggling a little bit?

574
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,889
It's a really interesting thing.

575
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,629
I think I always

576
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:48,610
change my answer on this

577
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,350
and I think

578
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,230
right now,

579
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:51,669
I'm a firm believer

580
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:52,009
that

581
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:54,129
we often make promises

582
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:54,929
with ourself

583
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:56,009
and I can reflect

584
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:56,649
on my life

585
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:57,830
when I have been my lowest.

586
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:58,929
It's when I don't

587
00:13:58,929 --> 00:13:59,769
uphold those promises

588
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:01,389
and you get to the point

589
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:02,169
where you stop

590
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:02,850
making the promises

591
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,950
and then you feel

592
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,049
that flat about yourself

593
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:06,350
because you don't even believe

594
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,330
that you have your own word

595
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,029
but the truth is

596
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:08,049
that you don't even believe

597
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:08,809
The times that I feel

598
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:09,909
the best about myself

599
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:11,110
is when I make

600
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,830
those little promises

601
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,769
and I uphold them

602
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:13,529
consistently

603
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:14,710
for a period of time

604
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,950
and the times

605
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:16,710
where I felt the best

606
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,690
obviously prior to comp

607
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,870
is when you're training

608
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,350
every day

609
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,750
and you're doing

610
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,289
all these things

611
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:21,190
that 1% is outside

612
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:21,870
of training too

613
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,429
and you're upholding

614
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,049
that word

615
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:25,490
and being the person

616
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,470
that you say you are

617
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,169
consistently

618
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:28,129
for an amount of time

619
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:29,490
and I feel like

620
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,110
I'm strong

621
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:30,929
and I'm stable

622
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:31,690
and I'm secure

623
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,789
and I feel like

624
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,830
life will often

625
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,370
throw things

626
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,429
that are out of our control

627
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:37,090
that can derail us

628
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,029
but when I'm

629
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:38,909
strong and stable

630
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:39,750
and secure in myself

631
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,509
because I've upheld

632
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:41,070
my word

633
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,509
I feel like

634
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:43,690
I can attack those

635
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,330
way better

636
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,789
So what's an example

637
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:46,370
of a promise

638
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,889
that you give to yourself

639
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:48,509
that you keep

640
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:49,250
that works for you?

641
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:50,250
So it would be

642
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,990
when I am my flattest

643
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,330
the one thing I do

644
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,149
the next day

645
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:54,929
is fast

646
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:55,950
for 24 hours

647
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,389
because it's actually

648
00:14:57,389 --> 00:14:58,269
quite a challenging thing

649
00:14:58,269 --> 00:14:58,549
right?

650
00:14:58,649 --> 00:14:59,590
We all love to eat

651
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,929
especially in Western Civilization

652
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:02,009
we love to eat

653
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:03,370
And a lot of emotional eating too

654
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,029
when you're struggling

655
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:04,649
Absolutely

656
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:05,629
and I guess

657
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:06,950
even if it isn't

658
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,909
as extreme

659
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:08,590
as fasting

660
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,049
picking one thing

661
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:11,309
that you're going

662
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:12,070
to achieve tomorrow

663
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:12,529
it could be

664
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:13,549
mowing the lawns

665
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:13,950
it could be

666
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:14,730
cleaning your house

667
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,950
and make sure

668
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,730
you achieve it

669
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,629
and then just

670
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:18,649
like sit in it

671
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:19,450
for a period of time

672
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,370
like that feeling

673
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,049
of positivity

674
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:22,429
that you did

675
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:23,090
what you said

676
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:23,769
you were going to do

677
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:24,929
and you upheld

678
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:25,850
the look

679
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,769
and the man in the mirror

680
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:27,230
and I think

681
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,330
that is so important

682
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,009
and little things

683
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:29,789
that I try and do

684
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:30,669
I want a bit of a

685
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:32,250
down period

686
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:32,629
at the moment

687
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:33,409
as I just competed

688
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:34,029
last week

689
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:35,190
but I've made a deal

690
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:35,570
with myself

691
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,230
between now

692
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,730
and the Olympics

693
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,409
I'm going to train

694
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:38,269
every single day

695
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:38,750
between now

696
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,190
and the Olympics

697
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,190
and on days off

698
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:41,750
we're supposed to have

699
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,710
days off as athletes

700
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,350
they'll just be like

701
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,629
a little 3 or 5k run

702
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:45,610
just nice and cruisy

703
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,710
but that is a deal

704
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,769
that I've made with myself

705
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:48,830
I'm on my down period

706
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,850
but I have to train

707
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,690
every day

708
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,210
between now

709
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:51,669
and the Olympics

710
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:53,269
and the research

711
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,769
on fasting

712
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:54,750
is fascinating too

713
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,669
what it does

714
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:57,370
I've read a lot about it

715
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:57,950
you know Ramadan

716
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,330
and you know

717
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,009
a lot of those

718
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:01,549
religious times

719
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:02,590
where people do fast

720
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,529
have got a lot of science

721
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,370
and thousands of years

722
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:04,730
in history

723
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,250
it's just sort of

724
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,129
a lost art isn't it

725
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:06,750
in some ways

726
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:06,950
that

727
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:07,389
you know

728
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:07,850
the day off

729
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,929
you give your body a rest

730
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:10,190
you're not dying today

731
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,389
you can go without food

732
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:12,450
for a long time actually

733
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:12,889
can't you

734
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:13,629
and you find that

735
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:14,970
24 hours

736
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:15,909
just gives you

737
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,090
strength of mind

738
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:17,490
that one

739
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,350
you can have the discipline

740
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:18,970
to do it

741
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:19,450
and two

742
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,190
it just gives your body

743
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:20,990
a reset as well

744
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,649
yeah absolutely

745
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:22,450
of course there is

746
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,509
scientific benefits

747
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:24,809
but I do it more so

748
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,230
for having my word

749
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,110
and I guess having

750
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,190
a stronger sense of self

751
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,149
and it's a great feeling

752
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:30,549
I guess

753
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:31,889
to I guess

754
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:32,909
take back control

755
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:33,590
of your word

756
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,830
and there's so much

757
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,350
in our life

758
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,830
that I think

759
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,049
is out of our control

760
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:37,570
and sometimes

761
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,649
we can be living

762
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:39,129
our life

763
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:39,850
and be dictated

764
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,190
by I don't know

765
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:41,870
by a job

766
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,149
or by other people

767
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:43,629
telling us

768
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:43,970
what to do

769
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:44,549
with our lives

770
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:45,190
but when we can

771
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:45,730
take back

772
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,129
a little bit

773
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:46,769
of control

774
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:47,470
I think that's

775
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,389
when we feel our best

776
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:49,690
Mike Dunlap

777
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,409
was on this podcast

778
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,649
he coached

779
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:52,570
the Charlotte Hornets

780
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,649
Michael Jordan's team

781
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:54,570
legendary coach

782
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,529
in the world

783
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:56,049
of basketball

784
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:56,750
and he talks about

785
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,570
the miracle morning

786
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,470
which is actually a book

787
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,090
and the freedom

788
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,769
in routine

789
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:00,429
and the freedom

790
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:01,570
of silence

791
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,409
and affirmation

792
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:03,070
and reading

793
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:03,830
and a little bit

794
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,289
of writing

795
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,150
and visualisation

796
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,549
in the process

797
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:07,150
of a day

798
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,130
and a lot of people

799
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:08,609
think freedom

800
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:09,690
is being able

801
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:10,369
to do nothing

802
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:12,009
they talk about

803
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:12,829
and I agree too

804
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:13,529
so when you commit

805
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:14,150
to do something

806
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,869
and you show up

807
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:15,329
for yourself

808
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:16,869
it sounds like

809
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,690
you've got that wisdom

810
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,710
pretty comfortably

811
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,390
I was thinking

812
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,569
when I was reading

813
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:21,250
all your stuff Harry

814
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,250
in preparation for this

815
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,930
and I was taken by it

816
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,210
I loved listening

817
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,670
to your words

818
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,049
and how you've spoken

819
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:28,410
about it

820
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:28,710
and I was thinking

821
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,670
about Scott Galloway

822
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,049
I'm not sure

823
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,210
if you've seen his work

824
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,210
he's an American academic

825
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,069
a really intelligent voice

826
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:34,730
on what he sees

827
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,210
as the struggles

828
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:35,930
for young men

829
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,829
and talking

830
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:38,150
that young males

831
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,970
are twice as likely

832
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:39,549
to overdose

833
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:40,490
three and a half times

834
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,549
more likely to suicide

835
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:43,289
nine times more likely

836
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:44,009
to be in prison

837
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:44,450
in the US

838
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,509
and he describes

839
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:46,690
the most dangerous person

840
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,630
in the world

841
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,349
he says

842
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:48,869
as a broke

843
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:50,049
alone young male

844
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:51,029
and he thinks

845
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:51,650
we're producing

846
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,650
millions of them

847
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,369
around the world

848
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:54,930
because of what I think

849
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,009
you're an expert in

850
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,150
males don't know

851
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:57,869
how to be masculine

852
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:58,670
or how to be

853
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,390
more feminine

854
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,170
we're stuck

855
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,390
the young generation

856
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,450
in what are we

857
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,529
actually supposed to be

858
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:04,430
how do you think

859
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:04,990
about all that

860
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,809
I

861
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:06,509
I think that's

862
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:07,190
one of the most

863
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,009
important topics

864
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:09,009
over the next five years

865
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:10,089
I think there's a war

866
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,390
on masculinity right now

867
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,490
and I think

868
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,750
I hate the term

869
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,630
toxic masculinity

870
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,450
it does my head in

871
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,470
because it isn't toxic

872
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,089
to be masculine

873
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:17,750
it's needed

874
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,170
it is so needed

875
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:19,529
and I

876
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:20,730
it's absolutely

877
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,170
there is negative parts

878
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:22,950
of cultures

879
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,170
and societal norms

880
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:25,569
or

881
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:26,789
you mean stuff like that

882
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:27,289
absolutely

883
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:28,769
but being masculine

884
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:29,529
being strong

885
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:30,170
being stable

886
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:30,690
and I guess

887
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,170
I can only speak

888
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,029
from my experience

889
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,190
but I can't deny

890
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:34,970
that there is something

891
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,690
inside of me

892
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:35,950
that

893
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,769
this masculine energy

894
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:38,829
that wants to be secure

895
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:39,490
safe

896
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,569
and be the protector

897
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:41,170
and provider

898
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,109
of the people around me

899
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:42,470
and people

900
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,609
and I'm sure you feel that

901
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:44,369
you've got a family

902
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:46,029
I'm sure you feel that right

903
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:46,789
that is the pure

904
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:47,670
masculine energy

905
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,210
and that is beautiful

906
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,009
and that is needed

907
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:51,210
and society needs that

908
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:51,869
to balance that

909
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:53,029
it also needs a beautiful

910
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:54,150
feminine energy too

911
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,930
right

912
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,710
and they need

913
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,490
the nurture

914
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,089
the nature

915
00:18:57,089 --> 00:18:58,670
to be the receiver

916
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,869
they need that right

917
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:00,890
and I think

918
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,630
right now

919
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,750
there's like a little war

920
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,470
on masculinity

921
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,789
and it's really

922
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:05,470
heartbreaking

923
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:05,890
to see

924
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,509
because I think

925
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:07,630
young men especially

926
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,410
they can't help

927
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,890
at the age of 14

928
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,089
that they've got this energy

929
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:12,809
this frequency

930
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:14,890
this rambunctious nature

931
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,250
they can't help that right

932
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,109
and then they're being told

933
00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:17,690
to sit down

934
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,269
be quiet

935
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:19,109
don't act like that

936
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:19,730
that's wrong

937
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:20,630
so what do they do

938
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,390
they suppress it

939
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,569
and it comes out in ugly ways

940
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:23,849
and then someone like Andrew Tate

941
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:24,769
comes out

942
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:26,150
and sort of gives them a voice

943
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,190
so of course

944
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,890
they're going to follow him

945
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:28,650
it's because everyone is telling

946
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,789
they can't act like that

947
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:30,250
it's like

948
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,849
I think masculinity

949
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:32,690
is beautiful

950
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,069
but it's beautiful

951
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:35,210
when you learn to control it

952
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:35,450
and that's why

953
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,490
I think combat sport

954
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,150
is beautiful

955
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,250
it really is

956
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:38,849
because it gives

957
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:40,269
not just young men

958
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:41,029
but young people

959
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:42,849
the ability to feel confident

960
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:43,990
in their own body

961
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,230
and to feel secure

962
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,069
in their own body

963
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:46,849
and to feel like

964
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:48,109
if anything bad

965
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:48,869
happened around them

966
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:49,789
they would be safe enough

967
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,430
to take care of themselves

968
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,670
and people around them

969
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,910
but when you keep

970
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,670
emasculating people

971
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,829
I reckon it comes out

972
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:57,690
in really ugly ways

973
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,230
personally

974
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,569
yeah well said

975
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:00,630
and I agree with you

976
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,089
wholeheartedly

977
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:01,549
and it's

978
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:02,150
you know almost

979
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,190
cancel culture

980
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,910
kicks in on this

981
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,190
you know

982
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:04,829
if you're even

983
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:05,450
you know

984
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,569
starting to prosecute

985
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:07,309
that case now

986
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:08,410
it's a very sensitive thing

987
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:08,849
but you're right

988
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:09,490
someone's going to

989
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,250
break in the door

990
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,109
tonight

991
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,450
and charge the family

992
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,690
and I hope the masculine

993
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,569
energy kicks in

994
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:15,329
I'm sure

995
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:16,029
you know

996
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:16,930
it's pretty valuable

997
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:17,509
then isn't it

998
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:18,490
you've got a family of four

999
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,250
you want that

1000
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,410
aggression to be there

1001
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:20,950
you don't want to

1002
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:21,869
hide away from that

1003
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:22,630
and you're right

1004
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,109
it's someone like

1005
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:23,809
an Andrew Tate

1006
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:25,470
who captures young men

1007
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,789
but underneath it

1008
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:28,470
is this misogynistic message

1009
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,309
and does take it

1010
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:29,950
into a path

1011
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,369
that is really unhelpful

1012
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:32,210
on the surface

1013
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:32,970
you can see why

1014
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,009
it's captivating for young men

1015
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:34,750
because they're looking

1016
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,309
for leadership

1017
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,450
they're looking for

1018
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,450
I suggest they go to

1019
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,089
Harry Garside

1020
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:38,930
maybe more than

1021
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,930
Andrew Tate

1022
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,430
I had

1023
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,930
a brilliant author

1024
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:43,490
Steve Biddle

1025
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,210
on this podcast

1026
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:44,990
as well

1027
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,809
Harry

1028
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:47,009
Raising Boys

1029
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:47,609
has sold more

1030
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:48,390
four million copies

1031
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,029
one of the

1032
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:49,970
legends of

1033
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,029
parenting

1034
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:52,529
stage you're not at yet

1035
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:53,970
but globally renowned author

1036
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,150
and he talks about

1037
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,089
being in auditoriums

1038
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:57,789
or he spoke to me

1039
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:58,950
in this podcast

1040
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,589
about

1041
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:00,470
of thousands

1042
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,269
and thousands of women

1043
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:02,849
he's really sought after

1044
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:03,529
and a lot of mums

1045
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,009
want to go

1046
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:04,670
and talk about

1047
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,430
raising boys

1048
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,490
and raising girls

1049
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,670
and then he started asking

1050
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,390
the question he was saying

1051
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,150
to me in these audiences

1052
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,170
well what do you want

1053
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:10,650
from a man

1054
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,170
what do you actually want

1055
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,589
and he was saying

1056
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:15,410
like the words come out

1057
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,450
really really quickly

1058
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,470
and it starts with

1059
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:17,710
you know

1060
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,430
first of all they say

1061
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:18,670
I want

1062
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,349
you know

1063
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:19,930
Tom Cruise

1064
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:20,910
or Harry Garside

1065
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:21,869
because you know

1066
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:22,670
the good looking rooster

1067
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:22,930
and he said

1068
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,650
once you get through all that

1069
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,410
then they start going

1070
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,210
hey I want a bloke

1071
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:25,849
who has a crack

1072
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:26,750
I want a bloke

1073
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,809
who's got some

1074
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:28,549
some strength

1075
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:29,349
I want him to have a go

1076
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:30,630
I don't want a guy soft

1077
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:30,930
you know

1078
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:31,650
so there's all these

1079
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,730
sort of words you write

1080
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,410
on the whiteboard

1081
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,950
but then on the other side

1082
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:35,609
he said

1083
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:36,630
but I also want him

1084
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,210
to be kind

1085
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,569
and I also want him

1086
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:39,950
to care a little bit

1087
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,990
I want him to be a good dad

1088
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,150
I want him to be empathetic

1089
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,029
and he sums it up

1090
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,450
and says

1091
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,009
really what you're after

1092
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:46,549
is males to have

1093
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,970
backbone

1094
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,009
and heart

1095
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:49,710
and I think it's a beautiful way

1096
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,470
to describe

1097
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,150
I think

1098
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,329
what you're saying as well

1099
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:53,130
you don't want to lose

1100
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:53,670
a backbone

1101
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,230
but maybe we bring more heart

1102
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:55,930
into it

1103
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,250
for males who are in good shape

1104
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,390
I think 100%

1105
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,130
I couldn't agree more

1106
00:21:59,130 --> 00:21:59,930
it's someone who

1107
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,029
is secure enough

1108
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:02,730
in their energy

1109
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,309
that if

1110
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:04,289
if I can swear

1111
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,549
it was going to hit the fan

1112
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:06,630
they're stable

1113
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,950
and that

1114
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,890
they're the people

1115
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,769
that people turn to

1116
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:09,390
in those moments

1117
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,349
that's who you want

1118
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:11,069
leading the house

1119
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:11,769
that's who you want

1120
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:12,670
being the strong

1121
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,390
stable person

1122
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:13,710
right

1123
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,089
correct

1124
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:15,349
but then you also want

1125
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:16,470
someone who's in control

1126
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,049
of their emotions

1127
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:18,130
and I think

1128
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,509
there is a massive portion

1129
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:20,309
and I don't know

1130
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:21,269
I think it's getting better

1131
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:22,109
I'm obviously not

1132
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:22,769
in the school system

1133
00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:23,210
but like

1134
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,289
on scale

1135
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:24,970
I believe

1136
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:25,950
the feminine energy

1137
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,990
and females on scale

1138
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:27,650
have way better

1139
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,549
emotional intelligence

1140
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:29,109
it's in them

1141
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:30,470
it's really nice to see

1142
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:30,910
and I think

1143
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,950
if we can

1144
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:32,410
I guess

1145
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,450
teach more men

1146
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,269
and young

1147
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:34,609
boys

1148
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:35,589
emotional intelligence

1149
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:36,150
and I guess

1150
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,589
to be in control

1151
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:38,230
of their emotions

1152
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,670
more often

1153
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,470
and not let the emotions

1154
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,289
get the better of them

1155
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:41,650
I think the world

1156
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,369
would be a better place

1157
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:42,710
and I think

1158
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,549
when you do that

1159
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:44,869
when you can

1160
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:45,869
control your emotions

1161
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:46,690
you can control

1162
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,450
your actions too

1163
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,309
yeah well said

1164
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:48,950
I can

1165
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,250
you know

1166
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:49,789
it's pretty helpful

1167
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:50,410
being aggressive

1168
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,529
as an AFL player

1169
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:52,589
playing the role I play

1170
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:53,849
that's almost part

1171
00:22:53,849 --> 00:22:54,769
of the program

1172
00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:55,450
and without it

1173
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,130
you don't succeed

1174
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,769
but then when you finish

1175
00:22:57,769 --> 00:22:59,170
not that helpful

1176
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,230
sometimes being a parent

1177
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,950
you start screaming

1178
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,509
at your kids

1179
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:02,529
and you know

1180
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:04,170
having a beautiful partner

1181
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,130
to teach you more

1182
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:05,650
of that emotional

1183
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,230
that's not appropriate

1184
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:07,589
there

1185
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:08,390
you need to learn

1186
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,150
and it can be learned

1187
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:09,470
isn't it

1188
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:09,990
it's a discussion

1189
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,950
that needs to be had

1190
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:11,930
and once again

1191
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,150
mate

1192
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,069
I credit with you

1193
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:14,670
at your age

1194
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,950
it's brilliant

1195
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,809
the way that you're able

1196
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:17,750
to describe it

1197
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,230
so clearly

1198
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,569
we say in our world

1199
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:21,089
a bit Harry

1200
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:21,630
in this space

1201
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,650
success leaves clues

1202
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,009
and I love sitting down

1203
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:24,690
with different people

1204
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,789
from an author

1205
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:27,170
of Raising Boys

1206
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,750
to a young boxer

1207
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,430
going to the Olympics

1208
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,509
I love the difference

1209
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:31,569
and we start with the idea

1210
00:23:31,569 --> 00:23:32,230
it's hard to lead

1211
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,829
someone else

1212
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,150
unless you have an idea

1213
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,170
of self-leadership

1214
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,930
do you resonate

1215
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:37,430
with the thought

1216
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,670
of self-leadership

1217
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,650
yeah it's interesting

1218
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,089
I think being an athlete

1219
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:42,750
and I've always been

1220
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,650
very obsessed

1221
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,750
with taking control

1222
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,509
of my life

1223
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:47,869
and I

1224
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:49,029
from an early age

1225
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:49,349
I don't know

1226
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:49,690
if it's because

1227
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,210
I'm the youngest

1228
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,890
and I guess

1229
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,029
I had a lot more lenience

1230
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:54,670
compared to my brothers

1231
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,609
I think my older brother

1232
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:56,369
me and my parents

1233
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:57,230
were a bit more strict on him

1234
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:57,849
and by the time

1235
00:23:57,849 --> 00:23:58,269
they got to me

1236
00:23:58,269 --> 00:23:58,470
they were like

1237
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,329
oh we've just given up

1238
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:00,430
so I think

1239
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:00,970
how many siblings

1240
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,589
three

1241
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:02,089
I'm the youngest

1242
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:02,650
of three boys

1243
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,970
I think when I went

1244
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:04,369
to school

1245
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:05,670
and teachers tell you

1246
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,109
what to do

1247
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:07,329
and everyone's telling you

1248
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:08,029
how to live your life

1249
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,890
and I really found

1250
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,369
that hard

1251
00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:10,130
because I'm like

1252
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:10,809
don't tell me

1253
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:11,549
what to do

1254
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:12,650
even from a young age

1255
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,210
I would feel this

1256
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:13,930
and I think

1257
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,690
leadership is

1258
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,809
standing tall

1259
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:17,730
and making the decisions

1260
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,289
for your life

1261
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:18,829
that are needed

1262
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:20,589
just standing stable

1263
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:21,069
and strong

1264
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:21,970
in who you are

1265
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,029
and if you don't know

1266
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:23,569
who you are

1267
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:24,509
challenge yourself

1268
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:25,430
and find out who you are

1269
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,289
and that's a really

1270
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:26,950
hard thing to do

1271
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:27,509
but I think

1272
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:28,650
that is the most

1273
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,269
beautiful journey

1274
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:29,869
is trying to find out

1275
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:30,410
who you are

1276
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,230
especially before

1277
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:31,789
you have kids

1278
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:32,670
there's great studies

1279
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,509
on first born

1280
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:33,950
to second born

1281
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,430
to last born

1282
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,950
young Max

1283
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:36,549
he's our youngest

1284
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:37,069
of four

1285
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:38,609
and I can see

1286
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:39,049
a bit of you

1287
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:39,630
in him actually

1288
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,509
you do run out of gas

1289
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:42,390
more time around

1290
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,710
and you stay

1291
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,190
you're probably

1292
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:44,829
parent better

1293
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:45,470
because you just

1294
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,829
you let go more

1295
00:24:46,829 --> 00:24:47,970
and I think

1296
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:48,450
he's got more

1297
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,210
emotional intelligence

1298
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:49,829
than all of us

1299
00:24:49,829 --> 00:24:50,250
young Max

1300
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,410
so it probably

1301
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:51,950
makes sense

1302
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,509
in some ways

1303
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:53,509
we see people

1304
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:53,809
who are really

1305
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:54,170
conscious

1306
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:55,450
in their world

1307
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,190
of how they

1308
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:56,970
positively impact

1309
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:57,710
people on a daily

1310
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,109
basis

1311
00:24:58,109 --> 00:24:58,829
and what they do

1312
00:24:58,829 --> 00:24:59,269
is that something

1313
00:24:59,269 --> 00:24:59,829
you think about?

1314
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:00,730
Ben Crow

1315
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,829
has this beautiful quote

1316
00:25:01,829 --> 00:25:03,150
life's biggest truism

1317
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:03,869
is life isn't

1318
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:04,950
about us as individuals

1319
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:05,930
it's about the impact

1320
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:06,730
we can have on others

1321
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,769
and I think

1322
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:08,529
most people

1323
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:09,349
don't realize that

1324
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:10,109
until they probably

1325
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:10,630
have kids

1326
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,369
or you mean

1327
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:11,869
they're later on

1328
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:12,269
in life

1329
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:13,769
and I've realized

1330
00:25:13,769 --> 00:25:14,410
that I guess

1331
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,269
I guess I've spent

1332
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:16,289
most of my life

1333
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:16,829
up until the age

1334
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:17,509
of 26

1335
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:18,710
probably 23

1336
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,390
is when I've noticed

1337
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,009
this but 23 years old

1338
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:23,309
I was just so focused

1339
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:23,869
on myself

1340
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:24,529
and my goals

1341
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:24,970
and everything

1342
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,170
was so selfish

1343
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,549
and self-focused

1344
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:28,470
and individualized

1345
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:28,910
and I guess

1346
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,950
I realized at 23

1347
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,569
that like life

1348
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:32,289
isn't about me

1349
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:32,950
it's about the impact

1350
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,730
we can have right

1351
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:34,490
and I guess

1352
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,369
I'm trying my best

1353
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:35,930
to step more

1354
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:36,630
into that space

1355
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,309
especially leading

1356
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:38,049
after sport

1357
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:39,029
being an athlete

1358
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:39,750
I'm sure you can

1359
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,609
vouch this too

1360
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:41,009
it's like

1361
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:41,809
it's very selfish

1362
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:42,650
I mean you focus

1363
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,609
a lot on your performance

1364
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:44,269
and what you're doing

1365
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:45,170
and your training sessions

1366
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,210
and things have to be right

1367
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,549
for you so you can perform

1368
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:49,089
but at the same time

1369
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:49,930
I have realized

1370
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:50,289
that's actually

1371
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:51,210
not that fulfilling anymore

1372
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,170
I'm ready to step

1373
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,390
into another space

1374
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:53,869
especially

1375
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:55,250
post the Olympics

1376
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:55,730
next year

1377
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,529
you're probably right

1378
00:25:56,529 --> 00:25:57,230
the trend is

1379
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:57,950
we probably should be

1380
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:58,690
thinking about ourselves

1381
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,269
at our age

1382
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,930
in lots of ways

1383
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,890
so for you to get there

1384
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:01,410
so quickly

1385
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,589
is admirable

1386
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:03,529
post Olympics

1387
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:04,269
can I ask you

1388
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:05,309
what the thoughts are

1389
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:05,630
have you got

1390
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,890
yeah I really want to step

1391
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:07,769
into so there's

1392
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:08,450
multiple things

1393
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,410
like I won't deny

1394
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,910
that money buys freedom

1395
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,589
so I definitely

1396
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:12,549
I come from no money

1397
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:13,190
so I want to

1398
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,970
I want to make sure

1399
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:14,829
I change the stars

1400
00:26:14,829 --> 00:26:15,470
for my family

1401
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,789
I feel like I'm sitting

1402
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:17,609
on a lottery ticket

1403
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,109
right now

1404
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,089
and I'm not much

1405
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:20,069
I'm not too much

1406
00:26:20,069 --> 00:26:20,450
of a pussy

1407
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,089
to cash it in

1408
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:21,849
I'm cashing it in

1409
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:23,170
I'm going to try

1410
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:23,829
and set my

1411
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:24,529
start a business

1412
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:25,089
of some sort

1413
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:25,509
that I guess

1414
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:26,170
is going to impact

1415
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,589
people on scale

1416
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:28,150
and then there'll be

1417
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,069
a little passion project

1418
00:26:29,069 --> 00:26:30,109
I guess when I'm

1419
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:31,230
financially stable enough

1420
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,970
to help young people

1421
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:33,329
and I think

1422
00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:33,869
combat sport

1423
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:34,630
is a massive part

1424
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,670
of my experience

1425
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,390
but I would love

1426
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,690
to maybe start

1427
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:38,170
something similar

1428
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,670
to Jimmy Stein's

1429
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,490
Foundation Reach

1430
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,670
but it'll be more

1431
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,089
as I said

1432
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:42,869
around combat sport

1433
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:43,190
as well

1434
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,930
do you turn pro

1435
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,210
yeah I think

1436
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:45,750
up until the age

1437
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,170
of 30

1438
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,869
I'll continue boxing

1439
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:48,970
but also I think

1440
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:49,549
about head trauma

1441
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:51,589
and you see

1442
00:26:51,589 --> 00:26:52,529
those old boxers

1443
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:53,630
who box for too long

1444
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,509
and they can't talk

1445
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:56,289
and I love talking

1446
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:57,029
and I love thinking

1447
00:26:57,029 --> 00:26:57,690
and I love

1448
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,329
stuff like that

1449
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:00,049
and I also know

1450
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:00,809
that although

1451
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:01,750
my sporting career

1452
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,509
is really important

1453
00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:03,230
to me right now

1454
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,170
being a dad

1455
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:04,950
is way more important

1456
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,750
I love it

1457
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,569
very inspiring as always

1458
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:08,650
creating and sharing

1459
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,049
a vision in what you do

1460
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:11,549
you've got a clear goal

1461
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:12,589
around what you want

1462
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,349
to achieve in Paris

1463
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:14,069
very shortly

1464
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:14,450
have you

1465
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,009
with your extended team

1466
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,029
have you got a clear way

1467
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:17,970
about you know

1468
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:18,329
when you want to

1469
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:18,950
achieve something

1470
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:19,769
how you go about

1471
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:20,809
creating and sharing it

1472
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:21,950
yeah a big thing

1473
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,990
I think I focused on

1474
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:23,730
prior to Tokyo

1475
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,230
was just doing

1476
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:25,829
the one percentage

1477
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:26,450
so I couldn't

1478
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,329
throw my left hand

1479
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:28,170
not many people knew this

1480
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,369
I couldn't throw

1481
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:30,150
my left hand

1482
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:30,809
for three months

1483
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:31,670
prior to the Olympics

1484
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,390
the last Olympics

1485
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,069
which was so

1486
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:33,509
frustrating

1487
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:34,630
and then the last month

1488
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,329
so I injured it

1489
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:37,230
I had to get surgery

1490
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:37,829
post Olympics

1491
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:39,190
and you're a southpaw

1492
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,769
so your left paw

1493
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:41,470
is your dominant hand

1494
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:41,789
yes

1495
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:43,049
but the last month

1496
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:43,829
I had a cortisone

1497
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:44,630
and I could throw it

1498
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,410
so I got my distance

1499
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,009
but I think I

1500
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:48,650
because of that

1501
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,349
I had to focus on

1502
00:27:49,349 --> 00:27:50,130
all the one percenters

1503
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:50,849
to make sure that

1504
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:51,750
outside of training

1505
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,950
I'm being the best

1506
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:53,250
mentally

1507
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,470
because a lot of sport

1508
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,410
is at the

1509
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,890
is it Novak Djokovic

1510
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:57,529
has this quote

1511
00:27:57,529 --> 00:27:58,289
the difference between

1512
00:27:58,289 --> 00:27:59,309
the first ranked player

1513
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:00,710
and the hundredth ranked player

1514
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,990
is what's between their ears

1515
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,930
and I completely

1516
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:03,289
agree

1517
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:04,250
if you can focus

1518
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:04,869
on your mind

1519
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:05,950
and be the best version

1520
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:06,450
of yourself

1521
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,690
then 90%

1522
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,329
of the problems

1523
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:09,630
are done

1524
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,630
you also need to prepare

1525
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,450
and train hard

1526
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,549
but that also is mindset

1527
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:12,950
as well

1528
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,710
so between now

1529
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,130
and July

1530
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:16,829
next year

1531
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:17,849
I'll just be focusing

1532
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:18,970
on being the best version

1533
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:19,269
of me

1534
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:19,829
and showing up

1535
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:20,450
to every session

1536
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,589
and you know

1537
00:28:21,589 --> 00:28:22,710
just keep

1538
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,509
sort of grinding

1539
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:24,490
what I've been doing

1540
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,109
and of course

1541
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:26,170
picking up new things

1542
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:26,829
on the way as well

1543
00:28:26,829 --> 00:28:27,650
and it makes sense

1544
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,009
doesn't it

1545
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:28,829
you're in a weight division

1546
00:28:28,829 --> 00:28:30,190
where weight's the same

1547
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,190
and body types

1548
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,990
are very marginal

1549
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:32,650
and strength

1550
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:32,910
and power

1551
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:33,730
they're margins

1552
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,109
aren't they

1553
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:35,089
I mean you want to

1554
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:36,170
train at the highest level

1555
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,049
in any sport you do

1556
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,069
but the gains are all

1557
00:28:38,069 --> 00:28:38,930
between the ears

1558
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:39,509
really aren't they

1559
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:40,150
when you think about it

1560
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:40,769
100%

1561
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:41,930
when you really think about it

1562
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,390
it's like

1563
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,329
say in tennis

1564
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:43,910
there's a guy

1565
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:44,769
who has a great serve

1566
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:45,869
but then the other guy's

1567
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:46,549
backhand's better

1568
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:47,769
and they sort of

1569
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:48,549
even each other out

1570
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:49,809
of course there is anomalies

1571
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:50,650
like Kelly Slater

1572
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,809
or Serena Williams

1573
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:53,369
or people who are

1574
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:55,130
the top of their craft

1575
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:55,690
right

1576
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,009
there is anomalies

1577
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:57,529
like that

1578
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:58,730
but I truly believe

1579
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,410
that 99.9%

1580
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,049
of the athletes

1581
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:02,809
who I'll be competing

1582
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:03,650
at the Olympics

1583
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,970
will be very very similar

1584
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:05,349
to me

1585
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:06,049
yeah the difference

1586
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:07,069
will be you

1587
00:29:07,069 --> 00:29:07,869
preparing the way

1588
00:29:07,869 --> 00:29:08,289
that you are

1589
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:09,029
in your mind

1590
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:09,730
which makes sense

1591
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:10,230
curiosity

1592
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:10,829
I've already heard you

1593
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:11,670
talk about it Aaron

1594
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,869
we see that's a word

1595
00:29:12,869 --> 00:29:13,990
that comes up

1596
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,470
all the time

1597
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:14,890
with people

1598
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:15,809
that have success

1599
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:16,309
like you do

1600
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:17,089
and through curiosity

1601
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:17,650
they're constantly

1602
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:18,349
getting better

1603
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:19,490
how does curiosity

1604
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,269
play out for you

1605
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:21,509
I've always been curious

1606
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:21,789
for me

1607
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:22,309
and I think

1608
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:23,269
by nature

1609
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:24,549
every young person

1610
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:25,430
is curious

1611
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,769
right

1612
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:26,630
because they're

1613
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,589
experiencing the world

1614
00:29:27,589 --> 00:29:28,390
for the first time

1615
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,970
and I just remember

1616
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,490
like spending hours

1617
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,369
like looking up

1618
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:32,690
at the

1619
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,150
sitting on the trampoline

1620
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,170
looking up at the sky

1621
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,390
or being in the car

1622
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,410
creating games

1623
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,150
that imagination

1624
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,009
is running rampant

1625
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:39,710
and that's curiosity

1626
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,849
I believe it's finest

1627
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:42,190
and I don't think

1628
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:42,950
I've ever lost it

1629
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,349
and I'm curious

1630
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,049
about myself

1631
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,069
my actions

1632
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:47,410
I'm curious

1633
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,230
about my performance

1634
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,950
so I can get better

1635
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:49,430
and I think

1636
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,170
when you're curious

1637
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:50,910
about yourself

1638
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:51,549
and you're curious

1639
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:52,250
about the world

1640
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,549
it takes away judgment

1641
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:55,269
which is the most

1642
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:55,890
important thing

1643
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:56,509
because it's like

1644
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:57,630
when I'm curious

1645
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,309
about I guess

1646
00:29:58,309 --> 00:29:58,890
say let's say

1647
00:29:58,890 --> 00:29:59,630
someone close to me

1648
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,349
like my dad

1649
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:01,809
or someone

1650
00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:02,470
my friend

1651
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,549
why they made that decision

1652
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:05,130
or why I made that decision

1653
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:05,990
when I'm curious

1654
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,930
it takes away the judgment

1655
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,309
I just go

1656
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:08,470
oh that's interesting

1657
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,769
rather than being like

1658
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:10,329
that's critical

1659
00:30:10,329 --> 00:30:11,670
and I have found curiosity

1660
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,410
to be like

1661
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,289
the best thing

1662
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:13,930
I think to

1663
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:14,710
for myself

1664
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,509
to show up

1665
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:16,369
as a better person

1666
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:18,170
rather than judging myself

1667
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,630
and that's only been

1668
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,130
really strong

1669
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:20,710
I guess the last

1670
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,390
two or three years

1671
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,150
yeah it's brilliant

1672
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:22,569
you're right

1673
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:24,089
you listen to a four

1674
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:24,829
or five year old

1675
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:25,609
they ask

1676
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:26,789
every question

1677
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:27,210
why is this

1678
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:27,789
why is that

1679
00:30:27,789 --> 00:30:29,069
and some of us

1680
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:30,150
we train it out as parents

1681
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:30,470
don't we

1682
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,190
get over it

1683
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,109
and yeah

1684
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:32,430
if you can

1685
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:32,930
hang on to it

1686
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,170
the way that you have

1687
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,049
and I can see

1688
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:35,890
that's so alive

1689
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,269
and well in you

1690
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,670
it's a great skill

1691
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,809
you're a great communicator

1692
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:41,450
and we see people

1693
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,670
communicating with clarity

1694
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,109
on all your platforms

1695
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:44,930
you've got

1696
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,369
incredibly articulate

1697
00:30:46,369 --> 00:30:47,130
way about you

1698
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:47,869
is that something

1699
00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:48,589
you've worked on

1700
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:49,769
how you get your message across

1701
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:52,269
I've been asked this before

1702
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:52,829
and I

1703
00:30:52,829 --> 00:30:54,130
I don't know

1704
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:54,890
any different right

1705
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,069
yeah so it's

1706
00:30:56,069 --> 00:30:56,490
like

1707
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,950
I don't particularly

1708
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,170
like review myself

1709
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,509
as a good communicator

1710
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:00,930
it's just like

1711
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:01,470
this is just

1712
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,250
I

1713
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:02,410
I don't know

1714
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:02,430
I don't know

1715
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,609
I've always just been curious

1716
00:31:03,609 --> 00:31:04,329
and I love having

1717
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,089
deep conversations

1718
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:05,529
because

1719
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:06,670
I

1720
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,289
I want to find out the answers

1721
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:09,430
but I hope I never find them

1722
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,150
like that's the thing

1723
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,069
I'm searching for them

1724
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,150
but I hope I never find them

1725
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:12,390
and

1726
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,750
is your dad

1727
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,690
speak the same way

1728
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,170
is it come

1729
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:16,450
is there

1730
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:16,789
is it

1731
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:17,549
because you are

1732
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:18,910
you generally get your words out

1733
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,670
in a way

1734
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,569
it's pretty profound

1735
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:21,970
was there a role model for that

1736
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,349
or you were just the third born

1737
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,670
and you found your way

1738
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,710
I truly

1739
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,549
me and my family

1740
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:27,170
I guess

1741
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:27,910
I'm really grateful

1742
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,049
as we mentioned before

1743
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:29,890
being the youngest

1744
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,250
my parents

1745
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,269
don't get me wrong

1746
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:32,410
they're my parents

1747
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:32,910
they're my parents

1748
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,130
but a lot of it

1749
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:34,890
a lot of my life

1750
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:35,869
they felt like my friends

1751
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:36,970
so they would treat me

1752
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:37,549
like an adult

1753
00:31:37,549 --> 00:31:38,509
from an early age

1754
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:40,329
which I'm really grateful for

1755
00:31:40,329 --> 00:31:41,250
they would have conversations

1756
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,170
with me that I guess

1757
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:42,690
are deep

1758
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,589
and like I remember doing stuff

1759
00:31:44,589 --> 00:31:45,730
13, 14 years old

1760
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,349
that no 13, 14 year old

1761
00:31:47,349 --> 00:31:47,930
should be doing

1762
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:48,230
right

1763
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,529
but I guess it's because

1764
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:50,130
my parents

1765
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,410
treated me like an adult

1766
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,269
which was really nice

1767
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:52,750
and I guess

1768
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,509
I saw something on Instagram

1769
00:31:54,509 --> 00:31:55,470
and so I go off

1770
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,089
on little tangents

1771
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:56,990
but I saw something on Instagram

1772
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,269
and when I think about it

1773
00:31:58,269 --> 00:31:59,289
logically it sounds right

1774
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:00,329
but what this person

1775
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:01,009
was saying was

1776
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:02,390
when humans go through

1777
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:02,769
puberty

1778
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:04,289
there is this natural thing

1779
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,529
that happens as animals

1780
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:06,509
that we're supposed to

1781
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:07,849
break away from the tribe

1782
00:32:07,849 --> 00:32:09,410
and create something

1783
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,109
of our own

1784
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:11,109
create the identity

1785
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:12,210
family community

1786
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:12,869
of our own

1787
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:14,089
and you probably realise

1788
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:14,970
this when you've got kids

1789
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:15,849
they go through this

1790
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:16,589
rebellious stage

1791
00:32:16,589 --> 00:32:17,390
most of us do

1792
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,769
and it's because

1793
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:19,750
our society

1794
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,849
keeps people trapped

1795
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:21,730
especially young people

1796
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,670
trapped until they're 20

1797
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:22,990
21

1798
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,289
and then they can leave home

1799
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:25,329
and it's like

1800
00:32:25,329 --> 00:32:25,849
there is something

1801
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:26,509
that goes on

1802
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:27,630
that like at that age

1803
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,730
they're supposed to explore

1804
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:29,609
and I'm really grateful

1805
00:32:29,609 --> 00:32:30,130
that I guess

1806
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:30,829
at a young age

1807
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:31,730
my parents gave me

1808
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:32,170
the freedom

1809
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,609
to step into my identity

1810
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:35,150
and I guess

1811
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,410
build that identity

1812
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,509
and treat me like an adult

1813
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:38,329
at an early age

1814
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:39,049
and it's sad

1815
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:39,670
that we've lost

1816
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,109
that thousands of years

1817
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:41,769
of history

1818
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:42,730
and sophistication

1819
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,650
and the rites of passage

1820
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:44,630
for young men

1821
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,210
our indigenous culture

1822
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:46,970
here in Australia

1823
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,269
incredibly sophisticated

1824
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:49,029
around

1825
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:49,890
you know

1826
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:50,950
what secret men's business

1827
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,329
means for young

1828
00:32:52,329 --> 00:32:53,170
walkabout

1829
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,309
and your family

1830
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:55,150
are left behind

1831
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:55,829
and you go off

1832
00:32:55,829 --> 00:32:56,349
with the elders

1833
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,809
and you become a man

1834
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,250
and you know

1835
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,250
modern society

1836
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,509
has lost its way

1837
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:01,789
in that

1838
00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:02,250
big time

1839
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:02,670
hasn't it

1840
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,390
and it just causes pain

1841
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:04,730
doesn't it

1842
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,009
we try and suppress young

1843
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:07,470
it's hard in your house

1844
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:07,890
your teenager

1845
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:08,849
stops talking to you

1846
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:09,390
and parents

1847
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:09,829
you know

1848
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:10,630
we panic

1849
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,349
we think oh shit

1850
00:33:11,349 --> 00:33:12,109
something's wrong

1851
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:12,529
it's like

1852
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:13,230
they're doing

1853
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:13,869
as you said

1854
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:14,490
biologically

1855
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,390
what they should be doing

1856
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,789
but we're not educated

1857
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:18,390
on how to

1858
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,269
how to handle it

1859
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:20,470
how important

1860
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,069
is collaboration

1861
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:21,809
been for you Harry

1862
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:23,329
in your world

1863
00:33:23,329 --> 00:33:24,309
yeah it's huge

1864
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:24,650
I think

1865
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,170
I'm so grateful

1866
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,549
that over the years

1867
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:28,250
I've just met

1868
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,950
so many amazing people

1869
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,269
who

1870
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:31,490
and I

1871
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,109
truly

1872
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:32,869
I'm a firm believer

1873
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:34,529
I'm not a religious man

1874
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:35,490
but I guess I surrender

1875
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,490
to the universe

1876
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,309
I often say

1877
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:38,109
the universe

1878
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:38,930
has a plan for me

1879
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,009
and that's just like saying

1880
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:40,910
God has a plan for me

1881
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,109
but

1882
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:43,190
I'm a firm believer

1883
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,809
that the universe

1884
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:44,950
offers me people

1885
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:45,930
and offers me things

1886
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,549
and just puts things

1887
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:48,730
in place for you

1888
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,450
at the right moment

1889
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,170
at the right time

1890
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,509
the hard times

1891
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:52,609
are needed too

1892
00:33:52,609 --> 00:33:53,690
and the universe

1893
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,910
always has a plan for me

1894
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:55,950
and I truly believe

1895
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,170
that

1896
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,609
I have met

1897
00:33:57,609 --> 00:33:58,430
some of the best people

1898
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,029
in my life

1899
00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:00,109
and I've always met them

1900
00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:00,910
at the right time too

1901
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:01,250
and

1902
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,950
to form really strong connections

1903
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,170
in the boxing community

1904
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,750
and outside of the boxing community

1905
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,089
and

1906
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:07,150
prime example

1907
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:07,670
I just caught up

1908
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,289
with someone before

1909
00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:09,449
growing up

1910
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,130
I never met anyone

1911
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:10,909
who went to university

1912
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:11,230
right

1913
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,769
I go to

1914
00:34:12,769 --> 00:34:14,369
quarantine during COVID

1915
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:15,389
up in Darwin

1916
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,429
I'm there for two weeks

1917
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,530
I met this guy

1918
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,090
Scott Bradley

1919
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:18,889
he's an absolute legend

1920
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:19,750
big fan of you

1921
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,929
he was like

1922
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:22,250
quite a successful businessman

1923
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,349
and he's someone

1924
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:24,289
who I can go to now

1925
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:24,889
for ideas

1926
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:25,389
and stuff like that

1927
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,050
because as I said

1928
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:26,750
I didn't know anyone

1929
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:27,530
who went to university

1930
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:27,949
so

1931
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,230
when it comes to like

1932
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,489
taxes or anything

1933
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:30,829
I guess

1934
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:31,530
business related

1935
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,730
I didn't know who to ask right

1936
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,030
but the universe

1937
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:34,989
just offers you people

1938
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:35,530
at the right time

1939
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,250
and Scott Bradley

1940
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,389
was just in quarantine

1941
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,869
and you befriended him

1942
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:39,909
because of the time

1943
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:40,210
and

1944
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:40,690
yeah

1945
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,469
we were able to train there

1946
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:43,690
and he saw me training every day

1947
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,010
he's like

1948
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:44,849
this guy looks like

1949
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,070
he's an ex-footy player

1950
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:46,489
and he's like

1951
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:47,329
this guy looks like

1952
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:48,489
he can run just like me

1953
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,769
so we started training

1954
00:34:49,769 --> 00:34:50,269
most days

1955
00:34:50,269 --> 00:34:50,909
which was the best

1956
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:52,210
who's been the greatest leader

1957
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:52,869
in your life

1958
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:54,789
oh it's got to be my parents

1959
00:34:54,789 --> 00:34:55,269
yeah

1960
00:34:55,269 --> 00:34:55,590
it's

1961
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,690
to raise I guess

1962
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,230
three boys

1963
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,550
I was probably

1964
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,289
the softest one

1965
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:01,809
out of the three

1966
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:02,409
but the brothers

1967
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:03,210
were quite rough

1968
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:03,690
around the edges

1969
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,730
beautiful people

1970
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,650
but rough around the edges

1971
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,869
to raise three boys

1972
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:09,570
with not much money

1973
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:10,809
and to now create

1974
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:11,630
a bit of an empire

1975
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,449
that they've got now

1976
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:13,670
yeah by far

1977
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,130
my parents

1978
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,130
and I look up to them

1979
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:15,590
every day

1980
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,469
which I'm super grateful for

1981
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:18,329
and how are they

1982
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:18,710
Harry

1983
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,789
because you know

1984
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:20,849
you live your life

1985
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:21,650
authentically

1986
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,409
and you know

1987
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:23,409
how do they cope with

1988
00:35:23,409 --> 00:35:25,369
hey your son's wearing nail polish

1989
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:27,190
your son's wearing a dress today

1990
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,789
do they

1991
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:29,070
have their moments

1992
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:29,530
or

1993
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,409
of course

1994
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,690
of course they do

1995
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,449
especially my dad

1996
00:35:32,449 --> 00:35:33,530
just being a

1997
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,250
being a tradesman

1998
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:34,949
he's a roof tiler

1999
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:36,289
and I guess on job sites

2000
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:37,210
you mean

2001
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,010
that culture

2002
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,409
in being a tradesman

2003
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:40,610
is probably a little bit different

2004
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,170
to other

2005
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,150
corporate culture

2006
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,789
or something like that

2007
00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:44,030
and people there

2008
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,250
say things to me dad sometimes

2009
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,389
and I guess

2010
00:35:46,389 --> 00:35:47,829
I don't know what my dad's beliefs are

2011
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:48,570
as well internally

2012
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,210
but I always listen

2013
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:50,590
right

2014
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,489
because I actually think

2015
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:52,650
although I believe

2016
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,090
in what I stand for

2017
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,349
I'm always open

2018
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:56,369
to changing my mind

2019
00:35:56,369 --> 00:35:57,150
and I think

2020
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:57,909
I'm never set

2021
00:35:57,909 --> 00:35:58,690
in what I believe

2022
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,190
I always try and listen

2023
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:00,530
especially when I'm

2024
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,349
someone who doesn't have

2025
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:02,230
the same opinion as me

2026
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,030
and try and understand

2027
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,090
why they have that opinion

2028
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,690
and is that opinion

2029
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,389
better than mine

2030
00:36:06,389 --> 00:36:07,869
and that's really

2031
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:08,630
humbling sometimes

2032
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,789
because sometimes I'm wrong

2033
00:36:09,789 --> 00:36:10,889
and often I'm wrong

2034
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:11,170
right

2035
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,050
so I always try and listen

2036
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,329
but yeah

2037
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:15,190
I think it's hard

2038
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,449
for my dad sometimes

2039
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:17,969
but at the same time

2040
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:18,230
as well

2041
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:18,909
my dad

2042
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:20,150
has always backed me

2043
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:20,929
and always loves me

2044
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:21,789
and he doesn't really care

2045
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:22,670
how I show up in the world

2046
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,369
brilliant mate

2047
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:23,690
isn't it

2048
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:24,789
what a great gift to have

2049
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:25,610
and I love it

2050
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:26,250
when people immediately

2051
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,130
go to their parents

2052
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,550
it's a gift isn't it

2053
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,409
if that's where you think

2054
00:36:29,409 --> 00:36:30,530
the best leadership

2055
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,670
in your life has come from

2056
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,389
we're a bit obsessed

2057
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:33,510
with this world of collaboration

2058
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,929
Harry and some work

2059
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:35,329
we're doing

2060
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:36,570
of joining different people

2061
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,309
around the globe

2062
00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:39,250
in a space we call

2063
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:39,889
a leader

2064
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:40,550
has there been anyone

2065
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:40,889
you thought

2066
00:36:40,889 --> 00:36:42,110
jeez I'd love to collaborate

2067
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,150
and you've got lots

2068
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:43,849
of great passions

2069
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:45,349
you haven't even spoken

2070
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:46,170
about your poetry

2071
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,570
or your professional

2072
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:48,989
you know

2073
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:50,070
your boxing chance

2074
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:50,630
for a gold medal

2075
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,190
has there been someone

2076
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:51,429
you thought

2077
00:36:51,429 --> 00:36:52,309
god that's the person

2078
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:53,289
I'd love to collaborate with

2079
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:54,329
probably

2080
00:36:54,329 --> 00:36:55,630
you just sparked him

2081
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,610
but I've listened to

2082
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,309
his book

2083
00:36:57,309 --> 00:36:58,829
I would say 15 times

2084
00:36:58,829 --> 00:36:59,650
Matthew McConaughey

2085
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,409
I think

2086
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:01,650
his book is amazing

2087
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,510
and I've learnt so much

2088
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,329
listening to that book

2089
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:05,130
and every time I listen to it

2090
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:05,969
I pick up something new

2091
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:07,610
but it's so interesting

2092
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:08,030
I guess

2093
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:08,769
as a culture

2094
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:09,610
what we do

2095
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,309
we idolise these people

2096
00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:12,690
I think about

2097
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,329
David Goggins

2098
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:13,670
or

2099
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,210
we idolise these people

2100
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,230
when you really think

2101
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,210
about them

2102
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,110
as people

2103
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:18,929
it's like

2104
00:37:18,929 --> 00:37:19,510
David Goggins

2105
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,530
I'm pretty sure

2106
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,269
don't quote me on this

2107
00:37:21,269 --> 00:37:21,730
but I'm pretty sure

2108
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:22,409
he's got a kid

2109
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,130
and he's had failed marriages

2110
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:24,670
and stuff like that

2111
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,769
is that actually a person

2112
00:37:25,769 --> 00:37:27,170
that you want to be like

2113
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,010
when you really think about it

2114
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:28,610
it's like absolutely

2115
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,190
he's disciplined

2116
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,050
and he's hard working

2117
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:30,989
and there's things

2118
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:31,710
you can take from it

2119
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,610
when you really think about

2120
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,230
them as people

2121
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,590
is that the people

2122
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,530
you really want to be like

2123
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,010
and I think

2124
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,570
we idolise these people

2125
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:38,150
and it's like

2126
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,050
what people don't understand

2127
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:39,789
to be successful

2128
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:40,369
all the time

2129
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:42,429
they have to

2130
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:43,170
I don't know

2131
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,570
cut ties with people

2132
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,909
and be isolated

2133
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:46,489
and stuff like that

2134
00:37:46,489 --> 00:37:47,429
and I've felt that myself

2135
00:37:47,429 --> 00:37:49,030
but when I think about

2136
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:49,909
idols and people

2137
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:50,650
I want to be like

2138
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:51,610
I want to be a strong

2139
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,289
stable dad

2140
00:37:52,289 --> 00:37:52,829
I want to be

2141
00:37:52,829 --> 00:37:54,670
close to my kids

2142
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,090
when I'm old

2143
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,349
I want my kids to be around

2144
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:57,570
my grandkids to be around

2145
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,929
I don't want to be disconnected

2146
00:37:58,929 --> 00:37:59,590
because I've spent

2147
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,050
my whole life

2148
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:00,929
focusing on myself

2149
00:38:00,929 --> 00:38:01,630
and my goals

2150
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,090
so I guess

2151
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,969
people who I want to be like

2152
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:06,210
are more so people like that

2153
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,530
Beautifully said

2154
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,269
again Harry

2155
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:09,010
I was saying

2156
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:09,670
success without

2157
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,449
fulfilment

2158
00:38:10,449 --> 00:38:11,590
is the greatest failure

2159
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,409
and you're right isn't it

2160
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:12,969
we often look at

2161
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:13,809
financial success

2162
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:14,650
and someone who's got

2163
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,309
tens of millions of dollars

2164
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:17,710
but is there a gap

2165
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,550
in all the other things

2166
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,210
on your family

2167
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,230
and your connection

2168
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,570
and your health

2169
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,610
all those other things

2170
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,130
you give up

2171
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,469
if you miss out on that

2172
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:25,230
well Harry

2173
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,469
I'm inspired by you

2174
00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:27,730
and everything that you do

2175
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,969
we're heading into Paris

2176
00:38:28,969 --> 00:38:29,489
and I

2177
00:38:29,489 --> 00:38:30,630
I can see you

2178
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,289
on top of the podium

2179
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:32,510
I'm not sure that helps mate

2180
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,510
but I can

2181
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,329
because I just see

2182
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:35,150
the genius in you

2183
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,309
as a human being

2184
00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:36,949
I know that

2185
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:37,789
it won't be through

2186
00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:39,090
a lack of preparation

2187
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:39,570
and effort

2188
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,090
and the whole country's

2189
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:41,510
behind you

2190
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,110
but more than that

2191
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:42,949
I think you're showing a way

2192
00:38:42,949 --> 00:38:43,989
that is really important

2193
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,429
for all of us

2194
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:46,110
to understand

2195
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,030
congratulations mate

2196
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,989

00:38:47,989 --> 00:38:48,690
