00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:08,339
I hope you enjoy this episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast

2
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:12,240
with Harry Kuehl, one of Australia's greatest ever sportsmen

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,560
and arguably the greatest ever soccer player

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,500
who blazed a trail for many others to follow.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,300
You hear Harry talk openly about how he almost never reflects

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,160
on his playing career, but it was his famous work ethic

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,640
that saw him leave everything out on the training field

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,000
and the pitch on game day.

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,420
He describes Ange Postacoglu as the nicest person in the world,

10
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:35,259
talks about his love of being a father of four,

11
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:37,719
making bolognese, attending fancy dress parties

12
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:40,219
and being an Uber driver for his four kids.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,880
You can hear him talk also about the superpower

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,259
of never ever letting any critic worry him ever,

15
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:49,640
but only wanting to impress his wife and his boss,

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,960
are the words of Harry Kuehl.

17
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,840
We love that Harry Kuehl is part of our Alita Connect

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,159

19
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,479

22
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:05,000
We'd love to have that conversation with you.

23
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,500
You hear Harry talk about his Alita Connect group.

24
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:09,060
Simon Goodwin is in this group,

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,540
the coach of the Melbourne Football Club,

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,299
premiership winning coach, superstar AFL player

27
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:14,620
in his time as well.

28
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:17,140
Fleur McIntyre, who's been on this podcast,

29
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,799
who was the first female coach with the Sydney Kings

30
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,959
to win a championship in the National Basketball League.

31
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:25,780
Andrew Borovic, who's doing great things in his role

32
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,719

33
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,700
Jan Sterling, a legend of Australian basketball as well.

34
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:31,439
Formed part of the group with Harry Kuehl

35
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,519
that he talks about in this podcast.

36
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,239
You don't have to be a world leader.

37
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,000
You don't have to be a leading coach

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,159
or a superstar to be part of Alita Connect.

39
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,359
We are curating groups every week

40
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:44,000
and we love talking and connecting with entrepreneurs,

41
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,459
social venture leaders, sports people,

42
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,019
diverse thinkers from the arts and many, many more.

43
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,079
We come together to learn, to share and to collaborate.

44
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,560
Love to do that with you as well.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,719
Huge thanks as always to Jason Nicholas

46
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,739
and his team from Temper Bedding Australia New Zealand.

47
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,900
Successful leaders like Harry Kuehl

48
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,200
understand the importance of good sleep

49
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,980
and investing in a temper mattress

50
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,079
is a mattress-like success.

51
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,400
Like no other, it is a life-changing decision.

52
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,419
Huge thanks to the team at Temper

53
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,560
for supporting conversations like this

54
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,139
with Australian soccer legend, Harry Kuehl.

55
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:22,710
Harry Kuehl is a Sport Australia Hall of Famer

56
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,849
recognised as Australia's greatest ever footballer

57
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:27,189
of the round ball variety.

58
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:29,710
In 1999, while playing for Leeds United

59
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,889
in the English Premier League,

60
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:33,229
Harry was recognised as the Premier League's

61
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:34,349
Young Player of the Year.

62
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,610
He was selected in the Premier League Team of the Year

63
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,389
and generally considered to be the best player

64
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:38,469
in the Premier League.

65
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:38,530
He was recognised as the Premier League Team of the Year

66
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:38,930
and generally considered to be the best player

67
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:39,629
and generally considered at the time

68
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:41,530
as one of the best players in the world.

69
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:42,969
He's a father of four,

70
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,469
married to well-known English actress,

71
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:45,169
Sheree Murphy,

72
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,550
scored 17 goals in his 58 matches for Australia.

73
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,969
And Harry Kuehl is currently the first team manager

74
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:53,669
with the famous Celtic Football Club in Scotland,

75
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,710
having previously taken on a number

76
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,370
of top-level managerial roles in the UK.

77
00:02:58,669 --> 00:02:59,789
Harry, great to catch up with you.

78
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,349
Thanks for your time.

79
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,629
Cheers, Luke.

80
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,530
The only thing I would pull you up on there

81
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,189
is I'm a first-team coach.

82
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:07,650
There you go.

83
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,930
I haven't made that jump yet,

84
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:11,990
but looking forward to the challenges.

85
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:13,389
Well, there you go.

86
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:15,949
In the future, mate, I can see the manager role,

87
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:19,129
which is, I'm going to ask you about that shortly,

88
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,310
but one of my old friends is one of your Australian teammates,

89
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,629
John Aloisi, went to school together.

90
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:27,229
And I remember talking with him about you

91
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:29,289
and he described you at your best

92
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:32,050
as literally in the best handful of players in the world,

93
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:34,069
which I said in the intro, it's high praise.

94
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,969
Do you look back and think that you genuinely had a gift

95
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:38,889
for the world game like very few have?

96
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,550
You know, it's interesting because when I look back,

97
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,409
I don't see that, you know,

98
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:48,389
because I've always kind of don't worry about the past.

99
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,889
I kind of always look for the future

100
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:54,430
and to see what kind of situation I'm in at the moment.

101
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:59,050
And when I do sit down and, you know,

102
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:02,569
I speak about players or I talk about certain things

103
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:06,490
and whether I'm with my friends or with certain coaches,

104
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,069
you know, they'll always remind me.

105
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,689
They go, well, Harry,

106
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:11,169
you used to be able to do that or you've done that

107
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:11,990
or you were this.

108
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:14,490
And it's nice to reflect.

109
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:16,009
I don't reflect too much.

110
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,490
And sometimes it's a shame

111
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,589
because I think it's nice to look back on your career

112
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:23,670
and see the achievements that you have achieved.

113
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:26,889
I don't go back as often as I would like to go back

114
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:28,550
because like I said,

115
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:31,110
I'm always worried about my next challenge

116
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,550
and trying to improve the people

117
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,069
that I'm working with at the moment.

118
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,629
Harry, you're famous for your work ethic

119
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:38,310
and your attention to detail

120
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,629
and your personality.

121
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:42,589
What were the skills that allowed you to play the game

122
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:43,990
at such a high level in your mind?

123
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:46,389
Again, I think you just touched on it there,

124
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,110
my work ethic.

125
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,050
You know, I was willing to work harder than my opponent,

126
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,470
you know, or my teammate.

127
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:54,810
You know, I was the one that always wanted to work.

128
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:56,050
I loved working.

129
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:57,149
I needed to work.

130
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,810
I wasn't one of these that could, you know,

131
00:04:59,829 --> 00:05:02,189
if we took a normal week of football

132
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:04,790
and you talked about, you know, Monday, Tuesday training,

133
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,370
Wednesday off, Thursday, Friday, Saturday game,

134
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:07,930
Sunday off.

135
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:09,149
I was playing.

136
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:12,649
I needed to work all the way up until that Saturday.

137
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:15,810
Like on Friday, I needed to feel exhausted.

138
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:18,470
I needed to come off the pitch dripping with sweat,

139
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,589
felt that, you know, I've done everything possible

140
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:23,050
to go out there on the Saturday

141
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,449
and that's when I felt good.

142
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:26,850
When I wasn't playing well,

143
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:29,769
it was the times when people stopped me from working.

144
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:32,029
It's interesting now because back in the day,

145
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:34,449
it was, you know, what was good for one person

146
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:35,410
was good for the whole team.

147
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,449
And when we look at football in today's,

148
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:38,930
in the modern game,

149
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,230
we break it down to a lot of individual work,

150
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,009
what certain people need to get the best out of them.

151
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:47,569
And I was one of them back in the day

152
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:49,470
that needed to work constantly.

153
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,529
And my attitude was, and I hate the saying,

154
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:55,129
when people say, you know, you know,

155
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:57,029
nine times out of 10, you may fail.

156
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,189
It's just that one time, you know, that you may get it.

157
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:02,829
Whereas I was, well, I wasn't going to go to 10.

158
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:07,069
I was going to go to 14, 15, 16, 17 times and keep going.

159
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:09,529
Until I actually beat my opponent.

160
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,170
So that was my kind of attitude.

161
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:15,089
And, you know, as much as people say I was gifted and all that,

162
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,509
yes, I could see a pass.

163
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:17,290
I can move around.

164
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:19,990
But it was only because I worked hard at my job.

165
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,589
And Harry, you look back at that incredible time at Leeds United,

166
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:25,069
you and another Australian legend, Mark Paducah,

167
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,350
were dominating the English Premier League.

168
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:31,649
And you then got struck down by a whole series of injuries

169
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:34,870
that took its toll, as they do for any professional athlete.

170
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,410
Is there any regret for you in that?

171
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,949
When you look back, that maybe that did cut you down a little bit

172
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,209
short of what your prime was?

173
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:46,649
Well, again, I go back and, you know,

174
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,709
I think I had 14 operations in my career,

175
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:58,009
which would hinder someone's progress in a sporting environment.

176
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:00,850
There's two ways I look at this.

177
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,350
In hindsight, I would love to have seen what I was capable of doing.

178
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,250
If I could have just put the,

179
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,290
the, the,

180
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,430
the injuries aside and just to,

181
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:12,470
to be able to have played free and,

182
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:12,970
you know,

183
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:13,310
even,

184
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,110
even to have played a World Cup in no pain,

185
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:16,709
you know,

186
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,410
I missed out on the 98 in the 2002 when I was fully fit.

187
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,970
And then obviously 2006 and 2010,

188
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:23,329
I was,

189
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,050
I was injured in both of them and I was always fighting to come back.

190
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,470
So I would have loved to have known what I was capable of doing because I was

191
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,730
never afraid to play anywhere.

192
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,029
I was never afraid to play against anybody.

193
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:34,850
And I was never,

194
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,269
never afraid to have mixed it with,

195
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,569
with the very best.

196
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:40,269
So on that side of it,

197
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,610
I would have loved to have seen what I was capable of doing.

198
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:46,170
But then I look at myself and I,

199
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:47,430
I look at my career,

200
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:48,250
what I've had,

201
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,350
and I've had the very best of football,

202
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:51,490
you know,

203
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,870
where everything was done for me,

204
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,769
everything was perfect.

205
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:57,589
And then I've also seen that the ugly side of football where everyone kind of

206
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:59,569
forgets about you and you've got to be able to,

207
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:00,529
to make it for,

208
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,569
make it yourself.

209
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:03,250
So for me,

210
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,970
I've become a better person.

211
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:10,410
Because I've seen that the highs and the lows of football.

212
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,610
So I wouldn't,

213
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,350
I wouldn't change my career path,

214
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:15,689
but I would like to have seen,

215
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:20,050
just seeing what it could have been if I wasn't injured.

216
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,470
It's interesting you talk about the highs and lows of your career and the highs

217
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,089
were as high as it gets.

218
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:27,589
And then,

219
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,850
you know,

220
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,050
lots of challenges along the way.

221
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,090
And there's always plenty of critics that last time I saw you,

222
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,190
I'm not sure if you remember,

223
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,289
it was the world cup in Rio de Janeiro.

224
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:35,789
And you were,

225
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:38,070
you were generous enough to come round to,

226
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,389
we were broadcasting for there,

227
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:40,350
Mick Molloy and I,

228
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,350
and always a lot of fun.

229
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,309
And we had you come and join us,

230
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:47,029
but I remember it was right at the end of your career.

231
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:49,250
And I think you had this really open conversation.

232
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:49,750
You said,

233
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,190
this is the first time in my life I haven't had a team around me booking my flights or

234
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,549
organising transport,

235
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:58,230
or it was almost like it had dawned on you,

236
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,429
the new chapter was coming,

237
00:08:59,429 --> 00:08:59,929
Harry.

238
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:00,389
I mean,

239
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:04,850
people mightn't understand how big a shift was it you going away from being,

240
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:05,669
you know,

241
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:07,889
a champion player to the next chapter.

242
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:08,610
How hard was that?

243
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:09,450
Well,

244
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:09,730
look,

245
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,049
I wouldn't say it was like extremely tough,

246
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:15,029
but like I said,

247
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:16,629
it's something that we've,

248
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:19,350
we've always had everything on tap as a footballer,

249
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:19,889
you know,

250
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:23,730
because we go in there and we've been paid to do a job and we get looked after.

251
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,330
You know,

252
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:24,570
we,

253
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,470
we've got doctors,

254
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,250
we've got physios,

255
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,049
we've got masseurs,

256
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:29,070
we've got chefs.

257
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:31,750
We have everything on tap at 24 seven.

258
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,769
And like I said,

259
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:33,850
it doesn't even matter.

260
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,370
Like even in today's one.

261
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,789
Now you can take food home that the chefs cook and you don't even have to cook

262
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:39,149
at home.

263
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:41,490
So I'll play it literally all he has to do.

264
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,570
And when you think about a play in this day and age,

265
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,730
all he has to do is wake up,

266
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:45,570
you know,

267
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,169
you get told,

268
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:49,570
he gets told what to wear virtually the cars now drive you into training

269
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:49,950
ground.

270
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:50,669
You know,

271
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:53,250
you get told what to do on the training pitch.

272
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:54,809
You get told what to eat,

273
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:55,929
you get told how to recover.

274
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:56,929
You get told when to sleep,

275
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,029
you get told when to wake up,

276
00:09:58,049 --> 00:09:59,789
everything's run by schedule.

277
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:03,429
Now it wasn't run as slick as that back in the day,

278
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:04,549
but it was almost.

279
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:05,789
Identical.

280
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:07,889
So when you've lived your life,

281
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:08,250
you know,

282
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,889
since I was 16 coming into a world and that was all,

283
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:14,750
you kind of know it was strange coming out of it.

284
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,529
And I always tell the one story that always pops into my

285
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:22,429
head when I did finish football and I was ill.

286
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:25,409
And obviously I didn't have a doctor on call,

287
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:26,250
you know,

288
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,190
cause I was used to having a doctor 24 seven.

289
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,169
I could bring my doctor and say,

290
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:29,649
doc,

291
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:30,149
this was this.

292
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:30,370
Yep.

293
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:30,610
Yep.

294
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,529
And tablets would come or anything would come straight to my house or I'd have

295
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:35,149
to drive.

296
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:38,029
But everything was there and I remember it ill and I said to my

297
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:38,269
wife,

298
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:38,389
well,

299
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:39,070
I don't feel well.

300
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,350
She said,

301
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,149
we'll go to the doctor.

302
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:45,169
I remember going to the doctor and I lined up and I didn't

303
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:46,190
have a clue what to do.

304
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:49,909
So I went to the big tablet and I put my name and

305
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:52,429
address in and my date of birth and all that.

306
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:53,830
And I come back and I said,

307
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,169
oh yeah,

308
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:55,850
your next appointment is in two weeks.

309
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,450
And I said,

310
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,090
I'm healthy by in two weeks.

311
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,309
I need to see a doctor now.

312
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,990
So I called the receptionist and I said,

313
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,009
I love it.

314
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:04,309
I said,

315
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:05,570
I don't know if I've done this right.

316
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,169
And she says,

317
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:06,289
yeah,

318
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:07,629
that's the next available appointment.

319
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:08,809
I said,

320
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:09,870
I ain't going to be ill by then.

321
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,149
I'm ill now as well.

322
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:11,990
That's I'm sorry.

323
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,649
That's what it is.

324
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:13,789
So that was like,

325
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:14,929
wow.

326
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:15,470
Okay.

327
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,710
That's the real world.

328
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,230
That's how it works.

329
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,250
People may think,

330
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:19,549
oh,

331
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:20,450
spoiled this and that,

332
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,830
but you get brought up in a world where everything's done for you because you

333
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,490
have to concentrate solely on your job.

334
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,710
And like I said,

335
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,129
it's,

336
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:29,070
it's interesting.

337
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,789
And you do,

338
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:31,690
you do understand why sometimes,

339
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:32,330
you know,

340
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,269
athletes do struggle when they come out of,

341
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:35,210
of retirement.

342
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,649
If they don't fall in love with something straight away,

343
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:39,909
or if they don't have a hobby,

344
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:40,990
they can kind of,

345
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,409
you know,

346
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,009
feel left,

347
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,870
left alone.

348
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:44,110
And,

349
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:44,409
you know,

350
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:45,649
it's quite lonely out there.

351
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:47,110
And you look at your upbringing,

352
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,769
how are you from the Western Sydney,

353
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:50,029
very humble beginnings,

354
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:52,970
and you earn multimillion pounds,

355
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,409
uh,

356
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:54,830
playing in the English premier league.

357
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:55,149
And,

358
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:57,710
and with that Harry comes an enormous amount of tension.

359
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,629
You walk down the street,

360
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:00,470
you're one of the most recognized athletes in the,

361
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:01,789
in the UK.

362
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:04,250
And that world has a lot of sharks around too.

363
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:04,529
Isn't it?

364
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:08,389
Harry people are always wanting to sell your things or get into business

365
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,929
ventures,

366
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:09,470
or,

367
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:09,889
you know,

368
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:11,649
it's a dubious world of management.

369
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:11,889
How did,

370
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:14,090
how did you handle all of that at its peak?

371
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,250
There must've been a lot of,

372
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:15,950
uh,

373
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,470
distraction and some trappings that you had to work your way through.

374
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:19,090
Well,

375
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:19,549
of course.

376
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:21,070
And unfortunately,

377
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:21,610
you know,

378
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,409
you're always going to make mistakes along the way of your life.

379
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:25,909
And,

380
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:27,169
and that's the only way you learn.

381
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,889
I mean,

382
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,730
I'd be very surprised if there's one person at the age of,

383
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,049
uh,

384
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:32,330
you know,

385
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,190
44,

386
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:33,690
you know,

387
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,830
that hasn't made a mistake,

388
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,669
you know,

389
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:37,049
who hasn't lost money in,

390
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:37,309
in,

391
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:40,309
in something or who hasn't won money in certain things,

392
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:40,970
you know?

393
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,730
So I think it's just all about learning.

394
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:47,009
The one thing that I've been lucky enough to have is a,

395
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,570
a great financial advisor.

396
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,850
I had met him when I was 17 years old and I still have them to

397
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,309
this day.

398
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:55,809
And I've learned a lot from him.

399
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:56,370
Uh,

400
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,570
I wasn't one of these that just soon as my money got my

401
00:12:59,570 --> 00:12:59,850
money,

402
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:00,070
I,

403
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,529
I did this or I did that.

404
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:02,929
I always wanted to know what it was,

405
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:03,649
what it was earning,

406
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,409
how can I do it?

407
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,450
How can I improve it?

408
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:07,289
So I learned that side of it,

409
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:09,309
not to the degree of,

410
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:09,809
you know,

411
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:10,990
being a mastermind of it,

412
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,110
but I do know where every penny of mine is.

413
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:15,049
Uh,

414
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,610
so now I think that's important,

415
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:18,389
especially when you are growing up,

416
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:19,610
especially as you're young,

417
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,169
because there are a lot of people out there that will take

418
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,009
advantage of you.

419
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:26,250
And we're actually seeing a lot of footballers out there now

420
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,009
that have become bankrupt,

421
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:30,049
not because of their own doing,

422
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:33,049
but because of other people have manipulated,

423
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:36,649
manipulated them in a certain way to invest into certain things.

424
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,330
And you know,

425
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,350
they've lost a lot of money and they've had to restart.

426
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,889
So I have to say that I've,

427
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:45,289
I've been fortunate enough to have met a very good person

428
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:46,649
that I still keep in mind.

429
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:49,409
We just had my last meeting was yesterday with him.

430
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:51,710
So I still keep,

431
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:52,309
you know,

432
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:52,529
on,

433
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:52,769
on,

434
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:53,690
on top of that stuff,

435
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,190
but you have to be very careful out there.

436
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:56,210
Yeah.

437
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:56,830
I think the stats,

438
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,889
when you look at a lot of us athletes,

439
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:01,450
the amount that end up with nothing post their career,

440
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,070
having earned millions and millions of dollars,

441
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:03,570
uh,

442
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,610
by the end of it,

443
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:05,269
the,

444
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:05,570
uh,

445
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,230
remarkable amount end up with next to nothing.

446
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,769
As you said,

447
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:08,929
Harry,

448
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,289
to have someone in your life like that,

449
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,169
that you've been able to trust financially is a genuine gift.

450
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,509
The first team coach at Celtic,

451
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:16,970
I did elevate you to manager,

452
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,710
uh,

453
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,389
in the intro,

454
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:18,950
but,

455
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:19,309
uh,

456
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:21,269
one of the most passionately supported,

457
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,649
uh,

458
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:23,750
sporting organizations in the world,

459
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,169
uh,

460
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:24,690
Celtic.

461
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,590
Can you tell us about what it's like for you coaching at that famous club?

462
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:28,830
And,

463
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,289
and what's your leadership style,

464
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:30,529
Harry?

465
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,669
Now is someone who's in charge of young,

466
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:33,110
uh,

467
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,549
young men.

468
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:33,970
How do you,

469
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:34,850
how do you go about it?

470
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:36,610
Well,

471
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:37,230
it's interesting.

472
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:37,830
Um,

473
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:40,509
I remember obviously getting the call from Ange,

474
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,490
uh,

475
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:43,210
last year and coming to work.

476
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:43,509
And I was,

477
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,409
I was so excited because it was kind of out of the blue.

478
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:47,950
I was actually dealing with,

479
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:48,629
um,

480
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:51,110
maybe going into another job at that time.

481
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:55,110
And then when obviously I got the message from Ange to come up and join his

482
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,490
staff,

483
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,789
I thought it was too good of an opportunity,

484
00:14:57,789 --> 00:14:58,750
uh,

485
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,429
not to take,

486
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,210
um,

487
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,750
and to obviously be around,

488
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:02,570
you know,

489
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,509
a very,

490
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,870
very historical club,

491
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,330
um,

492
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,230
that has been there,

493
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,970
you know,

494
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,210
challenges for titles in champions league.

495
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:10,090
I just thought it would,

496
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,289
it would be the right kind of move for me to be able to go up there and

497
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:15,929
see what a first team,

498
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:16,769
uh,

499
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:19,129
environment is like in the coaching side of it.

500
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,629
And it's been amazing.

501
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:21,529
Um,

502
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,230
I have to say that the people up there are fantastic.

503
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:30,210
I know it's very much Celtic ranges up there and you get the odd kind of,

504
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,110
uh,

505
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,769
um,

506
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:33,409
other fans scattered around.

507
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,230
But I've been in that environment before,

508
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,330
especially over in Turkey,

509
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,929
you know,

510
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:38,190
where it's so much,

511
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,210
it's just Galatasaray,

512
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,629
Fenerbahce or Pashitas.

513
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:41,629
They're the main clubs.

514
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,409
So I've been in an environment where you go into cities and you have to,

515
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:46,230
you know,

516
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,629
you're walking past a certain person.

517
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:50,610
You don't know whether he's Rangers or Celtic and all that.

518
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,230
But for me,

519
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:52,809
I've,

520
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:53,370
you know,

521
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,350
I've always been that kind of person that's open.

522
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,330
So I've never had any problems,

523
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,649
especially when I've gone up there.

524
00:15:59,169 --> 00:15:59,889
Um,

525
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:01,850
but going into the,

526
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,049
the,

527
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:03,490
the football club itself,

528
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:07,230
working with top quality players that are international players,

529
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:11,330
it was an eye opener because when I was working at the low levels,

530
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,149
you know,

531
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:13,049
you,

532
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:15,990
you're having to work with players and you're wanting to improve them and you

533
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,090
can see a massive difference.

534
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:17,789
Whereas here,

535
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:22,789
you really have to knuckle down and do a lot of video work and analyze their

536
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:28,289
game to just improve them slightly because they're so much of a quality player

537
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:28,889
at the moment.

538
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:31,049
So that's been a kind of a different kind of,

539
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:31,889
uh,

540
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,909
um,

541
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:33,190
thing.

542
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:33,429
I've,

543
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:34,370
I've had to do,

544
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:34,629
you know,

545
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:35,090
where I've,

546
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,789
whereas I've looked at a team before,

547
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:40,929
whereas now I look at more individuals and see if I can improve them on,

548
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:41,990
especially the wingers.

549
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,590
I work very closely with the wingers up there,

550
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,769
which is important for me to get my ideas across.

551
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:52,250
But the most important thing I've found is that the,

552
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,389
the player has to be involved in this.

553
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,029
You know,

554
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:56,230
I,

555
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,049
I wouldn't want to work with a player that is just like,

556
00:16:59,049 --> 00:16:59,230
yeah,

557
00:16:59,230 --> 00:16:59,350
yeah,

558
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,049
I'll do my video and that's it.

559
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:01,210
Yeah.

560
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:01,509
Okay.

561
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:02,230
And walk away.

562
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,330
I need players to,

563
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:04,329
to be involved.

564
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:07,210
I need players to be asking questions and you know,

565
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:12,690
I've been lucky enough to have about five or six players up there that really

566
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,009
want to take the information that I have and apply it to their game.

567
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:17,349
And Harry,

568
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:21,069
you mentioned Ang Sposter Coghlu who had the great privilege of sitting down

569
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:23,470
with and remarkable success story.

570
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,150
Ang in every place that he's gone,

571
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:29,289
he's won all around the world and in Japan and his success in Australia.

572
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:33,390
And then what he did with you up in Celtic and had a great start to his time.

573
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:33,970
In Tottenham.

574
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:34,930
Tell us about that,

575
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:35,829
that message.

576
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:36,549
Uh,

577
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:36,750
you,

578
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,829
you missed out on a world cup team where Ang was,

579
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:39,250
uh,

580
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:39,970
was coached.

581
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,049
Was there some sort of sense that maybe this was,

582
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:43,349
you know,

583
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:43,529
I,

584
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,170
you're one Harry,

585
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,730
I need to get you back on my team.

586
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,630
And I think I read,

587
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:51,170
you said within two days you knew exactly what Ang Sposter Coghlu was about,

588
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,849
and you could coach his team because he communicated so clearly in two days.

589
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:55,750
Tell us a bit about all that.

590
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:57,089
Well,

591
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:57,369
I look,

592
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:57,549
I,

593
00:17:57,549 --> 00:17:58,450
I go back to the,

594
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:58,890
uh,

595
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,130
that famous coffee where I had in Melbourne down at the pantry in Brighton,

596
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,670
where I was sitting in and I had met him for the first time.

597
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:10,690
And our paths nearly crossed over a few times,

598
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,490
especially at Melbourne victory.

599
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,529
Um,

600
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:14,170
but they,

601
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:14,369
they,

602
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:17,369
they didn't quite get there cause there were certain things that,

603
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:18,549
um,

604
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:19,809
I had to come back for.

605
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,470
But I remember sitting down there and to be honest with,

606
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:23,890
uh,

607
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,250
Ang,

608
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:24,630
he,

609
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,390
he just told me,

610
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:26,130
you know,

611
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:26,890
truthfully,

612
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:27,190
you know,

613
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,369
he,

614
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:27,890
he said,

615
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,230
look,

616
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,910
you're not in my plans for the world cup.

617
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:31,809
Uh,

618
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:32,609
it hurt.

619
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:33,109
I'm not going to lie.

620
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:37,309
Cause I still felt I had at least one more world cup and whether I would have

621
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:41,569
started or whether I could have just been that person to have helped the younger

622
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:42,410
players.

623
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,390
Um,

624
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,450
but at the end of the day,

625
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,990
I've always respected my managers and I've always respected their decision.

626
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,789
And I think that's what he liked.

627
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:50,309
You know,

628
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:51,250
I didn't cause a fuss.

629
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:51,589
I just said,

630
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:51,890
okay,

631
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:52,109
look,

632
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:52,690
that's a shame.

633
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:53,269
You know,

634
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:54,569
I would have loved to have been there,

635
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:55,130
but if,

636
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,150
if that's not the case,

637
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,329
then,

638
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:56,549
you know,

639
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:57,009
good luck.

640
00:18:57,009 --> 00:18:57,289
And,

641
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:57,690
uh,

642
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,509
I wish you all the best.

643
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,049
And I think he kind of must've,

644
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:00,890
you know,

645
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:02,990
taken that on board for him,

646
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,329
to,

647
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:03,950
you know,

648
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,230
see me and go,

649
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:05,690
well,

650
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,690
I'd like to be able to throw out and help you now again.

651
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:09,670
Um,

652
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:11,329
so when I did get that call,

653
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:13,069
the message that he did send me was,

654
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:14,029
like I said,

655
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:14,210
I,

656
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:14,890
once I looked at,

657
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,430
I remember showing my wife and I was like,

658
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:17,630
wow,

659
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:18,829
I like,

660
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:18,970
I,

661
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,029
how can I turn this down?

662
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,410
I can't turn this down.

663
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,089
Cause he speaks very well.

664
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:25,009
He is as much as,

665
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:28,250
as I see two sides to Ange,

666
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,089
you know,

667
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:29,509
one,

668
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:29,750
the,

669
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,109
the,

670
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:30,369
the,

671
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,369
the manager that he is,

672
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:32,789
but he's also like,

673
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:34,029
kind of like a father figure.

674
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:36,450
He's got that kind of lovely,

675
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:36,990
I don't know,

676
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,029
aura about him.

677
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:39,269
And don't get me wrong.

678
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:44,130
I've seen him on both sides where the aura is completely disappeared.

679
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:45,089
And you're like,

680
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:45,809
whoa,

681
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:50,670
I ain't nowhere near him today because he's just not there.

682
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:54,509
So I've seen both sides of him and it's,

683
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,589
and if I take the,

684
00:19:55,589 --> 00:19:56,130
the,

685
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:56,710
the,

686
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:00,549
the lovely side in which he probably won't want a lot of people to know,

687
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,490
but he is one of the nicest people.

688
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:02,769
You,

689
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:06,329
you'll ever meet any like when you speak to him,

690
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:07,650
he's actually genuine,

691
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:08,849
you know,

692
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:09,170
which is,

693
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:09,930
which is lovely.

694
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:12,930
But then when you do speak to him about the work side of it,

695
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:14,970
he knows what he wants.

696
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:17,029
And that's the thing that when I,

697
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:18,549
when I had moments with him,

698
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:19,730
when I was speaking to him,

699
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,670
he kind of put me back on track of how I was when I was

700
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,509
first in my job,

701
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:25,130
where I thought,

702
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:25,269
well,

703
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:26,069
this is what I want.

704
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,569
This is how I want to do it.

705
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:27,809
That's it.

706
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:30,809
And then I kind of drifted off into my own,

707
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:32,529
maybe listening to him,

708
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:33,970
maybe one or two other people,

709
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:34,390
or,

710
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,150
you know,

711
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,289
listening to this and all that.

712
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:37,869
Whereas he's kind of gone,

713
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:38,849
Harry,

714
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:40,109
this is what you need to do.

715
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:41,210
This is how you need to do it.

716
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,049
Because at the end of the day,

717
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:43,109
you're the manager.

718
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,490
You need to be able to put it down because there's only one person that's

719
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,329
going to get sacked.

720
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:49,930
And so he's kind of vision of,

721
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:50,170
you know,

722
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,789
his tunnel tunnel vision,

723
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:55,109
put me back on track of how I want to go back into it.

724
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:55,950
And you,

725
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,589
you go back to even his organization,

726
00:20:58,589 --> 00:20:59,589
his,

727
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:00,930
his tactics,

728
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:01,769
you know,

729
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:02,529
people may say,

730
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:03,210
Oh look,

731
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,089
they're out there.

732
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:04,950
And you know,

733
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,789
he's,

734
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:07,009
they're very plain to see,

735
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:09,069
but they're very clear.

736
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:10,309
And that's what a lot of people,

737
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:11,150
a lot of,

738
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,369
a lot of footballers want to want to know.

739
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:13,210
So it's like,

740
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,029
what's my job?

741
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:15,869
Great players just want to know what's my job.

742
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:17,269
What do you want me to do?

743
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:19,349
And if you can tell me exactly what I need to,

744
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:20,789
I'll go out there and execute it.

745
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:22,390
And I think that's what he delivers.

746
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:26,230
He delivers a clear message out there that this is what I want.

747
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,170
If you don't do it,

748
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,950
I will get someone else will come in and do it.

749
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:30,789
And that's,

750
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,630
I, you know,

751
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:33,750
it would have been great if I was younger,

752
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,309
I would have liked to have played for him,

753
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:40,170
but I look back at when he got rid of me from the

754
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,430
Australian team.

755
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,589
I honestly think I could have done a job for him,

756
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:45,269
but technically I don't think I could have,

757
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:47,309
because the way he wanted to play,

758
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:49,710
I was always a player that loves to drop off and receive

759
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,150
the ball in turn where he likes a lot of runners.

760
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,089
Whereas I could have done it when I was younger,

761
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:56,829
but maybe not as old as I was at that time.

762
00:21:56,829 --> 00:21:58,670
So, like I said,

763
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,769
everything works out for a reason.

764
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:01,609
And I think,

765
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:04,430
so me not kicking up a fast or anything like that,

766
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,730
he's probably looked at that and thought,

767
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,569
yeah, well,

768
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:08,750
he deserves an opportunity to come and work with me,

769
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,589
which, you know,

770
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:11,009
I'll always be very thankful for.

771
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:12,809
He's gone and had an immediate impact.

772
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:16,410
It seems that Tottenham Hotspur on the early days,

773
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,250
Harry,

774
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,809
but the way the supporters embrace him,

775
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:22,630
it seems he's an incredible communicator.

776
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,289
I think he's a masterclass when you see him at a press

777
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:26,130
conference,

778
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,829
he's got that way where he's unashamedly himself.

779
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:29,670
Can he,

780
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,309
can he have the ultimate success in,

781
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,349
in the English Premier League?

782
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:35,390
Of course there's no reason why,

783
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:35,730
but look,

784
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,809
it's very early on.

785
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:40,089
And when everyone keeps going about him being he's,

786
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:40,349
you know,

787
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:41,750
the coach,

788
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,930
a new coach in the Premier League,

789
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:43,390
like I said,

790
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,970
and he emphasises the fact that he's been doing this for over 30

791
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,009
years,

792
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:48,329
you know,

793
00:22:48,329 --> 00:22:48,930
and okay,

794
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:52,150
his journey hasn't gone as planned as maybe as someone else's,

795
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,970
but he has gone and done it the hard way for me.

796
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,410
He knows exactly what he's doing.

797
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:56,670
Yes,

798
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,289
it's very early on at the moment,

799
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:01,289
but the one thing that I think Tottenham fans have been

800
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:04,289
crying out for over the last maybe four or five

801
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:06,130
years is that,

802
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:06,329
you know,

803
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:08,390
Tottenham were a team that actually played football.

804
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,569
They were a team that,

805
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:09,970
you know,

806
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:10,990
played out from the back,

807
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,509
always wanted to play forward,

808
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:13,890
always wanted to play football.

809
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,670
And recently they've had a few managers who are very successful managers.

810
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:21,509
They play a different style to what Spurs are used to.

811
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,849
And I think that was a lot of the frustration.

812
00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:26,490
Whereas the Ang is a complete,

813
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:26,970
you know,

814
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,230
loves football.

815
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,269
He wants his team to hold possession,

816
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,289
control possession,

817
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,609
be high pressed,

818
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:33,529
be aggressive,

819
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:36,789
win it up there in the final third and be able to react quickly.

820
00:23:37,069 --> 00:23:40,289
So that's what Spurs are like back in the day.

821
00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:42,150
He's just bringing that back to them.

822
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:43,109
Now,

823
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:43,650
again,

824
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,910
we can't get too carried away.

825
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:45,250
We,

826
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,890
we all hope he succeeds,

827
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,329
but it's going to be very tough for him because the Premier League is not an easy team.

828
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:55,329
You can't tell me that every time you look at the fixtures week in,

829
00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:56,609
week out that you can pick a guy.

830
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:56,849
Well,

831
00:23:57,529 --> 00:23:59,529
there's probably only one team that you would sit there and go,

832
00:23:59,670 --> 00:23:59,809
well,

833
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:00,390
they will win.

834
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,349
And that's probably Man City.

835
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,289
Everyone else,

836
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:02,630
you're thinking,

837
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:06,069
you just don't know what could happen.

838
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:06,490
So it's,

839
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,869
it's going to be a very tough season for,

840
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,369
he's got off to a fantastic start,

841
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:12,730
but he's got a very long way to go.

842
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,730
And he knows that.

843
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,049
And the one thing he's fantastic at,

844
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:17,569
right,

845
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,269
is communicating with the media,

846
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:21,410
with,

847
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:22,309
with the people.

848
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,190
And he knows exactly what they want and he can deliver that.

849
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:28,069
Robbie Williams singing songs about him already.

850
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:29,990
So it's been an incredible start.

851
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:34,490
Harry and I think everyone in Australia now follows where Ange goes.

852
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:35,089
It's amazing.

853
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,650
We got introduced through Celtic,

854
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,730
through him and you are now to Tottenham Hotspur.

855
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,809
Those that aren't necessarily rusted on to,

856
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:42,750
to the Premier League.

857
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:43,329
Hey Harry,

858
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:45,190
it's been great to connect with you in a program.

859
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:48,609
We call a leader connect that was co-founded with my great friend,

860
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,609
Matt Waterwood.

861
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,009
So we curate these groups around the world,

862
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:55,190
people from different backgrounds that come together to sort of learn and

863
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,569
connect and to share.

864
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:56,910
Harry,

865
00:24:57,009 --> 00:24:58,849
we think in a pretty profound way.

866
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,789
And I love the,

867
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,009
the,

868
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:00,369
the group,

869
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,970
the group that you're in Simon Goodwin,

870
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:04,009
someone I know really well.

871
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,710
He's had great success as a,

872
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,990
as an AFL senior coach was an outstanding player in,

873
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,049
in Australian rules football,

874
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,630
a multiple premiership winner.

875
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:13,029
Andre Borovic from cricket.

876
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:14,390
Australia's got a great reputation.

877
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,390
Fleur McIntyre from the Sydney Kings is quite a remarkable person.

878
00:25:19,069 --> 00:25:20,210
Jan Stirling from basketball,

879
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:20,769
Australia,

880
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,529
and you get together Harry to,

881
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:22,869
to,

882
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,769
to sort of connect and share experiences in this format.

883
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,569
Can you tell us about a leader connect?

884
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:28,390
What's it been like for you?

885
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,049
It's actually been interesting.

886
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,509
I think it's been a lot of fun.

887
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:31,589
I think it's been a lot of fun.

888
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:31,650
I think it's been a lot of fun.

889
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:31,670
And,

890
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,230
and I say,

891
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:38,329
and I say this because I'm kind of the odd one out in this group.

892
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,049
And,

893
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:39,309
and,

894
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:43,309
and I say that only because of the environment I'm in.

895
00:25:43,569 --> 00:25:44,089
This is what,

896
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,509
how I felt that I was struggling in my career,

897
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:48,970
because I feel dealing with players is,

898
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,390
is easy because that's,

899
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:51,210
you know,

900
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:51,890
making it better.

901
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:52,730
It's easy for me.

902
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:54,130
It was dealing with the,

903
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,089
the higher people,

904
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:55,849
especially of the,

905
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:58,069
the level of where I was at,

906
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,589
you know,

907
00:25:58,589 --> 00:26:00,089
especially league two and league one.

908
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:00,349
It's,

909
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:04,950
it's very difficult to deal with people that may have not have been where you

910
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,289
have been into professionalism.

911
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,569
So you've had to kind of manipulate yourself in a certain way to,

912
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,430
to speak to them.

913
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:11,809
And I found that very difficult,

914
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:13,769
but speaking to the group,

915
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:18,250
they had helped me understand certain patterns and certain movements or

916
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:18,970
certain sayings.

917
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:22,910
You can actually entice them into doing it and kind of opening up that way.

918
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:24,230
Yeah,

919
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,670
we love that Harry.

920
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:28,230
And that's what we think is valuable is that diverse thinking.

921
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,230
And even though,

922
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,069
uh,

923
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:31,710
clearly unique what you're doing in,

924
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,069
in,

925
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:32,690
in Scotland,

926
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:35,150
but the idea of how you treat people and how you can,

927
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,250
as you described,

928
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:36,769
uh,

929
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:37,029
you know,

930
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,589
beautifully there,

931
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:41,730
the idea of how you are able to overlay someone else's world to support your

932
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:41,990
world.

933
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:43,890
It's been brilliant to connect with on that front.

934
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:44,730
You're a,

935
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,210
a proud father of four.

936
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:46,910
What,

937
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,130
what do you like on the home front,

938
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:48,369
Harry?

939
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,609
You're back in Manchester,

940
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:50,329
uh,

941
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:52,670
with the family and the family's growing up.

942
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:52,849
What,

943
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,410
what sort of leader are you on the home front?

944
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:55,750
Well,

945
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:56,289
I'm the,

946
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:56,569
uh,

947
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:57,250
well,

948
00:26:57,309 --> 00:26:57,529
look,

949
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:57,930
let's,

950
00:26:58,029 --> 00:26:58,269
let's,

951
00:26:58,329 --> 00:26:59,109
let's face it,

952
00:26:59,150 --> 00:26:59,390
Luke,

953
00:26:59,529 --> 00:26:59,829
you know,

954
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:02,789
I would love to say I run the ship,

955
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,910
but I don't and give the old lad.

956
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:05,170
No,

957
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:06,309
it's all me,

958
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,930
but very much hands on.

959
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:09,210
I'm,

960
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:09,569
I'm,

961
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:10,589
I'm the Uber driver,

962
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,410
the taxi driver.

963
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:11,970
I'm the chef.

964
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:12,609
I'm the cleaner.

965
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:13,190
I,

966
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,450
I,

967
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,910
I enjoy that stuff because it takes my mind off football.

968
00:27:16,329 --> 00:27:17,289
So like I said,

969
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:18,130
even this morning,

970
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,829
so my wife has to work.

971
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,450
She's got to go down to London today.

972
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:22,789
So I dropped the,

973
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,329
like my,

974
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:26,450
my girls off at school today and I'll pick them up.

975
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,609
I'm on chef duty.

976
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,329
So I'm cooking a nice spaghetti bolognese.

977
00:27:30,069 --> 00:27:30,890
For everyone tonight.

978
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,269
My other daughter's got to go down to London.

979
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,190
She's got to pick her keys up for her apartment,

980
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:36,450
but she's back up later.

981
00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:39,549
I'm going to a fancy dress party on Saturday.

982
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,730
So I've got to go pick up some stuff from my wife's friend.

983
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,670
I've got to go pick up a couple of fans because absolutely roasting over here at the moment.

984
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:48,349
We don't have data.

985
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:51,130
So I'm kind of that person.

986
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,750
I've already done the dogs as well.

987
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,829
So I fed them and taken them out.

988
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:56,410
I've got gardeners in my garden,

989
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,130
building some decking that my wife's done.

990
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:00,009
I love helping.

991
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:00,750
You know,

992
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:02,230
so I've got no problem with it.

993
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,549
You're making us look bad,

994
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:03,769
mate.

995
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:04,309
With that list,

996
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:04,710
that's,

997
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,450
that's going to cause us a lot of problem,

998
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:08,009
Harry.

999
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:09,529
You're doing everything.

1000
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:10,109
Luke,

1001
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:13,029
otherwise I just sit around and I get bored.

1002
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:13,910
Or like I said,

1003
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,150
well,

1004
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,069
I'll go to the gym.

1005
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:15,769
Like I said,

1006
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:16,029
I,

1007
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,529
I just did about a 40,

1008
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:20,250
40 minute gym session before I came on with you.

1009
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,109
So I did that.

1010
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:22,630
And then I'm,

1011
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,150
I'm actually into running at the moment.

1012
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,089
So I,

1013
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,089
I'm up to about 55 minutes running,

1014
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:27,730
you know,

1015
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:27,869
so,

1016
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:30,049
cause I could never run longer than 10 minutes.

1017
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:31,549
It's funny that,

1018
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,190
you know,

1019
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:34,809
cause everything's broken down with running with,

1020
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,509
with a footballer,

1021
00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:36,710
you know,

1022
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:37,890
you're always running even a minute,

1023
00:28:38,069 --> 00:28:38,490
three minutes,

1024
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:39,029
five minutes,

1025
00:28:39,109 --> 00:28:39,529
10 minutes,

1026
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:40,690
12 minutes max,

1027
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:41,250
right?

1028
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:42,410
Cause even in a game,

1029
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,089
you're always running,

1030
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:43,849
walking this out,

1031
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:47,329
but I've decided to actually just see how far I can actually run.

1032
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,589
And the best I've done so far is 55 minutes.

1033
00:28:49,589 --> 00:28:52,509
So I'm trying to get up to about an hour and a half of just,

1034
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:52,849
I mean,

1035
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,690
it's not quick running.

1036
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,309
It's just nice,

1037
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,369
steady pace running.

1038
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,930
That just keeps me ticking over.

1039
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,289
Life's good,

1040
00:28:59,470 --> 00:28:59,650
Harry.

1041
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,049
It's great.

1042
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:01,849
It's great to hear that the family's good,

1043
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:02,410
life's good.

1044
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,730
And you're,

1045
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:04,529
you're on fire.

1046
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,849
We have one of our coaches,

1047
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:07,650
one of the leaders in this forum,

1048
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:07,869
Harry,

1049
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:08,490
use a term,

1050
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:09,809
success leaves clues.

1051
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:12,150
And that's really the basis of a leader connect.

1052
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:15,009
And we want to pick up a lot of the wisdom that you've got.

1053
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:16,869
You've got an incredible relationship with your players.

1054
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:20,529
I read about the Celtic players and how much they value your impact.

1055
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,069
And so there's a series of patterns.

1056
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:25,369
We think that leadership looks like and shows up regularly.

1057
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:27,829
And we start Harry with this idea of self leadership.

1058
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:30,049
It's hard to achieve what you've achieved,

1059
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:32,369
in your life without a sense of burnout,

1060
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:33,069
lead yourself.

1061
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:33,549
What,

1062
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:35,670
what do you think of when I ask you about self leadership?

1063
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:36,990
Like,

1064
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:37,910
like I said,

1065
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,509
I just try to live my life.

1066
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:44,869
How I don't know.

1067
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,789
I just try to be like a good person.

1068
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:48,450
You know,

1069
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:48,670
I,

1070
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:48,990
I,

1071
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,450
I try to lead by example.

1072
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:50,950
Like I said,

1073
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:51,150
I,

1074
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,589
I'm not that,

1075
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:52,849
that,

1076
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,230
that person that will get up in the morning and make my bed straight away.

1077
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:56,170
You know,

1078
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,170
or sometimes,

1079
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:57,569
like I said,

1080
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:57,930
I mean,

1081
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,109
especially when I'm up in Scotland,

1082
00:29:59,250 --> 00:29:59,930
I'll make my bed,

1083
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:02,509
straight away because they always say you make your bed straight away.

1084
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,910
You've accomplished something already,

1085
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:04,789
you know?

1086
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:05,509
So it's,

1087
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:06,130
it's things like that.

1088
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:06,490
Then I,

1089
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,829
I try to get into routine,

1090
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:08,190
you know,

1091
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:08,349
I'm,

1092
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:10,569
I'm very much a routine person because I,

1093
00:30:10,569 --> 00:30:11,170
I look,

1094
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,430
my whole life's been a routine,

1095
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:13,329
you know,

1096
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,289
doing all that.

1097
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:14,630
So I,

1098
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,329
I try to keep myself on that.

1099
00:30:16,329 --> 00:30:20,890
And the only time I really span out of being in a routine is only when I go on

1100
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,309
holiday.

1101
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:23,970
And then that's when I eat a lot and,

1102
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:24,430
you know,

1103
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:26,230
have to have some drinks and,

1104
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:26,470
and,

1105
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:26,630
and,

1106
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:26,890
you know,

1107
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,329
you go to parties and all that.

1108
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:28,630
And then,

1109
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:30,069
but then you feel kind of rubbish,

1110
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:30,849
you're about yourself.

1111
00:30:31,349 --> 00:30:34,990
So I like to keep in a routine and I feel stronger that way.

1112
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:36,190
And then I think if,

1113
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,210
if you keep yourself in a routine and it doesn't have to be like army style

1114
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:40,710
routine,

1115
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,309
if you can just keep yourself in a nice routine,

1116
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,109
do the simple things and just slowly build it up.

1117
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:46,589
Now,

1118
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:47,410
the,

1119
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,809
the one thing that I've always loved to do,

1120
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:52,670
especially when I was younger is I always loved to push myself,

1121
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,190
you know,

1122
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,789
and that's how my work ethic was.

1123
00:30:54,829 --> 00:30:56,069
I was never one to,

1124
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,410
I was always that kind of mindset that if I did a,

1125
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,289
you know,

1126
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:01,630
a kilometer in,

1127
00:31:01,849 --> 00:31:02,410
or,

1128
00:31:02,849 --> 00:31:03,150
you know,

1129
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,789
let's just say three minutes,

1130
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:05,529
for example,

1131
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,890
the next day I had to do it in two 59.

1132
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,990
Then the next day I had to do in two 58 and each day.

1133
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:12,670
And that's how that was my mindset.

1134
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:14,230
Now I'm a lot older.

1135
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:16,789
I kind of back off at that.

1136
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:19,890
And I just try to keep a bit more simple and,

1137
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:20,069
and,

1138
00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:20,849
and easier.

1139
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:21,490
So like I said,

1140
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:22,930
when I go to Celtic,

1141
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:23,349
I'll,

1142
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,569
I'll still get up at six 30.

1143
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,569
I'll still go in.

1144
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,410
I'll do a workout.

1145
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,930
I'll just have my routine.

1146
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:29,250
And then I feel better.

1147
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:29,990
In myself.

1148
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,009
That's how,

1149
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,609
and I think if you can feel better in yourself,

1150
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:36,549
that's when you can start being more positive towards people,

1151
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,349
you know,

1152
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:40,150
whether you meet them for the first time or whether you're working with them

1153
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:40,970
24 seven,

1154
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:41,470
you know,

1155
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,230
you go in there and you're feeling tired.

1156
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,650
You're feeling lazy.

1157
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,069
You're feeling not good about yourself.

1158
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:52,730
You can't project energy off yourself into them because they're just going to

1159
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:53,490
see straight through you.

1160
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:55,650
They need to be able to see someone think,

1161
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:56,269
wow,

1162
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:56,609
look,

1163
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,250
look at this guy.

1164
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:58,809
If they're looking opposite you,

1165
00:31:58,809 --> 00:31:59,490
and thinking,

1166
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,130
man,

1167
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:00,950
this guy is,

1168
00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:01,650
nah,

1169
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:02,109
I'm not,

1170
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,369
I'm not picking up that bite,

1171
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,829
but you're seeing some positive,

1172
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:06,529
powerful,

1173
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:07,049
you know,

1174
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:07,710
you know,

1175
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,410
interesting,

1176
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:08,769
you know,

1177
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:12,369
really taking pride in their work that they're trying to show you about your

1178
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:12,650
work.

1179
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:13,950
I would love that.

1180
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:15,069
I would switch off.

1181
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,730
If someone would just come in there and was like,

1182
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:16,970
yeah,

1183
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:17,309
Hey,

1184
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:17,890
how are you?

1185
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,410
I'll switch off straight away.

1186
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,990
But if someone come in and said,

1187
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:22,470
you know,

1188
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:24,950
in one of my mates always says,

1189
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:26,869
and he always makes me laugh to this day.

1190
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:27,289
When I,

1191
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,109
every time I bring him,

1192
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:28,390
I ask him,

1193
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:28,569
he said,

1194
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:28,730
look,

1195
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:29,210
how are you?

1196
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:29,809
He goes,

1197
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,130
mate,

1198
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,289
he swears,

1199
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:31,890
but he'll go,

1200
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:34,390
but that makes you laugh.

1201
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:35,869
So I've taken like,

1202
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,470
he's always told me this about six years ago.

1203
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:38,630
So every time I go up to self,

1204
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,109
everyone goes,

1205
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:39,730
Hey,

1206
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:39,970
Harry,

1207
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:40,349
how are you?

1208
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:40,549
I go,

1209
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:40,809
man,

1210
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:41,829
I'm awesome.

1211
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:43,750
That's,

1212
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:44,809
that's the reaction you get.

1213
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:45,970
And it makes them laugh.

1214
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,690
And it just gets them go,

1215
00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:47,990
Oh,

1216
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:48,650
you know what?

1217
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:51,210
And I just think putting people on the,

1218
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,789
on the right foot straight away in the first thing in the morning,

1219
00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:55,910
when you meet them is always a great start.

1220
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:56,170
You know,

1221
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,430
you never want to meet someone in the morning.

1222
00:32:57,529 --> 00:32:57,750
How are you?

1223
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:58,329
Hey,

1224
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:58,589
Hey,

1225
00:32:58,589 --> 00:32:59,710
Oh wow.

1226
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,150
And you think,

1227
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:01,309
well,

1228
00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:03,730
I don't really want to know what's happening in his life at the moment.

1229
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:04,690
Cause I've got my own problems,

1230
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:05,509
you know,

1231
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:06,670
and that's,

1232
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:07,730
and that's how it is.

1233
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,950
But you get someone that's a bit bubbly guy.

1234
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:10,369
Yeah.

1235
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,390
Then you have a quick chat and then you get on with your life.

1236
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:13,569
Yeah.

1237
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:14,329
Brilliant answer,

1238
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:14,549
Harry.

1239
00:33:14,609 --> 00:33:14,930
And I can,

1240
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:18,009
I can see that in you and it does lead into the next dimension,

1241
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,089
which you probably touched on straight away.

1242
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,769
Having a positive impact on others is,

1243
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:24,150
is something we see,

1244
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:24,509
you know,

1245
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:26,329
people who are really successful are conscious of that,

1246
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:26,509
Harry.

1247
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:27,390
And you just described it,

1248
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:27,670
isn't it?

1249
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:28,190
And I,

1250
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,789
I can awesome give someone that feeling straight away.

1251
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:33,109
I mean,

1252
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:33,890
is how,

1253
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,529
what other ways do you think about,

1254
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:38,049
we just heard about what you do for your family on a daily basis,

1255
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,490
but it's clearly something you think about having a positive impact.

1256
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:41,130
Yeah.

1257
00:33:41,349 --> 00:33:41,750
Again,

1258
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:42,930
even when I like,

1259
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:44,470
I sit down with my players,

1260
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,430
so I'll sit down opposite them.

1261
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:46,869
And,

1262
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:47,470
you know,

1263
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:51,089
even when I started to speak to my ADA dies and my ADA,

1264
00:33:51,349 --> 00:33:53,690
I was honest with him from the start.

1265
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,049
I said,

1266
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:54,269
look,

1267
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:57,750
this is a two way conversation because this ain't going to work if it's only a

1268
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,150
one way,

1269
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,490
conversation of me telling you what I think.

1270
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,509
I expect us to have arguments.

1271
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,609
I expect us to not be agree on every point.

1272
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,569
I'm going to always have my opinion,

1273
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:09,750
but I need you to have your opinion as well.

1274
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:10,909
And,

1275
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:11,289
you know,

1276
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:12,429
even though we have a translator,

1277
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,369
cause he's,

1278
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:14,010
he's Japanese.

1279
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,050
We have that communication.

1280
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,110
Even when last year,

1281
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,230
when I had Jotter as well,

1282
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:19,110
we would argue,

1283
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,570
but that's,

1284
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:21,730
that's what he needed.

1285
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:23,829
Cause I'm not the manager.

1286
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:27,989
I'm a coach because it's not my job to be able to tell him off on certain

1287
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:28,170
things.

1288
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,650
I'm here to make him a better person.

1289
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:33,809
So when I like clip all these clips in the game,

1290
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:37,909
I'll sit there and watch him and I will give him little movement patterns,

1291
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:38,789
you know,

1292
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:39,869
things that may,

1293
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,969
he may know or may not know things that I did,

1294
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,449
but then what I did,

1295
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:47,230
he may not be able to do things that he does.

1296
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,050
I couldn't do.

1297
00:34:48,309 --> 00:34:52,610
So it's kind of about me trying to get that right mixture to get him to be

1298
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,590
able to understand it.

1299
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,650
And then ultimately you go out there and work on it,

1300
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,170
but it has to be a two way relationship.

1301
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:58,969
And again,

1302
00:34:58,969 --> 00:35:01,989
if you don't bring that energy or that positivity,

1303
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:03,230
I mean,

1304
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:04,849
you're going to lose them straight away,

1305
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:05,809
especially footballers.

1306
00:35:06,489 --> 00:35:09,469
And you don't get to achieve the level that you have,

1307
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:10,449
Harry,

1308
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:15,050
without creating and sharing a vision for what you want to achieve.

1309
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,429
And you're doing that in the coaching path at the moment with Celtic and

1310
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:20,550
you've had your own teams in the,

1311
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,070
in the UK.

1312
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:24,949
Have you gone about sort of sharing the vision that you want for the things

1313
00:35:24,949 --> 00:35:25,789
that you want to achieve?

1314
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:27,489
Oh,

1315
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:27,809
easy.

1316
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:28,389
I mean,

1317
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,389
I,

1318
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,070
I love creating.

1319
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,510
I'm a creative person.

1320
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,690
I was a creative player.

1321
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:37,090
And that's the one thing as me being a manager,

1322
00:35:37,289 --> 00:35:37,650
I've,

1323
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:38,550
you know,

1324
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,690
I've always written everything.

1325
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:42,429
Like I always wrote everything down,

1326
00:35:42,489 --> 00:35:44,829
but I never really like how to play.

1327
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:45,110
I mean,

1328
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,289
the one thing that always amazes me is when I used to go,

1329
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,869
go for jobs and people go,

1330
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:50,030
well,

1331
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,789
how do you play?

1332
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:51,610
How do you,

1333
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:51,809
you know,

1334
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:52,389
how do you do this?

1335
00:35:52,429 --> 00:35:52,610
How do you,

1336
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:53,489
well,

1337
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,710
I don't know what team have I got?

1338
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,250
What players have I got?

1339
00:35:56,469 --> 00:35:57,750
And that was one thing.

1340
00:35:57,809 --> 00:35:58,550
So that people say,

1341
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:58,730
no,

1342
00:35:58,769 --> 00:35:59,989
you must have a certain style.

1343
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,570
Of course I have a certain style of how I want to play,

1344
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,090
but if I don't have them players,

1345
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:04,610
right,

1346
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,449
then how am I supposed to be able to play that I want to play?

1347
00:36:07,909 --> 00:36:08,130
You know,

1348
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:08,309
you,

1349
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:09,750
you got to be able to be adaptive,

1350
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,130
especially at the start.

1351
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,030
So that was me as a coach.

1352
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,969
But then as I've gone into a player,

1353
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:15,570
I mean,

1354
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,010
as a,

1355
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,250
an individual coach,

1356
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:21,389
I've looked at it a completely different ways where I'm looking at movement

1357
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:21,769
patterns.

1358
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:23,329
I'm looking at body language.

1359
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:27,409
I'm looking at shifting defenders and I'm only going through experience of what

1360
00:36:27,409 --> 00:36:28,989
I got taught when I was younger.

1361
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:31,369
And I go back to,

1362
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:34,829
even when I got taught how to strike a ball or the cross the ball,

1363
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:35,630
um,

1364
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,409
or the volleyball,

1365
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:39,070
these things got broken down for me,

1366
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,949
like where my foot got,

1367
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,550
how my foot had to be placed,

1368
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,670
how my knee had to be bent,

1369
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,050
how my shoulder had to be pointed.

1370
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,789
And I don't know.

1371
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,150
I've always remembered it.

1372
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,869
I've always remembered it.

1373
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,369
And I knew,

1374
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,969
and I knew how to do it because the one thing I could do in the game was I was

1375
00:36:54,969 --> 00:36:57,250
a very good striker of the ball and a very good cross.

1376
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:57,389
Well,

1377
00:36:57,409 --> 00:36:57,670
the ball.

1378
00:36:57,869 --> 00:36:59,570
So when you put me in situation,

1379
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:03,829
I can tell when my wingers don't cross the ball properly.

1380
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,809
I can just hear by the noise of the ball.

1381
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:06,730
You know,

1382
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,769
I can see by the pattern of how the ball slides across the grass and I'll just

1383
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:10,929
go,

1384
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,230
no,

1385
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,190
I'll just go,

1386
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:12,530
no,

1387
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:13,210
I'll just go.

1388
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:14,010
And then when they hit it,

1389
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:14,269
perfect.

1390
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:14,510
I'll go,

1391
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,469
do you hear the sound?

1392
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,809
And then even now they're listening to the sound of it.

1393
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:23,070
So it's not about me having all this information and not sharing it.

1394
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:27,130
I will share anything with anybody if they're willing to learn,

1395
00:37:27,409 --> 00:37:28,409
you know,

1396
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:31,349
and I think that's the important thing is that's why I always say it's got to

1397
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,110
be a two way,

1398
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,650
a two way street.

1399
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:35,670
Cause if it's not,

1400
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:37,329
then you're just talking to,

1401
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:38,510
to deaf ears and don't get me wrong.

1402
00:37:38,769 --> 00:37:41,630
I've got one or two players up there that are not interested.

1403
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:42,269
You know,

1404
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:42,449
they,

1405
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,670
they will sit there and you do a drill with them and all that.

1406
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:45,730
And you know,

1407
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:46,010
well,

1408
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,630
if they need anything,

1409
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:48,610
they'll come to you,

1410
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,889
but then you have the other ones that really want to learn.

1411
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,110
And you just put all your energy and effort into them.

1412
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,230
And that leads into something.

1413
00:37:55,369 --> 00:37:57,130
We see another really common trait of leaders,

1414
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,349
Harry,

1415
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:59,050
around being curious and,

1416
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,210
and through being curious,

1417
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:03,949
they're always wanting to learn and they approach their constant learning and

1418
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,309
improvement through curiosity.

1419
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:08,210
Does that ring true with you being curious?

1420
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:09,949
I,

1421
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:10,489
I,

1422
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:10,789
I,

1423
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:11,329
yes,

1424
00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:17,869
to a point because I don't think I need to invent the wheel again because

1425
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:24,670
striking a ball back in the 1970s is no different to striking a ball now.

1426
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:26,449
Like it's,

1427
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:26,809
it's,

1428
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:27,110
you know,

1429
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:27,849
it's like boxing,

1430
00:38:27,969 --> 00:38:28,190
you know,

1431
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:29,070
you throw a punch,

1432
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:29,829
there's no difference.

1433
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:30,070
There's,

1434
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:30,550
there's no,

1435
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,230
there's not another way of striking a ball.

1436
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:32,989
You know,

1437
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:33,230
you,

1438
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:34,929
you have to be able to get the,

1439
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:35,969
the,

1440
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,389
the,

1441
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:37,510
the right technique,

1442
00:38:37,769 --> 00:38:38,969
um,

1443
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:39,869
down pat,

1444
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:40,329
you know,

1445
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:40,550
you,

1446
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:43,369
there's not too many things you need to change in it.

1447
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:48,489
You just need to make sure that they understand exactly what they're missing because there's a lot of,

1448
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,409
I can tell you now,

1449
00:38:49,489 --> 00:38:53,329
there's a lot of players out there that have never been taught how to strike a ball or head a ball.

1450
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,489
I remember even when I was at Watford under 21s,

1451
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,010
and I remember,

1452
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,050
getting my group in there,

1453
00:38:58,489 --> 00:39:01,309
and I think we had lost the game and I was angry with them.

1454
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:05,409
And I remember sitting there with them and looking at them and I said,

1455
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:06,690
how,

1456
00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:07,110
like,

1457
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:08,929
how can you not head a ball?

1458
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:10,489
Like,

1459
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:11,929
how can you not head a ball?

1460
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:13,090
Uh,

1461
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:13,289
you,

1462
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:13,610
you,

1463
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:16,210
you're playing at like under 21s for Watford,

1464
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:17,110
a Premier League club,

1465
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,090
and you cannot head a ball.

1466
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,530
And to be fair,

1467
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:20,769
one of the players,

1468
00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:22,369
and he was a Welsh international at the time,

1469
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:23,190
he put his hand up and goes,

1470
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:24,190
I've never been taught.

1471
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:26,530
And I just went,

1472
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,429
wow.

1473
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:30,389
And I go,

1474
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:31,530
I got,

1475
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:32,449
like I said,

1476
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,449
I got taught how to head a ball.

1477
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,269
I got taught how to volley.

1478
00:39:34,389 --> 00:39:35,329
I got taught how to throw down.

1479
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,050
And I just think this day and age now,

1480
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,070
especially a lot of coaches,

1481
00:39:38,889 --> 00:39:39,090
you know,

1482
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,010
everybody wants to play ticky tacky football.

1483
00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:44,190
Everyone wants to play like Ange or Pep Guardiola,

1484
00:39:44,429 --> 00:39:46,250
and they just want to talk about formations or that.

1485
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:51,170
But break it down to the actual person or the child that you're working with.

1486
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,210
They actually don't know how to actually pass the ball properly.

1487
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,570
They don't know how to jump properly.

1488
00:39:55,809 --> 00:39:57,090
They don't know how to strike a ball.

1489
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,530
Probably they don't know how to do this,

1490
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,929
but they've been put into teams.

1491
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:03,010
And then when they get isolated in moments,

1492
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,329
and this is what I used to say to my under 21s.

1493
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:10,309
And I remember taking their whole kind of concept and just putting it to the side.

1494
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:13,849
And I actually taught my players how to strike balls and cross balls.

1495
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:14,630
And I told them,

1496
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:14,869
I said,

1497
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:16,670
when you step up to the first team,

1498
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,030
the manager is going to ask you to whip a ball in.

1499
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:19,909
Right now,

1500
00:40:19,969 --> 00:40:24,570
if you whip a ball in and you send a 50 yards in the air and a mile over that direction,

1501
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,130
he's just going to go next one.

1502
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,030
Come in.

1503
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,050
And that's your chance gone.

1504
00:40:28,389 --> 00:40:31,949
But if you put that ball and you whip a ball in right on the striker's head and he scores,

1505
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,170
he's going to look at you and go,

1506
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:33,809
Ooh,

1507
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:34,670
I like that.

1508
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:35,809
Do it again.

1509
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,829
And I just found it amazing.

1510
00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:41,489
So this has been interesting for me.

1511
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,929
And even from my coaching side,

1512
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,989
I'd always have time for individual work,

1513
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,670
but especially working with Celtic,

1514
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:47,530
I said,

1515
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,570
especially with the wings,

1516
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,349
when I see certain movement patterns,

1517
00:40:50,429 --> 00:40:51,329
and especially with Dyson,

1518
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:52,550
you know,

1519
00:40:53,269 --> 00:40:56,590
I teach him certain patterns that I did and he takes it really on board.

1520
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:56,929
And I,

1521
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,250
I see it in the games where he gets success.

1522
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,869
I just think it's fantastic.

1523
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:05,449
It is like so much joy that you bring to yourself inside.

1524
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,010
And even though the,

1525
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,949
like the managers there and he's loving that,

1526
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,309
you know,

1527
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:09,690
deep down,

1528
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:10,030
you're going,

1529
00:41:10,489 --> 00:41:10,650
man,

1530
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,309
we talked about that and now he's doing it.

1531
00:41:13,309 --> 00:41:13,570
Right.

1532
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:13,869
And that,

1533
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:15,570
and that's like an international player.

1534
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,349
So like,

1535
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:19,889
I've stepped up from that to work with players that have played at world cups,

1536
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:21,570
that they're listening to me.

1537
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,929
So it's a nice feeling.

1538
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,329
And that's where you get your buzz from.

1539
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,929
I can see the joy.

1540
00:41:26,929 --> 00:41:27,849
I can see the joy that you get out of that.

1541
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:28,409
Harry,

1542
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,969
you mentioned before about,

1543
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:30,789
you know,

1544
00:41:30,849 --> 00:41:33,469
Ange Postacoglu in a couple of days communicating so clearly,

1545
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,489
you knew exactly what he wanted.

1546
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:39,309
How have you gone about your communicating your message with clarity?

1547
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,030
Well,

1548
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:41,269
again,

1549
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:41,590
I've,

1550
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:44,909
I've been fortunate enough now to have worked with two great managers,

1551
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,250
one with Ange and one with Brendan Rogers,

1552
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:51,250
and they're completely different managers within themselves.

1553
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,110
And,

1554
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:53,309
and,

1555
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:56,769
and learning both and seeing both,

1556
00:41:56,929 --> 00:41:57,510
you know,

1557
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:00,150
I kind of see myself kind of in between,

1558
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:01,429
you know,

1559
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:01,869
there there's,

1560
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:05,289
there's nothing that they're doing that is,

1561
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:06,449
you know,

1562
00:42:06,449 --> 00:42:08,389
kind of different to what I've been doing.

1563
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:09,230
You know,

1564
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:09,889
like I said,

1565
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:10,710
I,

1566
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,630
I feel like I'm,

1567
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,030
I'm on the right path now.

1568
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:14,050
Look,

1569
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:14,250
I've,

1570
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:18,869
I've got to hopefully be in the right place at the right time for my next

1571
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,650
opportunity.

1572
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:23,050
But like still learning,

1573
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,050
learning my trade,

1574
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,250
still do what I have to do,

1575
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,809
but still learning from Brendan Rogers.

1576
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:27,889
Now who's like I said,

1577
00:42:27,889 --> 00:42:29,110
they're completely different manager,

1578
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:30,530
but taking the information there,

1579
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:31,369
but what I,

1580
00:42:31,409 --> 00:42:32,929
what I see and what are there,

1581
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:34,369
I'm not too far away,

1582
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:35,250
you know,

1583
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,829
from what I think I can do.

1584
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:40,750
Cause I feel like I do what they,

1585
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:41,469
they kind of do,

1586
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:41,909
but on a,

1587
00:42:41,909 --> 00:42:47,130
obviously a lower level because these guys are obviously fantastic at their

1588
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,170
job and look,

1589
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:51,429
we'll see what will happen.

1590
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,429
We'll see what will happen,

1591
00:42:52,429 --> 00:42:53,710
but I'm excited.

1592
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,429
I'm not afraid.

1593
00:42:55,469 --> 00:42:56,309
I've never been afraid.

1594
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:56,789
Like I said,

1595
00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:00,210
I love making mistakes because that's how you learn.

1596
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:03,489
I just hope I don't make too many mistakes in my next job.

1597
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:07,090
How important has collaboration,

1598
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,670
you're just talking about the collaboration,

1599
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,070
aren't you?

1600
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:12,510
With Brendan Rogers and Ange Postacoglu and learning and wanting to,

1601
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,670
to get better.

1602
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:15,269
How important has that been for you?

1603
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:16,949
It's put me on the,

1604
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:20,849
on back to where I felt I was when I first took my first job at Crawley,

1605
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:21,409
you know,

1606
00:43:21,429 --> 00:43:22,510
where I had a mindset,

1607
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:23,949
like even when I was a player,

1608
00:43:24,429 --> 00:43:26,670
like a lot of managers knew that,

1609
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:27,989
just leave him.

1610
00:43:28,769 --> 00:43:29,550
He knows his job.

1611
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,630
He knows what I want,

1612
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:31,530
you know,

1613
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,309
just leave him because he will figure it out,

1614
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:33,849
you know,

1615
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:34,170
and,

1616
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:38,489
and some of the best coaches that I had worked with just left me alone,

1617
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,789
told me what I needed to do and just said,

1618
00:43:40,789 --> 00:43:41,010
look,

1619
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:41,230
you know,

1620
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:41,630
if you need,

1621
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:42,530
if you see something else,

1622
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:43,150
you,

1623
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:47,730
you got to do it because I was that type of player to be able to go into a

1624
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:52,489
certain position or drag someone out of a certain position to allow someone else

1625
00:43:52,489 --> 00:43:53,449
to be able to come in.

1626
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,769
So I felt when I,

1627
00:43:56,769 --> 00:43:58,010
when I went into coaching,

1628
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:58,510
that's,

1629
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,550
that was my mindset.

1630
00:44:00,269 --> 00:44:00,730
And like I said,

1631
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:00,929
I,

1632
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,289
I felt I did very good,

1633
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:03,010
especially on my,

1634
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:03,309
on my,

1635
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:04,210
on my first one.

1636
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,210
And like I said,

1637
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:12,150
I kind of drifted off into a different little paths and kind of just drifted

1638
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,429
away of drifted off my beliefs,

1639
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,150
but working with Angie and working with Brendan Rogers.

1640
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:23,829
Now these guys have put me back onto my tunnel vision of what I kind of

1641
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:24,329
want to do.

1642
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,690
And because I've seen two top managers,

1643
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,670
now work and it's like,

1644
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:29,590
yeah,

1645
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:30,050
yeah,

1646
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,429
I'll listen,

1647
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:32,630
but I know what I want,

1648
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:33,409
you know?

1649
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:34,070
And I've,

1650
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,309
and you see that when you hear them talk,

1651
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:38,929
when you hear them talk to players,

1652
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:40,349
when you hear them talk to the press,

1653
00:44:40,489 --> 00:44:42,489
when you hear them just talking to general public,

1654
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,309
or when you hear them talk to the coaches,

1655
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:44,690
you know,

1656
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:44,869
you,

1657
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:45,469
you see,

1658
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:45,949
and you hear,

1659
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,170
and they're the things that I'm picking up.

1660
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:49,050
And you know,

1661
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:49,630
look,

1662
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:53,869
I'm excited to see what the Celtic team can do because we've got a big

1663
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:56,150
champions league competition coming up.

1664
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:56,570
We've got,

1665
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:59,110
I think a good opportunity,

1666
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:01,670
especially with the teams that we've drawn.

1667
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:04,250
I think we've got a good opportunity to progress,

1668
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:10,030
especially with the performance that we turned out the other day against

1669
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:10,469
Rangers.

1670
00:45:10,469 --> 00:45:11,750
I thought it was very positive.

1671
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:15,369
So I'm looking forward to seeing what this Celtic team can do,

1672
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:16,190
but also,

1673
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:16,610
you know,

1674
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:21,409
hopefully I can also take a little bit more information from Brendan Rogers

1675
00:45:21,409 --> 00:45:23,150
and just up my game a little bit as well.

1676
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:24,530
Harry,

1677
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,389
we're obsessed with great leadership.

1678
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:30,110
And what it looks like in different forms and the work we do at a leader

1679
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:30,710
connect.

1680
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:31,429
And yours is a,

1681
00:45:31,489 --> 00:45:31,789
is a,

1682
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:37,190
is an incredible story from the humble backblocks of Western Sydney to,

1683
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:38,510
to achieve what you have.

1684
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:39,510
Let me ask you this.

1685
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,449
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1686
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:51,639
I think there's been periods of where leaders have,

1687
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,119
well,

1688
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:53,320
I wouldn't say leaders.

1689
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:56,619
I would say just people that have,

1690
00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:57,820
have been there,

1691
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:58,659
supported me,

1692
00:45:59,440 --> 00:45:59,920
you know,

1693
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,519
um,

1694
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:02,860
because when you,

1695
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,239
when,

1696
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:03,480
when,

1697
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:03,880
when,

1698
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:04,039
when you,

1699
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:05,139
when you talk about a leader,

1700
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:05,699
like I said,

1701
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:09,199
a great leader for me is someone that,

1702
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:09,679
you know,

1703
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,599
is there 24 seven,

1704
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:12,260
you know,

1705
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:12,480
is,

1706
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:12,739
is,

1707
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:13,960
is always there to help.

1708
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:14,500
You know,

1709
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:16,719
he puts the team first.

1710
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,840
He's not one of these that it's about him.

1711
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,780
He's always worried about everybody else,

1712
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:25,460
but he really looks after himself because he makes sure he is that,

1713
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:27,320
that person that is strong.

1714
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:33,639
So I've come across people in my life that players even players,

1715
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,300
you know,

1716
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,239
that have shown qualities of like that.

1717
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:38,440
Um,

1718
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,199
but as far as like great,

1719
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,340
great leaders,

1720
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:42,960
uh,

1721
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:44,119
you know,

1722
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:47,380
like my dad was a big leader when I was younger growing up.

1723
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:48,340
Um,

1724
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,719
he was a big part of it,

1725
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:51,199
but obviously because I left home,

1726
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:53,199
I had to kind of filter out,

1727
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:53,940
you know,

1728
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,280
and,

1729
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,579
and maybe look for other kind of,

1730
00:46:57,579 --> 00:46:57,639
uh,

1731
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:00,099
father figures that that were like leaders.

1732
00:47:00,139 --> 00:47:03,340
And obviously like I go back to even my financial advisor,

1733
00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:04,719
he's like a father to me,

1734
00:47:05,139 --> 00:47:05,639
you know,

1735
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:06,219
but in a,

1736
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:07,000
in a different way,

1737
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,539
I go back to one of my first coaches at Leeds United,

1738
00:47:10,659 --> 00:47:11,300
Eddie Gray,

1739
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:11,880
you know,

1740
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,440
who I'm very fond of still to this day,

1741
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:15,280
you know,

1742
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,719
he was a big part of,

1743
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:17,380
you know,

1744
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:18,199
bringing out,

1745
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,260
cause he could see a lot of him in me,

1746
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:21,059
you know,

1747
00:47:21,699 --> 00:47:23,920
of what he wanted from me.

1748
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,420
So he helped me as,

1749
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,039
as a leader.

1750
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,639
And then throughout my stages,

1751
00:47:28,059 --> 00:47:30,099
meeting different managers,

1752
00:47:30,099 --> 00:47:30,820
different players,

1753
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:34,659
they've all kind of helped me in a way to become who I was.

1754
00:47:34,659 --> 00:47:36,159
But honestly,

1755
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:36,880
Luke,

1756
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,880
ultimately it's always been my own decision and my own mindset that has led me

1757
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:45,099
to be who I wanted to be.

1758
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:48,619
So I've always appreciated people helping me,

1759
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:54,300
but no one's ever really kind of told me really what to do.

1760
00:47:54,699 --> 00:47:56,119
Cause I've always been that player.

1761
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,619
That's gone out and played on the edge and wanted to play on the edge.

1762
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:03,920
And I was never afraid of what people were going to say about me.

1763
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,679
And I know a lot of people out there sit there and go,

1764
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:06,920
Oh,

1765
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,280
you know,

1766
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:09,500
you'll get criticized for this or this,

1767
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:09,739
that,

1768
00:48:09,739 --> 00:48:12,119
that has never affected me.

1769
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,960
Like it actually makes me laugh.

1770
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:19,500
Like when someone wrote something bad about me or,

1771
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:19,739
you know,

1772
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:24,380
you played bad or this and that asked me and I'd go,

1773
00:48:24,659 --> 00:48:25,539
do you really think,

1774
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:29,920
do you think that I need you to tell me that I played bad?

1775
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,599
Now I know I played bad,

1776
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,400
but that's all that matters,

1777
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:33,699
right?

1778
00:48:33,699 --> 00:48:35,980
There's only two people I need to impress in this world.

1779
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,320
It's my wife and my boss.

1780
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,840
They're the only two people,

1781
00:48:40,179 --> 00:48:40,380
right?

1782
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,139
Other than that,

1783
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,840
like you can say what you wish.

1784
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:44,800
And that's one thing that I,

1785
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,619
I suppose I can take out of my career is that I've never let anyone affect me of

1786
00:48:50,619 --> 00:48:51,880
what they've ever said.

1787
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:52,420
It's just,

1788
00:48:53,739 --> 00:48:54,820
doesn't really bother me.

1789
00:48:55,539 --> 00:48:56,960
And that is a great superpower,

1790
00:48:57,219 --> 00:48:57,380
Harry,

1791
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,059
in this world now where critics are everywhere and more than ever,

1792
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:01,739
you know,

1793
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:05,099
athletes can get direct contact through social media.

1794
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:09,780
And I'm not surprised in that in you that your own standards are so high that

1795
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,219
really,

1796
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,599
why would you worry about someone that doesn't know you?

1797
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:13,679
It's easy to say,

1798
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:15,380
not many people can actually,

1799
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:17,300
can actually do it the way that you have.

1800
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,559
It is a bit of a superpower in the interest of collaboration,

1801
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,340
which is another thing we're passionate about.

1802
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,340
I can hear the ambition,

1803
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:24,440
Harry and you,

1804
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,519
and you're going to back yourself in,

1805
00:49:25,539 --> 00:49:27,739
and have a crack on this path.

1806
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,119
Is there anyone you thought,

1807
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:29,400
God,

1808
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:29,860
that's the,

1809
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,739
that's the person I'd love to collaborate with.

1810
00:49:32,739 --> 00:49:34,019
And that's the person that,

1811
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:34,380
you know,

1812
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,599
in any area of your life,

1813
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,780
is there a name that springs to mind on that front?

1814
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:39,800
Look,

1815
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,099
if,

1816
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,340
if I had the chance to work with someone,

1817
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:43,599
especially in the,

1818
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:44,639
in the football industry,

1819
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,659
and I,

1820
00:49:46,739 --> 00:49:46,900
and,

1821
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,280
and I go back to my playing days,

1822
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,280
it'd probably be like Frank Reichardt,

1823
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:55,519
because I love my time when he was out there with Galatina,

1824
00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:55,940
Tassarai.

1825
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,559
I thought the way that he saw football,

1826
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,440
and again,

1827
00:49:59,699 --> 00:50:04,960
he's probably the only one that's really challenged my kind of vision,

1828
00:50:05,139 --> 00:50:05,820
because I,

1829
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,400
I thought I could see a lot of things in football,

1830
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:11,260
but he kind of just zoomed it out that little bit more.

1831
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,599
So if,

1832
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:16,219
if I had an opportunity to kind of hook up with him and,

1833
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,519
and learn from him,

1834
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:20,360
that would be something that I would definitely jump at.

1835
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,840
And I would love to hear all about that.

1836
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,199
The great Frank Reichardt and,

1837
00:50:24,219 --> 00:50:25,079
and Harry Kuehl,

1838
00:50:25,179 --> 00:50:25,320
Harry,

1839
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,980
it's been a pleasure and a privilege to sit down and,

1840
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,000
and hear your thoughts,

1841
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:30,019
hear you going so well.

1842
00:50:30,139 --> 00:50:32,960
I love what you're doing on the home front as much as anything,

1843
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:33,420
mate,

1844
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:33,719
as a,

1845
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:34,940
as a father of four.

1846
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,179
I'm,

1847
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,579
I'm going to lift my game myself on the back of what you said today,

1848
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:41,980
but always admire you,

1849
00:50:42,099 --> 00:50:43,460
admire what you've done to put,

1850
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:44,300
you know,

1851
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,420
the round ball game on the map here in Australia and wish you all the best

1852
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:47,880
for the future.

1853
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,840
Thanks for taking time.

1854
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,880
And also really appreciate you being part of our Leader Connect program.

1855

It's been,

1856
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,920
been great to connect with you on that front.

1857
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,039
Thank you,

1858
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:55,219
Luke.

1859
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,099
And thanks for having me on,

1860
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:56,260
mate.
