00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:07,120
Brilliant to have Craig McRae as this week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast,

2
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:13,519
the Collingwood Premiership winning 2023 coach and one of the great AFL Grand Finals.

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,820
We cover a lot of ground in this conversation, how his ability to live in the moment helped

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:25,019
him enjoy the birth of his daughter at 7.45am on Grand Final day without panic, despite

5
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,539
accidentally packing two right shoes in his rush to get to the hospital.

6
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:35,140
The story of how his team has lived family first, from inviting the players' mums into

7
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,759
the rooms on Mother's Day for the pre-game address, to using the players' kids as water

8
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,219
carriers in the school holidays, he has genuinely created a family first environment.

9
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:50,039
His values-based leadership style that makes it really easy for him to support Jordan Ngoi

10
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,479
or Jack Ginneman or any of his players for that matter when they hit a hurdle.

11
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,960
He also talks about his enjoyment of his Alita Connect collaboration.

12
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:06,920
Every month he sits down via Zoom with legendary coaches, Mike Dunlap from the NBA, Anthony

13
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,879
Seabolt, a legendary coach in NRL, Johnny Elowisi, an Australian soccer legend, and

14
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,200
Andrew McDonald, the current coach of the Australian cricket team, and why that collaborative

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,099
leadership approach and learning from other coaches is incredibly valuable for Craig and

16
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:24,420
what he does as one of the great leaders in modern sport.

17
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,400
It's people like Craig McRae who inspire the work we do at Alita and our signature Alita

18
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,659
Connect collaborative program.

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,599
Love you to check it out.

20
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,359
We bring together bespoke groups of five or six leaders from non-competing spaces to learn,

21
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,280
to lead, and collaborate.

22
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:41,359
And as you'll hear from Craig McRae in this conversation, it's something that he really

23
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,060
values, someone who's constant and curious and never-ending self-improver like Craig

24
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,379
McRae.

25
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:49,560
You don't have to be the Collingwood Premiership coach to be involved.

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,420
We love collaborating with people from art, from industry, from social venture.

27

Great prize.

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,520
Very soon.

53
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:06,159
Craig McRae was drafted from Glenelg in South Australia.

54
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,139
He picked 22 in the 1994 national draft to the Brisbane Lions and would go on to play

55
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:19,919
195 games, kick 232 goals, winning three consecutive premierships, 2001, 2002, and 2003, and what

56
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,340
many believe to be one of the greatest teams in VFL, AFL history.

57
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,780
A teacher by trade, four years primary teaching experience, Flyer, as he's universally known,

58
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,419
embarked on an 18-year coaching apprenticeship before being appointed as the head coach of

59
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:38,919
the Collingwood Football Club before the start of the 2022 season.

60
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,939
He was awarded the AFL Coaches Association Coach of the Year in his first season, falling

61
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:47,360
one point short of making the grand final in that first year.

62
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,900
On the 30th of September, 2023, Craig McRae coached Collingwood to an incredible four-point

63
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,159
win over the team he played for, the Brisbane Lions, delivering the Magpies its 16th premiership

64
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,360
and first since 2010.

65
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,719
Fly.

66
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,139
Fly.

67
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:00,460
Fly.

68
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:00,479
Fly.

69
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:00,539
Fly.

70
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:00,599
Fly.

71
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:00,620
Fly.

72
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:00,719
Fly.

73
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,819
Thanks for taking the time.

74
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,639
Yeah, thanks to us.

75
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,300
Good to be here.

76
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:04,780
Big smile on your face.

77
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:05,460
Still, can I start?

78
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:05,960
It's still fresh.

79
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,680
The paint's still wet.

80
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,819
It's joyful being in your presence.

81
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,419
Can I just start with the nickname?

82
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,580
Where did Fly come from and what's the backstory on that?

83
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,439
Yeah, it's something I've been trying to shake for 30-odd years now.

84
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,360
When I grew up in Adelaide, I was playing at Glenelg.

85
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,779
Choco Williams coached me as a young fella down at Glenelg and he took us to the movies

86
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:28,819
one day for a bit of a bonding session and it was Back to the Future.

87
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:29,560
It had just come out.

88
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,620
I think it was.

89
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,779
It was George or Marty McFly.

90
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:36,420
I had a similar haircut and looked very much like him so the boys started calling me McFly

91
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,339
and I couldn't shake it.

92
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,040
Then over the time, it's just sort of dropped the Mac and become Fly and I must admit I've

93
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,420
gone 25, 30 years now and I tried to reclaim Craig for a while but even that's not a great

94
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,459
name so I've just, something that's stuck by me.

95
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:54,779
And as you know in footy clubs, the harder you try, the more things stick.

96
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:58,740
A lot of people won't remember Back to the Future, a cult film back in that era and it

97
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,959
really took over the world.

98
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:03,699
Marty McFly, so Fly's it for, and it came to Brisbane with you.

99
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,060
Yeah, it came there and even my younger daughter calls me Fly sometimes.

100
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:11,720
It's evolved in different, you have to fly bags, a few other things.

101
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:16,459
Mick Malthouse named me Fly Bags once and so it's evolved but I'd, yeah, anyway, here

102
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:16,720
we are.

103
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,120
We're fresh from grand final day.

104
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,040
Your wife, Gabrielle, was due on that day and you knew weeks out there was a possibility.

105
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:28,379
Incredibly, 7.45am on what's one of the biggest days of your life.

106
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:28,600
Yeah.

107
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:29,439
Yeah.

108
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:29,500
Yeah.

109
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:29,560
Yeah.

110
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:29,579
Yeah.

111
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:29,639
Yeah.

112
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:29,660
Yeah.

113
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:29,720
Yeah.

114
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:29,779
Yeah.

115
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,120
Maggie is born.

116
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,319
The heart must have been pumping that morning.

117
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,920
Can you tell us how it all unfolded?

118
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:39,040
Well, you know, when we were lucky enough to find out that we're having a child and,

119
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,500
you know, it's joyful and it's exciting and then they tell us the due date and I was sort

120
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,959
of just flicking through my phone and going, hang on a minute, that 30th of September,

121
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,139
that's grand final day and then we sort of laughed and didn't think much of it and then

122
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:56,800
as the year goes on, we're going, well, there's a fair bit that has to, you know, align here

123
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,540
for this to happen.

124
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,660
You know, baby being born on the due date.

125
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,300
But also us making the grand final.

126
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:03,420
And I said, oh, I just kept putting it off.

127
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:04,300
Let's not worry about it.

128
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:05,399
You know, let's qualify first.

129
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,139
You know, then we qualify finals and don't worry about it.

130
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:09,720
We're going to make a prelim before we even worry about that.

131
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:15,100
And before we know it, here we are, you know, a week out, made a grand final and my wife's

132
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,759
about to be 40 weeks pregnant on the day.

133
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,519
And, um, but even still the obstetrician was saying it's probably going to be a week late,

134
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,439
maybe a little bit more.

135
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,620
So in my mind, no problem at all.

136
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,379
We'll go and do the grand final and worry about it when we have to.

137
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:29,540
Little did I know.

138
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,319
That she sort of started to go and labor on the parade.

139
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,079
She was in the, in the car in front of us or in, in, in the car that was at the back and,

140
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,620
um, went into labor, but kept it to herself.

141
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,839
My wife's pretty amazing, but this is next level because her sister was down.

142
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:46,420
They ended up going to the hospital together at midnight.

143
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,600
It was full, full contractions, labor and unbeknownst to you, I had no idea.

144
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,439
I went to bed with our other daughter and, um, had no idea.

145
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,500
And then wake up about quarter to six, her mum's rang and said, uh, you better take this

146
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:58,779
call.

147
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,639
And my wife says, so you better take this call.

148
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,060
You better get it.

149
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:02,040
The baby's going to be born in about half an hour.

150
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,699
And we're Williams down to St. Vincent's.

151
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,199
It was a bit of a drive and I just, in a mad rush, went there.

152
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:13,139
An hour later, the most joyful experience that you ever have has been a father and a

153
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,079
little Maggie was born.

154
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,660
And that leads into this dream of coaching an AFL grand final.

155
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,399
I mean, you're the most relaxed person I think I've seen.

156
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,360
And yeah, the, the smile and the joy was that, did that throw you out at all?

157
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,939
Or were you just like, this is meant to be?

158
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:29,639
No, look, I just know that match day is a big thing.

159
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,540
It's about playing.

160
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,680
Like we set it up like that every week for our players.

161
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,620
It's, you know, match day's the outcome and, and, you know, you've done all the process.

162
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,720
So I knew that everything had been put in place.

163
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,139
There was no disruption to any of that.

164
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,899
I was really well planned for the match day meeting and a bit of fun.

165
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,379
And as I normally do, I had it all set out.

166
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:50,139
But the only thing that sort of threw me is that I, in my madness and the darkness, I've

167
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:52,920
grabbed all my work gear thinking I better go from there to the game because I don't

168
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,839
know how long this is going to take.

169
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:59,620
I grabbed two right shoes in the darkness and I, so it wasn't.

170
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,579
Until about half past 11, I think I better get ready for this game here.

171
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,120
We got to, we got to get to the ground.

172
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,939
And I've gone to put my shoes on and I'm going, oh no.

173
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,500
So then, then straight away I've had to go into autopilot.

174
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,160
You know, as your coach, you just look for solutions, not about the problem.

175
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,639
And worked away trying to work through that.

176
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,759
But I end up running to pick up some shoes on the way.

177
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:18,959
And yeah, I don't know.

178
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,800
It's just, it's the joy in the, in the moment of having a child.

179
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:23,060
It's, it's so special.

180
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,480
And then to actually then be able to put that into place and then go to work.

181
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,500
Yeah, I just, is, is always just find a way.

182
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,000
Come back to the, to the day a little bit later.

183
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,960
But for me, you've brought this great joy to the sport that we love and the smile and

184
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,559
the charm and the, and the good humor that you've had since you've been in the main chair.

185
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:46,960
Can you take us inside, understand pre-game that every time we see vision of the rooms

186
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,779
inside, the players are pissing themselves laughing, you're laughing.

187
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:54,600
Can you share with us some of the ways that you've approached that and why you chose that

188
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:54,960
path?

189
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,620
Oh, I think my personality is cheeky.

190
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,259
I like to be cheeky, but respectful.

191
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:03,379
And, you know, I don't like to be disrespectful, opposition or, you know, whatever it looks

192
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:03,940
like, people.

193
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,659
But I like being cheeky.

194
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,440
I like having a laugh.

195
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,879
And I think, you know, life, life is too short not to.

196
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,139
So my personality does come out in my coaching, but particularly match day, this group have

197
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:16,100
sort of taught me what they need.

198
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,600
You know, like you sort of inherit a group and you wonder what, what gets the best out

199
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:19,779
of them.

200
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,320
And in the early days when I was presenting for a game, I went a little bit light.

201
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,200
I told a story about, you know, I was trying to sell my car and whatever, and a few funny

202
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,799
bits about it.

203
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,860
And, and it got this relaxed nature.

204
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:33,940
The week before I sensed a tension in the group and whether it was a performance anxiety,

205
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,019
I'm not sure, but you sort of work out what your group needs.

206
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,200
So it started to evolve from that.

207
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:41,340
And then, you know, last year in particular, we just took it on different journeys and

208
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,720
find different ways to get a laugh, to, to relax the room and allow, allow the oxygen

209
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,740
to breathe in the brain to then let some stuff go.

210
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:54,980
So there was an evolution of it, but it become a, you know, important part of match day routine

211
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,279
was relaxed into, into, you know, mindset.

212
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,240
You know, where do we need to go?

213
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Where do we need to go into performance?

214
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,419
And then, yeah, nothing's changed in that time.

215
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,840
It's just, you know, whether it's a video or, um, do you want me to go running on the

216
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,759
ground and, and mirroring that to a, um, a Forrest Gump movie, like I just said, that

217
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:10,820
was match day grand final.

218
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,960
That was grand final day.

219
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:12,320
Yeah.

220
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:12,639
Yeah.

221
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,860
I don't know if you remember the prelim, he's on the bench, he runs on and he's got

222
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,820
high knees and he runs, just seems like went forever and running.

223
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,279
So I put that into like, and one day I started running and, and then he's just looking for

224
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,240
little angles to, to have fun, but ultimately you can't have fun unless you've done the

225
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,519
work and this group.

226
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,879
It's one of the best I've ever seen at preparing, training standards, you know, preparing to

227
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,600
play, trying to get better every day.

228
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,879
So then you rock into match day and you know, you've done the work and it's hard to be

229
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,139
relaxed if you haven't.

230
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:43,360
Is there a famous one from the prelim final of the year before?

231
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,320
Am I told that, uh, there might've been a whole heap of confetti emerge out of your

232
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,700
rooms?

233
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:50,700
Yeah, that was, that was probably a couple of weeks before then.

234
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:52,179
It might've been a qualifying final.

235
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:52,700
Yeah.

236
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,279
We celebrated Darcy Cameron's 40th game one week, which no one's ever done in the history

237
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,299
game, but we decided to.

238
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:01,139
And, uh, he's a pretty soft target, Darcy.

239
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:06,759
He's, he's easy to find a laugh for, um, for, um, but we had Gil McLaughlin send a video

240
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:09,860
message in about, you know, how important it is to play 40 games.

241
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:14,919
And, and, uh, and then I think we got a message from Warwick Capper too, because Darcy Cameron

242
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:19,100
played one game for Sydney and, you know, how, how he was a legend and Darcy's not.

243
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,559
You know, Fraser Gerrick, cause he called himself the G train, Fraser Gerrick did a

244
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,220
video message about imitating him and things.

245
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,279
So that it just grows, you know, the length you go to, to do it.

246
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,960
But sometimes it's, it's right in front of your face.

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,639
Other times you have to search for it, but again, allowing the players to be relaxed

248
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,220
to perform is something that was important for this group.

249
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,539
And speaking of which, and I've said this to you before, my favorite moment for the

250
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:46,700
year happened on Anzac day with your team and sitting there lucky enough to been the

251
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,080
best seat in the house calling the game.

252
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,700
Brayden Maynard kicks out from fullback and literally misses the ball.

253
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,179
It rolls off his shin, rolls into his opponent's lap.

254
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,240
He kicks it straight over his head and kicks.

255
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,980
He got, you can't have a bigger clinger in sport than that.

256
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,279
Anzac day is a hundred thousand.

257
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,240
One of the most significant days outside of grand final day.

258
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,779
And they panned to the bench and there's you pissing yourself laughing.

259
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,600
And I couldn't help the joy that gave me, because I know in the past we just played

260
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,759
in an era where you might've got dragged.

261
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,299
You definitely would've abused the runner would've come out and, you know, called you

262
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:21,139
everything under the sun.

263
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:25,500
And, and we all knew how unhelpful that was, but how have you been able to train

264
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,600
the players to just relax in that moment?

265
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,159
Oh, it's been.

266
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,700
Consistent messaging around, you know, whether it's a windscreen wiper analogy

267
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,100
that, you know, make a mistake, wash it away and have clarity.

268
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,759
The ability to move on from things is, is critical.

269
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,399
I remember when we've started, I'm really big on, you're allowed to make mistakes.

270
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,139
This game is imperfect, make as many as you can or attempt to, cause then you're

271
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,320
gonna actually having a go at it.

272
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,919
But I remember we were making mistakes at training and I'm, I'm watching guys do

273
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,919
this and I miss a kick and they're doing pushups.

274
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,539
I said, what are you doing?

275
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,659
Pushups for go, go get the ball.

276
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,899
And, and they go, oh no, but I made a mistake.

277
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,759
I said, yeah, make a mistake, go fix it.

278
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:02,940
Like we're running around with the biggest arms in, in the competition.

279
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,360
Once they go, what are you doing here?

280
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,299
Like, so, so changing behaviors around stakes is okay, was something

281
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:12,659
that we had to set about and then, and then it just evolves.

282
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,940
And I, I, again, I use that analogy one game.

283
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,659
I think the bigger the games too, sorry, that, that the more you have to get

284
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:23,379
away from yourself and then be able to move things, like you have a set shot.

285
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,340
You gotta be able to go next minute on man in the mark, I'm getting on with it.

286
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,460
Cause that could come back in a hurry and those be able to execute.

287
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:36,600
So, um, windscreen wipers was used, um, 2022 and in a big game too, it might've

288
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,279
been an Anzac day game then it was like, Hey, Hey, we'll make mistakes.

289
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,220
Just quickly move it on.

290
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:40,600
Yeah.

291
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,039
So, and we gotta, we gotta be present.

292
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,519
Stay in the moment, be live here.

293
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:46,620
Cause then you can go and lay good tackle or, you know, win that ball back.

294
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,440
But the, the Anzac day game of this year, the one you're talking about with Braden

295
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:57,100
before the game, I showed a Ted lasso clip of, um, Ted talking about the goldfish, the

296
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,700
happiest animal in the world or something, because it has a 10 second memory.

297
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:06,460
And then the gag to his, to his players was exactly that let some stuff go.

298
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:10,539
So I said today, you know, we need to be goldfish and I had it as a thing.

299
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,080
Always today with goldfish, we let some stuff go cause things won't go away.

300
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:17,559
Umpires decisions, you know, free kicks against whatever it looks like.

301
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,240
Missed goals, kicks it out in the fall.

302
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,659
What we will make some mistakes, but we're gonna be goldfish.

303
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,600
And we laughed at this clip and whatever, and then get to half time.

304
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:26,740
And.

305
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,779
Jamie might've kicked a couple out in the fall of that stage.

306
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:29,539
I made a joke of it.

307
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:32,620
So we talked about before the game, you know, kick it out the fall, Jamie, too

308
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,700
many, mate, too many, and we're laughing at that at half time, but then literally

309
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,059
after, um, half time, Rosie does that kick.

310
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,480
What I mean?

311
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,279
When the first minutes they get kicks at the worst he's ever done.

312
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,559
And I'm on the bench and I looked at the bench and I looked at the players.

313
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:50,539
I said, I suppose it's time to be goldfish boys.

314
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,000
Like it was as bad as you get, isn't it?

315
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,220
Like that's a bigger claim you'll see.

316
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,080
And, but I think that that's giving them.

317
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,600
Permission, permission to fail and permission to have a go.

318
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,139
Um, and I think again, this group's really, really found their place with that.

319
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,360
There's a skill in that though.

320
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:06,639
Fly.

321
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,220
I think that is underestimated.

322
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,100
Is it, and you know, so even at junior sport where you might have the intention

323
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,980
and you say the kids, Hey, we want you to take risks.

324
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,860
And then the coach, when you do goes, oh fuck, you know, and, and puts

325
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,100
his hands on his head and if you do that, you've probably lost it immediately.

326
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,399
Haven't you?

327
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:21,639
Yeah.

328
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:26,320
You're you need that ability to, to be able to keep the calm when it counts.

329
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,980
And I, I think it's, you know, you look at your own self a lot.

330
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,779
I, I, I self reflect more than anything and you know, that's probably a strength

331
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:38,139
of mine to be able to, you know, not worry about the baby until September 30th.

332
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:40,779
Cause I'm just gonna do, you know, to the 29th.

333
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:42,279
Well, you don't worry about that.

334
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:45,039
And so that's probably where I've lived my life a lot.

335
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,519
Um, which helps me sort of, I'm a process driven guy and I, and I keep educating

336
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,399
our group where process driven, not outcome driven.

337
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,840
So we live in the moment of light.

338
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,399
Let's just do, you know, Tuesday.

339
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,419
Well, and then Wednesday will come.

340
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:55,720
So that.

341
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,120
That definitely helps, you know, drive this stuff.

342
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,860
The self-reflection, if I picking up what you said earlier, so I'm cheeky, I'm not

343
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:07,039
disrespectful and you were known as that on the field and in our era, and every time

344
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,559
you looked up, you were sort of the running the mad Mondays that the Brisbane lions, you

345
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,840
know, famously, do you think that was maybe this idea of a coach for, you know, a long

346
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,419
time is the alpha is the coach and you've got a, and we've probably selected that along

347
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:21,059
the way.

348
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:25,399
Do you think that maybe put you into the apprenticeship role for a bit longer?

349
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:25,700
Cause the.

350
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,100
World wasn't ready for that style.

351
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,720
Yeah, potentially.

352
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,720
Yeah, potentially.

353
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,279
But also, um, I think I had a handbrake in myself, um, in, in that I wanted to not be

354
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:35,799
in a hurry.

355
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,539
I wanted to be a coach for, you know, life coach, whatever that meant, you know, tenure,

356
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:43,240
but, um, I was determined to stay in the game for a long time.

357
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,080
So I wasn't in a hurry to be assistant coach and then whatever the pathway was at that

358
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,379
time.

359
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,919
Um, yeah, I think, I think the, the coaching landscapes change a lot.

360
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,679
People change.

361
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:55,720
People want to be more connected, more valued, more appreciated.

362
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:59,799
Potentially, you know, no one wants to be yelled at and told them that are good anymore.

363
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:03,220
That, but that was the style that we inherited and we lived by.

364
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,700
Um, yeah.

365
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,720
So, uh, so yeah, maybe a little bit of a time for myself to find where I needed to go and

366
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,599
grow and learn.

367
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,619
And, but also, yeah, well, the way that young people like to be coached.

368
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,140
Do you remember thinking about it as a player with you, you described wanting a life tenure

369
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:20,720
as a coach.

370
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,119
Do you remember thinking, I'm going to do this really differently when you give me the

371
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,460
chance?

372
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,660
I'd never really had.

373
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:32,099
Ambition to be a senior coach until probably 2019 when Adelaide came rank, uh, they rang

374
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:35,259
about their senior position and, and it caught me by surprise.

375
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:40,440
It just part of Richmond's success and coached a VFL premiership in 2019, literally two days

376
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,960
later, the phone rings and we're really interested.

377
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:45,059
And I wasn't then did I realize how close it was.

378
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:50,220
It wasn't just the right time for a family and, and just didn't feel ready for that.

379
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:55,200
Um, preparation wise to go for the job, but also in life, that was probably a moment where

380
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,700
I'm close.

381
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,900
And if the phone rings again, I'm going to be ready.

382
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:04,380
And I went about for two, three years, putting together a bulletproof presentation, but also

383
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,559
I knew my resume was going to be hard to fault for the next phone call that rang if it did

384
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:08,779
ring.

385
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:12,880
And I understand for a part of that resume, when you presented to Collingwood, I read

386
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,480
recently that you presented it through the eyes of these great mentors of yours and,

387
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,539
and you read the list.

388
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:22,640
It's a sort of roll call of some of the most influential people in the history of the game.

389
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,180
Um, Choco Williams was your coach at Glenelg.

390
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,079
He had a huge impact.

391
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,420
Robert Walls, your first senior coach at Brisbane and, you know, notoriously tough

392
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:30,960
Woolsey.

393
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,759
Mick Muldouse, you went back to Collingwood.

394
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:37,460
Nathan Buckley in your time as an assistant at Collingwood, Damien Harwick at Richmond.

395
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,900
Craig Bellamy, you were the kicking coach at the Melbourne Storm.

396
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,119
Alastair Clarkson from Hawthorne.

397
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:46,859
And then Lee Matthews as the triple premiership coach in that famous Brisbane era.

398
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,319
Can you share with us the importance of that and what, and what you grabbed from them?

399
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,039
Yeah.

400
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:51,339
Yeah.

401
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:55,140
And it, um, you know, that's what I thought that I had to have a bulletproof presentation.

402
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,680
Cause when I'm putting this together for two or three years, I knew the extent of the

403
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,440
people I'd work with and the successes that those people had had.

404
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,720
And, and my, you know, fingerprints somewhat of being involved in those programs, I knew

405
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,859
what it was like to be a winner.

406
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,599
And, um, for those that know me well, I'm, I'm not arrogant, but I know how to win.

407
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,920
And that, and that was, that was the basis of my presentation.

408
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:20,940
I'm a winner and I know how to win and I know the behaves required to win because of all

409
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,019
my experiences.

410
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:24,900
And, and, you know, at the time at the Richmond Footy Club.

411
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,960
Winning three flags in four years, the Storm were doing something similar.

412
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:31,160
And I was at the same, same, um, timeframe.

413
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,240
I was at two different organizations, two different sports, but the same behaves were

414
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,400
there.

415
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,500
The way that the training was unbelievable.

416
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:42,920
And then the connection to the people and, you know, just discipline and leadership.

417
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,519
It was all there.

418
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:48,079
So I'm learning all these lessons and making, making mental notes and also coaching my own

419
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,920
team at the time, trying to connect this stuff.

420
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,039
But ultimately, if you look through all those, those names that I mentioned, I'd learned

421
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,720
something off all of them, if not many off, off some.

422
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,900
And yeah, so I shared the, the one or two things when I, it's just a visual, you picture

423
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,480
a visual of those guys, all the guys on a one page keynote, and I'm just telling the

424
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,339
stories about how they've influenced me to be in this position, to go for this job.

425
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,079
Yeah.

426
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,160
It's a compelling, when you, when you set it out like that, we use a term, a lot of

427
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,660
success leaves clues, isn't there are patterns that you can pick up around successful people

428
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,599
and Craig Bellamy's history is enormous.

429
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,779
You look right through that list.

430
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,059
It's.

431
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:24,500
Yeah.

432
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:24,720
I know.

433
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,019
I know.

434
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,799
All of them had been premiership players.

435
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,500
I'm pretty sure.

436
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,119
I think I was close to it and, and, or, or being attached to.

437
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,299
Success everywhere.

438
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:32,619
Yeah.

439
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:33,119
Yeah.

440
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,099
Every one of them actually.

441
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:34,380
Yeah.

442
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:34,579
Yeah.

443
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:39,779
And that was, that was, you know, lucky enough in my playing career to, to have some great

444
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:42,160
mentors and learnings and yeah.

445
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,299
And then there was the big one in the middle was Lee who, who taught me the most, probably

446
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:50,619
because I was 28 ready for to, you know, on board a lot of stuff.

447
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:52,660
And then we had the success at the end of my career.

448
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,980
I could see where it all fit.

449
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,519
And yeah, amazing day, grand final day, got to spend a bit of time with Lee and just the

450
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:06,039
fingerprints of him from 1990 in Collingwood and describe that as almost, uh, in his unemotional

451
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:10,759
way, Lee is the most profound, uh, victory he had in his eight, uh, premierships and

452
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:13,160
then coach you in that extraordinary era.

453
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:16,119
And you could see it was the proud father, wasn't he?

454
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:18,039
When he put his arm around you, that must've been a beautiful moment.

455
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:18,700
Yeah, it was.

456
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,460
Yeah, it was.

457
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:23,480
And, um, I haven't had a lot to do with Lee in recent time.

458
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,240
Um, and last couple of years, he rings me probably once a year, Texas a couple of other

459
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,559
times.

460
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,019
And, but then I got to share that moment on the ground, but then the next day we hit,

461
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:32,740
we had a reunion.

462
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:37,299
I got to chat to him even more and yeah, I got a photo with Lee and it doesn't make,

463
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,480
doesn't make sense to me.

464
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,319
Like this is like, I'm, I'm Lee's role player.

465
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,220
And now I'm a coach of Collingwood who now we're in the premiership.

466
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:45,640
It's just quite surreal to be honest.

467
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,220
Just jump on that for a moment.

468
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,700
I mean, there's so many great images of grand final day and I want to come back to it again

469
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,339
a little bit more.

470
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:53,039
But was there one moment where.

471
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,980
You gave a hug to one person.

472
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,519
Was it a Lee Matthews or one of the players?

473
00:21:57,619 --> 00:22:00,700
Was there one that you've got an image that you can go to or is it too many?

474
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:01,720
Oh, there's a lot.

475
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,240
And a lot of it was a blur, um, of just emotion and joy.

476
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,960
Uh, you know, Darcy Moore, seeing him embracing in a moment, I'll never forget.

477
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:11,799
Yeah.

478
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,940
Just the staff too, you know, they do all the work and you know, that, that joy to be

479
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,039
able to share that moment and excitement with those.

480
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:22,779
And they're just the surreal nature of, of winning premierships.

481
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:24,700
As a player, it felt the same as a coach.

482
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,940
You just can't believe it's happening.

483
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:28,140
Is this real or what's actually happening here?

484
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,779
And so it's hard to describe it, but to be able to celebrate with people that, you know,

485
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:33,940
have done so much work.

486
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:39,039
And then there's the bootstutter, Neil, who's been there way longer than any of us, you

487
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,200
know, before the game, he's a nervous wreck because you just got to win this one.

488
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,359
And I'm like, Neil, we've got this mate, we're good.

489
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,880
And then to share in his joy afterwards and see what it means to a lot of people.

490
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,759
And that's the staff.

491
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,759
I know, I know, you know, just outside how many people it means to them.

492
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,740
The, the broader Collingwood community.

493
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,480
So I don't lose sight of that.

494
00:22:56,619 --> 00:23:01,759
He walked in here and, uh, Joey is, uh, the great editor of our podcast and he shared

495
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:05,000
it, you know, he's in tears and been in tears many times.

496
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,859
He was quick to show me his tattoo, wasn't he?

497
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:07,200
Yeah.

498
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,119
Mate, I almost had to call security to get him off you there, Fly, for a minute, uh,

499
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:12,359
Joey.

500
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,700
He's never been more excited in his life than saying, can you come and, uh, be here with

501
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,299
Fly today?

502
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:18,420
Can you share the story?

503
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:21,240
Just share with me off air at the same time around picking up your mail.

504
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:21,740
Yeah.

505
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:22,180
Yeah.

506
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:22,740
And that's.

507
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,819
And this is the thing you don't realize.

508
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,299
And that's why I like to go home and have a red wine replay after the games every, every

509
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:32,940
win, because you want to embed yourself in the game and see the people that are coming

510
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,000
along and the emotion attached to it.

511
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:39,119
So yeah, I was just going to the mail to get the mail out on Monday or Tuesday this week

512
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,859
and gentleman's walking his dog.

513
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,200
He's an elderly gentleman.

514
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:47,359
I'd never seen him before, but he's, he must live close and he's, um, got a premiership

515
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:47,720
hat on.

516
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,220
And I just suddenly said, oh mate, I really like your hat.

517
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,400
And he stopped and paused and looked at me.

518
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,420
And then he just started crying.

519
00:23:54,259 --> 00:23:56,420
And I'm trying to make conversation with this man.

520
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,440
This is a bumbling mess, but he's, he's, you know, he just said, um, weeping.

521
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:04,039
He goes, mate, you don't realize how much this means to all of us.

522
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:09,799
And I, and you do, but you don't like, how could I possibly know, you know, the, the

523
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:13,220
column with supporters and what they've been through or the family connected, the ones

524
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,519
that missed out on it, that, you know, didn't quite get there.

525
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,980
Whatever it looks like that everyone's got a story to be told about it, but, but I don't

526
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,279
lose sight of how important this is.

527
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,000
For so many people.

528
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,799
It's the joyful part of sport, isn't it?

529
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:29,480
I, you know, can't imagine it's easily replicated in other areas of your life, isn't it?

530
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,160
Where people genuinely describe that day as the best day of their life.

531
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,759
As Joey did.

532
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,759
Joey just did before.

533
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,680
He's nodding furiously out there.

534
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,859
And, and I didn't have, uh, the, uh, the fortune or skill you might argue to, to win one as

535
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:43,500
a player fly.

536
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:48,220
But when our team won one after such a long time in 2016 as the Bulldogs, that is one

537
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,240
of the best nights of my life.

538
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:50,279
Arguably the greatest.

539
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:50,799
All that.

540
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,079
I felt like all of.

541
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,140
The, um, the skeletons and the frustrations were buried for all of us that did it.

542
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,259
And we're this great catch up with all the players from our era.

543
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,240
And I can, I still smile when I think about, you know, being lucky enough to stand on the

544
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,160
MCG that day.

545
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,160
It's, it's unique, isn't it?

546
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:07,740
It is.

547
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,160
And then, you know, I, I didn't realize the scar tissue attached to so many Collingwood

548
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,500
losses.

549
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,720
I was very much aware of the, uh, the narrative around Collingwood making grand finals and

550
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,200
not winning them and losing close ones.

551
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,339
But I, I didn't realize until grand final week.

552
00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:22,339
How much people.

553
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,380
Well, people are still carrying all those scar tissues or stories from the Renee Kinks

554
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,839
losing seven grand finals.

555
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:30,680
And there, there, there's a lot of them.

556
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,920
Um, Darcy Moore, um, Peter Moore's lost five grand finals.

557
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,220
And so there's a lot of stories to be told.

558
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:43,680
And when we get the success we had, the joy, um, associated with that, but also allowing

559
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,579
some cleansing and some healing.

560
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,099
Um, yeah, there's a lot of that too.

561
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:50,200
So, you know, there's two sides of the story.

562
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,059
Obviously, obviously every, every grand final.

563
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:57,220
I'll be told, but yeah, this club has got an incredible history, you know, only 16 victories

564
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,220
since 1892.

565
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,220
That's yeah.

566
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,220
It shows how hard they had to win.

567
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,380
And I think the stat from grand final days, 1967 and Collingwood had played in something

568
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,880
like 16 grand finals and only won two of them.

569
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,240
So that is a lot of scar tissue, isn't it?

570
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,960
Over a long period of time.

571
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
Yeah.

572
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,960
Yeah.

573
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,920
And again, hopefully this, this performance from our playing group in the club allows

574
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,240
people to cleanse and heal and, and, but also creates a whole new journey of supportive

575
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,559
base and, and joy.

576
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:26,099
Well, as you know, to, to be a professional at any sport, almost particularly a collision

577
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:30,380
sport like AFL, you're inherently a risk taker and you're going to make mistakes.

578
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:35,019
You can't turn that off the second you get off the field and every club, every player

579
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:36,759
mate, we all made them.

580
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:38,799
You deal with that in a, in another unique way.

581
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,880
I, you know, saw the way that the whole world coming after one of your star players, Jordan

582
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,099
Ngoi over the journey that you've been coach and wanting blood from him and ban him for

583
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:48,099
whatever reason.

584
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:50,720
Um, and I think your line was, you know, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was,

585
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,039
you know what, I just want to put my arms around and give them a hug.

586
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,039
Yeah.

587
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,039
Talk us through that approach.

588
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:59,400
Oh, well, I'm, I'm a values based leader that I think that's probably the best way to describe

589
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,680
the way I go about it and, um, yeah, around love and support and yeah, George is a unique

590
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:10,920
one in terms of, um, yeah, the attention he gets for, for, for past errors, if you like.

591
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,900
And, um, yeah, I was only new to building a relationship with him and I've, I've openly

592
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,920
shared and you've probably heard this before that I, I don't have any sons, but I like

593
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,920
to treat them like mine.

594
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,519
And.

595
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:23,519
But you don't always agree with what you, you know, I've got daughters, but they don't

596
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:24,920
always agree with the things they do.

597
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,960
They make mistakes, they, you know, stuff up or whatever, and, but you're still ultimately

598
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,779
in there that they love them and, and you're gonna be there for them.

599
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:35,079
So errors can be made, but you know, how do you react to that?

600
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:39,839
You know, you know, and my style is, is, is values based, as I said, so I, I wanted to

601
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:42,900
wrap my arms around Jordan and say, okay, yeah, I don't agree with what you've done

602
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,680
here or, or you do agree, whatever, whatever happens.

603
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,680
Yeah.

604
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,180
And then you go, well, what are we gonna do about it?

605
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,180
Come on.

606
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,180
I wanna, I wanna help you get through this.

607
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:54,420
And, and so maybe that's something that Geordie hasn't received previously.

608
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:58,319
I'm not sure you have asked him, you know, to be there for him and, and, and being able

609
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,059
to be in the same room was something that straight away came to mind.

610
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:06,700
Fascinating in real time though, uh, flying, you've, you, you've talking about this story,

611
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,319
but it, you know, it's grandfather day, you got a bit going on, got a baby being born,

612
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,319
you called in, you got two right shoes in your bag, so you got, you got some solutions

613
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,319
to.

614
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,319
I was a left footer too.

615
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,319
Right ones are no good to me.

616
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:20,119
And word comes through.

617
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:23,400
One of your players is going to the races on a, on a, on the night before the grand

618
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,619
final, Jack, you know, and how do you process that?

619
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:30,880
Is there a, hey, I'm wrapped my arms around him or is there a bit of, oh shit, not today,

620
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
mate?

621
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,880
Yeah, there's a, there's all, all that.

622
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,019
And, uh, there's certain things I just can't control.

623
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:36,019
Does it affect us now?

624
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:37,019
No.

625
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:39,460
Let's give that some thought when I need to, but I don't need to worry about it now.

626
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,460
Yeah.

627
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,460
So I'd be able to put things where they need to be.

628
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,940
You know, I, I might probably say that I'm, I'm on the fence, whether that's the right

629
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,940
thing to do.

630
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,259
I, I'm probably erring in time to think it was a poor decision to be made.

631
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:53,940
Um, you know, hence why I said read the room, Jack, in that situation, but it's, look, I,

632
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,500
I'm, I'm about accountability and I'm about rewarding behavior.

633
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,519
Um, they're, they're things that I'm really big on and I won't walk through our hallways

634
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:05,740
and see something that I like without calling it out.

635
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,920
I want to allow somebody in our environment that does something that makes us better and

636
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,500
not make sure that everyone appreciates that.

637
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,500
Yeah.

638
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,539
Um, and so a lot of things get done that people don't see.

639
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:19,240
So I'd make sure they, they know who did that, who puts the signs up in the, in the, in the

640
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,559
rooms before the game.

641
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,740
We just walk in and assume it's just some magic, click a finger gets done.

642
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:27,240
I want to make sure we realize how many people do that, who, who packs up afterwards.

643
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,960
You know, we, we appreciate little, little, little things.

644
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,240
And so some of that is reward.

645
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,420
And then the other part of this is about creating a culture where you go, well, we're winners.

646
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,420
And I walked into this club and the first thing he said, oh yeah, I'm a winner.

647
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,000
And I want to have winners and we're going to be winners.

648
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,740
Winners only if you step in here, that can correlate in so many different angles.

649
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,920
You know, are you a winner as a parent?

650
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
Are you a winner as a dad?

651
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,519
Are you a winner in the way you open the door for, for someone in our environment or,

652
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,240
you know, put your plate back on after you had lunch and don't just assume someone's

653
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
going to clean it up.

654
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,240
They're all winning behaviors.

655
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,240
Yeah.

656
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,240
Um, it varies.

657
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,099
So for me going to the races before the game, um, grand final day, that for me, that's not

658
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:06,099
being a winner.

659
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:07,640
So that's where I put that.

660
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,420
And then you work around trying to educate or encourage or, or discourage behavior.

661
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,420
Yeah.

662
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,339
It's, uh, it sounds simple, but it's, it's profound.

663
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:18,039
I think you, you touched on something there I think is really worth sharing is I think

664
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:18,900
we miss the obvious.

665
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,880
A lot, which is that opportunity to say to someone, Hey, love what you're doing.

666
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
It's fantastic.

667
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,920
In all of our organizations, the free hit is there.

668
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,759
And particularly in Australia, you never see people more uncomfortable than someone telling

669
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:32,339
them how well they're doing.

670
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:33,900
We find that really hard here in this country.

671
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,900
Don't we?

672
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,700
Yeah, it is hard to, hard to receive good feedback.

673
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,400
And I'm the same, I've learned over time that it's actually okay to be told you're doing

674
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
something well.

675
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,140
But I, I think ultimately we like to feel valued and appreciated.

676
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,799
There is the five languages of love.

677
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:46,900
I'm not sure if you're familiar with it.

678
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,900
Yeah.

679
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,900
Yeah.

680
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,900
Yeah.

681
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,900
Yeah.

682
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,900
A lot of people like to be told they're doing well.

683
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,640
They probably don't want to say it out loud, but a little pat on the back, say, man, I

684
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,259
really appreciate you doing that for us, but we, we, our culture, we, we, once a week we

685
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:02,599
get together to finish the week and we call it side by side and, and, and, and it's not

686
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:07,140
every week, but most weeks it is this, that we just take a couple of minutes to say, okay,

687
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,900
all right, I want a player to chat to the place person next to you.

688
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,839
I want you to look around the room and everyone's in the room, players and stuff when you look

689
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,880
around the room and I want you to, um, give a shout out to someone that you really appreciate

690
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
that you've done.

691
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,099
I've done something for you in the last couple of weeks.

692
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:24,839
And then the staff look back at the players and still apply that you really appreciate

693
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,720
something they're doing, whatever.

694
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,000
And it might only take five minutes in your environment, but it creates this pattern of

695
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,259
behavior that it's actually okay to be told you're doing something well.

696
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:36,180
And I'm going to look you in the eye, Darson, and tell you, I really appreciate that.

697
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:41,140
So there's, it becomes comfortable because it can be uncomfortable to receive, you know,

698
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,839
this somewhat positive feedback with, um, that, oh, I don't know.

699
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:45,839
I don't need that.

700
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:46,839
I'm bulletproof, whatever.

701
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:47,900
As long as not we're polishing up stuff.

702
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,900
Yeah.

703
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,900
Stuff that's not real.

704
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,900
Yeah.

705
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,900
Yeah.

706
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,900
Cause that's the difference.

707
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,900
If you fluff up stuff, that's not real.

708
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,900
Then people see through that straight away.

709
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,900
Yeah.

710
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,900
Um, but when you're genuine and authentic, I think people can buy into that.

711
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,900
Yeah.

712
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,019
We do that in our, in our leadership business, in the team meeting.

713
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:03,019
Start every meeting.

714
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:04,019
What have you got to celebrate?

715
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:05,019
What have you got to bring?

716
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:09,380
And it becomes, uh, and it's only five minutes, but you know, you've got to bring something

717
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,900
positive to the table and it's a small bit of time, but it can be pretty profound.

718
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,900
It is.

719
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,900
Yeah.

720
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,900
And I know my daughter and I, and my wife, we sit around the dinner table every night

721
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,900
and we just make sure we say what we're grateful for.

722
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,900
Yeah.

723
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,480
Cause it, it, it makes you appreciate what you've got cause yeah, this is a crazy world

724
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,480
we're living in it.

725
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,480
So.

726
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,480
Yeah.

727
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,740
And I love the opportunity to share great leadership stories and I appreciate you doing

728
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:35,619
it today because your empathy and your care and your authenticity, you know, really, uh,

729
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:40,779
comes out in everything that you do, but we know in a lot of environments that old style

730
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:44,200
of leadership is still there and you've got the boss who's got the hierarchy and it's

731
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,400
command and control and it's still that I'm going to yell at you to do what I need you

732
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
to do.

733
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,019
What would you say to people listening that, uh, maybe, um, you know, in that sort of position

734
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:57,579
of power or what does good leadership look like to you?

735
00:32:57,579 --> 00:33:04,099
Uh, I, I think, um, yeah, is it essential or, or, or, uh, a given, I, I don't know,

736
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:08,099
but I, I live in an open-minded mindset, so I'm open-minded to things.

737
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:09,099
You come up with an idea.

738
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:10,099
I'm open-minded.

739
00:33:10,099 --> 00:33:11,099
Where's that fit?

740
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:12,099
Let's see if that can make us better.

741
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:14,099
Um, I'm, I'm not, I'm not perfect.

742
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:16,980
No way in hell would I consider myself to be perfect.

743
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,980
So I'm open to.

744
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,680
I'm open to criticism or, you know, yeah, this is not good enough.

745
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
Yeah, I get that, mate.

746
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,160
Oh, I remember, I remember going to a board meeting.

747
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,519
We lost three games in a row and there was a, a conversation around this, this better

748
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,519
not continue.

749
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:29,519
This is not good enough.

750
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,220
And I, I, I, I can't control what others say, but I say, hey, let's come back.

751
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,220
I'm a process guy.

752
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,220
I'm going to show you how we're going to fix this.

753
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,220
Yeah.

754
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,640
So, yeah, but there's, you know, taking people on the journey, building relationships, Jeff

755
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,779
Brown and I, I would ring Jeff Brown every Thursday after match committee and just tell

756
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:46,220
him what we're doing with the team and why.

757
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,220
And I heard Lee did this.

758
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:47,819
It's a, it's a.

759
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:47,940
Yeah.

760
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,519
He was a coach to, um, you know, when he was at Collingwood and I thought that's a

761
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,519
great idea.

762
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:53,519
I don't really know Jeff Brown.

763
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,519
No idea.

764
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:55,519
Had hardly met him.

765
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,640
Um, and so I thought, well, this is a chance to build a relationship.

766
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,640
He'll get to know my style.

767
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,240
I'll get to know his, and then we can work together and, and, and build trust because

768
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,480
that's ultimately once you've got a relationship, you can yell at me as much as you like, Jeff.

769
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,219
You know, sometimes I might laugh at it because we've got such a relationship.

770
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,219
Oh, whatever, Jeff.

771
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,219
Yeah.

772
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,219
We've got this.

773
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,219
Or other times you go, no, no, you're right, mate.

774
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,219
That's, that's well grounded.

775
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,219
Yeah.

776
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,820
But without a relationship, it's, it's difficult.

777
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,579
It's difficult to get that feedback and like, without getting your front up.

778
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:25,699
So ultimately, you know, how you connect with people is, and build a relationship is, is

779
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:26,699
critical.

780
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,699
Isn't it?

781
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,699
Yeah.

782
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,699
Jeff Brown, the, the president of, of your club.

783
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:30,699
It's a really smart thing, isn't it?

784
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:31,980
We ask you about communication a while, isn't it?

785
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,000
But that just five minutes of your week can save a lot of, uh, a lot of pain, uh, in the

786
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
future.

787
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,199
Fly, we're really privileged to, uh, have you part of our Leader Connect program and

788
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,860
where we bring together leaders from different non-competing backgrounds in a diverse range

789
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,780
of areas.

790
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,699
That's a really, uh, fascinating group.

791
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:53,219
I know they're private conversations, but I love hearing the stories.

792
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:58,179
Um, Mike Dunlap is with you, who was, uh, NBA coach, uh, with Michael Jordan's team

793
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,179
of Charlotte Hornets.

794
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:02,260
So Mike had the privilege of chatting to him on this podcast.

795
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,260
He was a reason.

796
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,260
He's a star, Mike.

797
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,260
He's an incredible person.

798
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,260
Isn't he?

799
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,260
He's, he's, he's just fascinated by all the stories he tells.

800
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,860
I just sit there and just want to listen to him.

801
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,739
Full of wisdom, isn't he, ah, Mike?

802
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:14,659
And recently at the Milwaukee Bucks when they run, Johnny Eliwissi, he's Australian soccer

803
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:15,659
legend.

804
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:17,659
Anthony Seabold, head coach, currently at the Manly.

805
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:20,539
There goes Anthony McDonald, the Australian cricket coach.

806
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:23,719
Can you tell us about this experience and what it's meant to you?

807
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,699
Oh, you know, I've just started out my journey as a senior coach

808
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:28,920
and then walk in and they got Andrew McDonald,

809
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,179
then he becomes the Australian cricket coach

810
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:35,420
and Seabes was over with the UK Rugby Union

811
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,440
and then obviously now is back with Manly

812
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,480
and they got John and Alyssa.

813
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:41,519
They won the flag that year.

814
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:44,460
They won the premiership the first year we did it

815
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,300
and Mike was with the Milwaukee.

816
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,599
They were in the NBA playoffs, they won it.

817
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,440
They won it in 2021.

818
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:51,199
Yeah, so they might have just won it and then come in.

819
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,780
So there was all this success around there too.

820
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,500
So you're listening to stories and like you said,

821
00:35:55,539 --> 00:35:58,780
the fingerprints and the breadcrumbs of what makes success

822
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:04,699
and I constantly get something out of these Zoom calls and catch-ups

823
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:07,539
and there's so many subtle little things from, you know,

824
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:09,280
how we picked our leadership team this year.

825
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,539
We had to evolve our leadership team

826
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:12,719
and I asked a question just before Christmas,

827
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,239
any experiences from the group?

828
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,179
Andrew McDonald shared the story around

829
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:17,739
how they went from, you know,

830
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,579
their new captain in the Test of Mondays

831
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:22,280
and in Cummings and the process of that

832
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,239
and the regrets he had and didn't do

833
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:26,679
and so I thought, okay, I'm going to take him on a journey.

834
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,380
So I set about doing it exactly what Andrew didn't do, you know,

835
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,960
because he said that I would do this differently

836
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,440
and all those things,

837
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:36,360
these little things that you're getting out consistently

838
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,820
and because we're all living the same stuff, aren't we?

839
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,699
But it's just, you know, a different code

840
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,460
or a different environment, but I've got a lot of it.

841
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:44,420
Matt,

842
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:48,179
founded a leader and a great friend of mine

843
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:50,820
and said he was just blown away

844
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,079
by one of the first meetings and getting that group together.

845
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,739
You can imagine everyone's on different time zones

846
00:36:54,739 --> 00:36:55,760
and there's a fair bit of skill

847
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,960
in bringing together that group of busy people

848
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,239
and it coincided with a training session

849
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:03,980
and you, you know, new coach,

850
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,260
happy to leave the track

851
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,199
and spend some time on your own personal development.

852
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,159
A lot of coaches wouldn't be comfortable

853
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,239
in their own skin to do that,

854
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,340
but you could do that, you know,

855
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,980
in one of your first experiences.

856
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,159
How did you come to that?

857
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:17,980
Yeah, it's always difficult

858
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,320
because you especially knew I was trying to drive the bus

859
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,760
and say, no, this is where we're going

860
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,860
and then be prepared to then sit at the back

861
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,440
because the bus is going pretty good.

862
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:30,380
And so I did challenge my thought process around it,

863
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,280
but if I'm just going to say to our group

864
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,980
consistently, nearly daily,

865
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,719
hey boys, we're getting better every day.

866
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,760
Yeah, today's another, no exception.

867
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,340
We're getting better.

868
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:39,300
Make yourself better.

869
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,699
Train this, whatever it looks like.

870
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,000
And I'm not role modeling that.

871
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,139
Well, then I'm, you know, my word's not nowhere near.

872
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:46,980
There's much meaning, does it?

873
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:49,320
So, you know, I'm prepared to step out and tell my coach,

874
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,199
hey, look, I'm doing this thing.

875
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:50,780
I'm going to get better.

876
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,260
So I walk out of that meeting thinking I've missed something,

877
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,559
but actually, in fact, I've gained.

878
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:57,719
So I went out on the track with full of energy

879
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:58,619
and a couple of little ideas.

880
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:01,159
And, you know, every situation is slightly different.

881
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:03,340
But in that particular moment,

882
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,840
I only, you know, might've been only a month or two

883
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,920
into my tenure as a Collinwood coach.

884
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,300
I thought, oh, this is a chance to actually do the opposite.

885
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,599
Trust the people I've got around me

886
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,619
because I've got great staff.

887
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,659
So that's an example of like, I don't need to be,

888
00:38:16,179 --> 00:38:18,059
you know, holding the whip and whipping it all the time.

889
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:19,860
I've got trust that the right people are doing it

890
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,239
and delegate.

891
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,619
And then two, I'm getting better.

892
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,460
It's a great message to the team around you for me, isn't it?

893
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,320
I'm empowering you.

894
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,059
We've got great people.

895
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:27,840
I trust you.

896
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,719
I can let go.

897
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,179
That is a unique thing to get early on.

898
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,119
And it's really powerful, isn't it?

899
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:34,440
Yeah.

900
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,500
And I know Jeff Brown says the same.

901
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:38,659
You employ the right people to let them do their job.

902
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,840
And I think I'm in an interesting conundrum

903
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,179
a little bit at the moment

904
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:45,739
because I'm going to go to Boston in December

905
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:47,199
and do a Harvard leadership course,

906
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,119
which I'm really excited for.

907
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:52,719
But it coincides that first week back for training.

908
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,579
And the first week back in this campaign,

909
00:38:56,019 --> 00:38:58,440
I want to make sure we get the right messaging going early.

910
00:38:58,519 --> 00:38:58,739
Yeah.

911
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,079
So I feel a bit compromised on it,

912
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:01,659
but I might zoom myself in.

913
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,219
Because if I've, again, if I'm saying to our playing group,

914
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:04,900
hey, we're getting better.

915
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:07,139
And there's no ceiling on this.

916
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,960
There's no, we're an open mind.

917
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:12,119
There's no, why can't we just grow through the roof?

918
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,599
And I'm in Boston doing a seven-day leadership course.

919
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:17,639
I think that could send the right message too.

920
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,460
Hey, yeah, we might've had success,

921
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:20,739
but we're not standing still here.

922
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,500
But I've got to get the balance of that right.

923
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:25,139
If you're not there, yeah, what message does that send?

924
00:39:25,219 --> 00:39:26,699
I love your thought process, O, isn't it?

925
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:30,460
And technology allows you to do both potentially.

926
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:33,260
I'm told that your grand final weekend

927
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,019
is just extraordinary, isn't it?

928
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:37,699
Baby born, 7.45, you win the grand final.

929
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:39,260
Told the next morning,

930
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,760
one of your elite connect sessions on,

931
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,159
you pop up with baby Maggie sitting inside the cup.

932
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,659
You squeeze a premiership reunion.

933
00:39:45,739 --> 00:39:46,280
Yeah.

934
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,019
With your great Brisbane Lions teammates.

935
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,199
There's many lines to that though, Darce.

936
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:54,659
Like I often say that it's a moment in time

937
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:55,820
that I'll be the Collingwood coach,

938
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,000
but I'm going to be a father forever.

939
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,519
Yeah.

940
00:39:57,619 --> 00:39:58,860
So I want to be there for my kids

941
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,960
and I want to be there for my wife.

942
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,900
And then, but then also I'm not the Collingwood coach

943
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,800
without my time at Brisbane.

944
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:06,800
So there was a reunion on the Sunday

945
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,639
and I'm going.

946
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,940
And it might only be for one beer,

947
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,579
but I'm there just to show my respect for,

948
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:15,719
you know, this opportunity they've given me.

949
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:16,880
You know, like I'm not here without it.

950
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,340
So I never forget where I come from.

951
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:20,460
And then the elitist stuff's the same.

952
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,619
Like we just got out of hospital.

953
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,139
So I was an hour late, but I thought,

954
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:25,300
oh, can I get on again?

955
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,539
I've got the little one in my hand.

956
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,420
And, you know, I actually think I might've cried.

957
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:30,599
I was probably because I had no sleep,

958
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:31,840
but also the emotion of it all.

959
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:36,159
But again, you know, you just appreciate what you got.

960
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,280
And then, you know, don't forget the people along the way

961
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,780
that've helped you have success.

962
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,420
Because quite often you meet them on the way down

963
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,980
if you go up to, and don't forget those people.

964
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,239
Yeah.

965
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:45,280
Yeah.

966
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,340
Yeah.

967
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:45,400
Yeah.

968
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:45,420
Yeah.

969
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:45,440
Yeah.

970
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:45,460
Yeah.

971
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:45,480
Yeah.

972
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:45,500
Yeah.

973
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,320
You mentioned your values.

974
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,380
You show them, you turn up and show them in every minute.

975
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,099
Five minutes to go, grand final day.

976
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,320
I felt like sitting there, you had the better of the day

977
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,139
all the way through.

978
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,320
Brisbane hit the front.

979
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:59,000
You're back into a center of bounce.

980
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,119
I mean, how did you assess that moment

981
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:03,420
and what was going through your mind?

982
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:06,260
Yeah, I think that five minutes I've watched about 10 times

983
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,400
back on replay.

984
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:10,880
And, you know, you train all your habits and behaviors

985
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,280
for when you need them most.

986
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,139
And grand final day is the time where you need that,

987
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,539
the great habits you've created with this training standards

988
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:20,300
or, you know, game plan education and, you know,

989
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,760
set plays, whatever it looks like.

990
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,019
We've, we've, we've trained habits around our close wins

991
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:28,760
and close losses or kill the game, win the game scenarios a lot.

992
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,820
And so when that happens, the staying in the moment,

993
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,119
the goldfish, the windscreen wiper, can't do anything about it.

994
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:35,619
What's next?

995
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:36,139
Here we go.

996
00:41:36,219 --> 00:41:36,579
Right here.

997
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,920
Right away, get the sign up.

998
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,559
We're going to this mode and then the on-field leadership

999
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:43,880
to execute and go, we're all on the same page.

1000
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,860
We've, we've trained that.

1001
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,500
We've trained that for two years.

1002
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:45,900
Yeah.

1003
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:50,400
Train the situation, look after others and then get yourself right.

1004
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,039
You know, those things are all there, trained and, and,

1005
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:54,559
and readied for when you need them.

1006
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,300
And sign goes up, ball goes up and, and then you just have

1007
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:03,519
some complete, another skill and class and talent that executes

1008
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:05,920
Dacos, handball to Geordie de Gaulle and kick across your body

1009
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,380
from 50.

1010
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:07,920
You can't train that stuff.

1011
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,500
That's, that's one of the draft.

1012
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,800
So, you know, those, those unbelievable,

1013
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:21,739
incredible talent able to shine above game plans and shine above moments and manage those

1014
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:22,739
moments.

1015
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:23,739
You win the premiership.

1016
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:28,460
Can you compare standing there as a, as a coach of a premiership side to the, to the

1017
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,239
three as a player is, is it, is it different?

1018
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:33,760
Is it more special or how do you, how do you describe it?

1019
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,760
Yeah.

1020
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,760
Lee, Lee said that out in the field.

1021
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,300
He says, oh, you're, you're remembering this a lot more as, than you did as a player.

1022
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,760
And at the time you're just in it, but I, it's absolutely true.

1023
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,760
Yeah.

1024
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,699
I mean, as Joey's out here with his tattoos still wet and, and that man that walked past

1025
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:56,900
my house crying with his dog and 106,000 members and yeah, you, you, as a coach, you're, you

1026
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,900
represent all those.

1027
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,760
You're the, you're the, you're the figure for those.

1028
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,440
And I know our staff do all the work.

1029
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,719
I'm not trying to say I do all the work, but you realize that you are driving a lot more

1030
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:08,239
emotion when you got your own medal.

1031
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:09,239
Yeah.

1032
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:13,639
You and your team, you know, you do represent your fans and the like, but certainly as a

1033
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:14,639
coach.

1034
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:15,639
We've got a lot more people.

1035
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:18,599
Flying the, uh, space that we're really passionate about the leader.

1036
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:22,039
And as I said, we're incredibly grateful to connect with you and that success that leaves

1037
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:23,659
clues and we saw these common traits.

1038
00:43:23,659 --> 00:43:28,559
We think that great leaders show and always start with an idea of self-leadership.

1039
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:29,559
It's hard.

1040
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:31,059
We think to lead anyone else.

1041
00:43:31,059 --> 00:43:34,480
If you haven't got an idea of your own self-leadership, what does that mean to you?

1042
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,599
Yeah, I've spent a lifetime becoming this guy and I'm not finished.

1043
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:43,579
So yeah, there's a lot of self-reflection, a lot of mistakes made.

1044
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:50,320
Um, course is done, you know, I'm 50 now and you know, I, I think one of my great strengths

1045
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,820
is my self-awareness, my emotional intelligence.

1046
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:58,539
Um, I can read a room well, so I wouldn't go to the races the day before.

1047
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:05,500
See, that's my cheekiness coming out, see, see the cheekiness, but yeah, that emotional

1048
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:11,239
intelligence and being able to read body language and listen for clues from what players need

1049
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:12,239
or staff need.

1050
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:13,239
And.

1051
00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:17,619
When people say, don't say things that they really want to say, you can hear it in anything.

1052
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:22,019
So all that stuff, I think is important, but it's a, it's a lifetime to get here.

1053
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:23,019
Um, yeah.

1054
00:44:23,019 --> 00:44:25,239
And a lot of lessons learned along the way.

1055
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:29,219
It's a great line that I've spent a lifetime being this guy and it's not ending, you know,

1056
00:44:29,219 --> 00:44:34,199
it's that constant, never ending self-improvement we see is another real pattern of people.

1057
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:38,199
They're curious always, uh, and continue to, to follow that.

1058
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:42,679
We talk about leaders really conscious now for more than ever about the impact they have

1059
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:43,440
on others.

1060
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,440
Yeah.

1061
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,440
On a daily basis.

1062
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,400
So I'm, I'm curious of the answer here because I think that's something you're particularly

1063
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,900
good at that positive impact.

1064
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:53,460
When I walk into a room, when I walk into any environment, what's the positive thing

1065
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,960
I'm doing around the people I'm at in any, in any scenario you're in.

1066
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,960
Yeah.

1067
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,980
I think, I think that's a natural course of my own energy.

1068
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:09,340
Um, I don't find it that difficult to see the glass full, um, or close to it, um, see

1069
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,340
the good in people.

1070
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,340
So I think that's important.

1071
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,679
And, and, and obviously with tiredness.

1072
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:12,800
Yeah.

1073
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:12,840
Yeah.

1074
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:12,900
Yeah.

1075
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:12,920
Yeah.

1076
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:12,980
Yeah.

1077
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:13,039
Yeah.

1078
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:13,079
Yeah.

1079
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:13,139
Yeah.

1080
00:45:13,139 --> 00:45:13,159
Yeah.

1081
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:13,179
Yeah.

1082
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:13,199
Yeah.

1083
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:13,219
Yeah.

1084
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:13,239
Yeah.

1085
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:13,300
Yeah.

1086
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:13,320
Yeah.

1087
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:13,440
Yeah.

1088
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:13,460
Yeah.

1089
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:13,480
Yeah.

1090
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:13,659
Yeah.

1091
00:45:13,659 --> 00:45:13,679
Yeah.

1092
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:13,699
It's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a good thing to have that step.

1093
00:45:13,699 --> 00:45:13,719
Yeah.

1094
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:13,780
I think that's important.

1095
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:13,840
I know.

1096
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,320
And being pulled, your focus gets pulled in all sorts of directions through performance

1097
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:23,420
and the role, but you know, coming back to what you're good at and, um, you know, I remember

1098
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:27,480
we lost three games in a row that time when I had to go to that board meeting and, and

1099
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,659
it was only my first year as a coach.

1100
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:32,900
And there's a lot of different pressures that come with that, that you haven't experienced

1101
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,280
before and I don't know what will come again.

1102
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,719
But then, you know, sitting in a coma for two days in my bed going, what, how do I

1103
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:39,320
get out of this?

1104
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,360
You know, like, what do we do?

1105
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:45,340
and playing a Friday night and finally get myself into an energy level

1106
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,400
just to communicate with my wife, let alone anyone else.

1107
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,340
And she goes, you know how to do this.

1108
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:50,579
You know how to get out of this.

1109
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:51,019
I said, what?

1110
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:52,360
She goes, just be you.

1111
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,000
There's a positive version of you.

1112
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,300
So instead of looking at all the things we didn't do in that game

1113
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:00,360
over the last two weeks, I scrapped it and just said to the coaches that day,

1114
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,000
I said, boys, don't come tomorrow and show us what we didn't do.

1115
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:04,940
I'm not interested.

1116
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,719
Find evidence of all the things that we have done

1117
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:09,960
and what we're going to do next.

1118
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,340
Like, let's concentrate on the team we want to be,

1119
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,559
not the team we are right now.

1120
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,519
And funnily enough, it was a great reset of, like,

1121
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:19,980
we might have tried to go too fast, too quick with the group.

1122
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:21,360
When you go, no, they got that, they got that.

1123
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:22,000
Let's go to this.

1124
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,039
So we just went back in time and a little bit and said,

1125
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:26,260
boys, if we're going to be this great pressure team,

1126
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:27,619
we're going to do this.

1127
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:31,300
So funnily enough, we won the next 10 games in a row, I think, from that.

1128
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,579
But it was a moment that the group was potentially waiting for,

1129
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,980
you know, that heavy stick.

1130
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,900
And not to say that you can't give a heavy,

1131
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,760
but at that time, they probably got what they least expected.

1132
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,960
And it was a moment to go, all right, no, we need to be this team.

1133
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,920
Let's go be this team.

1134
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:52,239
So the 80-20 rule, if you like, of positivity or reward behaviour.

1135
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,179
And then the 20% of, like, hey, let's get better in this area.

1136
00:46:57,159 --> 00:46:59,420
Creating and sharing a vision is something we see

1137
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,920
a really common trait for great leaders.

1138
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,960
And they're really clear on how they share that vision.

1139
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,880
How have you gone about that?

1140
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:08,820
The great thing about going for this position

1141
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:09,940
was there was an extensive,

1142
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,099
three-month exercise of presenting five or six times.

1143
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,940
And one of the questions was,

1144
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:16,840
what's your first three months look like?

1145
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,219
So I only reflected on it about two or three weeks ago

1146
00:47:21,219 --> 00:47:23,539
because one of my close friends was going for another position at the club.

1147
00:47:23,739 --> 00:47:25,539
And he said, so I went back in time and had a look.

1148
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:27,719
And there was the vision,

1149
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,760
the cultural vision around who we want to be

1150
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,639
and the pillars of, you know, family first

1151
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:33,980
and connect with our past

1152
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,980
and take the fans on the journey.

1153
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:36,500
It's all there.

1154
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,800
And so now to know it's two years later that we've lived at,

1155
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,480
it makes me really warm inside.

1156
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:42,659
I'm going, oh, wow, this is great.

1157
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,599
You know, this, you know, water what you want to grow mentality

1158
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:46,639
of reward the behaviour.

1159
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:47,300
It's all there.

1160
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:50,579
So, and quite often you have a vision.

1161
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:52,820
And I think the best thing that I've experienced in two years

1162
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:57,300
is get people around you that you share the vision with

1163
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:01,219
and encourage or, you know, manipulate if you like

1164
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:03,940
or get them to come on the same journey with you.

1165
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:07,320
Or they can then take this to places you'd not,

1166
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:08,860
never thought would be possible.

1167
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:09,219
Yeah.

1168
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,380
And, and so we've got great staff that have, you know,

1169
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,559
not only, you know, Jared Wade had high performance,

1170
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,619
he's gone to another level and I'm, I've got this vision

1171
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:21,059
and then it's just so far beyond what I thought would be capable.

1172
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:23,940
That's, that's exciting to start something

1173
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,960
and then watch it grow.

1174
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:28,920
You mentioned family first and I can't not acknowledge

1175
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,199
because we see it in the industry, you know,

1176
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,460
Bo McCreary's mum delivers a pre-game speech,

1177
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,780
which is just, I mean, it's so funny

1178
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,519
and it's so brilliant at the same time,

1179
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:39,940
but it's not, you know, people have these values documents.

1180
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,960
And they sit in the top drawer and no one really knows them,

1181
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:44,320
but you've brought that to life.

1182
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,519
Every time I look down the rooms,

1183
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:48,980
the whole family are there and they're lining alongside the banner.

1184
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:50,840
You've lived it, haven't you?

1185
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:51,519
We have.

1186
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:54,960
And, and, and I praise the partners, parents and,

1187
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:56,920
and others that step into this.

1188
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,559
It's a choice.

1189
00:48:58,099 --> 00:48:59,039
Connection is a choice.

1190
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:04,219
And the post COVID I've openly said was a massive ripple

1191
00:49:04,219 --> 00:49:06,239
for all of us in the footy world and life

1192
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:08,539
that we're disconnected from all the things that we've wanted.

1193
00:49:08,539 --> 00:49:09,679
We want, we're humans.

1194
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:10,760
We want interaction.

1195
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,519
And so we set about family first and then,

1196
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:16,179
you know, getting school holidays, kids in to run the water.

1197
00:49:16,179 --> 00:49:17,739
And then after games and all, you know,

1198
00:49:17,739 --> 00:49:19,019
it's just all the different layers of it.

1199
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:21,019
Mother's day, all the mums come into the team meeting

1200
00:49:21,019 --> 00:49:22,900
and father's day, we did the same.

1201
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,039
And, and then it was an opportunity mother's day

1202
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:27,719
to have Julie McCreery come in and, and in line

1203
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:30,119
with that, keep the meeting light to start the meeting.

1204
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:31,159
It was just a perfect fit.

1205
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:34,760
And little did I know that was going to, she went viral,

1206
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,119
didn't she?

1207
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,139
It was a, it was a great moment.

1208
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,920
How did the call go when you rang Julie McCreery and said,

1209
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,659
uh, do you want to do this?

1210
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:40,519
A pre-game speech?

1211
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:41,000
How did that go?

1212
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:42,780
Well, it was all set up the day before.

1213
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,039
Yeah.

1214
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:45,380
So we had my pre-game meeting.

1215
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:48,260
Um, this is how we're going to win the game and what we need.

1216
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:51,199
Had mum, son, mum, son, all the way around the room.

1217
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:52,519
And they got to listen to the.

1218
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:53,420
They were part of the whole meeting.

1219
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,139
Fantastic.

1220
00:49:54,139 --> 00:49:56,699
And so, so we go, oh, you know, Donna Maynard, oh Donna,

1221
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:57,320
what do you think here?

1222
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,960
And she says something funny and the boys laugh.

1223
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,280
Cause it's like, I think he, I think Bruzzy introduced

1224
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,900
Donna as his, um, yeah, full-time, full-time Nuffie.

1225
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,480
And so the laugh.

1226
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,300
And I asked Jane.

1227
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,179
Um, my check, you know, I had Brodie kicked five the week before.

1228
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:12,920
How'd you feel about it?

1229
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,059
Oh, about effing time.

1230
00:50:14,059 --> 00:50:18,000
You know, like, so just, just again, I thought it was one of the better

1231
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,019
meetings that we had to set up again, because you got this genuine, um, I

1232
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:25,579
didn't realize how attentive the players are when their mums are listening.

1233
00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:28,079
Yeah, they're in, you look at everyone's eyes, they're in.

1234
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,400
So you don't, you feel like everything you're saying is just becoming truly

1235
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,320
embedded in, in what we're trying to achieve.

1236
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,239
I can set the people up well.

1237
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,179
So then match day, you feel a comfort, but we've got

1238
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:39,420
trust.

1239
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,139
We've done the work boys.

1240
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:40,739
Just go play.

1241
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,559
And what a life memory for the mums fly.

1242
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:47,239
It's often, you know, I look back and I get my own mum, it was sloughing so much

1243
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:52,380
about the dads and the father, son, and, and, and the mums play an overwhelming,

1244
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,159
uh, role in all of our lives, but probably don't get, you know, that

1245
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:57,360
that'll stay with them forever.

1246
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:57,960
I'm sure.

1247
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,260
Yeah.

1248
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:02,760
And, and, and they all came in the meeting room before and photos and that's,

1249
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:05,400
again, it's, you know, you want to be a family first.

1250
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,119
What does it look like?

1251
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:08,940
Well, that's what it looks like that we, we care about our mums and.

1252
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:11,739
I still think we're scratching the surface of what we're capable of, or

1253
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,940
got some other ideas how we make that even deeper.

1254
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:19,579
But, you know, um, Bruce Pendlebury came to the father's day one last year and

1255
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:23,639
he openly said his son's 17th year at that stage, that was one of the most

1256
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:28,440
memorable times of his life for Scott's time at the, at the footy club, because

1257
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,099
he was part of the team meeting and he's part of the gulking common gets Peter

1258
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:38,219
Dacos and just, but it just gave a sense of we're all in this because we changed

1259
00:51:38,219 --> 00:51:39,059
our, our, um,

1260
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:43,199
Mote If you'd like early last year, we travel and Parteson, you can come.

1261
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:46,139
Maybe it's old school that you couldn't, but now you can come bring your kids.

1262
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:49,260
Whatever we lost the preliminary final by a point tears in the room.

1263
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,820
There's kids running around, jack crystal kids, run around, um, you know,

1264
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,940
wives and partners are there, right there when you're lost, when you need your

1265
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:59,860
family the most because things haven't really, will you go to your family?

1266
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,280
When things don't, I need my wife.

1267
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,860
I need, I need someone to console them in order to reconcile with that.

1268
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,760
So family, you're right there when you need them, so to keep the family coming

1269
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,139
with us.

1270
00:52:09,139 --> 00:52:09,159
Okay.

1271
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:12,699
to enjoy the success of what we just had on September 30.

1272
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,239
It makes it really special.

1273
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,639
But then if we didn't, they're right there for you too.

1274
00:52:17,139 --> 00:52:18,340
So then you don't have to fall as far.

1275
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,539
So I think it's certainly the club we want to continue to be.

1276
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:22,179
It's brilliant.

1277
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,539
Curiosity is a word that we see a lot of.

1278
00:52:24,579 --> 00:52:27,679
And through curiosity, we see leaders like you

1279
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:30,920
constantly learning and improving themselves through curiosity.

1280
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:31,579
Does that resonate?

1281
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:32,400
Yeah, it does.

1282
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,039
Yeah, and hence the leader.

1283
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,519
Once a month, you always find something new.

1284
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:39,920
You know, there's always something little to improve yourself.

1285
00:52:40,219 --> 00:52:44,579
Yeah, I'm not a massive reader in terms of novels or biographies

1286
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:46,940
or things like that, but I love to listen to podcasts.

1287
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,360
You know, I just constantly just trigger the mind.

1288
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,579
When you get old, as you know, it does.

1289
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,599
There's a lot in there.

1290
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,340
Sometimes you just need something to bring it back to the front, isn't there?

1291
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,860
So you get lost in there.

1292
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,079
Communicating with clarity is another dimension I want to ask you about.

1293
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,860
And you do that in your own unique way.

1294
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:06,159
Have you thought about why you communicate as a leader of your club?

1295
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:07,539
Yes, yes.

1296
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,139
I think one of the big things I'm conscious of is

1297
00:53:10,139 --> 00:53:11,960
whatever comes out of my mouth, I've got to live.

1298
00:53:13,099 --> 00:53:14,699
Don't say things you can't action.

1299
00:53:15,639 --> 00:53:16,960
For example, Billy Frampton,

1300
00:53:17,139 --> 00:53:19,900
I'd said to him a couple of weeks before the grand final,

1301
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,840
I think, mate, I really want to give you an opportunity.

1302
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:23,760
I'm not sure if it's going to be there.

1303
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,280
But I wanted to give hope.

1304
00:53:26,019 --> 00:53:28,480
But don't give that hope unless you can fulfil it.

1305
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:34,280
But yeah, I did a course in London 2021, I think it might have been,

1306
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,800
or not 20, roughly.

1307
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:38,840
And it was around gravitas.

1308
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,380
Because like you said, I'm not the alpha male.

1309
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,340
If I'm going to be a senior coach, I've got to have gravitas.

1310
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,800
I've got to have presence.

1311
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:50,039
And it taught me a lot about being in someone else's shoes when you present.

1312
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:52,619
And then what did the audience want to hear now?

1313
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:54,539
Where have they come from?

1314
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:56,980
Have they come from, they just woke up in the morning at 7 o'clock,

1315
00:53:57,039 --> 00:53:57,860
do I need to wake them up?

1316
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,440
All these little things that you learn when presenting,

1317
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,280
but now being the face of the footy club, which I had never been before,

1318
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,699
I didn't really love the media, to be honest.

1319
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,639
Not that I didn't love them, but I didn't love the attention of it all.

1320
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:13,679
But again, I think it's just about being yourself, really, ultimately.

1321
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:16,900
Curious about doing a course on gravitas and presence.

1322
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:22,199
So you recognise within yourself, you wanted to add some layers to that.

1323
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,440
And can you give some more detail on that?

1324
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:24,880
Did it help?

1325
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:25,719
Yeah, it did help.

1326
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:26,440
It helped a lot.

1327
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:30,039
Yeah, little did I know, I already had a lot of it.

1328
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,679
And it just made me need to believe in myself a bit more.

1329
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,980
Yeah, the self-awareness is a big attachment to gravitas.

1330
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:36,039
Yeah.

1331
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:36,139
Yeah.

1332
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:40,920
Yeah, authentic leadership, something that, you know, being yourself,

1333
00:54:41,059 --> 00:54:46,000
but also, yeah, the body language, the, you know, your tones,

1334
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:52,300
you know, leaving little bits of yourself spread around the room

1335
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,139
without even knowing it.

1336
00:54:53,179 --> 00:54:57,400
Like you're just saying less when more seems to be needed.

1337
00:54:57,679 --> 00:54:58,739
You know, I'm not saying anything here.

1338
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,800
Silence can be really powerful.

1339
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:05,119
So all these little things, yeah, well, the way you present

1340
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:06,039
and, you know, I've got a lot of things to say.

1341
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:06,980
I do love presenting.

1342
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:07,599
I'm a teacher.

1343
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:10,340
So that's one thing that I do.

1344
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,340
I see it as theatre, if you like.

1345
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,960
You know, like it's a, it is a performance.

1346
00:55:14,139 --> 00:55:16,920
I like, you know, a presentation is a performance.

1347
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:20,260
But I, every conversation, sorry, every presentation I ever do,

1348
00:55:20,699 --> 00:55:23,360
and I tell this to our coaches, make it a conversation.

1349
00:55:24,219 --> 00:55:25,480
Don't make it a presentation.

1350
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:28,340
So then if you're having a conversation like we are now,

1351
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:29,539
it's different to a presentation.

1352
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:32,659
So then we set that up a certain way.

1353
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:35,840
Yeah, and I think you're 100% on the money that so many of us,

1354
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,840
full down because we're trying to be what we think great leadership looks like

1355
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,360
and we're trying to be a version of someone else that we think,

1356
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,000
and that's always going to fall short, isn't it?

1357
00:55:45,099 --> 00:55:48,059
The only option is to be ourselves and the best version of ourselves

1358
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:51,860
because people pick up in a second, don't they, if you're not.

1359
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,860
And that's, everything about you is authentically Craig McRae

1360
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:58,420
and that's got as much gravitas as anyone has.

1361
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:01,480
Well, yeah, it's my style and I drive past Colin,

1362
00:56:01,579 --> 00:56:04,500
we're still doing it, I can't believe we coached that club.

1363
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,260
Yeah.

1364
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,380
Lise is a great example of what, what, we both coached Colin

1365
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,340
with premierships, gives a spell, that's not real.

1366
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,219
So there's a real, I have good perspective on it,

1367
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:19,440
but also I don't lose sight of how lucky I am to be doing this job

1368
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,340
and it won't be forever, but I want to be the certain person while I'm doing it

1369
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:27,699
and it's going to be challenged and tested and in all sorts of levels

1370
00:56:27,699 --> 00:56:30,960
and at some stage I'll shake hands and move on

1371
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,960
and hopefully there's still a little authentic version of myself.

1372
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,760
No doubt in my mind at all that,

1373
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,980
whenever that day comes, that won't be a question that needs to be asked.

1374
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,780
How important has collaboration been for you, Fyfe?

1375
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:47,320
Yeah, I think I used to always approach things with a group mindset.

1376
00:56:48,099 --> 00:56:50,079
Okay, let's get together as a group and work through it.

1377
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,699
Over time I've learnt that that can be of benefit,

1378
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,159
but also it can be very time consuming.

1379
00:56:56,579 --> 00:57:01,400
So there's certain levels of collaboration that I approach things with now,

1380
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:03,679
probably less than I once did.

1381
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:05,500
Yeah, I don't mind saying, no,

1382
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,960
the way we're doing it and then onboard people.

1383
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:13,519
I know we started our DNA stuff and I contact the leadership group

1384
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:16,679
and say, this is my idea and onboarded my idea

1385
00:57:16,679 --> 00:57:18,619
as opposed to saying, this is how we're going to do it.

1386
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,000
As opposed to, oh, let's carry it in a room for two hours

1387
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,719
and then let's talk about how we want to play.

1388
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,460
We did that.

1389
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:26,380
We did that for the game plan, but certain levels of it,

1390
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,619
I'm going, no, this is how we're doing it.

1391
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,079
And then it's about how we're onboarding those people.

1392
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:33,579
So I think I've changed a lot in the last three or four years

1393
00:57:33,579 --> 00:57:35,039
around collaboration versus saying,

1394
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:36,659
sometimes you're just going to make a strong decision

1395
00:57:36,659 --> 00:57:37,739
and make people believe in it.

1396
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,119
Yeah, it's smart, isn't it?

1397
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:40,059
That understanding, isn't it?

1398
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:42,519
You're employed to do that and you need to collaborate.

1399
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:43,719
You need to bring people on board.

1400
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,460
But if you go consensus on everything,

1401
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:48,199
you're not going to get locked down all the time.

1402
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:51,880
No, and I think in two years, Graham Wright in particular,

1403
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:53,360
I've worked heavily with him.

1404
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,000
I'm more right now in the case of take people on the journey.

1405
00:57:58,199 --> 00:57:58,599
Yeah.

1406
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:01,380
So, yeah, this is why we're doing it.

1407
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,119
And as opposed to what do you all think about it,

1408
00:58:04,179 --> 00:58:05,019
just bring it.

1409
00:58:05,059 --> 00:58:05,619
Everyone on the journey.

1410
00:58:05,739 --> 00:58:06,579
We're making this decision,

1411
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,739
but take everyone on the journey to make that decision.

1412
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:09,559
Understand why.

1413
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:10,400
This is why we're doing it.

1414
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:14,860
So that's from draft picks to leadership decision making

1415
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:18,079
to changing schedules, whatever it looks like.

1416
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:18,739
Take them on the journey.

1417
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,519
Make sure they understand why we're doing this

1418
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:22,539
as opposed to this element of surprise.

1419
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,380
So I think, hence, even with the fans,

1420
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:26,460
this is what we want to play.

1421
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:27,119
Take them on the journey.

1422
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,780
Explain why we're doing this as best you can.

1423
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:30,820
Yeah, brilliant.

1424
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,380
I've asked these two questions of everyone.

1425
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,500
I've had the great privilege of sitting down with it.

1426
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,659
And I've thoroughly enjoyed doing that with you today.

1427
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:39,400
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1428
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,099
Many, many.

1429
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:44,000
I'd say my dad.

1430
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:47,559
My dad would be number one for many reasons.

1431
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:48,719
Work ethic.

1432
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:52,039
He's always got, you don't realize when you get older

1433
00:58:52,039 --> 00:58:53,880
how old your dad is.

1434
00:58:54,219 --> 00:58:56,539
He says some things, but he's definitely,

1435
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,420
he's got more of a fixed mindset than me.

1436
00:58:59,179 --> 00:59:01,739
Yeah, he's a bit set in his ways, but he's 73.

1437
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:03,079
But he's been incredible.

1438
00:59:03,559 --> 00:59:04,460
He's always been there.

1439
00:59:04,539 --> 00:59:06,599
From the journey, picking me up when I needed to be,

1440
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:08,340
pushing me where I needed to go.

1441
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,280
Tell us a bit more about him.

1442
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,320
What did he do?

1443
00:59:11,539 --> 00:59:13,380
Yeah, boiler maker for 45 years.

1444
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,400
Worked six days a week.

1445
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,739
Had to earn everything he got in life.

1446
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,059
Yeah, we ended up, my dad split up.

1447
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:20,500
We ended up living in the caravan park together

1448
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,579
and through some tough times in 16, 18, 19,

1449
00:59:23,659 --> 00:59:25,179
whatever it looks like before I got drafted.

1450
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,980
Yeah, like he's a man of great integrity,

1451
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,280
great hard work.

1452
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:31,480
Yeah, he was there for me.

1453
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,539
How much joy did he get out of grandfathering?

1454
00:59:33,539 --> 00:59:34,420
Yeah, he's still crying.

1455
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,480
And I don't think I've ever heard him cry.

1456
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,579
Or sorry, I've never seen him cry.

1457
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:40,840
He texts me three days in a row.

1458
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,719
He cried three days in a row from the birth of the baby

1459
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:46,219
to premiership win and then to all the other parts of it.

1460
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:49,820
So it's pretty special for him to still be alive.

1461
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,699
He almost lost his life last year.

1462
00:59:51,739 --> 00:59:52,699
So it is pretty special.

1463
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,340
And then there's so many different layers of leadership.

1464
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,679
Obviously, Lee Matthews is probably the one

1465
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:00,840
that comes to mind the most.

1466
01:00:01,579 --> 01:00:03,219
Yeah, just around football.

1467
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,960
Lessons and all those things.

1468
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,619
But I'm not going to lose sight of myself around leadership

1469
01:00:09,619 --> 01:00:13,880
because I made a lot of mistakes in so many different areas

1470
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,599
and the resilience to change my own tack

1471
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:19,280
and stick to who I want to be

1472
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,239
and revisit those things over and over again.

1473
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:29,300
Yeah, I think at one stage I'll sit back fishing somewhere

1474
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,119
and be proud of the journey we've been on.

1475
01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:33,980
Yeah, I love the reflection and the self-awareness

1476
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:34,480
that keeps coming.

1477
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,280
And, yeah, I haven't had anyone ever answer it

1478
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,420
with that final thought at the end, but it's profound.

1479
01:00:39,739 --> 01:00:43,039
And, yeah, in a lot of ways that's where it starts and ends, isn't it,

1480
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,460
with our own ability to shift paradigm,

1481
01:00:45,579 --> 01:00:47,000
which you've been able to do.

1482
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:50,440
We're obsessed at Alita with this idea of what collaboration looks like

1483
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,599
and the idea of learning from each other

1484
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:57,340
and how do we do that on a small scale

1485
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,880
and a global scale as well.

1486
01:00:59,179 --> 01:01:01,880
So the question to me, if you collaborate with anyone

1487
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,440
on anything fly, and you might have another passion,

1488
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,679
another area of your life, is there someone you thought,

1489
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,980
God, I'd love to collaborate with that person,

1490
01:01:09,059 --> 01:01:09,699
someone that springs to mind?

1491
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,280
John Bertram, I formed a relationship with John.

1492
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,380
We were just walking the town.

1493
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:17,019
Literally the first day that I started this role,

1494
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,599
took all the staff for a walk around the town,

1495
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:22,340
grab a coffee, just to have an informal connection.

1496
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,139
John Bertram's standing at the lights.

1497
01:01:25,179 --> 01:01:27,320
And I knew John was at Collingwood,

1498
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,559
whether he was a director or he was definitely involved

1499
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:32,059
way back when Mick was involved.

1500
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,340
And I saw him.

1501
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:36,179
I mean, growing up as a kid in Adelaide,

1502
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,900
Mary's Cup's huge.

1503
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:40,480
He's one of the most famous Australians in the world.

1504
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:41,179
Do you remember that morning?

1505
01:01:41,719 --> 01:01:44,900
I do vaguely, vaguely Bob Hawke's words

1506
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,820
and waking up to this victory.

1507
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:47,780
I didn't know much about it.

1508
01:01:48,519 --> 01:01:49,639
We're the same age.

1509
01:01:49,699 --> 01:01:53,760
I remember my dad got me out of bed and you've got to understand this.

1510
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,960
And I remember I shared this with John.

1511
01:01:56,619 --> 01:01:58,539
I thought, this is the most boring thing I've ever seen.

1512
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,179
What's happening here?

1513
01:02:00,179 --> 01:02:02,059
I didn't quite understand the gravitas,

1514
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,179
but sorry to interrupt.

1515
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,340
But John's been a big mentor and a big collaborator.

1516
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:07,800
Yeah.

1517
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:08,239
Yeah.

1518
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:12,840
And so I performed an initial introduction at that lights

1519
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,940
and he walked down a little bit.

1520
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,300
I said, I'd love to catch up with him a bit more.

1521
01:02:16,539 --> 01:02:17,659
Do you mind if we walk the tan?

1522
01:02:17,739 --> 01:02:18,380
Because he lives there.

1523
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,239
And within a week I'm walking the tan with John and just listening.

1524
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,739
And just the stories, his involvement with the Olympic team

1525
01:02:26,739 --> 01:02:30,239
and swim team and the stuff he's doing now, his passion.

1526
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:32,119
And that stayed true.

1527
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,320
And I've caught up with him again at the end.

1528
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:33,900
At the end of that year.

1529
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:36,099
And then we've gone out to dinner, my wife and I and his wife.

1530
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:40,960
And there's just this man crush on this guy because it's just someone

1531
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,639
that continues to look to be better and mentor.

1532
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,960
And yeah, what an incredible human being.

1533
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,059
He's incredible, isn't he?

1534
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:53,300
75 years of age, still racing and the great privilege of overlapping

1535
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,659
with him in the elite space.

1536
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,320
And he drops into a room and all he always says,

1537
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,199
I know absolutely nothing.

1538
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:03,280
And he starts every conversation with, and he just fires questions.

1539
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:03,719
Doesn't he?

1540
01:03:03,719 --> 01:03:04,059
He does.

1541
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:06,119
He's just constantly being curious.

1542
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:06,619
Yeah.

1543
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,639
And what's the game going to look like in five years?

1544
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:10,199
He says that to me all the time.

1545
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,619
I think we were last in centre bounces in 2022.

1546
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,500
And just coming to the final series.

1547
01:03:17,619 --> 01:03:20,219
And I said, oh, mate, we've got some issues around our centre bounce and stuff.

1548
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,719
He goes, well, what's it going to look like in five years' time?

1549
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,679
Don't try to fix it now.

1550
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:24,300
I said, oh, God, I just want to get tomorrow right.

1551
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,679
But it's just constantly about that, that improvement.

1552
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:32,000
And I think beyond what others are doing around the AI space.

1553
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
And why wouldn't you be ahead of the game?

1554
01:03:36,019 --> 01:03:38,780
And to have someone like that, just a text message away

1555
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:41,500
or a walk of the town away is pretty cool.

1556
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,539
If you haven't seen the documentary on Netflix,

1557
01:03:44,659 --> 01:03:47,460
which tells the story of John Bertrand's America's Cup win

1558
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:50,639
and his team and the detail on the links and being 10 years ahead,

1559
01:03:50,699 --> 01:03:52,480
I encourage you, it's one of the great documentaries.

1560
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,079
Even if you have no interest at all in sport,

1561
01:03:55,239 --> 01:03:57,139
you'll learn something from John Bertrand.

1562
01:03:57,219 --> 01:04:00,500
Like I've learnt today, fly and sit down and marvel

1563
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,599
at what you've been able to do.

1564
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:03,940
The Authentic Leadership's a great story.

1565
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:06,199
And congratulations, you deserve all your success

1566
01:04:06,199 --> 01:04:08,679
and look forward to watching what comes next.

1567
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,440
Thanks for joining me.

1568
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:09,900
Thanks, Tuss.

1569
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:10,500
Appreciate it.
