00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,140
I hope you enjoyed this episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast with Ivan Cleary, the Penrith

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,300
Panthers triple premiership winning coach.

3
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:16,079
Found Ivan to be incredibly humble, but equally full of wisdom at the same time.

4
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:21,940
Ivan tells us the full story behind the gut-wrenching decision to leave the West Tigers in 2018

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,160
with two years left on his contract.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,660
But ultimately, it was Ivan trusting his heart and his gut instinct that helped him to make

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,160
that call in the end.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,679
He tells us about ramping up the mental skills of his team following the line of the All

9
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:41,240
Blacks and their psychologist, Dr. Kerry Evans, and goes into detail about the method behind

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,920
that and how that's helped the Panthers with their incredible success.

11
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,939
You hear about his incredible self-reflection on his early coaching career.

12
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,759
He also describes his North Star of coaching in great detail and how their values fuel

13
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,259
what it looks like and how it acts.

14
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:57,560
Amazing story.

15
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,460
Love catching up with Ivan Cleary.

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,019
We're also really privileged to have Ivan Cleary as part of our Elita Connect program.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,879
Head to elitacollective.com to find out more, book a discovery call.

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,659
We would love to get you involved in a group just like Ivan.

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,739
We curate these groups of five to six people.

20
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:17,500
You don't have to be a legendary NRL coach to be part of our program.

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,640
We just love connecting with people from different backgrounds, whether it be from the arts or

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,000
from sport or from social venture or whatever space you're in.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,439
We know that leadership doesn't need a title or hierarchy.

24
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:35,060
We just love expanding this community of great people and Ivan is a great and fantastic

25
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:35,939
member of that.

26
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:41,319
Big thanks as always to Jason Nicholas and his team from Temper Bedding, a mattress like

27
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:41,719
no other.

28
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,420
We know that a third of our life is spent sleeping and really successful people like

29
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,540
Ivan Cleary understand the value of good sleep and that is one of the clues we see all the

30
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:50,879
time.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,599
Good sleep leads to a better life and investing in a Temper mattress will be a decision you

32
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,219
won't regret.

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,799
Temper, a mattress like no other.

34
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:05,879
Ivan Cleary is an icon of the NRL having just completed a trilogy of premiership victories

35
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:11,360
with the Penrith Panthers in 2021, 2022 and the remarkable come from behind three-peat

36
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,139
win over the Brisbane Broncos in what is one of the great grand final wins for me of any

37
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:17,659
sport anywhere in the world.

38
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:21,939
The added layer to this unique success story is that Ivan's eldest son Nathan is the triple

39
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:26,800
premiership winning co-captain of the Panthers and regarded universally as one of the NRL's

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,479
all-time greats despite being only 25 years of age.

41
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,240
Ivan himself had an outstanding 186-game playing career that saw him in 1998 score

42
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,680
a then-record 284 points in an NRL season.

43
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:43,740
Ivan is a father of four and has been married to his wife Rebecca for more than three decades.

44
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,379
Congratulations, Ivan.

45
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,099
Unbelievable achievement when he threw premierships and I really appreciate you taking the time.

46
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:50,939
Thanks, Darce.

47
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:53,139
I appreciate those nice words.

48
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,520
It's nice hearing all those things about you.

49
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,479
You had an outstanding playing career.

50
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,300
As a player.

51
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,620
Did you always feel like coaching was your path?

52
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,439
No, not really.

53
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,939
Yeah, it was only probably late in my career when you start kind of thinking about what's

54
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:12,280
life after going to look like.

55
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,580
I hadn't really thought too much about it.

56
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:22,379
I'd gone to university sort of before I started playing, so I had a few options along that

57
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:22,680
path.

58
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:26,560
But I remember one of my brothers telling me one day he should coach.

59
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
I was like, that's pretty much where...

60
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,300
Yeah, as far as it went.

61
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,719
I really just fell into it, to be honest.

62
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:38,080
When you read your highlights and the success you have, it sounds like a dream life.

63
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,659
But as we all know, everyone has their challenges and you've had more than your fair share of

64
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:43,120
challenges.

65
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,560
Can I take you back to 2018?

66
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,400
You're in your first year as coach for the West Tigers.

67
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,139
Dave O'Neill is the chairman of the Penrith Panthers.

68
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,120
He lures you back to Penrith and it comes with some serious backlash.

69
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,240
The world turns on you.

70
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,719
People write and say some awful things about you.

71
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,539
Can you tell us...

72
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,039
Can you tell us how hard that was for you and your family?

73
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,580
Yeah, it was extremely difficult at times.

74
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:09,240
It was a strange situation because you mentioned Dave O'Neill, the then chairman of the Panthers.

75
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:16,519
I'd coached at Panthers before, so Dave and I were friends.

76
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:19,560
He just wanted to catch up with me.

77
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:24,240
Had been trying to for some time, so I didn't really think too much of what it was about.

78
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,519
Yeah, just went for a coffee.

79
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,339
I was coaching the Tigers.

80
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:31,860
At the time, honestly, I was happy there.

81
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,339
I wasn't sure how the future was going to look there, but I wasn't too worried about

82
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:36,980
that at the time.

83
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:38,360
Just a bit of backstory.

84
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,240
We worked at the Tigers.

85
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:45,620
We were trying to sign Nathan, my son, and I realized that he didn't want to come.

86
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,920
I actually had to tell him, look, I don't want you to come, mate.

87
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,220
If you don't want to come, just tell me.

88
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:51,860
He's like, oh, really?

89
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,879
I was like, I don't want you to come just because of me.

90
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
That's the last thing I want.

91
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,279
Anyway, that was just something.

92
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,420
That was going on in the background.

93
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah, and Dave popped the question, just said, do you want to come back to Panthers?

94
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:08,860
Honestly, it hit me from complete left field in my eyes.

95
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,800
My heart straight away said, yes, there's nothing I'd love more.

96
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,699
I never wanted to leave Panthers.

97
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,899
I felt like there was so much unfinished business.

98
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:21,819
I was very close with a lot of the players, the community.

99
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:22,560
We lived here.

100
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,519
Obviously, Nathan was playing there, but that left a big problem.

101
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:31,779
I was contracted to the Tigers, and it was two more years there.

102
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:37,680
I'd started a rebuild, which was, that's a big process, and I was all in doing that.

103
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,899
Yeah, it dragged on for a bit.

104
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,899
I just went to the Tigers, honestly.

105
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,339
I just went there and just told them, honestly, what had happened and how I felt.

106
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:49,939
They said, you're not leaving, and I said, fine.

107
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:50,720
I understand.

108
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,660
I just went about my business at that point.

109
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,779
We were still playing in the season.

110
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:58,120
I was trying to get us to the finals.

111
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:01,339
It didn't quite get there, but then it dragged on afterwards.

112
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,100
I remember my wife saying at some point, why don't you just stay?

113
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,759
It's just getting too hard.

114
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:13,939
I just said, honestly, because there's just this attraction that I just can't shake.

115
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,759
Yeah, anyway, I got through a bit of a tough period there.

116
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:20,420
There's still a lot of people down at the Tigers.

117
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,959
I'm not too happy with me, but I think it's worked out okay.

118
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,060
Worked out a bit better than okay.

119
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,319
That's a huge amount to think about.

120
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:31,639
Your son, who's probably the most sought-after player in the country,

121
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:34,600
the club wants to entice him across to the Tigers.

122
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,620
You're such a values-driven person, and integrity comes out in everything you do,

123
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,220
and you're caught in this incredible bind, I suppose.

124
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,139
I look at it, too.

125
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,779
I think you're the Dallium Coach of the Year in 2014.

126
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:48,000
The Panthers sacked you a year later.

127
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,860
Was any of that in the mix, too?

128
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,180
How did you go back there after they booted you only a couple of years earlier?

129
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,879
Yeah, definitely.

130
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:02,720
You know, Phil Gould, a very highly respected, well-known figure in rugby league,

131
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:07,680
he got me there in the first place, and then he did sack me.

132
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:12,360
He was still there when I came back, but he wasn't the one that wanted me back.

133
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,279
So that was definitely some question marks.

134
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,920
I had a lot of family members going, what are you doing?

135
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,459
But I didn't really know what I was doing.

136
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:23,920
I just felt it, you know, and it was honestly all about feel, my heart.

137
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,000
A lot of it was around Nathan, I think.

138
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:26,920
Yeah.

139
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:26,980
Yeah.

140
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,040
Yeah.

141
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,100
Yeah.

142
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:27,120
Yeah.

143
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,180
Yeah.

144
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,199
Yeah.

145
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:27,220
Yeah.

146
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:27,240
Yeah.

147
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,300
Yeah.

148
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,319
Yeah.

149
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,319
Yeah.

150
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:28,459
Yeah.

151
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:32,980
There's a strong attraction to go and link up with him.

152
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,540
I just felt terribly, you know, about the whole Tigers thing.

153
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,240
Honestly, I still feel, I don't feel good about that.

154
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,040
As I said, you know, I've said this before, you can only be in one place, and at the end

155
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,000
of the day, if I had stayed there, I just don't think they would have got the best of

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,120
me.

157
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,779
So I know that they mightn't understand that, but it's just how it went.

158
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,100
I think I've done 120 or so of these conversations, and I love it.

159
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,199
Yeah.

160
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:57,220
Yeah.

161
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:57,259
Yeah.

162
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:57,300
Yeah.

163
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:57,319
Yeah.

164
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:57,339
Yeah.

165
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:57,360
Yeah.

166
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:57,379
Yeah.

167
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:57,639
Yeah.

168
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:57,680
Yeah.

169
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:57,720
Yeah.

170
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:57,779
Yeah.

171
00:07:57,779 --> 00:07:57,800
Yeah.

172
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:57,860
Yeah.

173
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:57,899
Yeah.

174
00:07:57,899 --> 00:07:58,139
Yeah.

175
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:01,540
that is a really common thing is that people will say what you said

176
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,079
in a roundabout way, that they've made the best decisions in their life

177
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,519
when they listen to their heart or their gut instinct.

178
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,959
And when they make bad decisions, they go against it,

179
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,139
even though it might seem the right way.

180
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:15,660
It sounds like a pretty crucible moment there for you where you just,

181
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,819
when my heart's here and I've got to do it.

182
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:18,459
Does that sound right?

183
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,019
Yeah, it's absolutely right.

184
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,819
And even when there's, as I said, you know, my wife, Bec,

185
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,079
said at one stage, like it's, you know, don't you just,

186
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,379
why don't you just stay?

187
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,839
Like you're happy there.

188
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,540
Like there's, you know, you've got so much happening.

189
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,120
We're on the right path, all that stuff.

190
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,440
I just said, I get it, babe.

191
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,899
Like I'm a fairly simple bloke, really.

192
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,759
I'm fairly conservative as well.

193
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,299
So it would have been really easy for me to just go, no.

194
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:46,740
But I just, for some reason, I just kept down the path.

195
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:50,580
And I mean, I don't think you ever want to look back and say, well,

196
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,240
that's all I'll just say.

197
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:55,519
Like this was, you know, it's not really about that.

198
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:55,879
I just.

199
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,500
It's just something I felt like I have to do.

200
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,120
And I think what it has shown is that, yeah,

201
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,820
I felt like I did belong at Panthers.

202
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,919
The stuff that I, you know, started or helped start, you know,

203
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,000
many years ago, did have some unfinished business, I think.

204
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:16,100
And, yeah, it's just one of those things that happens in life.

205
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:20,340
I totally agree about the gut feel and such a common thread in leadership.

206
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,740
The amount of times you don't do it, you just kick yourself and go,

207
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,440
I knew I should have done that, you know.

208
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,059
So I think that's one of the fun things about being a leader, I reckon.

209
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,379
Yeah, it's a great bit of insight.

210
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:31,639
You're fast-tracked in.

211
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,100
You find your way to the Panthers in that first year.

212
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:37,940
You're two and eight, two wins, eight losses, 10 rounds in.

213
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,440
And I read this from you at the time.

214
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,259
You said, I felt burdened by the father-son thing.

215
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:44,840
Nathan wasn't playing well.

216
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,039
I felt guilty for that.

217
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:47,519
I felt like a burden on him.

218
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,620
I was wondering maybe I'm not the right man for the job.

219
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,759
Can you tell us about that bit of self-doubt that crept in at that time?

220
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,460
Yeah, I think I started that year still carrying the baggage from the Tigers.

221
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,840
I still felt like I did feel guilty and bad about that.

222
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,620
I was hearing the noise too much.

223
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,480
It was really affecting me personally.

224
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,460
So that was part of it.

225
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,700
The other part was there's a lot of pressure,

226
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:18,000
a lot of pressure around the signing and me going back to Penrith.

227
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,000
There's a lot of people with a lot of eyeballs on us,

228
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,340
particularly and more so because of Nathan.

229
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
That's why I felt guilty.

230
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,340
Because I felt you don't deserve to have extra pressure

231
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,639
because of me, essentially, on you.

232
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:34,000
And I think that was affecting him.

233
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,840
It was affecting me as well.

234
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,320
I'm sure it was affecting my coaching because, as you'd know,

235
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,139
people feel that.

236
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,580
It wasn't great times.

237
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,080
There was a lot of doubts going on in my mind.

238
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:47,200
The team was playing terribly, honestly.

239
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,980
As the coach, you're responsible for the performance.

240
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,419
I don't care what anyone says.

241
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,840
You can blame the players or...

242
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,559
Yeah, as much as you want.

243
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:58,419
But the fact is that you're responsible.

244
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,440
It was a mess.

245
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,059
So anyway, sort of hung on and turned it around.

246
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:07,279
We ended up winning seven games in a row at that point,

247
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:08,779
which I don't know where that came from.

248
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,620
It just sort of happened.

249
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,759
And then we stumbled to the end of the year, missed the finals.

250
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,039
I definitely thought, well, yeah, I'm not sure whether I am the right man.

251
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:22,259
But in the end, I was like, well, no, no, I'm going to go for it.

252
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:25,419
And made a few changes and did a couple of things there.

253
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,220
And I never expected what's happened in the next four years.

254
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,980
Spoke about a bit of dysfunction in the culture at that time.

255
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,019
Can you share a bit about what you saw and what needed to change?

256
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,960
Listeners probably have read the book,

257
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,440
The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni.

258
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,620
I'd read that book about 10 years earlier, but had forgotten about it.

259
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,139
My brother sent me just like a snapshot of what the book's about.

260
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,960
He just sent it to me on the phone one day.

261
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,120
And I looked at it and just went,

262
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,659
Oh, man, that is us.

263
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,620
Like that, honestly, that is us.

264
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,419
That was quite a shocking moment, but a good one as well.

265
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,340
I saw that was the basis of, yeah, we're going to turn some things around.

266
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,419
I mean, I was trying to promote change.

267
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,360
You know, whenever you come into a club, I know I've been there before,

268
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,399
but I was definitely trying to change things.

269
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,919
It wasn't a rebuild by any stretch.

270
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:20,559
We had some good players and it was ready to go, I thought.

271
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,740
But culturally, there were some things that I thought we needed a shift there.

272
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,000
And as you know, you know, some people come with you on that journey.

273
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,440
Some take some time, some don't.

274
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,659
And that's what was, yeah, that was happening.

275
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,980
You know, we needed to change some things and some tough decisions were made.

276
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,340
Some, you know, unpopular ones probably.

277
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,019
That's what we had to do.

278
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,600
And that's the same as anything.

279
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:46,720
It just took me a while to realize that we had to make some changes.

280
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:51,100
And that was one of the things about the first year back there, 2019,

281
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,539
where we were struggling.

282
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,539
I thought the place was different.

283
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,200
You know, I thought I knew the place.

284
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,279
I'd coached here before.

285
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:00,399
I'd watched many games when I wasn't there because Nathan was playing.

286
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,740
But things had changed and I didn't notice until I got there.

287
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,259
So that was interesting.

288
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,580
It was difficult, but it was also good.

289
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:10,080
You know, it's good to go through that time.

290
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,360
And yeah, it was definitely some hard times early,

291
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,519
but I think the struggle is what it's all about.

292
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:18,419
It definitely makes you enjoy the good times more.

293
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,799
Fast track on the head full of years later and you're hugging your eldest son.

294
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,080
He's the co-captain of your team.

295
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,539
You've just three-peated.

296
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:27,259
You've pulled off one of the great grand final wins.

297
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,279
He's played one of the great grand final performances.

298
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,460
As I said off the top, in any code, any sport in the world,

299
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,220
that's the level of what you've achieved.

300
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:38,600
Are there any words that can describe the amount of joy

301
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,279
that you must have felt to post the third grand final win with the family?

302
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,659
No, I don't think so.

303
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,700
It was just incredible.

304
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:49,100
You know, I've been fortunate enough to win three.

305
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:50,659
They've all been different.

306
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:54,320
The emotions have been all quite different, actually.

307
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:58,679
And this one was, I don't know if I've ever felt euphoria,

308
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,559
probably other than sort of, you know, when you have your children

309
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:04,279
and just sort of pick through the first job you've never seen one before

310
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,139
and just go, oh, my God.

311
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:07,059
But this was something else.

312
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:11,620
Just the way the game went and how radical that last 20 minutes was.

313
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,279
And when it was actually over, I was just like, yeah, it was sort of surreal.

314
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:22,019
And it took me, honestly, it was like weeks to try and wrap my head around

315
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,559
how that all went down.

316
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:23,860
Yeah.

317
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,059
Yeah.

318
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:24,080
Yeah.

319
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,139
Yeah.

320
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:24,200
Yeah.

321
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,220
Yeah.

322
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,240
Yeah.

323
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,259
Yeah.

324
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:24,279
Yeah.

325
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:24,299
Yeah.

326
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:24,320
Yeah.

327
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,379
Yeah.

328
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:26,940
I mean, I went back a few times and pieced together some stuff.

329
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:32,580
But, yeah, I like all the stuff with my family and obviously Nathan,

330
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,720
what he did, you just couldn't write it.

331
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,620
So I feel very blessed, very lucky.

332
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:41,179
So to win one NRL grand final is incredibly tough.

333
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,480
To win three in a row is just next level.

334
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,779
And to set the scene for those who aren't on the same plan

335
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:51,120
that don't understand, 24-8 down, 61-minute mark of the grand final.

336
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,860
In the last 18 minutes to win,

337
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,120
you score 18 unanswered points.

338
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,600
It's the biggest come from behind victory in grand final history.

339
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:01,419
You looked as calm as anyone could possibly be.

340
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,799
I watched you back yesterday in preparation for this in the box.

341
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,220
I know how you kept your cool.

342
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,360
Can you describe what sort of work goes into being able to get that right

343
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,360
in that circumstances and how you've been able to prepare that?

344
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,220
Yeah, I think the best thing about this whole thing,

345
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,620
apart from just the joy of it and experience,

346
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,639
is it's just going to be such a great reference point for the future in and

347
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,580
around, you know, when you're set the way you want to play,

348
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,720
the things that you value, the things you coach day in,

349
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,419
day out, you know, all season.

350
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:36,279
You preach, you know, little details here, there and everywhere.

351
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,960
And the amount of those things that happened at the end of that game

352
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,679
was just, there's just too many to discuss.

353
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,940
A big thing we've worked on the last few years has been, you know,

354
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:53,419
we've really ramped up, you know, mental skills, coaching, you know,

355
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:59,259
like obviously the better you get, like the higher level of competition,

356
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,899
we all know how much the mental stuff is important.

357
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:07,019
But we probably, not neglect it, but it's probably never, you know,

358
00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:08,139
coach as much as it should.

359
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:09,940
It's hard to find the time.

360
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:13,340
You know, we may have a conscious effort probably for the last, yeah,

361
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:16,379
probably four years, but definitely it's improved the last few years

362
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:17,559
because once you get better at it.

363
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,879
And a lot of that stuff came to the fore in that last 20 minutes, you know,

364
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,299
just trying to stay present regardless.

365
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:26,379
So what the situation was like, you know,

366
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,460
the scoreboard was blowing out, the time, everything.

367
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:34,100
You know, a lot of the stuff we trained and spoken about, yeah,

368
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,080
like it helped the boys out in that moment.

369
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:38,919
I mean, it's not always going to work out that way,

370
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:42,580
but just for it to actually work and it's going to be such a cool reference

371
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,700
point for the future too.

372
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:46,179
It's like the chicken and the egg thing, isn't it?

373
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,899
What do you get first?

374
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:51,720
But, you know, that's going to be really fun to actually look back on

375
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,379
when we're trying to improve.

376
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:55,259
And evolve even more.

377
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,919
Can you give us a little bit of detail on mental skills training?

378
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,000
What does that look like for you and the team?

379
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:07,019
Yeah, we probably followed the All Blacks lead probably when that was,

380
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,660
that's probably going back to 2011.

381
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,539
They were struggling with pressure.

382
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:15,039
Clearly the best team for probably 20 years,

383
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,980
but they only won one World Cup at that point.

384
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,759
Yeah, and they use the, you know, the red-blue model.

385
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,599
Kerry Evans, I think, is,

386
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,900
it's quite an intense, detailed and complex model.

387
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,019
When we try to just, you know, really simplify it and, yeah,

388
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:34,019
so that's kind of the way, the way we do it and, you know,

389
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,819
work towards very simple stuff.

390
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:40,579
Try not to make it too complex and too complicated for the boys or me.

391
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,779
Yeah, but a lot of it's just around, yeah, dealing with pressure and outside noise

392
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:49,720
and just all the things that can distract you basically in the middle of a game.

393
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:50,359
Yeah.

394
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,299
And we feel like we've only really started.

395
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:52,619
We've only really started to scratch the surface too,

396
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,980
so that's exciting for the future.

397
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,380
Heard your reference at Army Camp at the end of the 2019 season, I think,

398
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,140
that you felt you led the foundations

399
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,240
and then you built your culture and values on the back of that.

400
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,460
Can you share us a little bit about what that did for the team, you know,

401
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,180
heading into the three-peat Premiership wins

402
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,160
and what are the values and cultures?

403
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,519
How do you articulate them?

404
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:16,220
Probably going back to the, you know,

405
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,059
when you asked about the difficult year in my first year when I came back in 2019

406
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:21,240
and we had to make some changes at the end,

407
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:21,880
at the end of that year.

408
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:25,880
When I was originally sacked at Panthers at the end of 2015,

409
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,980
I had a year out.

410
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,160
I really tried to spend that year trying to, you know,

411
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,079
I'd been a head coach for 10 years at that point.

412
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,279
Started pretty young at like 35, pretty much straight out of playing,

413
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,920
made a lot of mistakes.

414
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,799
Had survived essentially, pretty much that's it for 10 years.

415
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,940
So I sort of sat down and thought, okay, I need to, you know,

416
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,519
streamline the whole thing.

417
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:49,640
Like what have I learned?

418
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,220
What works?

419
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,279
What doesn't?

420
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:54,259
And part of that was, yeah,

421
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,099
when I first started coaching the New Zealand Warriors, that was 2006,

422
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,440
I had an assistant coach called John Ackland.

423
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:02,099
John was, he's about 12 years older than me, I think.

424
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:05,720
Real wise guy, you know, real old footy head guy.

425
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,740
One of those guys, you know, the one-liner types and, you know,

426
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:09,640
just so cool.

427
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:10,799
And I remember him saying to me,

428
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:14,160
the most important thing you will do is create, you know,

429
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,039
the right environment.

430
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,660
And I didn't really, I knew what he meant,

431
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,400
but I don't think I ever really,

432
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:26,099
you know, drilled down into what that should really look like and feel like.

433
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,700
It was more just to sort of, you know, you have, you know,

434
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,859
you have, you know, beliefs, obviously, and standards and all that kind of stuff.

435
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:35,859
And then the culture was sort of just, it would just evolve organically.

436
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,900
Whereas at this point, you know, when I was out, I was like, right, okay,

437
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,859
I want to actually articulate like what it is.

438
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,420
And then did that for a couple of years and I got to the Tigers, did that.

439
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:49,799
And then when we had this bad year in 2019, I was like, no, no, no,

440
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:51,220
I'm going to streamline it again.

441
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,059
And I'm going to actually say what it is, you know,

442
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,240
so people can follow it and it's really clear.

443
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,440
And I've got an idea, just break it into three parts.

444
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,640
You know, what does it look like from the outside?

445
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,279
What does it feel like on the inside?

446
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,619
And then basically how does it act?

447
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:08,440
Not just on the field, but obviously on the field,

448
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,740
that's what we deal with.

449
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,119
And that's, so that's what we did and still doing.

450
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,339
So I'm still working on that.

451
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,019
Trying to make it pretty simple.

452
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,279
That's pretty simple to follow.

453
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,279
But everyone knows, everyone knows how we act, what we do.

454
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:25,440
In that sense, if you know, you're accountable for it

455
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,940
and that's pretty much how we've gone.

456
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,359
So what does it look like?

457
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,759
What does it feel like on the inside?

458
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:30,640
And then how does it act?

459
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,400
That's the culture reference point.

460
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,519
And then you live those behaviours and you get to analyse them

461
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,160
through that lens.

462
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:39,819
Is that as simple as it sounds?

463
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,039
Yeah, pretty much.

464
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:42,819
It's sort of like my North Star as a coach.

465
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:46,900
So I always just keep, you know, whether it's after a game,

466
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,680
whether it's a training session, whether it's if we've gone to a fan day,

467
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:55,579
yeah, all that stuff is just, you just keep, you know, referencing it.

468
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,799
So, you know, a little simple thing like, you know, we want to look fit.

469
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,420
You know, so if you want to be fit, then that goes into our recruitment strategy

470
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,799
or our, you know, retention model or, you know, we build from within.

471
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,980
So a lot of our kids come through.

472
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,619
So the Junior Pathways Program, like there's a big emphasis on, you know,

473
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,740
how fit we either are or we look.

474
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,099
You know, it's not just about being fit.

475
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:21,259
You know, so, you know, things like strong body language and,

476
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,480
you know, never defeated and all that kind of stuff.

477
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,420
You know, we care about that kind of stuff.

478
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,000
So it's just, it's good for not just me, but also the rest of the coaches

479
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,420
and the players and the captains and the leaders and all that sort of stuff.

480
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,519
Just simple stuff to, yeah, to follow.

481
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,640
The feeling one's interesting because that's a tough one.

482
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:43,220
But that's what we're always looking, you know, we want people who work for us

483
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,940
or play for us or whatever to feel, you know, connected

484
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,599
and, you know, to feel psychologically safe.

485
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,940
I know that's a, yeah.

486
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:54,619
It's easy to say, but that's a constant thing we work on.

487
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:57,460
And for me, that's a good one just to keep, you know,

488
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,539
and just in all your discussions and what you observe.

489
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:03,819
It's, yeah, it's something that we, again, we take very seriously.

490
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,000
And you don't always have it.

491
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:06,559
Without a doubt, you don't have it all the time.

492
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:08,660
But that's what we always, we try and search for that sort of stuff.

493
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,119
Could someone share with that recently around psychological safety?

494
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,940
That's, you know, Google has clearly got the ability to analyse data,

495
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,839
maybe as well as any organisation worked out in their team of, you know,

496
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,119
how many?

497
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,440
40,000, 50,000 people.

498
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,640
The teams that had that were the highest performing teams

499
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,799
over and above any other measurement they could find.

500
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,240
And it seems interesting how, you know, the North Star you described,

501
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,880
the Penrith Panthers, something you feel people in the organisation

502
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,539
have got an understanding of that, whether they can say it the way

503
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:37,160
you did or not.

504
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,880
Is that what you're achieving?

505
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,720
Well, that's what I'm trying to, yeah.

506
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,759
Yeah, and I don't think I'm there, definitely not there yet,

507
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:49,819
but that's sort of, you know, I probably, when I started this,

508
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:56,160
I probably didn't have the confidence in it and myself to sort of preach it.

509
00:22:56,259 --> 00:23:00,980
I don't want to preach it, but, you know, if I feel as though it's, you know,

510
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,720
it's at a point now where, you know, we are, you know,

511
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:08,339
we are making some progress with it and I'm, yeah, much more comfortable,

512
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,960
you know, I guess, yeah, spreading that message and trying to get,

513
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:16,299
I guess, you know, other people in the business, obviously coaches

514
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:19,160
and other staff to, you know, to follow that.

515
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,519
Yeah.

516
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:25,059
Penrith is located 55 kilometres west of the CBD in Sydney,

517
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,599
proudly working class suburb of Sydney.

518
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,920
You speak a lot about your passion for the community, where you live,

519
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,680
and you moved your family to Penrith a second time around, I believe.

520
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:41,900
Can you tell us about the people of Penrith and they sometimes do get a bit

521
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,319
of a bad rap and why they mean so much and so much to you and the culture?

522
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,799
Yeah, just a little back story.

523
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,920
I come from the Northern Beaches of Sydney, that's where I grew up.

524
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,539
My wife also does.

525
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:58,279
For the average kid from the Northern Beaches, Penrith is pretty much like Mars.

526
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:00,799
You can't be further away, you can't be more different.

527
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:04,359
It's not somewhere where as you're growing up, you're going to go,

528
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,779
you know what, I'm going to live in Penrith, I'm going to go there.

529
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,700
Went to New Zealand for 10 years, got the job in Penrith.

530
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,319
I could have easily come back and just lived on the beaches and done the trek

531
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,319
or whatever.

532
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:18,359
But we decided that we wanted to, yeah,

533
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:21,119
we wanted to settle our family out there.

534
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,720
Yeah, had four kids or out here, I should say.

535
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:29,059
The thing was Nathan was like about 14 back then, 13 I think maybe.

536
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,400
And he's a good little footy player.

537
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,240
He wasn't a superstar.

538
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,539
But one of the things that was going to be good about it was like, yeah,

539
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,920
the footy system out here is strong, you know.

540
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,980
So if nothing else, he was going to get to play good competitive football

541
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,559
each week, which would help him.

542
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:47,640
Honestly?

543
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,759
It's the best thing we ever did.

544
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,759
My kids love it out here, honestly.

545
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:58,339
The people are, without putting, I don't want to put anyone down in Sydney.

546
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,420
I come from the beaches, so I'm probably allowed to say that.

547
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:05,039
But eastern suburbs, I've spent a little bit of time out there with the Roosters.

548
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,700
There is no pretentious people in Penrith.

549
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,640
If there are, they don't get very far and they won't last.

550
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:12,980
They're just real people.

551
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,579
I love their community.

552
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:17,799
I felt when I got here, the club wasn't going that well.

553
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:22,619
You get a lot of people come from sort of towards the city and, you know,

554
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,359
live out here.

555
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,839
Obviously, it's a bit cheaper and whatnot, a bit more space.

556
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,599
So there's a lot of like second, third generation, you know,

557
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,980
Souths fans, Parramatta, you name it.

558
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:36,119
You know, and if you were a Panthers fan, you didn't really want to put your head

559
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,680
up and talk about it too much.

560
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:40,700
And that was one of the things we wanted to change.

561
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:45,140
We wanted to, you know, we want Penrith people to be proud of their team

562
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,220
and their area.

563
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,079
And that wasn't all, you know, it's not always the case because, yeah,

564
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,440
as you said, there's a bit of shit put on us and stuff.

565
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:57,539
And just to see the amount of, yeah, Panthers jerseys and whatnot around

566
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:00,640
and, you know, just the pride that the community, you know, is feeling,

567
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,700
not just about the team, but about themselves.

568
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,259
And that is to be able to have some sort of influence there is just,

569
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:09,400
yeah, mind-blowing and I feel very grateful for it.

570
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,740
You're proud now, the Penrith community, no doubt about that.

571
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,099
And you mentioned, you know, Nathan, you said he's a pretty good little footy player.

572
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,039
You coached him when he was six, I believe.

573
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:22,400
I read about him as an Australian schoolboy champion who played, you know,

574
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,799
national level.

575
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,279
I mean, was there a point in time where you thought, hang on a minute,

576
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:29,400
my oldest son here could be a serious NRL player?

577
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,539
Was there a time you can remember that?

578
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,319
Yeah, probably when he made the Australian schoolboys, that was like,

579
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,380
it doesn't always mean you're going to be an NRL player,

580
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,759
but you're on a pretty good path.

581
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,519
He was in a really good Panthers under-20s team at that stage, very strong.

582
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,200
I think there was still five or six kids out of that.

583
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,700
That team are actually in our team still now, so it was very strong.

584
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:54,460
Yeah, I guess you sort of, you hope and think that he should be able to play.

585
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:55,500
How long for?

586
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:58,539
Honestly, I never would have envisaged where he's at now.

587
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:03,460
Interestingly, when I got sacked, that was probably the best thing for him because he was,

588
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,339
yeah, he was debuted as an 18-year-old where if I was the coach,

589
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:13,279
there's no way I would have picked my own son as an 18-year-old in the team.

590
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,660
So it's funny how things work out.

591
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,400
Like, it's definitely,

592
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,099
that's worked out better for him.

593
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,420
And I love asking this question, you know, about leadership on the home front.

594
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,680
As I said, you're a father of four.

595
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,680
What are you like as a dad?

596
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,079
Well, I think I'm all right.

597
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:34,400
Like, you know, I probably, it's just, you know, I guess a personality,

598
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,680
you know, you got to lead however you do.

599
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:39,380
I love my kids.

600
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,480
All my kids love them as much as any of them.

601
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,799
So two boys, two girls.

602
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,460
And we had two very close together.

603
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:51,220
Then we're pretty happy with that, a boy and a girl.

604
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,160
Six and a half years later, we got bored and life was getting too easy.

605
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,200
So we thought we'd have another one.

606
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,059
And then another one turned up.

607
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,980
I'm not sure how that happened.

608
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,380
But so we had four, yeah, boy and a girl, a bit of a break,

609
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,240
and then a boy and a girl.

610
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:08,440
So I know my first two, they complained constantly that, you know,

611
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,339
we were far harsher on them than we are the younger two.

612
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,099
And that's probably true.

613
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:15,380
So I think over time, you get a little bit lazy being a parent.

614
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,099
So just let them do whatever.

615
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:18,740
I've got four as well.

616
00:28:18,819 --> 00:28:20,000
And I concur, isn't it?

617
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,220
You run out of gas by the fourth time around.

618
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:25,119
And they might be the most well-adjusted, the fourth one,

619
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,000
because you stay out of their way potentially.

620
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,000
But Nathan, Jet, Malaya, I think, and India.

621
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:34,160
I wanted to ask you, I was talking to a friend of mine,

622
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,799
a very successful AFL player.

623
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,339
His oldest son is a star of the AFL, as it turns out,

624
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,640
was an early draft pick and one of the best young players in the competition.

625
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,940
His second son didn't quite make the grade, a beautiful young kid.

626
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:49,900
And I was talking to him recently.

627
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,339
He said, you know, for the second son, he's almost felt this sense of shame

628
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:56,640
that the pressure from the family outside world was so much.

629
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,900
It was one of the saddest stories I've heard.

630
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,259
And, look, Nathan's carved this path out that's almost impossible

631
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:06,180
for anyone to follow, let alone having a dad who played

632
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,259
and the other siblings.

633
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,339
Is it a hard thing to try and protect the others in some way from that?

634
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,259
Yeah, well, my youngest son, Jet,

635
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:15,460
he's now 18.

636
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,720
He's in the Panther system.

637
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:21,400
You know, he's already experienced a lot, you know,

638
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,640
the whole opposition school are basically chanting and, you know,

639
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,000
just, you know, you're not as good as your brother or this or that.

640
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,420
And I can, you know, I know he feels that.

641
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,480
He's starting to get better at just letting it wash over him.

642
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,680
He expects it a bit more.

643
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:39,740
I've spoken a lot to my wife about this over the years,

644
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:43,079
and I worry about it a lot, what Jet's going to have to put up with,

645
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,079
not just him.

646
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:46,119
Not just me, his dad, but obviously his brother.

647
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:48,539
It just so happens he plays the same position,

648
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,440
which is he tried to change positions, but he couldn't.

649
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,920
It's just that's what he plays, and that's what he's best at.

650
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,819
So that's all sort of still ahead of him.

651
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:00,839
And I do, yeah, I worry about it.

652
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,400
But, you know, we talk about it a lot as well,

653
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,339
just trying to keep an eye on it as best we can.

654
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
Some things you just can't, you know, avoid.

655
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:11,720
Like there are, you know, his peers and friends and their families and parents,

656
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,859
and they see it.

657
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,019
They see things that...

658
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:14,140
Oh, I don't know.

659
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,240
I don't know.

660
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,599
I don't think exist, but, you know, whether it's, you know,

661
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,519
they get a...

662
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:21,180
I think Jet gets a bit of a rails run because of who he is,

663
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:22,380
and that's hard.

664
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,180
That's hard for Jet.

665
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:24,119
Like that's not his fault.

666
00:30:24,339 --> 00:30:25,599
It's not his...

667
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:27,420
You know, and that would never be the case, by the way.

668
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,180
I would never do that.

669
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,259
Well, that's what I think.

670
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,799
And then again, I don't even...

671
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,579
I reckon some people have to tell me that, you know,

672
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:35,000
he's actually going well,

673
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,500
and I'm sort of trying to play it down all the time, you know.

674
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,980
So that's a bit difficult.

675
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:44,119
For the girls, yeah, they haven't been sort of...

676
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:46,380
Well, they sort of don't...

677
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,599
They don't kind of talk about it that much either,

678
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,980
but I don't know.

679
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:51,619
It's just one of those things as a parent,

680
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,680
just trying to navigate as best you can,

681
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:55,140
don't have all the answers for sure,

682
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:58,140
but, you know, we try and keep an open line of communication

683
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,839
as best we can,

684
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,660
try and keep an eye out for them and just deal with it,

685
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:04,359
you know, how we best fit, the way we think is best.

686
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:08,039
And you can't manufacture passion, I always say, in kids, can you?

687
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,079
And if that's what Jet loves to do,

688
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,500
it's what he loves to do, isn't it?

689
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:13,039
You're not able to...

690
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:17,019
to push anything in any direction, really, with any kid, I don't think.

691
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:20,480
And so I suppose you can just support them and their passion,

692
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:21,319
whatever it might be.

693
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:25,200
As it turns out, it sounds like he's got a love in the same way

694
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,519
and that will end up where it ends up, I suppose, isn't it?

695
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,920
Is that a way to think about it for the younger one?

696
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,079
Yeah, for sure.

697
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,759
I wish he was a golfer or something.

698
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,940
I could just go on caddy for him or something like that.

699
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,500
That'd be fun.

700
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,500
No, no, it's just kind of how it's worked out

701
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,819
and he's definitely passionate about it.

702
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,059
He's probably thought about that.

703
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,839
He's himself thinking, do I really want to do this?

704
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,160
Do I want to go down this path?

705
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,539
But that's what he wants to do, so we'll support him.

706
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,019
Like any other of our kids,

707
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:55,640
just try and give him the best opportunities as we can

708
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,420
for him to make the most of it.

709
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:00,220
And whatever happens, happens.

710
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:03,299
It's going to be hard to...

711
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:04,859
It's not about living up to his brother anyway.

712
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,200
It's just about his own path

713
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,480
and hopefully he makes the most of his talents

714
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,859
and does his best.

715
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,299
And if he does that, then he'll never fail.

716
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,099
Well, everyone, speaking of passion,

717
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,220
we've got a great passion for this world,

718
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:20,619
Alita Connect, that co-founded with one of my oldest friends,

719
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,400
a guy called Matt Waterwitz, about nine years ago.

720
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,859
And we connect people from different backgrounds

721
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,799
around the globe now to learn and share

722
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:29,980
in what we hope are these trusted environments

723
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,880
for personal development groups for five or six.

724
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,839
And we've been incredibly privileged

725
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:37,259
to have you collaborating in that world.

726
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:39,500
Can you tell us a little bit about Alita Connect for you?

727
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,240
Yeah, I had heard of it.

728
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,160
Matt gave me a call.

729
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:48,359
And just straight away when he mentioned it to me,

730
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,700
I thought it sounds like a really good idea.

731
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,480
It's, you know, I know you probably talk about this a fair bit,

732
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,680
about the loneliness of leading.

733
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,920
And I think that's the best thing about it

734
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,579
is it's not about, you know,

735
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:02,460
really what you are specifically doing.

736
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,819
It's just the common threads within,

737
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:09,039
whether it's business or sport or entertainment or whatever.

738
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,640
There's so many things that you just go,

739
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,099
oh, man, yeah, yeah, I understand.

740
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:14,880
I get that.

741
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm glad you're going through that.

742
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:18,460
Like a lot of times you get off a call and think,

743
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,339
I think reinforcement.

744
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,519
A lot of think that's, I think, yeah,

745
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:24,500
what I am doing is I think we're on the right track.

746
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,099
So there's no, you know,

747
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,460
I find there's not a lot of times you go,

748
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,500
oh, I'm completely off track there.

749
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,279
A lot of it's just reinforcement.

750
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,480
Just being able to talk about stuff that you just don't get.

751
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,519
You don't get to talk about, you know, really.

752
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,039
Like as a head coach, you know, you don't,

753
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,000
you rarely get feedback or whether they like it or not.

754
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,819
A lot of people are sort of telling you what you want to hear.

755
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:46,500
A lot of the time, that's why you get married, I reckon,

756
00:33:46,579 --> 00:33:49,599
because that's, you get sorted out there pretty much.

757
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,380
I'd certainly do, which is good, very good.

758
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:54,819
So I find, yeah, that just kind of,

759
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:57,700
just being able to talk on a common theme or a common thread about,

760
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,519
yeah, what we're all going through is, yeah, extremely,

761
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,099
it's motivating.

762
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:06,619
And as I said, it's, I feel like it's reinforcing, which is nice.

763
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:09,480
And Ivan, the sessions are an hour and 15 long

764
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,940
and busy people are able to, we find,

765
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:13,599
fit that into a schedule and you can,

766
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,480
and make that work, you know, a huge amount on your plate.

767
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,119
And I know Matt's put a lot of time into the sophistication

768
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:23,519
of making sure that hour and 15 gives people the maximum amount

769
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,099
of impact for their valuable time.

770
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:28,059
And he's put a lot of thought into it.

771
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:31,139
There's some brilliance in the simplicity of the facilitation.

772
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,239
Have you found that you get enough out of the hour and 15?

773
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,579
That's interesting you say that, because I didn't know that.

774
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,320
However he's done it, he's come up with it.

775
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,179
I reckon that's absolutely the perfect time.

776
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,519
Because I never felt like we haven't got,

777
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,619
through what we needed to, I never felt rushed.

778
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,360
Just never felt too long or, so I feel like it's perfect.

779
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:52,440
Probably what I didn't mention before is I think sometimes the beauty

780
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,380
of these conversations are it actually gets you out of your own misery

781
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:00,699
or head or thoughts where you can actually sit down and listen

782
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:04,920
to someone else's and, and offer something, you know, and that's,

783
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,519
that's good, hopefully good for them.

784
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:07,420
That's good for you too.

785
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,159
It's good to sort of think, oh, you know,

786
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:13,320
I'm hopefully helping someone in a completely different space that I

787
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,420
know.

788
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,280
I've never even thought of, of that, you know?

789
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,139
So I think it's actually good in that sense too,

790
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:20,500
just to, just to get you out of your own head and your own stuff.

791
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,539
Um, you know, with people that are smart and going through similar stuff.

792
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,139
I love the group you're in, Gus Wallen, one of the great people and true gentleman

793
00:35:29,139 --> 00:35:33,559
in life, Nathan Paris is a extraordinary individual in his world.

794
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:36,800
Both of them have had the privilege to sit down in this format with Leon Cameron,

795
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,980
one of my oldest friends, as it turns out.

796
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,639
And Jack Trengove, just a super impressive young person and everything Jack has done

797
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,000
throughout.

798
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,699
Uh, his life and, uh, success leaves clues is something we talk about a lot.

799
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:52,119
I would love to ask you, we feel like there is some, uh, patterns around why people have

800
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:55,840
success like you and one of the great success stories in recent times.

801
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,539
And we think that idea of self-leadership is where it starts for people.

802
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:02,920
That's hard to have an impact on others if you don't have an idea of your own sense of

803
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,920
self-leadership.

804
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,920
What does that mean to you?

805
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,920
Yeah.

806
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,920
Well, I agree.

807
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,940
As I said, I've sort of worn a, I don't know, like a, probably a different path.

808
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,039
I think a lot of, a lot of guys.

809
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:18,199
Certainly in our industry and, or probably even sport, um, in general, probably in Australia

810
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:19,199
there.

811
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:22,519
I think the general trend now is people do a lot more time in a, in an apprenticeship

812
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:25,440
type role, whether it's an assistant coach or coaching it.

813
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,280
Even if it's in, uh, NFL, like in VFL teams or in rugby league, it's, you know, lower

814
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,280
grades.

815
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,920
Uh, I probably didn't spend a lot of time doing that.

816
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,739
Just from a, as a, from a leadership point of view for me, um, you know, I captained

817
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:38,739
sort of teams when I was young.

818
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:41,139
I think I didn't really think of myself as a leader.

819
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:42,139
I just probably cared.

820
00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:42,840
Yeah.

821
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:47,659
I didn't know a lot about the team, uh, that I was in more so maybe than others.

822
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:51,400
And I feel like my, my parents sort of instilled a lot of that stuff in there.

823
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,099
They were very competitive people.

824
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:57,360
And then, um, yeah, as I said, I fell into coaching and the only reason is that someone

825
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,360
saw it in me.

826
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,320
I didn't really see it in myself, but they saw it in me.

827
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,320
So I thought, well, that's going to make confidence.

828
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,320
I thought, okay.

829
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,900
And then I had started and as I said, I got into it.

830
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,199
I was a head coach after only three years of coaching after playing.

831
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:11,199
Didn't know, think honestly, didn't know anything really.

832
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,199
Bobbled my way through it.

833
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:12,920
Survived.

834
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:15,440
Do it completely different now.

835
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,800
I mean, I learned pretty much the first sort of one of my early mentors, I suppose, as

836
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,840
a player, uh, taught me more about the game than anyone else on miles, but he pretty much

837
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,800
told me not to delegate as a coach.

838
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,800
Yeah.

839
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,079
It's more like a, well, you know, if you leave it up to them, like at the end of the day,

840
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:36,059
you're the one that's going to, you're the one that's going to get the ass, you know?

841
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:37,840
So that's how I started.

842
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,820
I pretty much didn't delegate anything.

843
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,900
Whereas now I basically delegate everything.

844
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:48,420
Uh, as much as I can, uh, so I've gone full circle there and luckily for me, I've just

845
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:53,820
been able to survive for a long time, but you know, and that's honestly, I feel like,

846
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,320
you know, for the big part of my career, I was surviving.

847
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:03,559
I was happy to make the finals or stay in the job or, you know, just keep your head

848
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:04,559
above water.

849
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,199
You know, I didn't think that at the time, but I look back and thought I was definitely

850
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:09,199
like that.

851
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,539
And I was lucky enough to get a team where I felt we could win.

852
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,539
Yeah.

853
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:16,639
It just changed everything and just went, well, you know, obviously more confident and

854
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:18,260
using people around me a lot more.

855
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:23,599
That was the power of delegation has been huge, you know, highlight for me.

856
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,280
I still remember the first time I did it and how good I felt, you know, how like stress

857
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,300
relieved and which was pretty cool.

858
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:34,260
And I suppose, so yeah, I've just, um, yeah, I've just learned along the way and I'm still

859
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:39,920
learning and, and I think that's what probably keeps me, you know, excited about the job.

860
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,920
357 games in before you win your, your first.

861
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,420
Yeah.

862
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:43,539
Premiership.

863
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:48,480
You'd coached a grand final in 2011 at the warriors and I, I had the privilege of talking

864
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,340
to Craig McRae, just won the AFL grand final with Collingwood, um, a few weeks back and

865
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:56,460
a lot of similarity in my mind around the two of you, Craig was a bit the same.

866
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,300
He didn't see himself as a senior coach for 18 years.

867
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,780
He took a longer time, but really didn't plan on doing it.

868
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:08,239
But delegation, you know, is probably where he has got the superpower now to the trust

869
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:10,539
he's got in everyone and the way he's able to do that.

870
00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:11,539
It sounds like a.

871
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:12,539
Yeah.

872
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:14,920
The youth level, a set of values that you're talking about today.

873
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,679
We, we, we see leaders in positions of, uh, success like yours, conscious about how they

874
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,039
positively impact people in their environment every day.

875
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:24,420
And they think about that consciously.

876
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,079
Is that something that impact on others in a positive way that you think about?

877
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,079
Absolutely.

878
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:33,059
You know, it's, um, I mean, you, you know, you, you hear things I've been reading fairly

879
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:34,059
early in my career.

880
00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:39,539
Like, you know, it's, it's a lot of the stuff that people will see from you is, is not sorry,

881
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:40,539
exactly that singing.

882
00:39:40,539 --> 00:39:41,539
It won't be.

883
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:46,840
necessarily what you're saying or it's how you conduct yourself it's how you even your body

884
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:53,420
language at times um you know even the way you like you react to a certain situation everyone's

885
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:58,539
watching all the time and i still feel that's i don't always remember that but it's a good thing

886
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:03,880
to to remember you know if you if you're dragging your heels about something or you're walking to

887
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:08,300
work and you're distracted by something else you know people feel that and that's gonna that's

888
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:13,000
gonna have a negative effect on the day which means in a day that's part of part of your season

889
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,679
so that's the first thing the second thing is you know i love to i don't you know i don't think

890
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:24,420
about this all the time and i still still struggle to comprehend that sort of positive impact that

891
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:30,659
you can have on the smallest things doing the smallest things but but it's there and i i feel

892
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:36,480
really lucky and blessed to be able to do that i don't try to look i don't i don't get looking for

893
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,239
it but i do know i do

894
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:38,280
know i do know i do know i do know i do know i do know i do know i do know i do know i do know

895
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,800
now i think you know what i probably should have taken a little bit more time uh yeah when you don't

896
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:49,760
do it you know did i just walk straight past that guy and when i felt like deep down maybe he wanted

897
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,619
to talk but i was busy i had something else on or whatever i'm still learning about that i still

898
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:58,460
have to actually check myself a fair bit about that the other day i'm an introvert uh which can

899
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:07,860
be it can be um the opposite of what you need to be sometimes um i love you know i love talking to

900
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:12,000
people i love hanging out with people and all that stuff but i also like you know talking to

901
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,900
myself as well so that's always a struggle for me yeah and authentically yourself i think comes

902
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:22,039
across in everything you do uh to you can be an extrovert 6 a.m after your third premiership at

903
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:28,400
the right time if you if you caught at the right moment i uh i enjoyed uh listening to that fact

904
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,280
but even you know the humility that came across in that interview if you haven't heard um you and

905
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,800
carl stefanovic a big broncos fan go head-to-head that morning certainly made

906
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,980
made me laugh but creating and sharing a vision is uh something we see really leaders are conscious

907
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:48,159
of and you don't achieve your success without a really clear vision have you gone about that in

908
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:54,699
in your environment i agree uh i thought a lot about vision and and something that that needed

909
00:41:54,699 --> 00:42:01,360
to be you know never-ending essentially so for example if he did climb everest and win a

910
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:06,840
premiership the vision that had nothing to do with nothing to do so much with that so our vision at

911
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,460
is to be a source of community pride that's and that's it i feel like in that sense it's so many

912
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:18,940
things so it's more than just about how we perform on the field although that's obviously a big part

913
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:26,780
of it it's you know how we present ourselves to our fans um when we're alone you know in like in

914
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:33,559
the streets and function in a restaurant at a pub at a school driving you know sitting at the lights

915
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:37,780
whatever we're always on the show like we're always you know that's and and

916
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:44,260
we have the ability to be able to affect the mood and the confidence and the and the pride in our

917
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:49,500
community which is we take very seriously and we actually feel that more now because we have

918
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,079
had some success you know and you can actually see it it becomes tangible like wow that's but

919
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,219
what it also does is then when that bar goes up you've got to keep jumping it so that's a driving

920
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:05,780
real driving force for us and it'll be the same again when we kick off soon and forget about all

921
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:13,039
if we can first things first and that's we're always trying to be a source of pride for our

922
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:18,219
community if they can be proud of what we do and we can make them feel good about that then

923
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:22,360
that's going to be a pretty good feeling for us i love it you know source of pride for

924
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:28,019
your community and it it's fascinating so not in a lot of clubs you hear this we exist to win

925
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:34,219
premierships and that language is at the top of the tree but for you that comes after bringing

926
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:37,780
that pride to the penrith community well yeah i think if we're

927
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:44,639
generally speaking if if we are a source of pride then we're probably doing a lot of the

928
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:50,079
stuff that's going to get us you know achievement that's sort of how yeah it'll like say the spoke

929
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:56,480
before about it culturally and how it looks and that you know that that that all you know it all

930
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,320
lines up there you know as well if our community's proud of us we're going to be doing a lot of good

931
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:05,940
stuff and if they're not if they're if they're not what are we doing wrong and it won't take

932
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,780
longer to realize that we're not actually living

933
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:13,019
to the news that we you know we believe in so leaders are really curious i'm and through

934
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:18,000
curiosity they're constantly trying to learn and get better does curiosity play a part in

935
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,119
in your leadership yeah definitely i love reading don't do it probably enough thank god for podcasts

936
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,559
because that's um you know that makes life a lot easier doesn't it uh just being able to absorb

937
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:36,239
you know information whether it's uh i kind of i just i look in different places for it um an

938
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:37,780
obvious one is you know any

939
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:44,480
um i love you know just i'm very curious around other sports and there's so many different ways

940
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:51,760
you can find little pearls of wisdom i've been very um influenced by you know some of the great

941
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,599
sporting leaders over time um just just little nuggets of gold here and there that you don't

942
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,980
need a lot of things that i think but it's just stuff that actually goes you know what that you

943
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:07,500
kind of relate to and go that's yeah that would work for us or i might i'm going to look into

944
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,280
always looking for that sort of stuff so communicating with clarity uh dimensional

945
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:17,039
leadership we talk about a lot ivan and you mentioned being an introvert and you can you

946
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:23,300
can see that in in your personality type but you're very clear your communication is very

947
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:28,800
direct from all that i've seen of you in the past and talking to you now is that a conscious thing

948
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,840
for you how have you gone about that the only thing conscious has been making sure you know

949
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,780
i'm authentic i learned that early in my life i've been very conscious of myself and i've been

950
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:47,239
very conscious of my coaching career i started at the roosters i was i was coaching the reserve grade

951
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:55,219
team i worked on ricky stewart was the coach in those days ricky was a very different very different

952
00:45:55,219 --> 00:46:00,360
coaching style to me in those days i thought watching him i thought well that's sort of how

953
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:05,179
you're going to do it you know so you know i could say my first year i just thought what am i doing

954
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,940
just this is i don't feel like

955
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:14,599
doesn't feel right to me and so i i made a change and just yeah kind of went to my own style i've

956
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:19,380
stayed that way ever since so that's the only that's really the only deliberate thing that i

957
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:25,239
do i don't really in terms of how i communicate you know i don't waste words so too much unless

958
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:28,619
i've had a few too many drinks so i could talk a bit of shit with the best of them then

959
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:33,179
unfortunately you can't turn up to work like that so yeah uh i think i probably have got a direct

960
00:46:33,179 --> 00:46:36,559
style which i've at the end of the day i think most people relate to

961
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:37,780
how important is that for you

962
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:46,239
uh everything yeah everything i love that style i love getting people's opinions

963
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:52,840
i get it you know at the end of the day most the buck will stop with me on most things if not all

964
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,619
of them honestly even though you're delegating all that at the end of the day like as i said

965
00:46:56,619 --> 00:47:01,719
before the performance of the team that's with me that's on me but i love getting people's input

966
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:07,139
you know i love getting different views and then and then for me to be able to from that

967
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,079
point of view to be able to say okay this is this is where we're going to go i just think it's i think

968
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:14,559
that's one of the great things about coaching it's that's actually how you learn you just pick up

969
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:20,199
little nuggets from people you least expect you know it could be like a like an intern or something

970
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:26,139
it could be anyone you know and i just feel that's um yeah i feel that's an essential part it's easier

971
00:47:26,139 --> 00:47:31,079
when you get older i think um because you yeah it's easier to be a little insecure from time to

972
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:35,860
time and you feel like oh if i'm supposed to be the head coach you know like i'm feeling like this

973
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,780
guy knows more than i do or he's smarter than me and i'm like yeah i'm going to be the head coach

974
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:44,360
you know that takes a bit of time to to be able to get over i reckon and and just you know be able

975
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:49,460
to i guess establish that maturity and confidence um and i feel like at the moment i'm certainly

976
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:54,820
at a better place there to be able to yeah collaborate properly i mean who's been the

977
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:03,280
greatest leader in your life uh i think probably probably my dad he actually had a fair bit to do

978
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,340
with me in sport as a kid i was the youngest of three brothers and

979
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:13,039
he didn't coach my brothers in anything but he coached me in soccer he's quite influential in

980
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:18,300
athletics that we did a lot of as a kid i actually played cricket with him actually played cricket

981
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:23,659
like park cricket with my brothers and my dad uh for a couple of seasons and that like just stuff

982
00:48:23,659 --> 00:48:28,420
like that like just like i think i said before my dad's a very conservative like pretty straight dude

983
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:35,579
like very straight you know if he could manipulate stuff to win something he would do it you know

984
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,639
like you know like the old uh underarm

985
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:44,699
bowl my dad yeah he thought that was okay that's in the rules you you can do it and that was it

986
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:49,579
that's that you know so not really like that i don't think i was sort of always looking at that

987
00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:55,900
going geez i'm not sure about that anyway but you know i did i did sort of like the pragmatic

988
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:02,840
way of winning it stuck with me forever you know and i still kind of think of i think of him a lot

989
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:07,599
actually when we make decisions or do stuff and i think oh my god is that is that a bit

990
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,880
of a line in terms of you know i think oh no the old man's like he's super straight if he thinks

991
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,860
it's all right i reckon we should do it if you want an idea of how tight the cleary uh family

992
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:22,579
and brothers are you you gave a kidney to older brother ash at a time where you know it was either

993
00:49:22,579 --> 00:49:27,119
you or your other brother and the the testing came out that yours was the most compatible and

994
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,380
understand that was not even a blip on the radar for you you're always

995
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:37,059
going to look after the brother can you tell us about that yeah um it sort of came uh fairly

996
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:42,820
i know i think uh ash first when he first found out that he had some kidney kidney damage they

997
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:47,659
were talking like 20 years he might have to get one and like i think it was like maybe 18 months

998
00:49:47,659 --> 00:49:53,519
later mate you know then your kidney so i didn't know anything about donation really i didn't know

999
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:58,900
how it worked um mom just called one day and said hey we've all got to try and you know get tested

1000
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:03,440
because you know family's the best match and so i was like okay like yeah and then so we

1001
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,280
the only thing i really checked was um you know if i

1002
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:12,280
you know is it sort of like hereditary through the family and if i give one is that what if my

1003
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,840
kids need one you know that was the only sort of thing we really checked up and once that was sort

1004
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:24,079
of you know it was pretty much okay i was actually quite thrilled that i got the gig um so i

1005
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:30,159
definitely had the best kidney in our family just that's just for bragging rights um and i yeah i

1006
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:35,400
got the gong so um that was just from there it was just yeah full steam ahead you get all the tests

1007
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:37,639
it's quite a it's quite a pretty full on

1008
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:44,599
process it takes quite a while but to be able to do that for my brother like made me feel good you

1009
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:50,199
know like it's of course it helped him but like oh it was sort of like a bit of a euphoric moment

1010
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:57,840
for me too to be able to be able to do that you know and yeah he's still going strong uh what was

1011
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:05,380
that 27 so six years now so i mean i'm i couldn't tell don't feel any different so everything's

1012
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:11,199
going okay for me too are you closer on the back of it um i guess so we're pretty close before that

1013
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:18,639
uh he's my best man um always been pretty pretty you know tight with my brother so probably i mean

1014
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:25,139
yeah he ended up he's got three kidneys and i've only got one so i feel you know he's one out of

1015
00:51:25,139 --> 00:51:31,139
it but anyway we're a bit obsessed with uh collaboration and what we're trying to achieve

1016
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:34,800
with a leader and a leader connect and as we said earlier we're really privileged to have uh

1017
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,340
you

1018
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:39,539
part of uh that program and i like asking this question in the spirit of that is it has it been

1019
00:51:39,539 --> 00:51:44,800
someone you thought i'd love to collaborate with that person on anything in your life that you

1020
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,119
love to get into your sphere is there a name that jumps out at you in terms of collaboration

1021
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:55,300
yeah not really i reckon there'd be so many i would be open to you know if you sort of you

1022
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:59,860
just threw one out if you ran me out one day and said hey what about doing a work with this guy

1023
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:04,800
probably go yep um yeah so no one particularly in particular but

1024
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:10,579
you know i just think there's so many there's so many cool things that everyone does but if it's

1025
00:52:10,579 --> 00:52:15,940
from like a leadership perspective there's a lot of a lot of commonalities in and around because

1026
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:19,920
at the end of the day we're all what doesn't matter what sport business it's all about people

1027
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:28,019
um i think and you know if you can um do some stuff cross codes and all that or cross business

1028
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:33,659
uh i think that would be pretty fun well i mean i love the wisdom that you shared today and your
