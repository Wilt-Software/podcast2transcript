00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,179
I hope you enjoyed this episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast with one of my great friends in

2
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:14,060
life, Bob Murphy. Bob, to me, one of the most sincere, articulate, funny, but also equally

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:19,019
strong people I've had the privilege to call a mate for many years now. Always value any chance

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,780
to spend some time with him. And over the course of this chat, we cover a lot of ground, Bob's

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:29,059
unique family background, his leadership style, and his values come out a lot in this conversation.

6
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:34,759
You only hear the full unedited version of the time that I belted him in a practice match,

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,259
which hasn't been told in this way before. His reflection on the Bulldogs' 2016 Premiership

8
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:46,679
win and Luke Beveridge handing him the Premiership medal. And the great story of Mendo Monday and his

9
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:52,780
very short-lived online friendship with legendary actor Ben Middleton. Amongst many more, I'm sure

10
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,320
it's going to be an enjoyable conversation that I hope you enjoy as much as I did. It's a unique

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,039
leadership story.

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:04,859

28
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:29,740
Big thanks as always to our friends at Temper. Over 17 years and 312 games, Bob Murphy carved

29
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,719
out a hall of fame career, saw him captain the Western Bulldogs and become one of the greatest

30
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:40,080
figures in the club's 140 year history. He was voted by his peers as the captain of the year,

31
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:43,719
a two-time All-Australian, including being awarded the All-Australian captaincy,

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,879
married to his childhood love, Justine, a proud father of three, and one of the most principled

33
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:55,879
and values-driven people I know and lucky enough to call him a great friend. Good to sit down with

34
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:59,419
you, mate. That's a lovely intro, mate.

35
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:08,620
And you and I have a long history of jousting and taking, not just taking the piss, but just

36
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,960
actually giving each other verbal jabs to the point where if people overheard us, they think,

37
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:21,439
are these two actually mates? But we don't get to see each other nearly as often enough as we would

38
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,219
like. And thank you for those kind words, but I just love being in the same room with you. And

39
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:29,659
I've always found you fascinating to talk to.

40
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,979
I've always found you fascinating to talk about many aspects of footy and life and family and

41
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:35,659
just looking forward to it.

42
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,639
Very kind of you, mate. And yeah, there's a long history and I'm going to start at the start

43
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,580
and you'll know where I'm going to start because I remember this day really vividly. I get a call

44
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:51,120
from, I think it was Scott Clayton that said, you know, you can go and pick up our number one

45
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,080
pick. You were picked 13 in 1999 and I loosely get the address and I drive down this sort of

46
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,659
street. I think you're living with your sister.

47
00:03:58,659 --> 00:03:59,659
I was a living.

48
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,199
I was on a mattress on my sister's land room floor in a flat in North Melbourne.

49
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:11,000
And so I remember pulling into the driveway and I see this sort of figure come out and I think,

50
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:15,539
oh, that's good. He's got his little brother staying with him. You had no shoes on from,

51
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:22,160
tell me if I'm making any of this up. You weren't carrying a bag given training was going to happen.

52
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:29,420
I thought that that's actually the kid who's going to be our number one player who comes with this

53
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:29,720
incredible, incredible, incredible, incredible, incredible, incredible, incredible, incredible,

54
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,759
incredible reputation from Warrnambool. And I see the town of Warragal.

55
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,839
Let me take that back.

56
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,439
The town of Warragal has just.

57
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,579
Did I just say Warrnambool?

58
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:45,699
They've just, people have either run off the road or they've just thrown a glass against the wall.

59
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,540
Well, I'm Cameron from, of course I know you're the great man from, from Warragal. It's a long way from that day, mate, isn't it?

60
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:59,639
Mate. Um, yeah, the, the, the cliche of, oh, it goes in, you know, in a blink and, but then in other ways, it's like,

61
00:04:59,639 --> 00:04:59,699
yeah, it's a little bit of a, it's a little bit of a, it's a little bit of a, it's a little bit of a, it's a little bit of a, it's a little bit of a,

62
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,959
That does just feel like such a long, long time ago.

63
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,360
And everything you said was totally, totally true.

64
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:12,819
I think the more interesting part was that I thought you were weird for having a bag

65
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:16,680
and having your bag packed and your towel folded.

66
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:23,100
One thing I do remember from that time, which I think this probably paints as much of a picture as anything,

67
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:29,100
I do remember not having hair under my arms and getting to the club, an AFL club.

68
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,939
I'm 17 and I would do chin-ups the other way from the rest of you lot

69
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:40,939
because I was so self-conscious of like, I'm a boy, you know.

70
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:43,439
Which is amazing when you think about it.

71
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,860
And I'm not joking when you were down the driveway.

72
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,980
I honestly thought there's no way that could be, like I was a boy too at 17,

73
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,439
but not to the level that you were.

74
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,660
But then you got in the car and you had a presence about you.

75
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,040
Straight away.

76
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:06,060
And for those that don't know, you start asking questions and soon enough you find out

77
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:12,259
you're the third born Monica and John Murphy, beautiful people, two of the most extraordinary people.

78
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,759
Your dad was a Catholic priest, mum was a nun.

79
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:17,620
It's one of the great stories of all time.

80
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,019
They fall in love, they decide to start a family.

81
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,040
And I look at you now and I said in the opener, one of the most values-driven people I know.

82
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,040
I see that knowingly.

83
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,779
Knowing your family.

84
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,519
Do you?

85
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:32,279
No doubt.

86
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:32,540
Yeah.

87
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:38,259
And I think it's one of those things, it's probably the older you get,

88
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,160
and I certainly think for most people when you become a parent,

89
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,000
you certainly see your parents in a different light and the influence they had on you.

90
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:55,439
And sometimes there's moments of like, you either say things or act in a certain way and go,

91
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,540
well, that was dad.

92
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:58,000
That was my dad.

93
00:06:58,139 --> 00:06:59,019
Well, that was my dad.

94
00:06:59,019 --> 00:06:59,079
That was my dad.

95
00:06:59,079 --> 00:06:59,939
That was my mum.

96
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:06,660
But yeah, mum and dad, in a very sort of typical sense, we're in a pretty conservative country town.

97
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:14,240
And mum being a nun in a former life and dad being a Catholic priest and then them meeting

98
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,100
and falling in love and having children, as a teenager, I was embarrassed about it.

99
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,560
I didn't tell anyone about that.

100
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:21,699
Really?

101
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,319
Well, when you're that age, you want to fit in, you don't want to be different.

102
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,899
And in the town that I grew up in,

103
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:32,480
being different was not really what I wanted.

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,360
And then you get a little bit older and you sort of go the other way completely.

105
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,120
And I went the other way at pace.

106
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:45,860
I hit a certain time in my life and going, I don't want to be like anyone else.

107
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,339
And I think a part of that confidence is mum and dad's love story.

108
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,079
And I think that's probably, no, it is.

109
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,740
It's not probably.

110
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,740
It is the cornerstone of our family.

111
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:07,860
I think it's the thing that we have most pride in of, it's a pure love story.

112
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,800
And whilst it sounds from a distance, because it's 40 years ago now, whatever,

113
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:16,439
and oh, dad was a priest and mum was a nun and then they met and fell in love.

114
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:18,939
But it was controversial.

115
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,199
Like it really was a, that was a controversial time.

116
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,779
And there's family members who were refusing to go to the wedding because it was wrong,

117
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,040
you know,

118
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,060
perceived as wrong.

119
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,279
They get married.

120
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:36,419
And as, you know, there's a bit of history in, in, uh, in religion of, you know, you

121
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,600
go through a crisis, head to the desert.

122
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,700
And so mum and dad moved to Alice Springs.

123
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,980
And I only find this, find this out as an adult, but they move there just to get out

124
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,480
of the scandal, almost go away.

125
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,759
Let's start a family away from all of that negative energy, I suppose, to some degree.

126
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,879
But, um, it's something.

127
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:07,700
But yeah, whilst I was embarrassed about it when I was 12, now I'm like, it's probably

128
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,519
a very core thing in my heart of immense pride.

129
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:15,220
And when you think back, you know, moving to Alice Springs, you literally moved to another

130
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,100
planet, you know, no internet, no phones.

131
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:19,860
So you literally could start a new life.

132
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:20,679
And that's what people did.

133
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,179
And you went up to the Northern Territory.

134
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:28,720
It was not an uncommon thing, you know, knowing your mum and dad over the years and they are,

135
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,299
you know, two of the most beautiful people you'll ever meet.

136
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:35,679
And, and I can see, you know, that imprint on you, but yeah, I didn't really see in that

137
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:41,899
perspective around the shame and the controversy part of it that, um, did their family come

138
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:42,879
to terms with it in the end?

139
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:49,799
Like, well, we're Irish Catholic and look, we're not a very pious family.

140
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,100
I do want to get that point across because often people get, you know, you'd sell people,

141
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,700
oh yeah, dad was a priest, mum was a nun, and they sort of, oh, you're not going to

142
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,539
start quoting scripture to me, are you?

143
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,019
You're capable of doing that.

144
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:02,320
Well.

145
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:02,980
If required.

146
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:09,379
Well, on call, I'd be certainly what would be softly a lapsed Catholic.

147
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,519
Let's just leave it at that.

148
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:17,539
But, um, yeah, but I, I, mum and dad are not pious and they're, they're quite progressive

149
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:23,220
and, um, and left-leaning and very much community-based and all that sort of thing.

150
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:28,519
But the family is so big as an Irish, both Irish Catholic families.

151
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,379
There's, I mean, there's heaps of us.

152
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,299
There was a family reunion we had.

153
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:39,600
It was like, you lift up a table, it was like scattering of mice of like kids with freckles

154
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,500
and crooked teeth.

155
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,620
That's kind of what it looked like.

156
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,100
The thousands, it looked like a festival.

157
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,600
You know, you're taking me back.

158
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,759
There's so many places to go, but the pleasure of touring Ireland with you, uh, would have

159
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:54,399
been 2001 or was it 2001?

160
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,620
One or two, yeah.

161
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,700
And I can remember walking onto the bus and, you know, walking around.

162
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,360
It was funny enough to represent Australia with you, but all the little Irish kids, Jesus

163
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,080
Murphy, what the hell are you doing?

164
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:06,019
You're a bastard.

165
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,580
The worst Irish accent you've ever heard in your life there.

166
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,340
But I thought I was Irish being Darcy, but they were like, you're playing for the wrong

167
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:13,899
team, Murphy.

168
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:20,039
Well, I, yeah, I mean, we're Murphys and, and look, there was some Irishness in our

169
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:22,460
family, but I'm at a low level.

170
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,879
Like we watch, we had a VHS of The Commitments.

171
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:28,360
We watched Belly Kiss Angel on a Sunday night.

172
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:36,320
And we had a Furies CD, but there wasn't like, we weren't, you know, like drinking green

173
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,700
beer on St. Patrick's day.

174
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:43,799
And it wasn't that sort of thing, but going to that, that, that international Irish trip.

175
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:47,919
I mean, you, you were an established star of the game and it was the who's who.

176
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,080
And my life had gone from being a school kid to then stepping into the AFL world, which

177
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,759
for me was like a fantasy camp.

178
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,600
Like it was surreal.

179
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,960
It was totally like, oh, I can't quite comprehend that.

180
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:08,379
Like almost walking up to Chris Grant and like, you know, poking his arm with my finger

181
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:10,000
of like, is that actually real?

182
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,539
Or is that, and then 18 months later, oh, you've been called up to play for Australia

183
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:17,159
over in Ireland, flying business class.

184
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,039
And you'll be sitting next to Craig Bradley.

185
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:25,679
And I'm like, it was, it was all sort of, it sort of seemed normal at the time, but

186
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,500
it's not normal.

187
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,159
Your life goes from zero to a hundred miles per hour in a very, very short period of time.

188
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,840
And I hadn't ever really thought about my Irishness, but the bus pulled up, we were

189
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:42,600
playing Dublin city in the back streets of Dublin, like a pretty rough part of Dublin,

190
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,539
just as a bit of a warm up.

191
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,759
And I remember the bus stopped and all of a sudden there was this whack, whack, whack.

192
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:53,820
And we turned around and this group of Irish kids were throwing rocks at the windows of

193
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,299
the bus.

194
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:56,419
And I looked at them and they were aged from.

195
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,120
Six to 12 and every one of them could have been me.

196
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,259
I was just like, oh, wow.

197
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,980
It's like, geez, that, uh, I probably am pretty Irish.

198
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,340
And then of course I get on the field and I don't know if you, I, I don't know if you're

199
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,559
allowed to swear, you can beep it out, but the, my opponent next to me stood.

200
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:19,320
And as the ball was a long way away, he looked at the back of my shirt and it said, Murphy,

201
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,559
he said, Murphy, you should be playing for us.

202
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,039
You can't.

203
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,259
Which.

204
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,039
Uh, doesn't surprise me at all and, and makes me laugh and you undersell yourself because

205
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:31,620
you're right.

206
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,600
You're a young, uh, emerging star of the game and you, you, you, you win your spot in that

207
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,559
team on merit because people could see the brilliance in you.

208
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:43,320
You're perfect for the Gaelic game and perfect for Australian rules as well.

209
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:48,259
But, but I still remember, you know, the Ruckman word is sort of like, you might've had a good

210
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:51,100
year, but what the hell are we going to do with you in Gaelic football?

211
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,240
And, and this is you, you might've been, you know, looking at Craig Bradley and everyone

212
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,600
else.

213
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:56,299
But I remember.

214
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:02,320
About 12 of us had a go in Gaelic and you're laughing cause you know, no one wants to be

215
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,080
the goalkeeper.

216
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:08,480
And I reckon I had one minute and may have, may have sort of ducked to get out the way

217
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,960
of the ball.

218
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,820
And all I can hear is.

219
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,200
It wasn't, you just had a moment.

220
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:16,720
It wasn't, you were a very, very brave player and one of the bravest I ever played with,

221
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:19,679
but you had a moment that was not your bravest.

222
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,799
And when you have those moments, no one is more aware of it than Robert Murphy.

223
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:24,919
And I could hear you chuckle.

224
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:29,679
I can remember hearing you chuckle and then there was a, there was just a look.

225
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:31,000
They didn't need to even say anything.

226
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,440
That's been the banter over the course of many, many years.

227
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,659
And, and in preparation for this, cause I have done some preparation.

228
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:43,019
I was thinking, I feel like you can get decades of your life, Bob, condensed to a couple of

229
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:43,700
sound bites.

230
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,820
And I, I'm 48 now.

231
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,259
And you sort of.

232
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:48,019
You moisturise though.

233
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:50,059
You look, you look about 32.

234
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,879
I'm feeling like I've been having a good run.

235
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,419
You look good.

236
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,379
I look about 68.

237
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:53,620
68.

238
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:58,279
And the sound bites come back over time.

239
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:00,259
So you can have 30 years in the industry.

240
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:01,159
Those little moments.

241
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,559
And those sound bites, a couple of them, you are intimately involved in and we need to

242
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,179
address them.

243
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:12,740
One of them is this story that, and it's quite timely because the Brownlow medal was last

244
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,740
night here in Melbourne, that I hosted a party for myself because I thought I was going to

245
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,580
win the Brownlow and you were there at said party.

246
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:24,100
And the second one hasn't aged well.

247
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:24,279
Yeah.

248
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:24,299
Yeah.

249
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:24,360
Yeah.

250
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,419
Yeah.

251
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:24,440
Yeah.

252
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:24,460
Yeah.

253
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:24,480
Yeah.

254
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:24,500
Yeah.

255
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:24,519
Yeah.

256
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:24,559
Yeah.

257
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:24,620
Yeah.

258
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:27,980
King hitting you in an intra club practice match.

259
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,860
And I was telling this story to my daughter last night and say, I'm catching up with Bob

260
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,480
Murphy tomorrow.

261
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,600
And what are you going to talk about?

262
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,980
She said, like, like everyone else, you hit Bob Murphy, like one of the most loved figures

263
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,820
in the history of the game.

264
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,039
What were you thinking?

265
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,559
Can we put him to bed?

266
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,759
Can I, can I actually move on from them on the back of this conversation?

267
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:54,799
I actually think this story has done the rounds enough of poor Bob.

268
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:54,899
Yeah.

269
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,879
And what a thug Luke Darcy is.

270
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:58,700
One hundred percent.

271
00:15:58,779 --> 00:15:59,580
And I deserve it.

272
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,440
And I'm, but I like at times to be a contrarian.

273
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,980
Even in the moment, I was like, I kind of got what I deserved.

274
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm being brutally honest.

275
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,460
I, I think there was a little part of me that wanted it.

276
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:24,299
I pushed you and I pushed you and I knew that there was a nickname around for you of Bambi

277
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:26,039
because you would fall over.

278
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,379
And I knew enough about.

279
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:30,659
Given to me by Tony Liberatore, which you knew you always got a nerve.

280
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:35,159
And I just knew enough just about the tightening of the jaw when you'd get called Bambi and

281
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,159
go, Ooh, I've got a little weak spot here.

282
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,259
A little, it's just a little sensitive spot.

283
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:44,820
And so we play this practice match and I start up on you about Bambi.

284
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh, Bambi, Bambi, you pulled out.

285
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:47,419
Oh, you.

286
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,919
In an intra-club practice game.

287
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,919
Intra-club practice match.

288
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:54,259
But the part that I, that people won't know, and no one wants to hear this part because,

289
00:16:54,259 --> 00:17:00,100
because the, the, the wild part about this is Rodney E before the start of that game.

290
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:00,419
Yep.

291
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:01,799
Pulling me aside.

292
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,500
I'm captain.

293
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,160
Crucial part of the story, this.

294
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:05,160
That's been overlooked.

295
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,599
Rocket hasn't taken his part of the.

296
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:13,000
This is a, there's a, there's a triangle to this story and Rodney gets left out, but go on.

297
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:13,619
I remember this clearly.

298
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,599
Hey mate, everything's going well.

299
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,559
Really happy with pre-season, but I want you to start a fight in the intra-club practice game.

300
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,839
And I went to him, what are you talking about, mate?

301
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,140
This is our senior coach.

302
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,759
He said, mate, I get the feeling everyone's too nice.

303
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,359
I reckon you start a fight.

304
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:31,200
I want to see how everyone reacts.

305
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,779
So I sort of run out on the ground and going.

306
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:38,400
You're sizing up the menu of who you're like, well, garlic needs one.

307
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,099
It was a long week.

308
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,119
Harrison could probably do with a clip.

309
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:46,460
And then suddenly this sort of voice in my ear, hey Bambi, did you pull out of the last contest?

310
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,460
It was just sort of this like epiphany.

311
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,200
It's like, okay, the world's saying start a fight.

312
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,240
Now I had no intention.

313
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:59,359
I had no intention of, of what happened was, you know, I'll give you a little round arm around there.

314
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:17,900
I'll throw you to the ground and you were like, you know, like what it, you know, and then I've done my bit and we'll see what happens, but I'll never forget as I swung my arm around your peripheral vision and the noise it made, it just was like, I was like, oh my God, this is so, so bad.

315
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,140
And I can remember the looks on the faces of the couple of people who saw it.

316
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,460
They were like, you could.

317
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:31,859
Six foot six giant at the peak of his football powers and this prepubescent kid lying motionless on the ground.

318
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:34,599
But you should have got 12 weeks suspension.

319
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:37,460
That was how bad it was and how bad it looked.

320
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,839
But the interesting, but once it happened and Will Minson or someone, I thought I've got to keep going.

321
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:45,400
Well, in for a penny, in for a pound.

322
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,640
I started Bob, I've got, and I'll knock you out too, you big dumb fucking German.

323
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:50,720
I think was what I said.

324
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,400
So that just sort of doubled.

325
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:59,519
I sat down on this crazy act and I remember going off and my heart's sinking going, this is an awful, awful thing.

326
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,819
I knew straight away and Rockets distance himself.

327
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,619
Like he's looked at me and gone, I had nothing to do with that.

328
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,140
There's no email trail here.

329
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,319
And mate, your response was brilliant.

330
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,279
I thought what you, because you had no idea.

331
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,940
I think you genuinely, did you know it was me?

332
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:15,380
I did.

333
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:15,720
Yeah.

334
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:16,539
Straight away.

335
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:16,720
Yeah.

336
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,720
I, so the other, my version of all my, so my perspective of it was.

337
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:30,380
I was eager to get under your skin just because that was what I loved about being a young player.

338
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:37,940
And I've, so I'm the youngest in my family obsessed with football and I wanted to be one of the boys.

339
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:50,700
So getting the, the banter and the getting under your skin and I loved all that and I wanted, and above all else, but above all else, I wanted, I wanted to be a part of stories in footy.

340
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,660
Like I love the stories of footy.

341
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,380
And I do.

342
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,960
I think that is a, that's a little bit of the kernel of it.

343
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:59,779
So me just needling you, needling you, needling you.

344
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:08,059
I mean, I didn't think you were going to knock me out to that degree, but the physio runs out to me and says, the noise that I was making on the ground was.

345
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,599
But this is how much times have changed.

346
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,480
We, you know, how serious we take concussion in the game now.

347
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,279
10 minutes after, I mean, it could have been 15 minutes, 10 minutes.

348
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,059
I don't know.

349
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,319
I'm sat in the.

350
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:23,779
Dugout.

351
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,440
The game's still going.

352
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,160
I'm sat in the interchange dugout talking to a bulldog supporter who goes by the name of doc.

353
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:34,180
Who's got one eye and he's got an eye.

354
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:36,779
He's got a patch and he and I mid conversation.

355
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,480
And I know the only thing I know is that you knocked me out.

356
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,859
That's the only thing I know.

357
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,920
And, but, but do you know that here's the thing.

358
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,660
So you have this whole thing of going, what have I done?

359
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:49,539
The shock.

360
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,440
Other people were shocked and had, you know, I think some people would have been like, that's a.

361
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,519
That's a disgrace and shitty.

362
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,400
And I genuinely was like, this is a great story.

363
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:05,960
And I'm kind of, this is, this was part of why I wanted to play league footy.

364
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:06,940
So you had that sense.

365
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,200
I did straight away.

366
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,019
I was, I had no ill feeling.

367
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:10,819
It was like, you know what?

368
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,779
I have my part to play in this.

369
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:18,799
I knew you had the ability to, to lose it and the red miss fall.

370
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:22,440
And I poked it and poked it and I got hit.

371
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,359
And, and you've.

372
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,839
Seen that red miss fall on more than one occasion.

373
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:30,880
And, and I love what you did too, because when you got back into the rooms, you wrote coward.

374
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,720
I told him I like it in permanent market.

375
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:36,700
And it was the last thing I saw the day I wrote.

376
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:38,660
I'm looking up at it and going, you know what?

377
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:40,720
That is just, it was perfect.

378
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:45,420
But that's also testament to you as well of going, you know what?

379
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:50,579
I probably did the wrong thing by knocking out this scrawny little.

380
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:53,400
And my punishment is to have coward.

381
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,359
I'd written on my locker.

382
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:55,539
What am I on?

383
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,799
I've never asked mine and John, but I don't think I've got the courage.

384
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:58,859
They must've gone.

385
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,240
No, they're like me.

386
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,779
They're like me.

387
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:15,839
They have this almost irrational love, care, and respect for guys, especially you and

388
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:22,500
Garlow and Ben Harrison and Todd Curley and Crofty and that era.

389
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Because you genuinely looked after me and I mean that sincerely.

390
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,559
And I, I think they had a really hard time.

391
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,460
I know mum did.

392
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:39,259
I didn't know at the time because I was so young and physically like a child.

393
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,380
And I think, I think they were really, really worried.

394
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:51,299
And you guys looked after me in an unusual way at times, but they did.

395
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:52,359
And the way I spoke.

396
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:57,400
About you and the way you always treat them, they always felt like I was

397
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,019
being looked after and cared for.

398
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:03,559
And mate, that's beautiful to hear and, and, and I got the same and, and I think

399
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:08,119
people misunderstand that about sport is that, you know, I remember the privilege.

400
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:13,480
It's like, you get to go and drive our new recruit to training and then we form

401
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,980
this friendship almost immediately and it's, it's a lifelong, uh, friendship.

402
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,819
And to me, the roller coaster of sport, you and I have discussed this for many

403
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:22,220
years.

404
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,119
And you, you know, there's some stories to tell on that, but the thing you get

405
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:31,480
that I, is these lifelong connections and it doesn't matter if it's a year or a

406
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,740
week, they're so real and they're so unique, those, those friendships.

407
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,460
They're not there, but they're unusual to, I think, football relationships

408
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,220
because you're thrown together at different ages, different backgrounds,

409
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:48,619
political belief or religion, all of that sort of stuff thrown together.

410
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:52,220
And I always thought football, AFL football clubs.

411
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,839
As a business model, take away the winning games and premierships, and you've

412
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,359
got to win enough games to top for all that, but I always thought of 40,

413
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,460
particularly as a leader.

414
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,680
Okay.

415
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,440
Don't worry about the wins and losses.

416
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,359
We're trying to build connection and camaraderie, but as a business model,

417
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,880
it's a disaster.

418
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:17,920
You've got 44 players, 42 players, 22 or 23 play every week.

419
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:22,119
So at any one point, half of your workforce is not going to be able to play.

420
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,619
It's not in the position they want to be in.

421
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,700
And if you have the best year you've ever had as a business, if we just call it a

422
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,920
business, there's redundancies at the end of the year.

423
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:36,359
That's a, if that was a, if that was a company that was, if you're making plastic

424
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:43,559
cups, that is a dreadful structure for harmony and camaraderie.

425
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:46,240
It's a brilliant way to think about it.

426
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,500
And, and you're, you're a hundred percent wrong.

427
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
And so these friendships are.

428
00:24:52,119 --> 00:25:00,720
There's often tension and they, uh, sometimes combative and there's jealousies

429
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,000
and there's egos involved in it.

430
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:07,720
But the thing I've found most curious and you and I are probably a great example

431
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:16,500
of it, of it starts off as mentor kid, and then we become peers because you sort

432
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,900
of get to this and then our lives go in completely different ways and then you've

433
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,099
got to.

434
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:24,400
Sort of navigate that and who, who are we now?

435
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,740
And what's our friendship now?

436
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,940
And, and then after a certain period and now, and I think you and I both feel the

437
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:39,180
same, you get to this point and all those that combative competitiveness that not

438
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,799
that you and I ever had jealousy, but that little tension.

439
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:50,140
And now we just get to share in what's a very harmonious, affectionate, joyful

440
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:50,640
thing.

441
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:51,519
Yeah.

442
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:51,980
And I think that.

443
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:54,220
Comes with age too, for me, Bob, isn't it?

444
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,420
And, and a bit of maturity.

445
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:59,819
And I think you, you paint the right picture around, which most people won't

446
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:03,839
understand in a, in a sporting environment where you should have half the place

447
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:05,220
incredibly disappointed.

448
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:09,960
And there is a sort of cadence with that, that you're right, adds tension.

449
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:15,920
But the other part is the, I think the friendships are unique, mate, because you

450
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:21,420
shower together for 14 years, twice a day, you go on holidays at the time off, you go

451
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:26,779
and spend too much time together beyond anything you're ever going to do in any other part

452
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:27,440
of your life.

453
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:34,279
And so, you know, each other, you know, all of the, the warts and all more than anyone,

454
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,880
almost your family sometimes, because you see you're at your worst, you see when you're

455
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,240
injured, you see on a free field.

456
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,960
Well, that's why I listen to footballers talk, that listen to the language they use when

457
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:51,299
they talk about each other, particularly now, love, brother, family, all of these, because

458
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:52,700
it is a, it's family.

459
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,420
It's not, it's not the Brady Bunch though.

460
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,740
It's not the Brady Bunch.

461
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,480
Or the Manson family.

462
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,119
No, at times.

463
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:09,380
But it is, you're being constantly judged, critiqued and reviewed in front of people

464
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:16,420
who you deeply, deeply admire and crave their respect.

465
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,279
And that's a, that takes a toll.

466
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,339
Yeah.

467
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,279
And I think this is one of the things.

468
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:22,960
I've admired about you.

469
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:30,259
I said, you know, your presence, even when you're 17 and you're as, as prepubescent as

470
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:32,460
you can be going into an AFL world.

471
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,440
But I think from the start, I didn't ever see you walk past something that you thought

472
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,400
was not attached to your values.

473
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,200
And I can think of it, mate, I've been thinking my Bucs weekend and we won't go into too many

474
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:50,140
details, but even late at night, you could call out something that you saw that young

475
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,180
people maybe.

476
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:57,140
Wouldn't or, you know, when it was uncomfortable to, to, if something was outside of your scope

477
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:02,200
of value, you're prepared to put some skin in the game at the cost of what that was going.

478
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:03,799
And you still do it to this day.

479
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:09,420
And I think that's the essence of, of leadership to me in some ways is putting yourself into

480
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,759
the uncomfortable because you genuinely believe this is right and that's wrong.

481
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,119
And you did that from a young age, which I admire.

482
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,039
That's definitely, yeah.

483
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:21,000
And that's, and I take that as a great compliment coming from you because I think.

484
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:26,319
In terms of leadership, and I know you're fast, you're as fascinated about leadership

485
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:27,980
and culture as, as I am.

486
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:34,519
I think you probably understood it and made peace with it at a much younger age than I

487
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:34,720
did.

488
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,000
I didn't see myself as a leader for a long, long time, probably because I didn't see someone

489
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,480
like me who was a leader.

490
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:48,359
Football during that time was very different and quite conservative and orthodox to me.

491
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:51,220
And I was trying.

492
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:56,819
Not just wanting to be unorthodox, trying to be, what else could you do?

493
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:02,819
How do you, you know, in terms of dressing differently, uh, doing different things, all

494
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,259
of that sort of thing.

495
00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:14,319
And I, and it did take me a while to make peace with it, but I'm so interested by it.

496
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:22,740
And I think that our morals and ethics can vary from person to person and it's not about

497
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,180
being.

498
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:24,099
Perfect.

499
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:30,160
But I also think there's moments you go, that's not what it's about.

500
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:35,680
And I think one of the great things about 40 is you, it's this melting pot of different

501
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,339
people in background, but it's a compromise.

502
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,619
It's a 42 people band.

503
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,940
And when you put that jumper on, that's what brings you together.

504
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,039
And this is what we agree on in terms of standards behaviors.

505
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,500
And this is how we treat people.

506
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,500
And if people stepped out.

507
00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:57,039
Of that, it's like, Oh, I have a problem with that.

508
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:01,940
And I, but I learned that from so many people and leadership.

509
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,779
I don't know how, I think, I don't know.

510
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:09,019
I always viewed you as having a very clear idea of the type of person and leader you

511
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:10,519
were from a very young age.

512
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:14,519
I built it like a magpie would build a nest.

513
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:22,160
I was always like, Oh, I loved your ability to have certainty of direction, whether you,

514
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,000
whether you.

515
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:29,039
Were certain of it or not, but you're like, that's the way we're going, let's go this

516
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:29,319
way.

517
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:32,079
And I was like, okay, he's cause I was full of doubt.

518
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,460
And I'm like, he's not, I'll follow him.

519
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,440
But then other bits like Scott wind, he had, he used the power of silence.

520
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,220
He would talk softly.

521
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:47,960
So you get a group of people and he would say something and it made you lean in.

522
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:50,480
And then he would let the words hang.

523
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:52,259
And I was like, Oh, that's interesting.

524
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,519
And there's other.

525
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,900
People that other leaders that did Terry wheeler used emotion and talk about what makes

526
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,339
us different and where to play footscray.

527
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,099
You have to cross the Maribyrnong river.

528
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,119
And I'm like, Ooh, I like that.

529
00:31:05,619 --> 00:31:12,700
And so by the time I made peace with who I was as a leader, it was like, I, a bit of

530
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,400
that, a bit of that, a bit of that, a bit of that.

531
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,640
And then you make it your own.

532
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,440
And you did that, mate.

533
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,019
And I, my mind goes to being in Bali with you.

534
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:23,339
And as, as random as it was.

535
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:28,720
And the news broke that the club was in as big a turmoil as it had probably been.

536
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,960
As bad as bad as it can get.

537
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,319
As bad as it can get almost, isn't it?

538
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:32,039
I think so.

539
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,039
Brendan McCarthy was sacked as coach.

540
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,900
Ryan Griffin's a captain of the club.

541
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,400
Leaves.

542
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,220
He leaves and goes to another club.

543
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:39,720
Yep.

544
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:45,180
You're at the peak of your playing powers and, and, and a huge figure at the club.

545
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,819
But, and I remember where we're having a beer, we happened to be together.

546
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:48,319
All that news.

547
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:48,900
It all happened.

548
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,799
I was like fresh.

549
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:51,240
It was like 24 hours old.

550
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,359
I think that news.

551
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:52,660
Yeah.

552
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,160
And we're sitting.

553
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,660
We're sitting there and digesting it.

554
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:58,480
And I just remember you, you're taken on all on board and you, you know, there's some black

555
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,259
humor around all that, cuz that's how you cope and you, you're firing back and forth

556
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:03,259
and you turn.

557
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:04,259
I remember you said, I gotta be captain.

558
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:05,259
Mm.

559
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:07,259
I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna be captain.

560
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,460
I remember thinking that is awesome.

561
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,380
There's the first positive thing to happen and, and I didn't expect that to come out

562
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:20,519
of that conversation, but it was like, you know what, either did I, probably what I,

563
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:23,059
so what I find interesting about that.

564
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:29,920
Is, and what you've, what you left out there was when things are at that time, if you bottom

565
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,799
out at the Bulldogs, if you have multiple losing seasons and then, you know, the coach

566
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:42,559
gets sacked and the captain leaves the club survival is very much on the table and other

567
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,839
clubs don't have that pressure necessarily.

568
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:50,500
You can ride the wave, but at the Bulldogs, if it bottoms out, it could be the end of

569
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
the club.

570
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,500
Yeah.

571
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,279
But that was, that was our club and I, we love them to the point where it's part of

572
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,279
your marrow.

573
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:05,319
And I remember thinking I'm the oldest player at the club, so I have, I have a lot of guilt

574
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,920
and shame still from that time.

575
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,299
Cause it, it all went.

576
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:11,299
After that,

577
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:12,299
Because you were there when it went pear shaped.

578
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:18,400
Well, I've gotta take my responsibility of what happened during that time.

579
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,680
But I do find it.

580
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,940
I've only thought about this right now.

581
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,859
I did have that feeling of going okay well this is how do we get this back on track and

582
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:35,799
and the thing I admired about your leadership was that that forthright self-belief that was

583
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:42,019
infectious and I find it interesting as someone who met you had mentored me as a young kid that

584
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:48,779
I told you first I'm going to be captain and I should be captain because I that's something that

585
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:54,359
was not my style I would always be like oh whatever you know a bit a bit more circumspect

586
00:33:54,359 --> 00:34:00,839
and sort of in that maybe look at and it was the first time in terms of leadership I was like

587
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:09,300
this is my job I have a responsibility to do this and I'm all in but I told you first and then what

588
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:17,699
happens you go back and the club is seemingly a decade away from success but beverage comes in

589
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:18,460
and you meet

590
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:23,960
the spiritual equivalent of you at that time and you know I remember checking in with you a lot

591
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:29,219
through that year and you were like oh this is different something different's happened you

592
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:37,820
become the Australian captain that year you play the house down the club turns literally 180

593
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:47,519
degrees it's almost as remarkable 2015 as any story in our history and then you go in you know

594
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:48,260
to 2016.

595
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:55,059
and I talk about sound bites of life and that's going to be one of your sound bites isn't it and

596
00:34:55,059 --> 00:35:00,760
I was reluctant to even talk about it because it's a there's a football tragedy in it for me

597
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,739
that you know I I find you know really hard to actually talk to you about because you handled

598
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:12,840
yourself so fucking unbelievably well mate like I couldn't have I could not have done what you did

599
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,639
any way shape or form I don't believe that but well the class and the

600
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:23,360
actually you you got the joy out of it without being fine I could see you loving that moment

601
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:29,980
this 60-year premiership drought but you're the most important figure in it and then in this sort

602
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,719
of Shakespearean moment the coach hands his medal to you on the on the star I mean it's that's seven

603
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:47,480
years ago now or thereabouts I mean how's it age with you um it's like a um I describe it like uh

604
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:55,940
you know that you know they talk about the shades of Uluru at the time of day how it changes with the

605
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:04,719
light and for a long time like seriously battled with it really really battled with it but not all

606
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:12,119
like there were there are days when I look at it as what a what a what a beautiful thing to have

607
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:18,440
been a part of the team the team aspect of it was you and I are the most important people in the

608
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:25,119
biggest Bulldog supporters going around like that's that that's our club and we know the

609
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:31,059
history and the torture and all of that pain and to see 62-year premiership drought overcome

610
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:40,960
the euphoria is something it's hard to describe but my euphoria had warts on it yeah because

611
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:48,000
I was not where I was meant to be that's how it felt and I felt like I'd been robbed of my destiny

612
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:55,679
it was just not right and it's taken years for me to sort of make peace with it and it's taken

613
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:05,699
therapy and I've had and I'm quite open about that and I'm not I don't have hang-ups about

614
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:15,679
that sort of thing but just talking about it and working through it and it's it melted away the

615
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:18,239
the pain and even some shame and

616
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:28,780
an embarrassment because nothing happens now something happens in society now and we go to

617
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:37,219
our separate corners of are you 100 for that or do you think that that's no good and people

618
00:37:37,219 --> 00:37:44,239
misunderstood that moment as I see it of Luke Beveridge gives me his premiership medal and

619
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:48,340
I think she's a premiership player it's like you clown

620
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:57,039
it's not you miss the point it's an intimate moment between he and I and in some ways it's not

621
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:02,699
even about me it was about every player who had ever played for the Bulldogs who didn't get to

622
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:10,219
play that's how that's my rationalization for it the medal is arbitrary it's not about the medal

623
00:38:10,219 --> 00:38:17,380
was never about the medal it was about the hug and he knew I was living in athlete's agony

624
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:26,199
just wanted me to feel okay that was all it was and it was fucking unbelievable mate to because it's

625
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:32,300
you you handled it how you think about it and and and you know it's interesting you I think you're

626
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:36,739
right mate because I remember sitting on the ground I was working on the coverage on channel

627
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:42,900
seven I was on the boundary line and we had a big hug yeah I know mate and I looked up and and

628
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:48,400
knowing you your heart's breaking but then you know you always thought maybe the the

629
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,840
group that won't would there be some jealousy from all of us that battled and didn't do it but

630
00:38:52,840 --> 00:39:00,579
it was like all of those uh demons were buried you know it was like it was a healing unbelievable

631
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:06,460
night it was just as joyful at that level but I didn't have to stand there going through the agony

632
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:14,500
and I I just yeah I um it's fucking cruel mate it's cruel at one level isn't it it is and I and

633
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,440
I've and don't worry I've had there's been but at my

634
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:26,559
lowest moments I thought apart from Sydney Swans so there's the Sydney Swans crew and I thought wow

635
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:32,579
this premiership is almost like a national celebration like it was more of a cultural

636
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:40,039
event than a premiership and at my low moments I was thinking probably me Mitch Wallace and Jack

637
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:46,420
Redpath are probably the only three blokes who don't get to enjoy it because we're the ones that

638
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,440
but they're they're they're the only three blokes who don't get to enjoy it because we're the ones

639
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:53,199
they're little moments they're little moments and they're not your best moments but they are

640
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:59,000
human reactions they're just because you wanted it so much you you wanted the euphoria without

641
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:06,420
the warts you wanted it you wanted it to be nirvana and it and it wasn't for some of us

642
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:13,780
but as time goes it was it was just how it was meant to be it was just how it was meant to be

643
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:18,440
and I'm and I'm not only am I okay I'm totally at peace with it

644
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:28,079
and I and I see it for what it was it was this incredible experience of this this magical team

645
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:38,480
with this this charismatic leader who in my opinion has changed masculinity in football

646
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,300
and what that actually means now we've we've ruined the world vulnerability we have we've just

647
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:48,440
we have misrepresented it overused it

648
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:55,579
it and driven it into the ground but but Luke Beveridge changed footy from in my opinion of

649
00:40:55,579 --> 00:41:04,719
he's someone who's emotional affectionate can tell a story can be honest and authentic while also

650
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:18,750
being hard fair honest unflinching and tactically as sharp as a razor and I'd never had a coach who

651
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,630
had the balance

652
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:25,409
like that and I think people forget pretty quickly or even Brene Brown talks about authentic

653
00:41:25,409 --> 00:41:31,510
vulnerability now because it's become so cliche but you look back at that time and you know

654
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:37,969
footy players didn't even hug really before then certainly didn't celebrate after a game I remember

655
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:44,289
through that final series all the crusty old uh media oh mate they've won their premiership already

656
00:41:44,289 --> 00:41:48,090
because they well and we had to put up with it that week I remember there was there's a lot of

657
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,690
media personalities I remember there was a lot of media personalities I remember there was a lot of

658
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:55,010
I haven't forgotten who they are uh if I ever celebrated then I'm like you blokes don't get it

659
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:59,309
you think of the tragedy of you know I I used to quite knuckling it yeah that's

660
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:04,150
Nathan Buckley says he didn't enjoy one moment of his 14-year career as one of the greatest players

661
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:09,610
ever because he was told the only time he could celebrate was after a premiership he never won

662
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:15,269
it's like it's about as sad as it gets not good does a lot of damage to people not celebrating

663
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:19,690
a little more and that he taught that to the footy community that you need to be a footballer

664
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:27,369
to have the joy along the way and yeah unashamedly uh celebrated it's um and my your uniquely placed

665
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:33,809
because most people with the sporting brain don't have their creative brain the way yours works and

666
00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:41,829
you're this unique blend of guitar player singer poet writer but love your sport as much as

667
00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:49,130
have you understood that that there's I can't think of another person that I've been around in sport

668
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:55,630
thinks about the world creatively like you do I'm not sure if it's a uh I think to call me a guitar

669
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:59,309
player would be pretty offensive to a lot of musicians out there I just put that on record

670
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:05,449
I've sat there and seen you mate and and endured there's a difference between hacking a few guitar

671
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:12,190
chords and poor old Justine's at the center there's a bit of Ken from the Ken and Brian movie

672
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:18,449
but um sometimes in some ways it's a blessing and in some ways it's a curse

673
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:30,769
because uh being full-time into football and football is all consuming and sometimes just the

674
00:43:30,769 --> 00:43:36,550
game was not enough for me I I needed to have something else and writing a newspaper column

675
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:43,710
gave me a great balance but then also being in the media and writing newspaper columns and

676
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:48,650
interviewing interesting people and doing what you're doing now and I loved so much of it but

677
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:49,389
then it was like

678
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:57,670
but but geez I miss the um camaraderie of us against them the actual game itself

679
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:07,449
um sort of can take it or leave a little bit I don't watch football like um obsessively

680
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:12,289
I don't I endure football tactics I don't have any real

681
00:44:12,289 --> 00:44:18,650
um interest or and I'm not particularly skilled at seeing the mechanics of

682
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:19,690
the game

683
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:26,989
but the things around football leadership culture young men young women who are

684
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:33,409
got performance anxiety and how you might be able to help that and getting people to talk

685
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:40,030
and share about their emotion and to make them perform better that for me is like

686
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:47,949
that's the petrol for me um so to answer your question yeah I I do find myself

687
00:44:47,949 --> 00:44:49,690
trying to find the balance of

688
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:57,650
what fills my cup in terms of being a part of a clan and also think you know having the ego enough

689
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:04,170
to go I've got something to say yeah and I want to write and I want to do something different

690
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:09,829
yeah and I feel that synergy with you too Bob to be honest with you that the the the nuts and bolts

691
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:16,130
and the stats of it have never really interested me but the team part and the connecting part and

692
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,590
finding a way to try and get better and the friendship

693
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:24,550
part and the the dynamics of different people coming in is you know you do it in a much more

694
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:30,630
one of the creative way I reckon that the the way I describe it to people is when I when I was playing

695
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:36,190
some people and you would have played I don't know where you sit I think you were far more astute than

696
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:42,309
I was but the the what I call the human battleships of footy which you have to you know the tactics of

697
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:47,969
the game and when the game stops this is where you need to send it that's not my native language at

698
00:45:47,969 --> 00:45:49,590
all so I had to really

699
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:55,989
really concentrate and sit and okay how do I to lock in because I don't want to be selfish

700
00:45:55,989 --> 00:46:00,429
and there's a response you can't just go oh I'm an instinct player it's like yeah okay well that's

701
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:08,150
great for you but you leave your mate so the the thing that gave me uh peace of mind was

702
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:13,349
I need to stand at this part of the ground when the game stops

703
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:17,570
not because it's the right thing to do and because that's what the coach wants I was like if I'm

704
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:19,690
there that will protect me I need to stand at this part of the ground when the game stops

705
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:26,170
like Dale Morris who's on his own in the goal square with Travis Cloak and if I can help protect

706
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:34,650
him that is a motivation for me that helps me that puts a human element to it instead of it

707
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:43,750
being like Tetris because if it's Tetris okay you got the intelligence enough to to be out and

708
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,269
work your way through that but I love your ways attach meaning to something and that's what makes

709
00:46:47,269 --> 00:46:49,690
you unique and different and and I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know

710
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:57,510
I love about you know the the young lad that I uh picked up at the driveway is now great friends

711
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:04,730
with Paul Kelly the great artist and uh the the footy world opens up these pathways to meet people

712
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:11,210
and be in situations that you'd never dream of as a young kid same for me it's it's it's given

713
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:17,710
things that you'd never believe were possible and I was talking to you before we started because I

714
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,690
went through your Instagram and you know that that's not a word that I'm going to say but I

715
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:25,989
spent a lot of time in and um and I'm looking at pictures of Ben Mendelsohn and I'm thinking like

716
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:31,650
what's that all about you've got to explain the same thought but you've got to explain

717
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:38,150
because this gives people an insight into the quirky world that that you inhabit and I don't

718
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:43,949
fully understand it myself but it about as with about as much thought as a hiccup

719
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:49,150
on one Monday I said Alex I love Ben Mendelsohn as an actor and I was like huh

720
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:56,750
Mendo Monday's got a good ring to it yeah it's like what about if I just posted a photo of Ben

721
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:02,449
Mendelsohn on a Monday as random as that yeah and just called it Mendo Monday Mendo Monday

722
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:09,170
and just do it for a few weeks and see what happens and bizarrely enough I didn't do it one

723
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:16,849
week and you get it not I wouldn't say a flurry but enough people to go oh where is it where's

724
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:19,190
Mendo Monday we we liked it

725
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:26,710
we don't know what it means but we like I was like okay there's something here so I did it on

726
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:32,989
and off for about 18 months and it would be just a picture of Ben any sort of any sort of guys and

727
00:48:32,989 --> 00:48:36,929
I'd try and do a little you know try and do a little play on words just for my own amusement

728
00:48:36,929 --> 00:48:43,309
and people sort of you get along you get well some did and some like unfollow

729
00:48:43,309 --> 00:48:49,550
but then something something magical happened about four months ago

730
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:55,869
so how long has this been going for oh this is a couple of years sporadically yeah there's quite

731
00:48:55,869 --> 00:49:03,469
a lot of Mendo Mondays but not not every Monday but a lot of them and uh I got three direct messages

732
00:49:03,469 --> 00:49:11,690
all from Ben Mendelsohn I'm like it's happened it's happened were you expecting it not hoping

733
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:19,230
yeah and it said I can't remember what I've got I'll I'll I'll show it to you but it

734
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:25,889
I looked at what he'd written and I was like that rings a bell it makes no real logical sense

735
00:49:25,889 --> 00:49:33,269
and after a while I thought oh it's a cold chisel lyric and then I sat there for another two hours

736
00:49:33,269 --> 00:49:38,670
going why stop for a minute Ben Mendelsohn sending Robert yeah a cold chisel lyric on

737
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:43,809
just in isolation yeah and that's his response to two and a half years of Mendo Mondays yep

738
00:49:43,809 --> 00:49:49,690
somehow the Mendo Monday community has reached him or he's reached him and he's reached him and he's

739
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:54,889
or he's gotten somehow who knows how that world works you know who cares don't try and figure it

740
00:49:54,889 --> 00:50:00,789
out the universe brought it together and I sat there for two hours going why has he written a

741
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:07,690
cold chisel lyric and then I twigged that a year before I'd forgotten it was even there but you

742
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:14,590
know on your Instagram bio I had you know Bob Murphy and I just written underneath who needs

743
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:19,690
that sentimental bullshit anyway which is a line from flame trees so he's just written a cold chisel

744
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:31,670
lyric and another cold chisel lyric and I'm like I'm on air so we go back and forth talking about

745
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:38,170
cold chisel for about five messages and I'm thinking I mean let me make sure this is going

746
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:43,670
to end up in a barbecue it's going to end up in mates going to go hang out in LA with Mendo

747
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:49,289
and Mendo was Mendo he couldn't have been cooler because he was just

748
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:59,949
abstract unusual kept me guessing but I was on the hook and then I I'm well well because I'm not

749
00:50:59,949 --> 00:51:06,130
cool enough to keep up with Mendo and I have a rush of blood and go hey Ben I just have to let

750
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:10,510
you know that I'm a massive fan I love your movies and just the way that you have your cigarette

751
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:16,989
dangle from your lip how much you reckon I heard from Mendo after that radio silence never again

752
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:25,570
that was the end of it that was the end of Mendo Monday and that's just genius and it's probably

753
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:32,710
the right way to finish you know it's like he was he was him and I held out as long as I could and

754
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:39,570
then I was me and I lost and that was the end and that was the end hey Bob I uh I love asking

755
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:44,530
these questions and I'm going to be very fascinated by you because we we someone said to us success

756
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:49,349
leaves clues and there's these dimensions that make people consistently successful that we're

757
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:54,210
a little bit obsessed about and the work we're doing in the leadership space and we we feel

758
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:58,690
like there are some patterns in it um starting with this sort of concept first dimension is idea

759
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:03,829
of self-leadership that yeah you can't lead anyone else unless you've got an idea of self

760
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:11,829
you've described a bit of that what does that mean to you uh so I I've done enough personality

761
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:18,050
tests and traits and those things and they always come back with I have a um

762
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:18,650
a

763
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:19,590
a

764
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:19,690
a

765
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:19,710
a

766
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:28,710
bias towards storytelling uh intuition but symbolism uh so I love I love symbolism and I

767
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:35,550
love I mean I could talk about leadership and cultural philosophy all afternoon but I actually

768
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:43,469
think it's a bit of a trap and a bit of a wank yeah because that's all correct so I like what

769
00:52:43,469 --> 00:52:49,010
what can I touch and feel when we're in this building or when we're in your football club or

770
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:49,690
when you when you're in your football club or when you're in your football club or when you're in

771
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:54,309
when you're in your home what are the practical things that actually matter so the most obvious

772
00:52:54,309 --> 00:53:00,889
thing in sport is the well not the most obvious thing but one of the almost like a cliche is the

773
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:08,670
all black sweeping the sheds so what's something small that captures something big Martin Flanagan

774
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:14,369
told me that one day he said if you want to tell a big story and culture and leadership are huge

775
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:19,670
themes so if you want to tell a big story tell a small story and if you want to tell a big story

776
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:29,510
and so things like not throwing a jumper on the ground after a game is something those those

777
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:39,469
little things and I like I do like quotes but I like minimalism and a coach who shall remain

778
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:49,309
nameless once said no selfish pricks no weak pricks and I was like huh that's that's not how I would

779
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:56,809
use it but that's six words and you cover a fair bit of ground but there's none better than Ali

780
00:53:56,809 --> 00:54:05,130
me we and in my work that I do at the dockers with the men's leadership group

781
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:15,309
the structure of the meeting is me we team club so the meeting starts with me how are you as a

782
00:54:15,309 --> 00:54:19,650
leader how'd you go this week as a leader how did I go as a leader how did you go this week as a

783
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:26,690
leader go around the room how did we all go as a leader that's the me then the we is who's got any

784
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:31,849
feedback for anyone else on how they went as a leader well Luke I reckon in the third quarter

785
00:54:31,849 --> 00:54:35,829
when you went back with a flight was inspiring and it made me feel great but in the last quarter

786
00:54:35,829 --> 00:54:42,289
you didn't chase and I reckon you're better than that then get into team how is the rest of the

787
00:54:42,289 --> 00:54:48,989
team going how how can we help them how then get the club can be programmed and I think

788
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:57,849
too many leadership groups or people in leadership go to operations oh the taps are leaking we want

789
00:54:57,849 --> 00:55:03,769
to can we get a day off next Thursday so that's not leadership and if well if it is it's a very

790
00:55:03,769 --> 00:55:10,550
small and it's low-hanging fruit and it's impersonal and it's easy that the me and the

791
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:16,429
we stuff's hard and it's uncomfortable but that's where the good stuff is yeah you got a brilliant

792
00:55:16,429 --> 00:55:19,650
way about how to simplify things that people make complex it's

793
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:24,050
one of your great skills and you hear the army generals talk about actually making your bed

794
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:30,710
first thing though dude yeah is actually the first positive thing you do for the day and yeah I think

795
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:36,769
you sum that up really well the idea of impacting people positively every day we now see people

796
00:55:36,769 --> 00:55:42,349
really conscious of that Bob and you're not necessarily on the big scale of time but on a

797
00:55:42,349 --> 00:55:47,750
day-to-day basis how do I have a positive impact have you thought about that yeah so I this is why

798
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,650
I have a hard time with the word vulnerability

799
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:57,929
because I think it's it doesn't chime for me I know I I know when it's used in the right

800
00:55:57,929 --> 00:56:04,250
sense and it's changed sport for the better yeah I just think there's a better word and the word

801
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:15,769
is sincere and something again small but practical I deal with my time as a both a captain and now as a

802
00:56:15,769 --> 00:56:19,309
as someone who works in leadership in a football club

803
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:27,849
environment's important sitting opposite a player who's struggling or anxious or whatever they've

804
00:56:27,849 --> 00:56:33,909
got going on and that's what we are essentially dealing with a generation now and a society who's

805
00:56:33,909 --> 00:56:42,269
ravaged by anxiety mental health issues to varying degrees and I just naturally my way I was like

806
00:56:42,269 --> 00:56:48,369
let's walk a lap so you walk a lap with someone young player who's dealing with something yeah

807
00:56:48,369 --> 00:56:48,909
form

808
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:53,829
relationship issues whatever it is could be on the whole spectrum of whatever it is

809
00:56:53,829 --> 00:56:58,510
but just the fact that you're walking a lap so you're not face to face there's a freedom to the

810
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:04,269
conversation and I've never really been the one for oh the carrot and the stick

811
00:57:04,269 --> 00:57:09,349
I don't like that's a bit I don't know maybe because it's a cliche I'm like well I'd rather

812
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:18,929
do something different but I think a sincere chat is me walking with a young player and I put my

813
00:57:18,929 --> 00:57:25,769
arm around him and that's a symbol of I'm with you we're on the same team we wear the same jumper I'm

814
00:57:25,769 --> 00:57:32,510
in your corner but at the same time I can then with the other hand hit him in the shoulder and

815
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:40,650
go but what you did on the weekend is not up to standard and it's not you at your best and I just

816
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:47,570
for some reason people might go well that's useless or that's not but I've found that to be

817
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:50,230
and that's authentically you that sentence there

818
00:57:50,269 --> 00:57:55,590
is you know to take the time to put your arm around someone walk the lap be authentic always

819
00:57:55,590 --> 00:58:00,969
but then people underestimate your ability to do exactly what you said which is give it right

820
00:58:00,969 --> 00:58:05,989
between the eyes to someone in your way once you've built that trust it's sincere and it's

821
00:58:05,989 --> 00:58:13,230
authentic you know the thing about this is the thing I've found about football if I said hey uh

822
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:18,269
I don't look um let's I want to give you some feedback

823
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:20,070
people

824
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:25,469
immediately whether they think they do or not will brace there's gonna be criticism

825
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:29,949
my experience of particularly male footballers

826
00:58:29,949 --> 00:58:38,570
have a much harder time giving a compliment in a sense 110 percent it's the and particularly in

827
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:43,750
this part of the world way people find that more painful to sit in a room and everyone go around

828
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:50,250
and say and even to receive it yeah but that's I think that's the that's the thing that's the

829
00:58:50,269 --> 00:59:15,550
That's what I'm most passionate about and that's what I am trying to impart in whatever my career progresses to of, hey, you know when you take on that Ruckman and wear him down over three quarters, I need you to know that we all see that and we value it and it makes me feel like a better player.

830
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:40,110
But equally in the last quarter, when he got on top of you and I feel like you maybe went off the ground when you probably could have stayed out there, I think you're a bit better than that. Same tone, sincere, I mean it. I'm not humiliating you. I'm still with you, but you know exactly what I value and what I don't.

831
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:45,110
And also I think people have got the power of, you want to do more of the selfless.

832
00:59:45,550 --> 01:00:12,750
Celebration part, it's like, gee, give me more of that. I want that feeling more. And now I know this is what my team values for me. And when it's unspoken and you don't reward that, it's such low hanging fruit to use your term from before. But it's something we are, a lot of people would much rather, you give someone a spread, here's the 20 things you do really well and the one you don't, what are you going to focus on? Instantly and put all your energy into that. If you put your energy into the 90%.

833
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,889
And how do you create the environment?

834
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:45,409
There's a big difference between how are you to how are you? And I put my hand on your arm. If I ask you how are you, I don't even care. It's just a sound. It's a routine. We do it. It's kind of halfway down the corridor already. But I say, hey, can I have a word? How are you? How are you really? That's a different kind of a conversation because sometimes players and men, we give each other a compliment.

835
01:00:45,550 --> 01:01:03,170
And as it's coming, I go, mate, your overhead marking as an example, it's a crude example, but your overhead marking is as good as anyone in the comp. Oh, but it's not as good as Charlie Curnow there. And you walk away from it. Just get me out of this conversation. I'm not comfortable.

836
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:14,489
You actually go, mate, slow down. I'm telling you what you do on the field is really worth something. And I admire it.

837
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:40,090
Yeah. I wanted to pick up on the anxiety conversation just quickly. I was listening to this great researcher and neuroscientist who studied anxiety now for 25 years and was talking about how it's been demonized in a way. Like anything, there's a spectrum. At one level, people have got proper anxiety disorders and we know they're diagnosable and need to be treated. And so you're not diminishing that in any way.

838
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:40,489
No, no, no.

839
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:45,489
But now, as you said, it's like an epidemic of anxiety around young people.

840
01:01:45,550 --> 01:02:00,349
And the next generation and her thesis without being unkind was to say, we've misdiagnosed the word. It's an evolutionary gift in some ways that actually that little bit of nervous energy and that anxiety.

841
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:12,869
Well, yeah. What's anxiety and what is a high level of care and nerves? There's a difference.

842
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:13,809
Yeah.

843
01:02:13,809 --> 01:02:24,679
An elite sport is a very unique world. And the cliche of I'll get comfortable being uncomfortable is so true.

844
01:02:25,739 --> 01:02:44,300
And I use it in my world. I look at it and I go, I look at people who've been gifted or inherited too much money as one of the great curses in life. And I've seen it, you know, as it becomes a small city, Melbourne, and you watch people and you wouldn't wish that on your worst enemy.

845
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:44,539
Mm-hmm.

846
01:02:44,539 --> 01:02:45,000
Even though all of us,

847
01:02:45,059 --> 01:03:05,099
I think, give me the 50 mil, I'll be the one that I'll handle okay. Because you take away that little bit of anxiety or a lot of anxiety. It's like, I've got to find something to feed my family and to sort of, you take that away from someone, it produces a whole different set of problems and stresses and issues.

848
01:03:05,099 --> 01:03:14,099
That's very interesting. So this is what I have thought about a bit more recently. So people feel, I think there's a lot of people that feel sorry.

849
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:45,039
Mm-hmm.

850
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:47,820
And I would 100% turn into an arsehole.

851
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:51,099
I doubt it. I doubt it. But.

852
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,619
Getting everything you want.

853
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:53,340
Yeah.

854
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,440
Uh, that's a, be careful.

855
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,780
And kids getting everything they want on a parenting level.

856
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:07,460
They were jumping off in a whole range of directions, but I love asking the parenting question. You know, you've father of three. What do you like on the home front?

857
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:16,480
It's like, uh, it's like a green top versus the West Indies most mornings.

858
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:24,500
In the eighties, it's, uh, it's just right out helmet on.

859
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,039
I mean, we all think, don't we?

860
01:04:28,039 --> 01:04:31,519
That however many kids we have and they'll be pretty similar.

861
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:36,559
And then of course they're not, and they're wildly different.

862
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:46,639
And just when you think, yeah, I think things are cruising along here now, like, nah, it's almost waiting to get hits worse than the hit.

863
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:49,179
Um, we're a sitcom.

864
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:51,539
That's how I would describe us at the moment.

865
01:04:51,539 --> 01:04:55,139
We're at that stage of, there's a lot of love.

866
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:56,420
There's a lot of laughter.

867
01:04:56,699 --> 01:04:58,440
There's always been a lot of affection.

868
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:04,519
Um, but we're all as mad as a trolley wheel and anything can happen.

869
01:05:05,059 --> 01:05:05,980
Yeah, we are.

870
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:10,679
We're a sitcom and you know, kids are 15, 13 and nine.

871
01:05:11,059 --> 01:05:15,820
So we've got teenage stuff and, and those things have, you know, they're, they're, they're problems.

872
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:16,059
Uh,

873
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:19,840
they're bigger problems than they were a few years ago.

874
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:22,360
Um, but they're good.

875
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:22,940
We love them.

876
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,900
I'm so proud of them.

877
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:27,380
And they, they handle setbacks well.

878
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:30,380
And that's probably what gives me most pride.

879
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:42,780
I reckon because life isn't easy and they handle those challenges and moving them over to WA at that age was a huge, a huge move.

880
01:05:43,059 --> 01:05:44,579
I knew it would be hard.

881
01:05:45,079 --> 01:05:46,800
And I had a lot of guilt around.

882
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:58,659
And that, because it was essentially my decision for, because I felt like I needed to change a lot of things and reinvigorate and put myself out of my comfort zone.

883
01:05:58,739 --> 01:06:01,480
But yeah, you know, you, you do it to your family as well.

884
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:06,219
And the first year was, was really rough, really hard on all of us.

885
01:06:06,739 --> 01:06:07,480
Changing schools.

886
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,519
Changing schools and leaving friends behind.

887
01:06:10,519 --> 01:06:16,679
And WA, you know, when, when that time difference goes from two hours to three hours, it's like you live in Texas.

888
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:22,139
If you've got people back in Victoria, it's like, yeah, no, that's, that's too hard.

889
01:06:22,139 --> 01:06:25,519
But the way they've adjusted, they're brave.

890
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:26,820
They really are.

891
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:27,780
Now they're settled.

892
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:29,000
They got good friends.

893
01:06:29,659 --> 01:06:30,639
They work hard.

894
01:06:31,219 --> 01:06:38,360
Um, yeah, it's, but the reasons why we did it, I've sort of flowered, if you know what I mean?

895
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:42,019
I don't know for how long we'll be there, but it was, um, I think we needed to do it.

896
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,860
Mutual friend of ours, Rob Sitch.

897
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:45,260
I love talking parenting with Rob.

898
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:46,099
And as.

899
01:06:46,099 --> 01:06:49,260
I know you've interviewed Rob, which is a great experience.

900
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:49,860
What a man.

901
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:50,539
What a man.

902
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:58,579
I love talking, you know, him and Jane with their five kids and, and that parenting, I talk about the parenting guilt where you have your bad moments and you go, oh, far out.

903
01:06:58,579 --> 01:06:59,599
I've dropped the ball there.

904
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:00,340
I've had a shocker here.

905
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:00,739
Yeah.

906
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,199
And, and he's great.

907
01:07:02,199 --> 01:07:06,880
Cause he's like, you're in the elite 0.1% because you care about that.

908
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:07,739
But you're trying.

909
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,519
And you're reflecting on that.

910
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:10,380
That's the bit.

911
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:14,900
That, the fact that you go, phew, I probably could have done a bit better there.

912
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:15,920
That.

913
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:16,059
Yeah.

914
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:18,780
That's, that's, that's a good parent.

915
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:25,699
You don't see the other part is that unfortunately there's a bracket that, that don't, um, your vision.

916
01:07:25,699 --> 01:07:29,599
And we talk about leaders with creating and sharing a vision and you articulated that.

917
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,420
I love your family description, like a green top against the West Indy.

918
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,579
I mean, you're in leadership roles at the moment and you've changed your life.

919
01:07:37,579 --> 01:07:41,599
If you've got a clear vision, the way you describe your team meetings is a pretty clear way.

920
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:45,019
Is that the way you go about it through the way you like things explained?

921
01:07:46,659 --> 01:07:47,059
Yeah.

922
01:07:49,659 --> 01:07:50,059
Yeah.

923
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:53,119
I like the simplicity of those things.

924
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:59,570
I don't like to overcomplicate it and have it, have it too intellectual.

925
01:07:59,869 --> 01:08:13,650
I think with, particularly in, in footy and sporting environments, you and I could go into any football club and we come up with a mission statement or a trademark and ended it and a symbol.

926
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:15,090
And these are the behaviors.

927
01:08:15,769 --> 01:08:17,729
And because you and I.

928
01:08:17,729 --> 01:08:18,270
Yeah.

929
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:19,289
Quite academic.

930
01:08:19,649 --> 01:08:32,890
I mean, we could, but we could fake it, but it's it, it, the trap I see is that it can be really intellectual and it will appeal to the most fanatical and intellectual players on your list.

931
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:45,569
But if it doesn't, if it is not understood and viscerally felt by the least fanatical player or the least intellectual player on your list, it's not worth a pinch of shit.

932
01:08:45,569 --> 01:09:00,489
So how do you get that storytelling, symbolism, standards of behavior to be understood so that people feel good about it and what you reward is what your culture is.

933
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:01,250
Yeah.

934
01:09:01,329 --> 01:09:04,109
And eventually you just keep rewarding, reward, reward.

935
01:09:04,489 --> 01:09:07,529
And those that don't want to jump in, they just behave their way out.

936
01:09:07,729 --> 01:09:07,909
Yeah.

937
01:09:07,909 --> 01:09:08,630
And that's okay.

938
01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:10,090
Cause it's not for everyone.

939
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:11,710
That's.

940
01:09:11,789 --> 01:09:13,250
There's some natural selection in that.

941
01:09:13,369 --> 01:09:13,529
Yeah.

942
01:09:13,529 --> 01:09:13,649
Yeah.

943
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:14,550
I look back at.

944
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:20,109
Some of those long, long meetings and teammates you went, you've, you've lost some at the two minute mark.

945
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:26,069
You lost everyone at the 20 minute mark and we're now I'm 40 in it's like far out.

946
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:35,489
So that's what I spend a lot of my time thinking because, you know, people, you know, trademark and all that sort of, it's, it's, you know, a lot of businesses and clubs and all.

947
01:09:35,989 --> 01:09:38,850
I think of it as the 13 minute rule.

948
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:43,149
So at the 13 minute mark, you haven't touched the ball.

949
01:09:43,149 --> 01:09:47,409
And where do you go in your thinking?

950
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:51,350
Where do you go as close to getting your next position as you can?

951
01:09:51,409 --> 01:09:58,829
Well, that's what, so a lot of players go, the runner's coming out to take me off and I haven't touched the ball.

952
01:09:58,829 --> 01:10:00,970
And then my position's under pressure.

953
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:10,409
The power, if you've got a really good team culture that's supported by the coaches and the leaders and they're consistent on it.

954
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:12,909
It's like in those moments when the.

955
01:10:13,149 --> 01:10:17,430
Anxiety comes through and I want to get a kick cause that'll make me feel better.

956
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:19,909
Go back to what is your role?

957
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:22,130
What does the team need you to do right now?

958
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:27,909
Now, if that's stay there on the off side wing and not be anywhere, they won't play your role.

959
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:30,609
Play your role is the most beautiful cliche in the game.

960
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:31,369
I love it.

961
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:31,590
Yeah.

962
01:10:32,189 --> 01:10:37,890
But it just, it gets said so many times that you can almost not hear it, but it's your life raft.

963
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:42,970
It's a player's life raft away from an anxiety that.

964
01:10:43,149 --> 01:10:45,310
Manifests in selfish behavior.

965
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:48,470
I, um, oh, my mind was drifting.

966
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:52,470
I, you would've heard me tell this story before, but my third ever, I told him my third ever game.

967
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:53,970
I could not have been played.

968
01:10:53,970 --> 01:11:00,850
I told you the story Waverley playing on Chris Lankford, who was like Superman and he looked like him and one of the great athletes.

969
01:11:00,850 --> 01:11:03,930
I had no right to be out there and he was just marking everything.

970
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:13,069
And you know, when you know you like your moment, like, and no, no sophistication, you know, the runner's coming your way and you try not to look, but you know, and Chris Burton's our runner at the time.

971
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:13,130
Yeah.

972
01:11:13,149 --> 01:11:17,350
Um, and he had this, you might've crossed over with, but I did, you know, I did just did.

973
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:17,529
Yep.

974
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:17,869
I did.

975
01:11:17,869 --> 01:11:26,529
He had a special way, but, and I'll never forget, he comes out and he's laughing and he goes, mate, the coach, and he says, this didn't take me aside.

976
01:11:26,529 --> 01:11:27,789
So the length of couldn't hear it.

977
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:34,630
Like it was like, so everyone around the half forward flight, he goes, mate, the coach thinks you're playing the worst game in VFL, AFL history.

978
01:11:34,989 --> 01:11:40,630
And he's, and he's laughing and I can see length shoulders sort of just, they bubble up and down a little bit.

979
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,829
Cause he's laughing and he goes, do you know what's even funnier?

980
01:11:43,149 --> 01:11:48,449
He's actually going to leave you out of here because he doesn't think it's possible to play any worse.

981
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:52,630
And then he trots off a long way from Ben Crow.

982
01:11:52,829 --> 01:11:59,970
Oh, I remember just looking around going, this is going to be the shortest AFL career in history, but that was the era, wasn't it?

983
01:11:59,989 --> 01:12:07,310
Like there was a, there was a touch of genius in it, but it was, well, the thing, the thing about it is that fear works.

984
01:12:08,109 --> 01:12:13,029
Fear does have a fuel, but when it's over, it blows up.

985
01:12:13,149 --> 01:12:22,529
Well, the adjunct to that story is that the next one that came down, I did, I somehow found a way and then, you know, liver picked it up and we scored our next goal.

986
01:12:22,529 --> 01:12:34,189
And, and, and this is this day with me for my whole career, because then liver went up to Chris Lankford's like, mate, you're getting your fucking pants pulled down by that, you know, spitting at him and the bits swearing at him.

987
01:12:34,329 --> 01:12:39,090
And I remember thinking, oh shit liver, you haven't watched the game, you know, far out.

988
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:40,789
You're sort of giving him the, mate.

989
01:12:40,810 --> 01:12:42,590
Mate, yeah, this is, you've sort of missed the mark here.

990
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:43,130
You've gone, you've gone.

991
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:44,229
Just overcooked this one a bit.

992
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:49,149
Sort of, I remember looking going, I've got to learn to care as much as that.

993
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:49,609
Yeah.

994
01:12:49,729 --> 01:12:55,289
If I'm going to stay around here, that's the level, you know, and what he was doing was actually going, I'm going.

995
01:12:55,310 --> 01:13:06,869
So that's the nugget of gold, not the shame, fear, uh, I can make, I can, I can give an effort because of that shame and embarrassment.

996
01:13:06,869 --> 01:13:12,529
Cause you can, and you would have played well the next week on it and you might've had a good year on it, but I would argue.

997
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:22,409
After three or four years of getting to the line, playing on fear and potential shame and all those things, you just blow up and it causes.

998
01:13:22,409 --> 01:13:23,130
Not sustainable is it?

999
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:26,649
And it causes probably problems in your life outside the game.

1000
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:29,510
And I think that's where footy's changed a fair bit for the better.

1001
01:13:30,229 --> 01:13:37,750
Curiosity is a dimension we talk about a lot, Bob, and we see, you know, people who are leaders and successful, constantly curious.

1002
01:13:38,109 --> 01:13:39,010
Does that resonate with you?

1003
01:13:39,329 --> 01:13:39,590
Yeah.

1004
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:40,590
Endlessly.

1005
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:41,810
And I think.

1006
01:13:41,810 --> 01:14:02,939
I, you know, almost accidentally, I have a, a pretty eclectic group of people in my life who I just check in with and you're one of those, but I, from all different walks of life and just go, what do you think about this?

1007
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:04,779
And tell me about that.

1008
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:09,180
And that's a bit of this building the nest thing of, oh, that's interesting.

1009
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:10,220
I'll pinch a bit of that.

1010
01:14:10,819 --> 01:14:11,180
Ooh.

1011
01:14:11,899 --> 01:14:13,140
Like, what did you do?

1012
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:22,180
How did that, why, how did that, sometimes it's sport, sometimes it's art, sometimes it's music, whatever it is, but it's like, oh, there's a bit of that.

1013
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:23,500
It's a bit of that.

1014
01:14:23,579 --> 01:14:29,619
I remember talking to Tex Perkins and I said, what do you like two minutes before a show?

1015
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:38,199
And he said to me, he goes, and this is the, this is the rock star, the cocksure, I'm the man, you know.

1016
01:14:38,199 --> 01:14:38,859
The ultimate rock star.

1017
01:14:38,859 --> 01:14:42,079
The ultimate macho alpha.

1018
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:50,899
Two minutes before a show, every show, and he's done thousands, is why am I doing this?

1019
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:53,079
Why have I put myself in this situation?

1020
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,579
My life's choices have led me to this point and I don't have what they want me to do.

1021
01:14:59,819 --> 01:14:59,859
Wow.

1022
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:02,060
I would rather be anywhere else.

1023
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:03,979
Get me out of this hell.

1024
01:15:04,619 --> 01:15:08,819
And I go, what about you walk on and the lights come and he goes, yeah, and it goes away.

1025
01:15:08,819 --> 01:15:12,199
And then you get the double bounce of this is the greatest.

1026
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:15,100
It was my experience with footy at times.

1027
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:25,579
Man, I remember hearing Tony Lockett, the greatest goal kicker and one of the greatest, you know, legends of the game and the scariest player that was ever on a footy field.

1028
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:29,640
He literally, you know, stood in that hole once and you just saw.

1029
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:30,239
Like a boogie monster.

1030
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:36,359
And he would, you know, routinely remind people that he was capable of killing people and mean it.

1031
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:42,460
And they, they say, the guys that play them say he was physically throwing up before every game through nerves.

1032
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:46,279
It's like, mate, you made a lot of us physically nervous.

1033
01:15:46,939 --> 01:15:48,359
We were on the toilet as well.

1034
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,000
I'm thinking about Tony.

1035
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:51,960
What if I have to go back with a flight?

1036
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:54,000
But even he.

1037
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:55,619
Because he cared.

1038
01:15:55,659 --> 01:15:56,060
Yeah.

1039
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:59,640
And, and that's the, the best, one of the best things.

1040
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,460
And one of the hardest things about footy.

1041
01:16:01,739 --> 01:16:06,100
And it's the uncomfortable truth for anyone playing elite footy.

1042
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:10,699
Every week you put yourself and your team's reputation on the line.

1043
01:16:10,819 --> 01:16:12,760
And doesn't matter what you've done before.

1044
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:14,659
You have to do it every week.

1045
01:16:15,619 --> 01:16:16,680
And that's hard.

1046
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,199
And it takes a toll.

1047
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:23,960
And at some point I felt like right at the end, I was like, I can't do that anymore.

1048
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:27,960
I've exhausted that part of my soul or whatever it is.

1049
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:28,739
Yeah.

1050
01:16:28,779 --> 01:16:35,300
It's the, I admire, I admire that if you get out there once, um, I went to a UFC event.

1051
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:38,800
My three boys are obsessed with UFC and I, that's a crazy sport.

1052
01:16:38,899 --> 01:16:39,319
Oh my God.

1053
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:41,159
Not a sport I could imagine.

1054
01:16:41,159 --> 01:16:42,340
I used to do the kickouts.

1055
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:47,000
At, at Marvel and used to be like anxious.

1056
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:56,020
Imagine stepping in with Conor McGregor who's kick me, headbutt me and punch me after I've

1057
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:56,739
been knocked out.

1058
01:16:56,939 --> 01:17:04,420
Watching that walk into that cage and thinking, talk about performance anxiety, just thinking

1059
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:08,079
the courage required to, to do that next level.

1060
01:17:08,199 --> 01:17:09,779
But it's dealing with that anxiety, isn't it?

1061
01:17:09,779 --> 01:17:13,159
You know, you had a great way of communicating Bob.

1062
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:18,159
Well, the mention we talk about a lot and it's unique always has been, you give it much

1063
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:18,520
thought.

1064
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:22,920
I mean, you're right with, uh, wisdom and you mentioned Martin Flanagan, one of the

1065
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:27,180
great writers, you know, in Australia, who becomes a great friend of yours.

1066
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:31,239
You have put together this eclectic group of people in, in your life.

1067
01:17:31,239 --> 01:17:34,300
Is it something that you, you've given care and thought to how you communicate?

1068
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:37,600
Um, oh yeah.

1069
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:41,340
I think part of it is.

1070
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:50,329
And the, and the writing thing has been the biggest gift for me and for the life of me.

1071
01:17:50,329 --> 01:17:52,569
And you knew me at that part of my life.

1072
01:17:52,569 --> 01:17:55,850
I was cruising through, got by on a bit of natural talent.

1073
01:17:56,609 --> 01:18:02,189
I wouldn't have been described as the hardest worker or the most fanatical and, but I got

1074
01:18:02,189 --> 01:18:08,590
offered to write for the age and for the life of me, I cannot believe that I said, I'd like

1075
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:13,930
to write it and not get a ghostwriter, which was not what, not what footballers did.

1076
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:14,489
Not at all.

1077
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:18,369
And I, but for some reason I went, no, no, I'd like to write, I would, I would like to

1078
01:18:18,369 --> 01:18:26,149
learn the craft of that and had no idea what I was doing and just went on total instinct

1079
01:18:26,149 --> 01:18:30,729
and go, okay, well, if there was one thought I thought I would like to, it's almost like

1080
01:18:30,729 --> 01:18:35,050
a thank you letter and what I love about the game.

1081
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:39,390
Cause at the time I didn't really love the game as enough.

1082
01:18:40,109 --> 01:18:42,449
And so it forced me to think about it actually.

1083
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:43,850
I love this about it.

1084
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:44,569
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

1085
01:18:44,569 --> 01:18:49,510
and then you put it out there and there was just enough people, not everyone, a lot of

1086
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:55,149
people thought it was total shit, but there's enough people to go, you got something, you've

1087
01:18:55,149 --> 01:18:56,170
got voice.

1088
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:59,130
So just keep, keep going with it.

1089
01:18:59,489 --> 01:19:04,390
And we all need to, you know, you need a few cheerleaders to just keep, keep going with

1090
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:05,310
it, keep going with it.

1091
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:10,109
And when I'm landing in one of those, he was, he was one of the early ones and he's great

1092
01:19:10,109 --> 01:19:10,550
advice.

1093
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:13,890
Well, he just goes, take, take me on the field.

1094
01:19:14,949 --> 01:19:16,489
Take me out on the field.

1095
01:19:17,470 --> 01:19:22,090
And I mean, this is the, the, but the best practical advice he ever gave me, which this

1096
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:23,909
is what trips most people up.

1097
01:19:24,409 --> 01:19:31,210
If you can't start, cause the blank pages is as intimidating as Tony Lockett, the blank

1098
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:39,270
page, you're looking at, uh, uh, so if you can't start, don't write about the bit that

1099
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:42,810
you're ready to write about and the intro will emerge.

1100
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:44,270
And that has proven.

1101
01:19:44,569 --> 01:19:48,369
It's proven itself to be true over and over and over again, right about the bit you're

1102
01:19:48,369 --> 01:19:49,010
ready to say.

1103
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:50,810
Well, it's brilliant, mate, isn't it?

1104
01:19:50,829 --> 01:19:55,510
You want to start writing and you get Martin Flanagan in your corner and, and you're creating,

1105
01:19:55,510 --> 01:19:59,430
I think you have done in your world a little bit about what this whole podcast is about,

1106
01:19:59,569 --> 01:19:59,670
Bob.

1107
01:19:59,689 --> 01:20:03,090
And I haven't shared this, we haven't taken the time, but effectively what we're doing

1108
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:08,010
now is curating these groups of people around the world where you'll put an artist, Tex

1109
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:13,529
Perkins with a sports person, with a conductor from an orchestra or with someone who's got

1110
01:20:13,529 --> 01:20:14,409
some skills in.

1111
01:20:14,569 --> 01:20:15,909
It's the best part of Melbourne too.

1112
01:20:16,189 --> 01:20:16,489
Yeah.

1113
01:20:16,670 --> 01:20:22,869
That's Melbourne's calling card of the arts and sport and all of these different worlds

1114
01:20:22,869 --> 01:20:24,789
coexist quite easily.

1115
01:20:24,789 --> 01:20:28,050
And that's sort of, I think that is new, unique to.

1116
01:20:28,210 --> 01:20:29,909
And a misunderstood part of Melbourne, isn't it?

1117
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:35,710
You can walk down Fitzroy street or walk down Brunswick area and it's as high profile of

1118
01:20:35,710 --> 01:20:40,210
sport, probably per capita as any in the world, AFL football, you can argue that, you know,

1119
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:44,470
the English locker and the Spanish, but there is a presence, but there's parts of Melbourne.

1120
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:48,470
You can go and no one gives a shit about you playing sports still, isn't there?

1121
01:20:48,649 --> 01:20:50,850
It's the genius of this city, isn't it?

1122
01:20:51,069 --> 01:20:52,229
And we're furious about it.

1123
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:53,989
Exactly.

1124
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:57,449
Don't you know who I am as you're trying.

1125
01:20:57,609 --> 01:21:03,590
Someone said the other day, they said, oh, the young kid, some kid that they had their

1126
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:07,229
young kid who was a Bulldog, said, oh, can we get a photo?

1127
01:21:07,970 --> 01:21:09,409
You don't, you don't mind.

1128
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:13,890
I said, mate, ex-footballers, our worst nightmare is being ignored.

1129
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:14,210
Yeah.

1130
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:16,270
It's so true, isn't it?

1131
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:17,630
Let's have 50 photos.

1132
01:21:18,010 --> 01:21:21,329
You spend half your life going, be a happier day when you don't.

1133
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:24,710
And then the insecurity that shit, no one actually cares.

1134
01:21:24,789 --> 01:21:25,609
I'm wearing my full kit down the street.

1135
01:21:25,949 --> 01:21:26,250
Anyone?

1136
01:21:27,529 --> 01:21:28,850
Two final questions.

1137
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:30,770
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1138
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:32,229
Oh, wow.

1139
01:21:33,789 --> 01:21:34,869
Luke Beveridge.

1140
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:38,470
Luke Beveridge has been the greatest leader in my life.

1141
01:21:41,869 --> 01:21:43,350
I like leaders.

1142
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:51,930
I mean, there's, yeah, again, there's so leadership, so big and so broad, but I love people who

1143
01:21:51,930 --> 01:22:01,350
can stop momentum of a, of atmosphere to go, hey, wait, what just happened then?

1144
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:07,329
So there was a moment early on in his coaching time and we didn't really know who he was

1145
01:22:07,329 --> 01:22:13,210
or what was, and he, someone announced that, oh, Marcus Bontempelli, who's probably a

1146
01:22:13,210 --> 01:22:20,130
close second, uh, Marcus is, um, putting himself to be a part of a charity about for

1147
01:22:20,130 --> 01:22:21,329
violence against women.

1148
01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:23,369
And it's, oh, that's great.

1149
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:23,529
Yeah.

1150
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:24,689
I mean, 19 year old kid.

1151
01:22:24,789 --> 01:22:28,229
And, and it was a sort of, it was a bit of a footnote to the meeting and brushed it and

1152
01:22:28,229 --> 01:22:33,789
Luke stopped and said, hey, everyone sit back down.

1153
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:37,489
This is a young kid who's in our program.

1154
01:22:38,189 --> 01:22:42,590
Who's going to put himself out there for a cause.

1155
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:43,189
That's.

1156
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:44,829
That's, he really means it.

1157
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:52,329
And it's about protecting women and, and helping society.

1158
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:53,789
And that's important.

1159
01:22:54,170 --> 01:23:00,109
And I just remember sitting there going, we are a different football club as of that moment.

1160
01:23:01,289 --> 01:23:03,869
Little, little things are big things.

1161
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:08,369
You know, I just, I always remember those sort of, those little touchstones of like,

1162
01:23:09,470 --> 01:23:12,350
that's, that's one aspect of leadership that I,

1163
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:13,189
I hold in.

1164
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:15,149
A really high regard.

1165
01:23:15,909 --> 01:23:16,310
Yeah.

1166
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:18,890
And it's such a unique part of our history, isn't it?

1167
01:23:18,890 --> 01:23:23,489
Uh, Bob, we go back to both of, you know, where we met and this history and love of

1168
01:23:23,489 --> 01:23:28,609
football club and just, as you, you know, the history so well, and you mentioned it

1169
01:23:28,609 --> 01:23:32,390
beautifully that, you know, I was there many times when it looked like you're going to

1170
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:37,329
go out of business and it was going to be over and arrive just after the, the fight

1171
01:23:37,329 --> 01:23:37,689
back.

1172
01:23:37,689 --> 01:23:42,310
And that was really fresh in everyone's minds that, you know, it was days away from being

1173
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:42,550
not.

1174
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:43,149
Yeah.

1175
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:44,609
Not a club anymore.

1176
01:23:44,609 --> 01:23:50,909
And then you see this sort of paradigm shift that happened when, you know, in your combination

1177
01:23:50,909 --> 01:23:57,670
with Luke and, and, and the whole environment, but the, the point of difference was Luke

1178
01:23:57,670 --> 01:24:02,449
Beveridge at that time and you being a captain, it's, it's, you know, when you look back,

1179
01:24:02,489 --> 01:24:05,170
it's provided some sustainable success.

1180
01:24:05,329 --> 01:24:05,569
Yeah.

1181
01:24:05,630 --> 01:24:12,210
It's just a magical time, you know, like the, one of the hard things about football at the

1182
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:19,789
elite level is everyone's trying, like they're red lining it, they're trying so hard and

1183
01:24:19,789 --> 01:24:22,390
they care and they're, they're emotionally invested.

1184
01:24:23,829 --> 01:24:32,189
But if, if there's not an emotional alignment, particularly with the leaders, it's hard because

1185
01:24:32,189 --> 01:24:37,130
there's a lot of effort and there's a lot of strain, but if it's not going in the same

1186
01:24:37,130 --> 01:24:39,149
way, there's a lot of conflict.

1187
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:42,090
And just for that, that brief period at the, at the, at the, at the, at the, at the, at

1188
01:24:42,090 --> 01:24:49,109
the Bulldogs during that time, it was like a orchestra, it's like a symphony and it just

1189
01:24:49,109 --> 01:24:50,989
clicked and we made some music.

1190
01:24:50,989 --> 01:24:57,229
And the, the brilliance of trying to recreate that and in a, such a regulated environment

1191
01:24:57,229 --> 01:24:59,970
where there are almost no competitive advantages, isn't it?

1192
01:24:59,989 --> 01:25:02,210
It's legislated for you not to be consistent.

1193
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:02,489
Yeah.

1194
01:25:02,789 --> 01:25:03,149
Good.

1195
01:25:03,449 --> 01:25:04,750
So much working against you.

1196
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:10,609
And socially engineered behind the scenes to try and undermine anyone who's too good.

1197
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:11,609
And what, what the.

1198
01:25:11,649 --> 01:25:11,989
And it's an overkill.

1199
01:25:12,090 --> 01:25:12,590
It's a double ball.

1200
01:25:12,869 --> 01:25:13,109
Yeah.

1201
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:14,430
It doesn't do what it's told.

1202
01:25:15,229 --> 01:25:16,829
Even the great ones fumble.

1203
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:21,550
And then you throw the emotion in and this expectation that you will just, you know,

1204
01:25:21,569 --> 01:25:21,890
win.

1205
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:24,010
It's a, it's, it's crazy, isn't it?

1206
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:24,770
At times.

1207
01:25:24,949 --> 01:25:30,689
If you could collaborate with anyone, Bob, on anything, you've got, we hear about so

1208
01:25:30,689 --> 01:25:32,130
many of your diverse interests.

1209
01:25:32,869 --> 01:25:36,890
Is there a person you thought that's, that's the one or has it already happened?

1210
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:39,630
You know, I mean, you've, you've mentioned some of the great people you have been able

1211
01:25:39,630 --> 01:25:40,270
to connect with.

1212
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:41,430
Is there a name?

1213
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:42,310
Probably Mendo.

1214
01:25:42,789 --> 01:25:43,590
Get him back.

1215
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:45,609
Who would it be?

1216
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:48,369
Who would it be?

1217
01:25:52,369 --> 01:25:54,350
That's a really, really hard question.

1218
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:00,579
Who would I want to collaborate with?

1219
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:07,010
I, I don't know.

1220
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:11,270
I'd like to spend time with Paul Keating.

1221
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:12,430
Really?

1222
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:14,270
Yeah.

1223
01:26:14,430 --> 01:26:16,470
Jeez, that's, that's.

1224
01:26:16,850 --> 01:26:18,010
I'd like to pick his brain.

1225
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:19,170
I don't know if that's collaboration.

1226
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:20,109
Yeah.

1227
01:26:20,409 --> 01:26:22,210
But I would love to pick his brain.

1228
01:26:22,449 --> 01:26:23,090
Why Paul Keating?

1229
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:23,149
Why Paul Keating?

1230
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:37,609
I like people who are complex, who are strong in their convictions.

1231
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:47,590
And I think he just had, whether you agree with him or not, his vision, but his views

1232
01:26:47,590 --> 01:26:53,569
on white Australia and indigenous Australia and how we could make that better.

1233
01:26:55,979 --> 01:26:56,899
It'd be fascinating.

1234
01:26:56,899 --> 01:26:57,020
Yeah.

1235
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:57,060
Yeah.

1236
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:57,079
Yeah.

1237
01:26:57,079 --> 01:27:00,539
And he was a man of many passions and interests.

1238
01:27:00,659 --> 01:27:08,119
He was into, um, classical music in a big way and, um, antique furniture and clocks and.

1239
01:27:08,359 --> 01:27:11,260
And apparently one of the weakest handshakes of all time.

1240
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:11,439
Really?

1241
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:13,640
And when I heard that, I was just crushed.

1242
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,319
And one of the great wordsmiths of all time.

1243
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:23,960
Oh, well, I mean, no one, the one liners and the quips and, I mean, I, I have pinched it

1244
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:28,819
so many times, but describing someone as all tip and no iceberg is just.

1245
01:27:29,539 --> 01:27:29,899
What?

1246
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:30,640
If you, if you, if you, if you, if you, if you, if you, if you, if you, if you, if you, if you,

1247
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:36,619
if someone said that about you or me, I'd take a decade to get over that, I reckon.

1248
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:40,300
And what did he say about Houston when they're asking you about a comeback for Houston?

1249
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:43,359
He said a souffle never rises twice.

1250
01:27:43,579 --> 01:27:46,420
Like, how do you get that at the top of you?

1251
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:53,000
See, the, the one that I loved about him too, he said, um, he said he loved long questions

1252
01:27:53,000 --> 01:28:00,539
in parliament because he was so confident that the speaker would get up.

1253
01:28:00,539 --> 01:28:04,899
And, and whoever it was, and whilst they were getting up to walk, and if they were a further

1254
01:28:04,899 --> 01:28:09,039
way away, he loved that because that gave him all this time to think about, well, this

1255
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:14,199
is what he's going through the files of his brain of, okay, this is the minister for whatever

1256
01:28:14,199 --> 01:28:18,819
the, the, the, the, the, the, and the longer they asked a question, he would then get to

1257
01:28:18,819 --> 01:28:22,560
a point of, he'd said, then it was just a matter of where I was going to hit them.

1258
01:28:23,119 --> 01:28:28,899
And how many times and how often I just think I certainly have never thought about that

1259
01:28:28,899 --> 01:28:29,920
in that way.

1260
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:29,939
Yeah.

1261
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:31,260
Intellect there, isn't there?

1262
01:28:31,359 --> 01:28:33,340
That would be fascinating, isn't it?

1263
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:37,340
It's, uh, maybe gone a touch, uh, off the reservation.

1264
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:38,479
They tend to.

1265
01:28:39,739 --> 01:28:41,039
And we probably will too.

1266
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:42,880
It's probably already happened for me, mate.

1267
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:46,119
I, uh, sincerely enjoyed catching up with you, mate.

1268
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:48,300
I genuinely, as we started.

1269
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:49,340
I love our company.

1270
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:50,079
I love our chats.

1271
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:50,739
I always have.

1272
01:28:50,979 --> 01:28:56,159
Mate, it's, uh, to have these lifelong, uh, friendships whenever it's the chances to get

1273
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:56,760
together, mate.

1274
01:28:56,819 --> 01:28:59,060
I, um, I love it and I enjoy it.

1275
01:28:59,260 --> 01:28:59,819
Thank you, mate.

1276
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:00,880
Enlightening as always.

1277
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:02,720
Not a lot of verbal jousting, mate.

1278
01:29:02,779 --> 01:29:03,359
No, I know.

1279
01:29:04,119 --> 01:29:05,880
We'll have to wait till after, but I love you.

1280
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:06,380
I love you too, mate.

1281
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:09,340
And you mean a lot to me and, um, thanks for looking after me all those years ago.

1282
