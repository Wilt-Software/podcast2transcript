1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,240
I said, I'm totally and utterly broken.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,339
And I said it and then just covered my mouth and went,

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,279
oh shit, what have I just done?

4
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:09,060
I'm the resilience guy.

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:09,800
I shouldn't have said that.

6
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:10,740
They're a comedy show.

7
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,640
They went, oh, okay.

8
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:12,660
Good stuff, mate.

9
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,279
Well, have a good day.

10
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:14,939
Chat to you soon.

11
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:15,560
And they were gone.

12
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,780
This week's guest on the Empowering Ladies podcast

13
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,140
is the remarkable Hugh van Kylenburg,

14
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,780
the founder of the Resilience Project

15
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,460
and the Imperfects podcast.

16
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:25,199
So Harvey not feeling good.

17
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,359
Fuck doing a virtue journal.

18
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:26,859
I have a beer.

19
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:29,440
Like who's in control of, like who's controlling you?

20
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,280
Who is in control?

21
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,500
Hear Hugh talk about Billy Slater,

22
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,759
legendary state of origin superstar in the NRL

23
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:37,859
from Queensland as being the best leader

24
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:39,359
that he has ever seen.

25
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,299
Billy put his hands up five minutes in and he goes,

26
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,240
hey mate, this is fucking awesome.

27
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:43,899
Keep going.

28
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,679
He tells the incredible story of approaching

29
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,320
Ryan Shelton in a cafe, having never met him before

30
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,439
and leading to this great collaboration

31
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:52,079
on the Imperfects podcast.

32
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,820
Saw Ryan, I didn't want to annoy him.

33
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,179
I wanted to say, hey, you have had a massive impact on me

34
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:57,240
and I just want to say thank you.

35
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,560
I got so nervous.

36
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,259
I went to the cafe and I was,

37
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:01,219
it was the most uncool thing I've ever done,

38
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:03,159
but I sat down next to him and pretended I hadn't seen him

39
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:03,939
and went, oh, Ryan Shelton.

40
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,340
You get Hugh's take on what it really means

41
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,359
to be happy in life.

42
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,739
I used to say this from a place of privilege,

43
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,099
which was, I was just so happy, no problems in my life.

44
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:11,900
Life was great.

45
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:13,180
Come on guys, do this stuff, it really helps.

46
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:15,060
I'm now saying it from a place of,

47
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:16,519
life's pretty tough at the moment

48
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,579
and I know this stuff is going to get me through.

49
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:20,319
What does that mean to you, self-leadership?

50
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:21,219
I have thought about this

51
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:22,540
because I hear the term come up a bit.

52
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,900
I reckon the more time I have off,

53
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:26,739
the better leader I am, I think.

54
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:28,959
So I've got in my calendar, Hugh not available

55
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:29,939
in these big chunks.

56
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,560
It's not, I'm being lazy.

57
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:34,219
It's because I've burnt out 2019, 2020, 2020.

58
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,400
I burnt out three years in a row.

59
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,959
I got to November and I was really unwell.

60
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,000
When you go so hard like that,

61
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,780
you're not the only one who suffers.

62
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,379
We're lucky enough to have Hugh

63
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:45,340
as part of our Alita Connect program.

64
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,680
Head to alitacollective.com to check it out.

65
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,000
We love the group that Hugh van Kylenburg is in

66
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,680
in Alita Connect.

67
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,840
Dr. Troy Flanagan from the Milwaukee Bucks.

68
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,500
Amit Baines from the Western Bulldogs as a CEO.

69
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,000
Vanessa Ford, Tyson Ballard.

70
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:58,900
And you hear Hugh's take on why

71
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,120
the learning and sharing

72
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,260
and empowering is so important.

73
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,540
It's something he really values.

74
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,439
Big thanks as always to Jason Nicholas

75
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,659
and his team from Tempered Bedding

76
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:06,879
for their ongoing support of conversations

77
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,419
like this one with Hugh van Kylenburg.

78
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,960
Have a look at Tempered Bedding,

79
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,319
a mattress like no other.

80
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,740
Hugh van Kylenburg had been working

81
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,939
in education settings for over 15 years,

82
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,800
teaching both primary and secondary

83
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,139
in a range of different educational settings.

84
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,620
The highlight of his teaching career

85
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,840
was the year he spent in Far North of India,

86
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,460
volunteering and living at an underprivileged school

87
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,120
in the Himalayas.

88
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,900
It was here that he discovered resilience

89
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,120
in its purest form.

90
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,719
Inspired by the experience,

91
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,620
Hugh returned to Melbourne

92
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,199
and commenced working on his own programs for schools.

93
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,939
The Resilience Project was born.

94
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,139
Having completed his postgraduate studies

95
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:40,479
looking at resilience and wellbeing,

96
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,099
Hugh has developed and facilitated programs

97
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,479
for over 900 schools Australia-wide.

98
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,639
In 2015, the National Rugby League

99
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,680
asked Hugh to run workshops

100
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,919
at every club in the competition.

101
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,360
Since then, he's worked with the Australian cricket team,

102
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,439
the Australian netball team,

103
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,719
the Australian women's soccer team

104
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,759
and more than 10 AFL footy teams.

105
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,360
Beyond the team environment,

106
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,960
Hugh has worked one-on-one with the team,

107
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,080
and he's worked with the team,

108
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,099
and he's worked with the team,

109
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:00,120
and he's worked with the team,

110
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,659
with individuals the likes of Steve Smith,

111
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,599
Dustin Martin and Billy Slater,

112
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,379
to name a few.

113
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,800
And in addition to his work in schools and elite sport,

114
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,099
Hugh has presented to over 500 corporate groups

115
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:10,900
as a keynote speaker

116
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,879
and developed comprehensive programs

117
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,039
for a range of workplaces

118
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,379
across different sectors.

119
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,900
He's a best-selling author

120
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,099
and co-host of the incredible podcast,

121
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,639
The Imperfects.

122
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,139
Great to see you, mate.

123
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,900
I was really admiring your...

124
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,879
With the podcast I do,

125
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:25,759
I have to do the introductions

126
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,460
and the amount of editing we do

127
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,439
to make me not sound like a moron who can't read.

128
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:30,099
I'm very impressed.

129
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:30,520
I'm very impressed with that.

130
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:31,979
Until I couldn't say Imperfects.

131
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,080
It was the second last word.

132
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:34,039
I'm usually the third word.

133
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:35,259
I'm like, okay, guys, let's start again.

134
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:36,060
We'll do a quick edit here.

135
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,979
Well, maybe there was some synergy in there,

136
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,280
because you celebrate people being Imperfectly Perfect,

137
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,400
so it wouldn't have been right to get that out.

138
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,139
Wow.

139
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:43,500
Yeah, I don't know.

140
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,879
Stumbling on the word Imperfects is quite ironic.

141
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:49,060
There's a bit of something in that, I'm sure.

142
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:49,419
Yeah.

143
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:52,659
More than 500,000 kids and countless adults

144
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:54,460
have benefited from the work that you do

145
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,400
in teaching people to be grateful

146
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,219
and empathetic and mindful.

147
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,699
Must make you proud.

148
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:01,180
It does.

149
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,699
I mean, I think it was 2011 I did my first talk in a school,

150
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:07,680
and it went really badly.

151
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,919
It was terrible.

152
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:11,900
And I remember, because I just wanted to do one-hour talks.

153
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,439
I love doing public speaking, and I love working with kids,

154
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,180
and my interest is mental health and education.

155
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,740
This is perfect.

156
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,180
And the school said,

157
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,519
oh, we would like you to run like a whole-day program.

158
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,699
And I said, I've only really got an hour's worth of material.

159
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:25,959
And I said, well, if you want the opportunity,

160
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,439
it's going to have to be six hours.

161
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,339
So I went away and thought,

162
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,040
right, what's a six-hour talk I can do?

163
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,279
And put this talk together for year sevens.

164
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,519
No, no, year eights,

165
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,040
which is if anyone's worked in secondary schools,

166
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,660
year eights is probably the most challenging group you'll work with.

167
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:41,199
It was a state school,

168
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:43,759
and it was out of control when I walked in there.

169
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,779
And it was awful.

170
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,120
It was just, I hated it.

171
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,180
And I did such a bad job.

172
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,519
And there was one point,

173
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:51,579
I knew Daniel Jackson, who played footy for Richmond.

174
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,939
I got him to come in as a guest speaker.

175
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,899
Very articulate, very intelligent man.

176
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:57,800
And he was probably at the height of his career.

177
00:04:58,019 --> 00:04:59,100
And I said to them early on,

178
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,660
Daniel Jackson's coming.

179
00:04:59,660 --> 00:04:59,680
Daniel Jackson's coming.

180
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,740
He's coming to Richmond Football Club.

181
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:03,199
And they all just went berserk with either booing or cheering.

182
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:04,319
And I couldn't get them back.

183
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:05,660
I couldn't get them back.

184
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:06,579
It was like five minutes.

185
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,480
And I was looking at the teachers as if I wanted support from them.

186
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,040
They're looking at me like kind of going,

187
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,699
no, you're charging money to be here.

188
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,379
You can deal with this.

189
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,100
No one helped.

190
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:14,800
And I just,

191
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:16,819
so the fact it's gone from that to now,

192
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:17,939
I think we have,

193
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,339
I think it's a thousand partnership schools.

194
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:21,740
So a partnership school does our curriculum

195
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,019
and has all the digital content sent to them throughout the year.

196
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,839
And they're with us for quite a few years,

197
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:27,920
well, for many years really.

198
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,180
So to get to that,

199
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,680
to this now in what,

200
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:32,199
it doesn't feel like it's been overnight.

201
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,000
It's just been so much hard work.

202
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
I don't know if proud's a word,

203
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:36,680
but no,

204
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,139
I think it is.

205
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,399
Yeah,

206
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:38,339
I do feel really proud.

207
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,199
I do feel really proud.

208
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,560
And I'm very proud to be here today as well.

209
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,339
But I went to,

210
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,279
I listened to this podcast

211
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,980
and this is not the question that you asked me,

212
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,779
but I'm going to say it anyway.

213
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,259
I love this podcast.

214
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,339
There's some great stories.

215
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,699
And my favorite episode would be with Richard Oppie.

216
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,220
I went to school with Ops.

217
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,120
He was a year above me.

218
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,620
And one of the things that he said,

219
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,779
which I think about all the time,

220
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,420
he spoke about on this podcast,

221
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,139
he spoke about,

222
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,100
being aware of the energy that you bring into a room.

223
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,959
And I just took that very literally to my family,

224
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,439
to when I get up in the morning,

225
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,240
no matter what I'm feeling,

226
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,019
be aware of the energy you bring into the room.

227
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,680
And I love that.

228
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:10,300
And it actually reminded me of,

229
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:11,560
so Richard Oppie,

230
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,180
my first day of high school in year seven,

231
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,019
Richard Oppie was brought back as the year eight leader

232
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:17,060
to give a speech on what school's like,

233
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,180
what high school's like.

234
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,480
And he said something,

235
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,439
which I take into this,

236
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,860
I still practice every day.

237
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:22,279
He said,

238
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,699
his last thing was his big speech

239
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:24,519
and his closing line was,

240
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,379
and always pack your bag the night before.

241
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,800
And I have done it every day since.

242
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,399
Actually, Richard Oppie,

243
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,480
back in 1993.

244
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:32,720
Well, mate,

245
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:34,879
that is a brilliant story

246
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,079
and very kind of you to share.

247
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,259
And for those that don't know,

248
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,180
Richard went to Kerry Grammer a year above you

249
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,560
and has had this trajectory in life

250
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,779
that's quite ridiculous.

251
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,879
Maybe got the biggest marketing job in the world.

252
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:45,699
As far as I can tell,

253
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,100
he's like the CEO of beer.

254
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:47,800
That's what,

255
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,139
I don't know exactly what the position is,

256
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:49,259
but.

257
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:50,379
And we all dreamed of that as kids,

258
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,459
let's be honest with you.

259
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,720
Every time I pop up,

260
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,439
he's with David Beckham or Lionel Messi

261
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,920
or basically Budweiser around the globe.

262
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,800
It's just incredible.

263
00:06:58,899 --> 00:06:59,120
I do.

264
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,379
I do wonder how easy of a job that is though,

265
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:02,579
like having to market beer.

266
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,079
I don't think it needs any marketing.

267
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,560
I think it's pretty popular.

268
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,519
I think his sales budget's something like $30 billion.

269
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:09,899
So you need to sell a few,

270
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:12,480
a few Coronas and a few Budweisers to achieve that.

271
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,040
But I love the fact that they promote young people

272
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,160
in that organisation

273
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
and they saw this talented young guy in Australia

274
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,399
and said,

275
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,319
he's got something special.

276
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:20,300
He's doing something differently

277
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,740
and they back in young people.

278
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,959
His age to have that role was almost unheard of.

279
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,740
And I also love,

280
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:28,420
it's what I think is brilliant about the shared economy.

281
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,019
And I will talk,

282
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,819
I'll talk about the imperfects,

283
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,300
but if you pick up something

284
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,500
and that you generally apply to your life,

285
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,540
that is a piece of gold to me,

286
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:35,860
isn't it?

287
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,180
And sometimes it is something,

288
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,519
pack your bag the night before

289
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:41,259
is just something that works for you,

290
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:41,560
isn't it?

291
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,259
It's small stuff.

292
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:43,459
It's even something else that,

293
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:45,160
I'm not going to make this a tribute to Richard Oppie,

294
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:46,100
this interview,

295
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,420
but I remember playing cricket with him.

296
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,120
He was playing first love in cricket

297
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,920
in your 10 year old.

298
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,779
And so he's quite a good cricketer.

299
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,939
He's probably the first to admit

300
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,079
he wasn't the best cricketer going around,

301
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,480
but he was good enough to play first love in cricket.

302
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:55,620
Over the batting,

303
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,279
we were playing against St. Kevin's one day

304
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,879
and there was a guy bowling,

305
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,160
and he was bowling pretty quick for school cricket.

306
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,540
And he hit opposite,

307
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:04,480
literally on the,

308
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,000
it was a bouncer,

309
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,360
and hit him on the tip of the elbow.

310
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,420
Like such an awful place to hit.

311
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,720
And his elbow was just mushed

312
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,560
and he just kept batting.

313
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,680
And afterwards,

314
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,639
when people are asking about it,

315
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,819
he was so stoic about it,

316
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,279
he wouldn't complain about it.

317
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,480
And he was,

318
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,379
that was very much his thing.

319
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,000
He was very tough.

320
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,800
But I remember going,

321
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:19,939
oh wow,

322
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,860
like you don't make it,

323
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:21,439
if you get hurt,

324
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,600
don't make a big thing about it.

325
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:22,980
And just,

326
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:23,899
it's just funny,

327
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,100
you pick up little things from people

328
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,740
and I'll do,

329
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,759
there are three that I just think of,

330
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,720
think of Richard Oppie.

331
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,899
Every day I think about

332
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,519
the hacks of life,

333
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,879
which I think the podcast world

334
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,679
is bringing to life,

335
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:32,960
isn't it?

336
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,500
You used to have to wait

337
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,399
for someone to write a book,

338
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:35,860
see them in person.

339
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,179
But now in real time,

340
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,379
people are genuinely sharing

341
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:39,860
more than they've ever done before.

342
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,419
Are you finding that?

343
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,179
Yeah,

344
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:41,820
absolutely.

345
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:42,860
It's funny,

346
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,100
I think the whole world,

347
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,379
certainly commercial sites

348
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:46,100
are still trying to work out

349
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,019
how on earth podcasts,

350
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,120
because they're free.

351
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,899
I guess it's like TV,

352
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,639
like it's a free,

353
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:52,700
it's just this free product,

354
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,179
it's great.

355
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,740
Like the,

356
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:55,220
whatever you're into,

357
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,580
you can find someone having a really,

358
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,440
I always,

359
00:08:58,539 --> 00:08:58,879
one of the things I love

360
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,279
is,

361
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,460
I'll give you an example of it,

362
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,179
like that show that came up on,

363
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:03,759
I think it was Netflix

364
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,419
or wherever it was,

365
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,519
The Octopus Teacher

366
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:05,799
or whatever,

367
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,759
that guy who would,

368
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,340
it wasn't so much The Octopus,

369
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:08,759
I was interested,

370
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,019
I loved this man's passion.

371
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,299
I loved watching someone

372
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:13,139
who was so passionate

373
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:13,720
about something

374
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,940
and the excitement he got from it.

375
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,000
And I feel the same

376
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,700
listening to a podcast

377
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,779
when someone's on a topic

378
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:19,279
they just love exploring

379
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,360
and they want to nerd out on it.

380
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:20,960
I kind of,

381
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:21,940
I'm often more interested

382
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,139
in their passion

383
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:23,559
and the topic

384
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,759
than what the topic is itself.

385
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:26,360
And I think podcasts,

386
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,139
I think they're just great for that.

387
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:28,519
I love,

388
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,720
and certainly with our podcast,

389
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,700
it's been an incredible experience

390
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,519
that I've loved so much.

391
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,480
And I get to do it with,

392
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:33,960
you know,

393
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,779
three of my best friends,

394
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,740
Bridget, our producer,

395
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,419
who you know well,

396
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,519
who produced

397
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,440
The Hot Breakfast for you

398
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,000
for many years,

399
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,159
Ryan Shelton

400
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,100
and my little brother Josh.

401
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,399
And we get to

402
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,879
have these incredible people

403
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,039
on who are willing to share

404
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,179
really vulnerable stuff.

405
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
And then when that happens,

406
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:50,940
you have this closeness

407
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,820
and connection with them

408
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,179
that you never really forget.

409
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:55,539
These friendships have come

410
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:55,980
out of nowhere

411
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,899
where it's just,

412
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,480
you can't have those conversations

413
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,320
and then not stay in touch with them.

414
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,299
So it's been incredible.

415
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:02,940
That feels like

416
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,559
your superpower to me here.

417
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,539
The handful of times

418
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:06,299
I've been in your company,

419
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:07,139
it feels like

420
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,960
you open up immediately

421
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,100
a truth serum.

422
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,779
It's amazing.

423
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,500
And so suddenly

424
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,639
I start sharing with you things

425
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,779
I don't share with other people.

426
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,139
I don't know if you intend to do it,

427
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,580
but it seems as though

428
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,820
that's a sort of gift.

429
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,419
You make people feel comfortable enough

430
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,340
straight away.

431
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:23,240
And that's what The Imperfects does,

432
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,620
isn't it?

433
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,019
It gets people to share

434
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,200
in ways they haven't before.

435
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,460
And is that something

436
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,419
that you've always,

437
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,679
valued and been able to do?

438
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,799
That's very kind to say.

439
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:31,179
Thank you.

440
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:32,539
I think I don't do it with everyone.

441
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,039
It's a certain energy.

442
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,120
I think you just want

443
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,840
a certain energy with someone.

444
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:36,039
You're like,

445
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,220
I feel very safe to share stuff

446
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:37,799
with this person.

447
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,720
And I think when you do that,

448
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,679
that person feels like,

449
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,580
oh, this person trusts me.

450
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:42,279
So I trust them.

451
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:43,779
I think that's kind of what it does.

452
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:45,080
But no,

453
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,820
I don't do it to everyone.

454
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,059
But you certainly have that energy

455
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:47,320
of like,

456
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,000
I can trust this guy.

457
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:48,659
I can tell him stuff.

458
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:50,019
Yeah, I think I've probably

459
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:52,100
always instinctively liked

460
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,279
those kind of conversations

461
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,659
where it's like very real.

462
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:55,919
You're like,

463
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,240
well, I might only meet this person once.

464
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:57,639
Or,

465
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,580
I don't know,

466
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,379
I would like to make this encounter,

467
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:01,139
you know,

468
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:02,720
I'd like to make this encounter count

469
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,019
or like count for something.

470
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:04,299
Or,

471
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,019
I don't know,

472
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,240
I'd like it to be,

473
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,539
I'd like to know more about this person.

474
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,759
I sent an extra book on the plane

475
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:10,139
last night on the way back

476
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:11,000
from Ballina.

477
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,080
And he would have been

478
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,980
older than my dad.

479
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,100
He was probably about 80 years old.

480
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,899
And he had his phone out

481
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:15,559
and he had like,

482
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,860
I say this in a kind way,

483
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,299
but old person sized text.

484
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:18,940
It was huge.

485
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,659
And he's writing notes to himself.

486
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:21,799
And it was,

487
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,000
it said what I'd learned today.

488
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,659
And I was watching Unchained,

489
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:26,340
the Netflix cycling

490
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,559
Tour de France documentary.

491
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:29,559
But my screen was very close

492
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,500
to where he was holding his

493
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,340
and it's huge text.

494
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:32,659
And I could see,

495
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,059
and I was trying not to look,

496
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:34,840
but it was very hard not to.

497
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,200
He was writing his reflections on the day.

498
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:37,559
And it was really vulnerable stuff

499
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,100
about someone,

500
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:39,679
I don't know who it was,

501
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,440
but he was reflecting on someone

502
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,940
who he wants to know,

503
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,820
he wanted to know

504
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,179
why they keep him out of the loop

505
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:44,740
for so long

506
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,600
and only bring him the last minute.

507
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,299
Do they not trust him?

508
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:46,879
Do they not love him?

509
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,019
And it was really,

510
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,399
I was like,

511
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:48,700
oh,

512
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,019
I so want to talk to this man.

513
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,179
I want to hear the actual story.

514
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,120
He just didn't look like

515
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,580
the kind of guy

516
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,240
who would even have those thoughts,

517
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,220
let alone reflect on them.

518
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,279
And it's a two-hour flight,

519
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,919
the whole way,

520
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,940
there's really deep thoughts

521
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,960
and I didn't read all of them.

522
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,080
I read a lot of them.

523
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,379
It was hard not to,

524
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,120
but I think everyone has a story.

525
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:05,059
Like everyone has this,

526
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,100
has an incredible story.

527
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,360
And I kind of want to share mine

528
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,779
with people

529
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:10,820
and have them share theirs.

530
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,899
And it sort of results in,

531
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,039
I'd like love,

532
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,779
like the result is,

533
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,120
so with your leader group,

534
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,860
perfect example,

535
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,480
my leader group.

536
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,100
So we started last,

537
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
just started later last year

538
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,659
and remarkable people.

539
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,679
So we've got high performance

540
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,460
from Dr. Troy Fleming.

541
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:25,759
Yep.

542
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,120
Yep.

543
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,759
We have Vanessa Ford,

544
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,360
who's the creative super senior

545
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,980
over in Canada.

546
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,399
We have-

547
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:33,600
Mick Baines from the Western Board.

548
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:34,840
Tyson Ballard,

549
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,299
who's a serial entrepreneur

550
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:38,139
that is a remarkable human being.

551
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:39,139
It's like 50 companies.

552
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,519
He's out of control, Tyson,

553
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,659
with what he's doing creatively.

554
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,340
And the first two sessions are good.

555
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,840
Like we were getting a lot out of it.

556
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:45,279
We're chatting.

557
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,259
And then session three,

558
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,559
I don't think you might be saying this,

559
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,259
but Dr. Troy Fleming,

560
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,120
Dr. Troy Fleming just told us

561
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,840
about a problem he was having

562
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,919
that was more about his life

563
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,940
than his personal life.

564
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,759
And he was really vulnerable

565
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:56,200
and sharing.

566
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,000
He was sharing where he was at

567
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,980
and all the walls came tumbling down.

568
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,039
And all of a sudden,

569
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,700
I went from really liking these people

570
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,720
to just loving these people.

571
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:03,840
Like I honestly,

572
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,220
I was looking at this bloke on the screen

573
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,179
who I've never met before.

574
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,519
He's over in Milwaukee

575
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,159
and I'm just,

576
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,700
I thought,

577
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:09,299
I love this man.

578
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,080
I love him.

579
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,679
And it was all because he just told us

580
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:12,700
what was really happening in his life.

581
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,820
I think that's what it is.

582
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,259
When people tell you

583
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:15,279
what's really happening in their life,

584
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,100
like when someone tells the world

585
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,940
what they're struggling with,

586
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,220
the world just wraps their arms around them.

587
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:20,860
It's like,

588
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:21,799
yeah, hey, we've got you.

589
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,379
And that's certainly my experience.

590
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,100
It's just a much nicer feeling

591
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,940
to walk side by side

592
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,720
with someone thinking

593
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,519
they've got my back

594
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,700
because I know what's really going on

595
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,940
as opposed to,

596
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:30,960
I'll pretend everything's fine

597
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,200
because they'll think I'm great

598
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,820
because everything's fine.

599
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:33,580
It's just never really.

600
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,980
No, particularly when you,

601
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:35,740
you know,

602
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,559
people that look like

603
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,100
they've got their life

604
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,419
completely sorted out,

605
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:38,720
doesn't it?

606
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,519
And we always look and go,

607
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,139
God, there's nothing going on there.

608
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,200
And then when someone does let you in,

609
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,419
because everyone's got shit going on,

610
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:45,779
haven't they?

611
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,399
We all have.

612
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,600
We're all making mistakes.

613
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,379
We've all got stuff happening

614
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:49,279
on the family front.

615
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,159
I think everyone's up against it.

616
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:51,399
Yeah.

617
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,480
Everyone's up against it.

618
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,200
We just have been taught,

619
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,620
I think,

620
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:55,860
or,

621
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,580
we've picked up

622
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,399
somewhere along the line,

623
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,399
whether it's through our parenting

624
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,019
or through school

625
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:00,799
or just through society,

626
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,179
that the aim is to present

627
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:03,000
the opposite

628
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,399
so that you're impressive

629
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,539
and then you're accepted,

630
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,940
which I think is fine,

631
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,659
but I think eventually

632
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:09,759
that unravels

633
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:10,539
or that comes undone

634
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:11,279
at a certain point.

635
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,960
Whereas I think if you just,

636
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:13,679
hey, this is what's happening,

637
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,559
it provided you feel safe

638
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,399
to do that.

639
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:17,059
I think it's,

640
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:18,539
you get a much more,

641
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,700
a full rounded experience

642
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,940
of the human emotions.

643
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:21,720
And what I love about

644
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,559
what you've been able to do,

645
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,740
there's so many questions

646
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,379
to come back to

647
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:25,279
and I will in a moment,

648
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:25,919
but, you know,

649
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,960
I see you in the huddle

650
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,879
at State of Origin

651
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:29,419
for Queensland.

652
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,519
You don't get more alpha.

653
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:33,879
You don't get anywhere

654
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:34,519
in the world

655
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:35,460
than those guys.

656
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,320
AFL world's not far behind

657
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,019
and they're bringing in

658
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:39,879
Hugh Van Collenburg

659
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,919
from Kerry Grammar.

660
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,059
A Victorian.

661
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,100
A Victorian

662
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,139
to come in

663
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:45,679
and teach them that,

664
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,980
teach them to be vulnerable,

665
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:48,379
teach them to share

666
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:49,320
their feelings more.

667
00:14:49,539 --> 00:14:50,059
And, you know,

668
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:51,019
it's the world I grew up in

669
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:51,740
in AFL football.

670
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:52,759
Shit, don't do that.

671
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,940
You'll be ostracized.

672
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:55,919
You've brought that

673
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,220
to mainstream here

674
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:57,679
in Australia.

675
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:58,440
It must be,

676
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,059
do you have those moments

677
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:00,879
where you look around and go,

678
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,340
or does it just feel so natural?

679
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:03,759
You walk into those environments now

680
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,039
and you can create that?

681
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,639
I feel confident now

682
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,379
to do that,

683
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,419
but it wasn't always the case.

684
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:08,600
I mean,

685
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:09,539
my first,

686
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,700
my first deleting,

687
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,039
I wanted to do this in schools.

688
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:13,620
I wanted to do talks in schools

689
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,740
and some workplaces,

690
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:15,820
but never really felt qualified

691
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,399
in a workplace

692
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,259
because as a teacher,

693
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,559
I was like,

694
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,220
I haven't spent much time

695
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:18,840
in corporate world.

696
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:20,980
And then when I got the opportunity

697
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,419
to go and speak

698
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:22,159
to the Melbourne Storm

699
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:22,960
in 2015,

700
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,200
I was really nervous

701
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,879
and I don't often get

702
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:26,059
nervous,

703
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,080
but I was extremely nervous.

704
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,440
They're the biggest men

705
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:28,940
I've ever seen

706
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,659
in my entire life.

707
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,500
They didn't look like

708
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,080
they were ever wrapped

709
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,759
to be in a room

710
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,019
listening to guys

711
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:33,340
that are talking

712
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,059
about mental health

713
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,500
and NBA finals were on.

714
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:37,460
It was like,

715
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,679
they're watching the NBA finals

716
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,860
and I had to turn it off

717
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,259
to come in.

718
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,679
I was like,

719
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,720
this is not good.

720
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:42,899
And a few of the boys

721
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:43,220
at the back

722
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,960
had their iPads out

723
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,419
and they were watching

724
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:44,960
while I started.

725
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,960
And five minutes in,

726
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,379
Billy Slater put his hand up

727
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:48,840
and I did,

728
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,799
I'm a Melbourne boy,

729
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:51,799
so I knew Billy Slater,

730
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:52,519
I knew Cameron Smith.

731
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,080
I didn't even know

732
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,860
who Cooper Cronk was,

733
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,820
so I didn't know anyone else.

734
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,320
That definitely helped,

735
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,539
but Billy put his hands up

736
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,200
five minutes in

737
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,539
and he goes,

738
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:58,960
hey mate.

739
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,360
And I thought,

740
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:00,620
oh,

741
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,259
this could be,

742
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,620
and he goes,

743
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,720
this is fucking awesome.

744
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,539
And he pointed at me

745
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:04,700
and he goes,

746
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,200
keep going.

747
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:05,980
I was like,

748
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:06,139
well,

749
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:06,279
yeah,

750
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:06,899
I wasn't going to stop,

751
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:07,320
but okay,

752
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:07,980
thank you.

753
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:09,100
And from that point

754
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,559
I was looking around,

755
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:09,720
I was like,

756
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:09,940
oh,

757
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:10,899
their iPads are down.

758
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,059
They need this,

759
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,600
like they really need this stuff.

760
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,259
And from that point on,

761
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:15,539
it just,

762
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,440
it took off.

763
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,379
Like it just took off

764
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:18,039
in a late sport.

765
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,320
And the funny thing

766
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,860
is it got to a point

767
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,120
where I thought,

768
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,259
I don't,

769
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:23,000
I just want to have a rest

770
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,700
from doing a late sport

771
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,200
because I care,

772
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,539
I love sports so much.

773
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,620
And so when I work with a club,

774
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,360
I become obsessed with that club

775
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,259
and while Port Adelaide,

776
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:32,139
while I was working with Port Adelaide

777
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:32,779
for a couple of years

778
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:34,080
and we did some really great stuff together

779
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,679
and I became,

780
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:38,000
I was so nervous at game times.

781
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,500
I couldn't relax and enjoy footy.

782
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,000
And then when I was doing

783
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,600
with Cricket Australia,

784
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,860
I couldn't watch the cricket

785
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,299
and relax.

786
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:43,799
I just want,

787
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,320
and so I just want time away

788
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,860
from sport.

789
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,879
I just want a couple of years off.

790
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,379
And then Billy,

791
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,519
two years ago,

792
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,299
Billy Saita said,

793
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,100
can we catch up?

794
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:50,559
And I said,

795
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:50,679
yeah,

796
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,019
it's fine.

797
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:51,360
He said,

798
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,559
I'd love you to work

799
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,919
with the Queensland State of Origin team

800
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,240
and gave a big spiel on why

801
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,419
and said,

802
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:55,879
what do you reckon?

803
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:56,500
And I said,

804
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,799
I'll do it if the coach is,

805
00:16:58,899 --> 00:16:59,159
I said,

806
00:16:59,179 --> 00:16:59,980
if the coach is in,

807
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,019
I'll do it.

808
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,279
Because if the coach isn't in mate,

809
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:02,679
he's not,

810
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:03,220
and he said,

811
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:03,779
he paused for a minute

812
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:04,059
and he said,

813
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,980
so I'm the coach.

814
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:05,599
And I went,

815
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,240
all right,

816
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:06,480
okay.

817
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,000
Again,

818
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:07,740
I'm not all over,

819
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,180
you know,

820
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,319
I'm not over rugby league.

821
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,700
That has been,

822
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,099
I have never seen culture

823
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:12,740
like that before.

824
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,460
Never.

825
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,079
I quite generally,

826
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,579
hand on heart,

827
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,299
have learned a lot more

828
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:17,119
from them than they did me.

829
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:17,940
And you know,

830
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,579
I love that story

831
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,740
that you mentioned,

832
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:19,980
you know,

833
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,440
Billy Slater,

834
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,240
five minutes in,

835
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:22,079
what he's done

836
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,160
is basically signal to the group,

837
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,180
I'm in here,

838
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,319
come with me,

839
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,400
you need to be in as well.

840
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:27,720
And,

841
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:29,359
and that's what great culture

842
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:29,720
is about,

843
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:30,059
isn't it?

844
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:30,359
It's,

845
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,079
it's saying,

846
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,680
I don't care what,

847
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:32,900
get off your iPads boys.

848
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:33,900
I'm in,

849
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,140
we need to absorb this.

850
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,940
And the fact that

851
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,940
you get an entree in

852
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,180
through someone like Billy Slater

853
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,619
is why it probably works

854
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:39,980
so,

855
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,980
so successful.

856
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,579
There's so much,

857
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:41,740
mate,

858
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,039
there's 500 questions

859
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,240
in so many different directions.

860
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,180
I feel like I could do

861
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,460
a three part series

862
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,920
on Queensland State of Origin.

863
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,440
There's a,

864
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,359
there's a whole new podcast

865
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,279
in that alone.

866
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:51,700
But I,

867
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,900
I do want to go back a bit

868
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,880
just to give you the context.

869
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,400
You standing in front of

870
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,000
Queensland State of Origin

871
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and so many other stories

872
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,359
that maybe don't make sense

873
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,460
to people without going back

874
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:00,779
a step.

875
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,140
Yeah, of course.

876
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:01,799
There's a saying

877
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:02,900
that I really believe in

878
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,140
on the other side of pain

879
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,200
and hardship in life

880
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,680
often is almost everything

881
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,259
that you want.

882
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,940
And you had some serious

883
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,880
hardship growing up

884
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,380
and particularly,

885
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:10,799
you know,

886
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,380
with your sister

887
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,960
and the effect that had on you

888
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,539
and your family

889
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,259
and her more pertinently.

890
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,140
Do you think

891
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,339
if you could explain

892
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:17,920
a bit of that story

893
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,460
do you think

894
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,819
living through that

895
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:21,039
has given you this platform

896
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:21,720
now to be

897
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,440
who you are?

898
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,339
Yes,

899
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,079
I do.

900
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:24,859
I do.

901
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,359
I think,

902
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:26,599
and it does sound

903
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,099
a little bit cliche

904
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:27,839
but I do feel like

905
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,380
if it didn't,

906
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,000
if my family didn't go through

907
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,279
what was,

908
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:30,980
so my sister

909
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,700
when she was 14 years old

910
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,279
was diagnosed

911
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,380
with anorexia nervosa

912
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,099
an eating disorder.

913
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,799
It ravaged her,

914
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,799
it ravaged the family

915
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,519
and when she was 17 years old

916
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,319
she's admitted to hospital

917
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:40,839
because she dropped

918
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:41,660
below crisis weight

919
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,720
and it was extremely,

920
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:43,940
I didn't realise

921
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,200
until she was actually in,

922
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:45,720
that,

923
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,559
that was the night

924
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,180
when we got home

925
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:47,900
from my sister's

926
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,440
my sister's admitted

927
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:49,759
to hospital,

928
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,279
I'm 20,

929
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,480
George is 17,

930
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:52,140
my little brother Josh

931
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,220
is 14

932
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,400
and we're sitting

933
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:54,960
around the dinner table

934
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,380
that night,

935
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,099
George is not there

936
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:56,420
obviously

937
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,539
and dad

938
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,299
just picked up his plate

939
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:00,880
and went to the kitchen

940
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,240
quite early

941
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,799
and was cleaning up

942
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:02,579
and asked him a question

943
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:03,039
he didn't answer

944
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,839
so I turned around

945
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,319
to ask him again

946
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,240
and I'll never ever forget

947
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,740
the silhouette

948
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,440
of my dad

949
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,400
hunched over the kitchen

950
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,220
sinking tears

951
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,660
and I hadn't really

952
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,519
seen dad cry before

953
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,619
and for anyone listening

954
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,180
certainly for me

955
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,700
from chatting to people

956
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,380
it seems to be

957
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,019
for a lot of people

958
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:17,779
you remember the times

959
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:18,579
you saw your parents cry

960
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:19,380
and it's very unnerving

961
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,740
it's very unsettling

962
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,359
because they're like

963
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,140
the people keeping you

964
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,680
safe from the world

965
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,380
and there you gauge

966
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,059
on how things are going

967
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:26,019
and when you see them

968
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:27,420
not coping

969
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,500
it's kind of like

970
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,359
okay,

971
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,119
who's got me now

972
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,460
and I had this

973
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,119
strong feeling

974
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,259
I just remember it

975
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,119
so clearly thinking

976
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,279
that's the point

977
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:35,980
where I became fascinated

978
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,440
with the question

979
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,079
what is it that makes

980
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:37,599
people happy

981
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,019
I knew I couldn't

982
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:39,579
fix my sister

983
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:40,559
but I so desperately

984
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,500
wanted to make dad happy

985
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,240
and mum happy

986
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,539
and Josh happy

987
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:47,140
because I'd realised

988
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,559
we weren't

989
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:47,759
I was like

990
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,859
oh, we're not a happy family

991
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:49,359
we have been

992
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,059
we're not anymore

993
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:51,740
and I had no idea

994
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,200
what to do

995
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,920
I had no idea

996
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,759
for a very long time

997
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,779
but that's what started

998
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:56,940
I think that question

999
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,460
what is it that makes

1000
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:57,940
people happy

1001
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,720
was always

1002
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,660
burning

1003
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,359
that question

1004
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,099
was burning quite fiercely

1005
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:02,740
in the back of my mind

1006
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,119
for the whole of my 20s

1007
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,039
and I had no idea

1008
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:05,559
what I was going to do

1009
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,119
with my life

1010
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:06,599
but I did

1011
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:08,579
that was my biggest fascination

1012
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:09,119
I think

1013
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,519
and that led me to do

1014
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:11,119
primary school teaching

1015
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:11,480
because I thought

1016
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,579
well if I'm a primary school teacher

1017
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:13,740
I could stop

1018
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,420
anyone I teach

1019
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,000
I'll stop them getting

1020
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,079
I'll stop them getting

1021
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:16,559
a mental illness

1022
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,460
I don't know how

1023
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,680
but I'll stop that happening

1024
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,819
I remember my first day

1025
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:20,720
in front of grade 5

1026
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,140
was the first day

1027
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,519
as a teacher

1028
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,000
going right

1029
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,039
time to stop this

1030
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,200
it's getting a mental illness

1031
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,779
I had no idea

1032
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:25,240
what to do again

1033
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,259
but so to come back

1034
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:26,579
to your question

1035
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:27,440
without that

1036
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,740
I'm not doing this

1037
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,539
there's no way

1038
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:30,079
I'm doing this

1039
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,660
and it's almost unfair

1040
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,619
my sister went through that

1041
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:33,599
so I could then

1042
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,180
do this

1043
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,099
but yeah

1044
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:37,000
that's kind of what happened

1045
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,119
I have to ask you

1046
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,359
what does it take

1047
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:39,839
to be happy?

1048
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,500
So gosh

1049
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,400
I've been on such a journey

1050
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:44,980
since then

1051
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,380
you know

1052
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,059
we've had struggles

1053
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:46,859
in my family

1054
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,039
now which

1055
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:48,980
which I'll speak about

1056
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,319
one day

1057
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:49,539
but

1058
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,579
so when we

1059
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:52,240
when I first

1060
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,299
born Benji

1061
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:55,160
in 2016

1062
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,779
people

1063
00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:56,400
a lot of people said

1064
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:56,920
what do you want most

1065
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,400
for your son?

1066
00:20:58,019 --> 00:20:58,440
and my answer

1067
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,900
for the first month

1068
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,339
was I just wanted

1069
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:00,940
to be happy

1070
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,940
and it would lead me

1071
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,359
on to going

1072
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,980
and you know

1073
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,299
what you do

1074
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:04,799
to be happy

1075
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,519
you practice gratitude

1076
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:06,240
empathy and mindfulness

1077
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,859
that's what I learnt

1078
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:07,200
in India

1079
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,019
that's what the research

1080
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:08,380
says

1081
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,279
that's what our

1082
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:09,960
program's about

1083
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,000
but the

1084
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,480
the older my kids

1085
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,119
I mean I learnt this

1086
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:13,599
after a month

1087
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,660
he's not going to be

1088
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,279
happy all the time

1089
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,539
that's not the goal

1090
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:17,440
when no one's

1091
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,099
happy all the time

1092
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:20,039
what I want for my kids

1093
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:20,460
is when

1094
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:20,900
is that

1095
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,980
when not if

1096
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,740
when something goes

1097
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,440
wrong in their life

1098
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,019
I want them

1099
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:25,619
to have some resources

1100
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:26,980
they can go back to

1101
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,759
that might help them

1102
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,000
navigate

1103
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,099
what is a really

1104
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:30,640
tough time

1105
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,460
because it'll

1106
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,359
we all go through

1107
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,380
really tough stuff

1108
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,799
and we're not all

1109
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,460
happy all the time

1110
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,980
but we can do things

1111
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,400
there are things

1112
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:37,940
we can do

1113
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,559
to navigate that

1114
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,759
and it doesn't always work

1115
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:41,019
but

1116
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:42,259
if we know the things

1117
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:42,779
we kind of

1118
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:44,599
I'm seeing my psychologist

1119
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,799
once every two weeks

1120
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:46,200
at the moment

1121
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,180
and

1122
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:47,859
with the challenges

1123
00:21:47,859 --> 00:21:48,559
we've got in our family

1124
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:48,940
at the moment

1125
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,960
I've been finding

1126
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,079
really difficult of late

1127
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,259
and I've been saying to her

1128
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:54,059
I'm doing this stuff

1129
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:55,079
and there's

1130
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:55,779
the exercise

1131
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:56,220
that keeps me

1132
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,559
exercise is the big thing

1133
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:57,960
for me

1134
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,099
plus performing

1135
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:00,259
with our live tour

1136
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:01,259
but I noticed

1137
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:01,960
even those things

1138
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,900
weren't starting to

1139
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,880
really have the effect

1140
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,460
I wanted them to

1141
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,880
like they weren't

1142
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,279
you know

1143
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:08,220
when every time I exercise

1144
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,160
I just feel so happy

1145
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,500
or performing so happy

1146
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,839
or journaling

1147
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:12,299
and gratitude

1148
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,299
empathy and mindfulness stuff

1149
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,079
and I've noticed

1150
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:14,819
in the last few months

1151
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:15,880
it hasn't quite been

1152
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,160
you know

1153
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,380
it just hasn't been

1154
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,440
working the way it usually does

1155
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,660
and that's made me panic a bit

1156
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,299
and go oh my god

1157
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,140
if these things aren't working

1158
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,960
where am I at now

1159
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,140
but

1160
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,019
she said

1161
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:26,039
you've just got to drag yourself

1162
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,119
towards these things right now

1163
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,799
and the wheel will turn for you

1164
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,319
but you've got to keep

1165
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:29,859
dragging yourself

1166
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:30,539
towards this stuff

1167
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:30,839
so

1168
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:32,200
I don't think I've really

1169
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,799
answered the question

1170
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,140
but

1171
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,759
I know that

1172
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,200
no matter where you are

1173
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,019
we're all on the mental health

1174
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:37,700
spectrum somewhere

1175
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,500
some people are sitting

1176
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:38,880
at the top

1177
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,720
and life's great

1178
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,579
and some are down the bottom

1179
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:40,819
but

1180
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:42,359
if you come back to this stuff

1181
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,099
the research says

1182
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:44,140
if you practice gratitude

1183
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,440
which is where you pay attention

1184
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,119
to what you've got

1185
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:46,700
you don't worry about

1186
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,160
what you don't have

1187
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,440
you can practice empathy

1188
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:49,799
which is

1189
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,000
you put yourself

1190
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,980
in someone else's shoes

1191
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,500
and you look for

1192
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,000
compassionate action

1193
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,480
from that

1194
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,619
and if you

1195
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:56,539
practice mindfulness

1196
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:58,039
just being wherever you are

1197
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:59,099
the only thing that is really

1198
00:22:59,099 --> 00:22:59,839
happening in our world

1199
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:00,799
is what's happening right now

1200
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,720
those things will

1201
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,079
have a positive impact

1202
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:04,839
on your mental health

1203
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:05,839
those things will help you

1204
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:06,480
to experience

1205
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,019
more joy

1206
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,059
and even

1207
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:10,200
I used to say this

1208
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,920
from a place of privilege

1209
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,359
which is

1210
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,319
I was just so happy

1211
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,299
no problems in my life

1212
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:14,480
life was great

1213
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,940
come on guys

1214
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,339
do this stuff

1215
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:15,759
it really helps

1216
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:16,539
I'm now saying it

1217
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:17,140
but

1218
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,180
from a place of

1219
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,220
life's pretty tough

1220
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:19,640
at the moment

1221
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,940
and I know this stuff

1222
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,700
is going to get me through

1223
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,079
even if it doesn't feel

1224
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:23,759
like it is at the time

1225
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:24,180
I've got to keep

1226
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:24,819
dragging myself

1227
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:25,960
to the treadmill

1228
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,900
dragging myself

1229
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,380
to the gym

1230
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:27,940
dragging myself

1231
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,460
to my journal

1232
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,799
dragging myself

1233
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:30,299
to breathwork

1234
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:31,019
whatever it is

1235
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:32,220
and the wheel will turn

1236
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,359
and do you feel

1237
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,839
that consistency

1238
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:36,359
is the key

1239
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,180
and do you

1240
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,099
like a lot of people

1241
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:39,359
when it gets stressful

1242
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,319
it's almost the hardest time

1243
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,200
you say drag yourself

1244
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,599
to the treadmill

1245
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,059
hard to write in your journal

1246
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:43,859
when you're feeling shit

1247
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:45,039
hard to be mindful

1248
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,119
when there's chaos

1249
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:46,660
going on

1250
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,519
on whatever front there is

1251
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:49,240
and do you think

1252
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,180
sometimes we kid ourselves

1253
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:50,599
a little bit

1254
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:50,839
and we go

1255
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:51,859
it's not working

1256
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:52,920
but if we actually write down

1257
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,119
we go

1258
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,559
I may have let that slip

1259
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,200
a little bit

1260
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,180
more than I understood

1261
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,700
is that

1262
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:56,980
yeah

1263
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,119
and it's so hard

1264
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:58,859
when you're not feeling good

1265
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:00,859
it's so much harder

1266
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:01,819
than when you're feeling good

1267
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:03,039
you have a good day

1268
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:03,359
and you think

1269
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:03,740
gosh shit

1270
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,460
things are going pretty well

1271
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:04,900
for me at the moment

1272
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,259
I might write a gratitude journal

1273
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:07,259
that's not hard

1274
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:07,859
it's good for you

1275
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:08,559
it's good to do it

1276
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,180
but when you are really

1277
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,859
up against it

1278
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:11,700
and you've got some stuff

1279
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,200
really going wrong

1280
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,599
in your life

1281
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:13,299
stuff that

1282
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:14,440
you may not be able

1283
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,779
to control

1284
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:15,440
which makes it even

1285
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,519
more challenging at times

1286
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:17,740
that's when it's hard

1287
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,299
to you know

1288
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,079
fuck doing a gratitude journal

1289
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:20,599
I don't have a beer

1290
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,299
you know

1291
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:22,319
that's like

1292
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,420
who's in control

1293
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,839
like who's controlling you

1294
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:25,900
like who is in control

1295
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,160
but it's like just

1296
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,299
if you're looking

1297
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:29,119
at a couple of options

1298
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,059
which is staying up later

1299
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:30,599
having a beer

1300
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,640
or journaling

1301
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,339
and going to bed early

1302
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:32,900
or doing the stuff

1303
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,759
that makes you feel good

1304
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:34,799
if you're taking

1305
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,559
the option

1306
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,119
that you know

1307
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:36,900
you know in that moment

1308
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,700
like I know this isn't

1309
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,519
the right thing to do

1310
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,480
but I'm going to do it anyway

1311
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,759
you just ask yourself

1312
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:41,079
the question

1313
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,500
who's got the control panel here

1314
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,799
like I want to control

1315
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:44,579
myself right now

1316
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:45,980
I think often

1317
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,420
I think

1318
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,400
I do so many analogies

1319
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:47,799
around running

1320
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:49,559
but as a runner

1321
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:50,400
you'll have those days

1322
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:50,799
where you get up

1323
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,099
and you're like

1324
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:52,240
I'm not feeling it today

1325
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,500
but you do it anyway

1326
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,200
and it doesn't

1327
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,779
it's not as quick

1328
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:55,480
as you usually go

1329
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,380
but you've got the miles

1330
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:56,920
in your legs

1331
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,259
and you go

1332
00:24:57,259 --> 00:24:57,880
well I've done that

1333
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,640
it wasn't my best

1334
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,960
but I dragged myself there

1335
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,180
I've sort of got that approach

1336
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,000
to everything right now

1337
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,319
literally if it's running

1338
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,740
like I don't feel like it

1339
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,380
but I know it's going to

1340
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,000
make me feel good

1341
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,640
or journaling

1342
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,380
I know it's not going to

1343
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,000
yeah

1344
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,019
I just from all the work

1345
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:09,299
I've done

1346
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:09,720
it's like

1347
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,019
it does feel like

1348
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:11,900
you're dragging yourself

1349
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,779
to these things sometimes

1350
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:13,740
but you've got to keep doing it

1351
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,599
there's so many dimensions

1352
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:15,660
I've got to come back to you

1353
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,339
and the freak running thing

1354
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:18,839
that you've attempted

1355
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:19,819
in recent times

1356
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:21,259
but I think probably

1357
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:22,440
the pattern from

1358
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,859
this might be 148 people

1359
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:25,799
I've sat in front of

1360
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,240
the thing that's most

1361
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,039
those that understand

1362
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,039
their version

1363
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:31,079
of what you just said

1364
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,640
of their exercise

1365
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,259
of whatever meditation

1366
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:34,839
or mindfulness

1367
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,700
whatever way

1368
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,980
they come to gratitude

1369
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,339
or their consistency

1370
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:40,200
of their daily habits

1371
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,240
the ones that articulate that

1372
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,740
and are pretty

1373
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,720
seems to be

1374
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:43,740
the ones that are

1375
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,480
the ones that have

1376
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,380
the smoothest sailing

1377
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:45,880
and I think

1378
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,099
that would be the pattern

1379
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:48,759
that has been most evident

1380
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:49,700
over the time

1381
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,759
of sitting across from people

1382
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,000
and I'm not surprised

1383
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,880
that's where you went

1384
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,519
in your answer as well

1385
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,299
yeah

1386
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:56,000
it's

1387
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,720
because I'm not

1388
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,160
I have to

1389
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,339
I'm not always great at it

1390
00:25:59,339 --> 00:25:59,900
like I'm not

1391
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,740
but I do know

1392
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,220
I mean exercise

1393
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,099
is the main thing

1394
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:03,599
for me right now

1395
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:04,119
so I just

1396
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,480
I'll schedule that out

1397
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,319
from you know

1398
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:07,140
I have a running coach

1399
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,279
who's got me a month long program

1400
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,420
and I just don't

1401
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,619
you've got to tell us now

1402
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:12,059
you went for a

1403
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:13,500
world record

1404
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,079
it was a national record

1405
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:15,980
but if we

1406
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,900
tell me who the team is

1407
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,900
can you go through the

1408
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,819
so

1409
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:20,720
I played cricket

1410
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,339
until I was 35

1411
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:22,099
36 years old

1412
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:23,200
and our home ground

1413
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,960
Melbourne University

1414
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,119
next to the Oval

1415
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:25,880
was an athletics track

1416
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,880
and I

1417
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,200
enjoyed athletics

1418
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,099
more than cricket at school

1419
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:30,119
athletics is just the best

1420
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:30,480
I was never

1421
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,599
I did okay at it

1422
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:31,920
but I

1423
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,119
every Saturday

1424
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:34,220
I'd stand there

1425
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:34,839
out in the field

1426
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:35,900
and I'd always

1427
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,819
the older I get

1428
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:37,519
the worse I'd play

1429
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:38,380
and I'd be standing there going

1430
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,099
I want to do that

1431
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:39,880
I want to do athletics

1432
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,240
but I'm getting older and older

1433
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,140
so it's disappearing

1434
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,640
and then

1435
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,940
when I was 36 or 37

1436
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,319
I went

1437
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,339
I'd retire from cricket

1438
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:46,619
and I went

1439
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:47,839
no I am going to do that

1440
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,220
I'm going to run 400 metres

1441
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,039
that's going to be my event

1442
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,119
was that your event as a kid?

1443
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,240
no ones and twos were

1444
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:52,759
but I thought

1445
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:54,299
my hamstrings don't stand a chance

1446
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:55,380
and I don't want to do

1447
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,819
middle distance

1448
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:56,400
that looks awful

1449
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,539
so 400's like

1450
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:58,220
kind of the event

1451
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,160
that I'll choose

1452
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,180
it's full of pain in itself

1453
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,000
it's disgusting

1454
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,500
it is

1455
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,039
it is awful

1456
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:03,740
like it's just

1457
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,440
any track author

1458
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:04,900
will say

1459
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,579
that's the event

1460
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:07,920
that destroys you the most

1461
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,519
anyway

1462
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:09,480
I chose that event

1463
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:09,880
for some reason

1464
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,859
and trained for three years

1465
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:12,420
and compared for three years

1466
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,079
didn't tell a soul

1467
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,059
didn't put it on social media

1468
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:14,500
I just

1469
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,900
and started sharing

1470
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,740
little bits of it

1471
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,700
because it was making me feel really good

1472
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,660
the fact that I was getting better

1473
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,720
at something in my 40s

1474
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,480
it made me feel good

1475
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,000
I feel like

1476
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,740
a lot of what you do physically

1477
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,480
is in decline

1478
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,759
and that can be quite

1479
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:26,480
and 400's all power

1480
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,019
and all speed

1481
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:28,380
you're not supposed to get better at that

1482
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:28,740
no

1483
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,180
because I come from such a low base

1484
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,240
it wasn't hard

1485
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,400
but

1486
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,339
and so

1487
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:33,759
I started sharing a little bit of it

1488
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:34,660
and Steve Hooker

1489
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,000
who

1490
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,859
the Australian

1491
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:37,000
legendary

1492
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,259
pole vault gold medalist

1493
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:38,779
superstar

1494
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:39,279
yeah

1495
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,640
had the great pleasure

1496
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,200
to record a podcast with Steve

1497
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:42,400
oh

1498
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,440
he's just a beauty

1499
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,079
um

1500
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,720
he

1501
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,740
we went to primary school together

1502
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,579
I was a couple years above him

1503
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:47,279
at primary school

1504
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,119
and so we knew each other

1505
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,559
but hadn't chatted since primary school

1506
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,339
and he got in touch

1507
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:51,740
and just

1508
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,759
and we bumped into each other

1509
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:53,359
at um

1510
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,099
at Zadapek

1511
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:55,200
which is a huge meet in Melbourne

1512
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,599
no

1513
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,519
the Moray Plant Classic

1514
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:57,119
that's what it was

1515
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,539
and he said

1516
00:27:58,539 --> 00:27:59,500
I've just been watching you running

1517
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,559
I found it quite inspiring

1518
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,039
and I thought he was taking the piss out of me

1519
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:02,779
because he's like

1520
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:03,380
Steve Hooker

1521
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,160
and my running

1522
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,539
you would never describe it as inspiring

1523
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:06,799
if you saw it happening in the flesh

1524
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,180
and he said

1525
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,299
I have for a while

1526
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:10,200
been thinking about something

1527
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,900
and he said

1528
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,119
I'll introduce you to someone first

1529
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,119
he gets this guy out of the stands

1530
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:13,380
he said

1531
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,079
this is Brendan Cole

1532
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:14,980
Brendan's a gold medalist

1533
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,740
at the Commonwealth Games

1534
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,019
for 4x4

1535
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:18,740
and there's a really good mate

1536
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,079
Simon

1537
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,599
who's a dad from school

1538
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,859
who's a beautiful runner

1539
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:22,319
and he said

1540
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:22,660
what do you reckon

1541
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,140
the four of us

1542
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,099
trying to break the national

1543
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:25,720
4x400

1544
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,059
yeah

1545
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:27,039
hadn't even finished explaining it

1546
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:27,359
I said I mean

1547
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,259
that sounds unbelievable

1548
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:29,579
opportunity to run with you guys

1549
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:30,880
and so

1550
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,519
this friendship group started out

1551
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,079
and no one really knew each other

1552
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:34,740
well Stephen

1553
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,599
sorry Stephen

1554
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,339
Brendan

1555
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,099
had been in

1556
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:37,799
Commonwealth Games

1557
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,099
Olympic Games teams together before

1558
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:39,319
but

1559
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:41,079
and there's four blokes in their 40s

1560
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:41,799
and we went

1561
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:42,519
we picked an event

1562
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:43,299
that was a year out

1563
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:43,619
and we said

1564
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:44,079
we're going to try and break

1565
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:44,880
the national record

1566
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,859
we're going to

1567
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:46,680
all four of us have to run

1568
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,279
really fast

1569
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,039
what sort of times

1570
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,039
for 400s it was

1571
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:50,700
we all worked out

1572
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,420
we'd have to run

1573
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,259
51.8

1574
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:54,059
we'd all have to do

1575
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:54,940
a 51.8

1576
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,559
to do that

1577
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:56,480
and

1578
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,940
which is a serious 400

1579
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,940
at any time

1580
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,319
at any

1581
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,160
well it was going to be

1582
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,799
a PB for me

1583
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,720
a PB for Simon

1584
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,680
I mean Stephen

1585
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,799
Brendan had run much quicker

1586
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:04,440
than that in their heyday

1587
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:04,819
obviously

1588
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:06,220
but hadn't run in a long time

1589
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,599
and we had a year

1590
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,259
of training together

1591
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:08,779
and

1592
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:09,799
I was like

1593
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:10,799
the biggest learning

1594
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:11,579
I had for that year

1595
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:11,779
and probably

1596
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:12,599
for a long time

1597
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:13,660
is

1598
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,460
the joy you get

1599
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,460
from choosing an event

1600
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:16,960
that is going to be

1601
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,640
really challenging

1602
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,440
with a group of people

1603
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,339
like minded people

1604
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:22,079
and training together

1605
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:22,660
for that

1606
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,380
and when you

1607
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,380
when I say training together

1608
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,059
we would be

1609
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:26,839
I'd be on the

1610
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,099
watt bike

1611
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,240
at 5.30 in the morning

1612
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:29,940
in the garage

1613
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,759
in the middle of July

1614
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:31,359
last year

1615
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:31,839
in Melbourne

1616
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:32,960
sending a video

1617
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,700
to the other boys

1618
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,539
who were also doing

1619
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:35,140
the same thing

1620
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,640
so we weren't

1621
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,299
physically together

1622
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:37,579
but it was very

1623
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:38,380
you'd get out of bed

1624
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:38,779
because you knew

1625
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:39,440
they were going to do it

1626
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,619
and we had this goal together

1627
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:41,299
it doesn't have to be

1628
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:41,759
breaking the national

1629
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:41,980
record

1630
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,779
it could be a long walk

1631
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:43,099
with friends

1632
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:43,599
whatever it is

1633
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:45,960
and the day came along

1634
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,720
and

1635
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,640
we

1636
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,700
it was really cold

1637
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,480
which for people who know

1638
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,380
truck it's disastrous

1639
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,019
it was really cold

1640
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:51,440
very windy

1641
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,380
it was summer

1642
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,019
but it was 14

1643
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:53,940
coldest day of summer

1644
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,119
wet, windy

1645
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,599
and we missed out

1646
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,720
by 0.8 of a second

1647
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,539
and turns out

1648
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:00,299
Simon had COVID

1649
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,099
he tested positive

1650
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:01,920
for COVID that night

1651
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,559
and we had all the stuff

1652
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,099
go against us

1653
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:03,299
but

1654
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,480
I didn't really even care

1655
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,259
like I remember

1656
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:07,000
crossing the line

1657
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,400
and there was

1658
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,480
there's 5,000 people

1659
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:08,619
there

1660
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:09,019
Zadapek

1661
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:09,819
massive event

1662
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:11,359
Bruce McEvaney's

1663
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:11,980
calling the race

1664
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,480
and I hear Bruce McEvaney

1665
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,200
because I was

1666
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,940
for some reason

1667
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,779
I made my run last

1668
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:17,799
and I heard Bruce McEvaney

1669
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:18,099
go

1670
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:18,859
I could hear him

1671
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:19,160
in the home truck

1672
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,319
going someone stop the clocks

1673
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:20,680
and he goes

1674
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,680
they've just missed out

1675
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,960
and I heard this audible

1676
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,200
like groan from the crowd

1677
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,400
because they were so invested

1678
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,940
they were so into it

1679
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,140
these four old blokes

1680
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,160
trying to run really fast

1681
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,519
I instantly didn't care

1682
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:31,759
I was like

1683
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:32,660
it wasn't about

1684
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,720
it'd be nice

1685
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,259
but honestly

1686
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:34,920
it wasn't about that

1687
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,480
like it was

1688
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,079
the connection I got

1689
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:38,559
the healthy habits

1690
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,180
that came from it

1691
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,079
like I just had to eat

1692
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:40,880
really wanted to

1693
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,900
to prioritise sleep

1694
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,200
I had to stretch

1695
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,599
I had to

1696
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:44,440
instead of eating

1697
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,140
Marvelous Creations

1698
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,779
chocolate on the couch

1699
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:48,940
and having

1700
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,980
just drinking whatever

1701
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,980
watching television

1702
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,579
I'd be like

1703
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:52,420
drinking water

1704
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,099
and I'd be stretching

1705
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:53,839
and I'd feel good

1706
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:54,380
when I went to bed

1707
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:54,720
it was the

1708
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,200
it was the highlight

1709
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,720
of last year

1710
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,000
sorry

1711
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
did I have a child last year

1712
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,660
no it was the highlight

1713
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,480
it was the highlight

1714
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:58,980
of last year

1715
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,460
I mean and you don't

1716
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,380
want to let your mates down

1717
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,700
that's the beauty isn't it

1718
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,259
when you're running

1719
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:04,339
in something like that

1720
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:06,359
the will to want to

1721
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,240
you know make sure

1722
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,019
you hold up your end

1723
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:08,480
of the bargain

1724
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,519
must have been overwhelming

1725
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,420
yeah and that is

1726
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:10,859
something that

1727
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:11,960
no matter what level

1728
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,500
you play at

1729
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,400
if you have played sport

1730
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,559
which a lot of your guests have

1731
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,119
the transition out of that

1732
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:16,900
is you know

1733
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,960
I played club cricket

1734
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,519
for way too long

1735
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,539
for 25 years

1736
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:21,759
I didn't miss a game

1737
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:22,259
I didn't miss a

1738
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:22,920
I was always there

1739
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,240
if we injured

1740
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,660
the club was everything

1741
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,079
in my life

1742
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:25,900
and then to walk away

1743
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,339
from that

1744
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:27,380
it's I mean you would

1745
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,339
know that better than anyone

1746
00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:29,619
but like it's a serious

1747
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:30,480
adjustment for anyone

1748
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:30,920
to make no matter

1749
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,720
what level you play at

1750
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,400
especially elite

1751
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,880
but I found that again

1752
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,720
like I found this like

1753
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,480
oh I'm in a team

1754
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,140
like I'm in a team

1755
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,160
and we're there

1756
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,640
for each other

1757
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,000
and it was amazing

1758
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,240
that little bit of competitive

1759
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,839
and that

1760
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:41,500
little bit of

1761
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,799
sense of purpose

1762
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,059
it's genius

1763
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:45,160
the Imperfects

1764
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,059
is a phenomenon

1765
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:48,740
that you've created

1766
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,019
as you said

1767
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:49,880
younger brother Josh

1768
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,700
and Ryan Sheldon

1769
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,660
and Bridget's

1770
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,599
remarkable producer

1771
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:54,640
what's the takeaway

1772
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,200
from that

1773
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,319
sitting in those

1774
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:56,880
conversations

1775
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,059
is there a common thread

1776
00:31:58,059 --> 00:31:59,720
that has been something

1777
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,660
you've adapted

1778
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,319
into your life

1779
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,519
yeah so I

1780
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:03,559
I reckon the genesis

1781
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:04,279
of the podcast

1782
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,279
has been my biggest learning

1783
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,759
so I

1784
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,039
like a lot of people

1785
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:08,720
growing up in Australia

1786
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,259
just

1787
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:10,559
have so

1788
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:11,940
much admiration

1789
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,839
and respect

1790
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,480
and so in awe

1791
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,900
of the Hamish and Andy

1792
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,220
prop brand

1793
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,380
or just them as people

1794
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,000
and their shows

1795
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,740
and everything they've ever done

1796
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,099
because

1797
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:21,299
as someone who has worked

1798
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:22,559
very hard to teach people

1799
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,579
resilience

1800
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:25,079
or to make them smile

1801
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,059
I don't think anyone

1802
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:26,960
has brought more joy

1803
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,119
to people in this country

1804
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:28,900
over the last 20 years

1805
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,539
than Hamish and Andy

1806
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:31,160
and great friends of yours

1807
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,519
and

1808
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,960
sorry to jump in

1809
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,119
but what I love

1810
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:34,660
is that

1811
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,859
they've done it

1812
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:36,660
and they've never done

1813
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,460
anything nasty

1814
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,200
to anyone ever

1815
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,019
not once

1816
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:40,400
and other people

1817
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,140
with the tall poppy syndrome

1818
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:42,880
went after them

1819
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,779
and they do everything

1820
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:44,400
with a smile

1821
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:44,920
and a grace

1822
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,980
and if you bump into them

1823
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,819
as good a people as they are on air

1824
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:49,000
they're as good a people off the air

1825
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,680
as both of them

1826
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,819
I should speak to them individually

1827
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:51,240
but

1828
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,059
yeah

1829
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:53,559
and they were the motivation

1830
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:54,299
for you doing that

1831
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:54,579
is it

1832
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:55,720
no well I was going to say

1833
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,619
I mean Andy by the way

1834
00:32:56,619 --> 00:32:57,660
Andy's the reason I was in Alida

1835
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,559
Andy I remember Andy

1836
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,359
at Hamish's party

1837
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,220
saying I've got this

1838
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,140
we just met

1839
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:01,819
it was the first time we met

1840
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:02,759
and two minutes in he said

1841
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:03,420
I've got this course

1842
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:03,980
you've got to do

1843
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,960
I was like

1844
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,599
that's a bold suggestion

1845
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:06,920
to him

1846
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,579
you'll love it

1847
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:09,259
and he was so right

1848
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:09,460
but

1849
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,299
so

1850
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:11,980
I've just loved

1851
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,799
everything about

1852
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,160
I mean so in awe

1853
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,839
of what they do

1854
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,180
and I used to think

1855
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,299
quite deeply about

1856
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:18,359
how is it that they do

1857
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,319
this thing that like

1858
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:21,140
how can you be that famous

1859
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:21,619
and not

1860
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:23,140
no one speaks ill of them

1861
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,720
no one's

1862
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,240
there's no

1863
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,619
you never have a feeling

1864
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:26,019
of like

1865
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:27,279
there's no tall poppy syndrome

1866
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,359
I mean if it is

1867
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,279
it's just they deal with it

1868
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:29,720
so beautifully

1869
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,019
so I've always been in awe

1870
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:31,839
of what they've created

1871
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:32,200
and

1872
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,480
one of my favourite

1873
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,299
people in all that

1874
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:35,279
has always been Ryan Shelton

1875
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,579
I love the roles that Ryan

1876
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:37,859
plays throughout their journey

1877
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:39,480
Hamish's best friend from school

1878
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,279
and I

1879
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,099
I saw him sitting

1880
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:41,859
in a cafe

1881
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:42,779
in Fitzroy

1882
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:44,279
back in 2014

1883
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,059
I think it was

1884
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:46,839
and I got so nervous

1885
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:47,819
because I knew

1886
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:48,599
I was going to tell him something

1887
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:49,740
and what I wanted to tell him was

1888
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,240
and you hadn't met him

1889
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,160
never met him before

1890
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,900
no never met Hamish

1891
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,480
I had seen him around

1892
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:53,859
and just

1893
00:33:53,859 --> 00:33:54,960
and I saw Ryan

1894
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,680
I'd seen Hamish

1895
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,059
but I never

1896
00:33:56,059 --> 00:33:57,119
was never brave enough

1897
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:57,740
to go and speak to him

1898
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,839
I didn't want to annoy him

1899
00:33:58,839 --> 00:33:59,259
you know

1900
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:00,660
and I saw Ryan

1901
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,319
and one of the things

1902
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:01,920
that used to happen to me

1903
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,220
was back in the early

1904
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,480
2011-2014

1905
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:05,980
I would go to

1906
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,880
four or five schools a day

1907
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,260
and inevitably

1908
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,420
invariably I should say

1909
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,139
by the fourth or fifth

1910
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:10,360
school

1911
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,019
I didn't want to do it

1912
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:11,519
I was exhausted

1913
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:12,659
and I felt flat

1914
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,119
from no energy

1915
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:14,860
and one of the things

1916
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,219
I'd do

1917
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,199
sitting in the car park

1918
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,199
of a school

1919
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:17,820
around Australia

1920
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,699
I'd get my phone out

1921
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:19,280
I'd go on Instagram

1922
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,139
and I'd type in

1923
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:21,019
Ryan Shelton's name

1924
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:22,380
and I'd watch his videos

1925
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,420
and they would make me

1926
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,619
laugh so much

1927
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:26,059
and they would change my mood

1928
00:34:26,059 --> 00:34:26,539
and then I'd go in

1929
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:27,119
and do these talks

1930
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:27,760
feeling great

1931
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,780
and I just wanted to

1932
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,400
tell him that

1933
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,360
I wanted to say

1934
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,179
hey you have had

1935
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:32,139
a massive impact on me

1936
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:32,800
and I just want to say

1937
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,239
thank you

1938
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,539
I got so nervous

1939
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:35,199
I went to the cafe

1940
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:35,800
and I

1941
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,820
it was the most

1942
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,519
uncool thing I've ever done

1943
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,320
but I sat down next to him

1944
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,840
and pretended I hadn't seen him

1945
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,599
and went oh Ryan Shelton

1946
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:41,840
and I told him that

1947
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,280
and I said

1948
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,119
I just want you to know

1949
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:43,920
and he was so

1950
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,219
beautiful with that

1951
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,519
Brené Brown talks about

1952
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:47,260
she says vulnerability

1953
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,960
is taking an emotional risk

1954
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,980
when the outcome is uncertain

1955
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,000
the outcome

1956
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,400
you know they say

1957
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,059
never meet your heroes

1958
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:52,539
and the outcome

1959
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:53,460
is so uncertain for me

1960
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,119
because he was writing

1961
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:54,659
he was working

1962
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,900
so I had to stop him

1963
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,300
with doing what he said

1964
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,579
and he turned around

1965
00:34:58,579 --> 00:34:59,699
he was so lovely

1966
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:00,619
and he was chatting

1967
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:00,920
he was like

1968
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,300
what do you do

1969
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:01,940
tell me what you do

1970
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,739
and I said no no

1971
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:03,760
that's not why I came here

1972
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,360
I just wanted to say

1973
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,179
no I'm interested

1974
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:05,940
so I told him

1975
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,000
and I said

1976
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,300
do you mind

1977
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:08,820
if I take a photo

1978
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,679
for my wife

1979
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:10,619
it was for me

1980
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:11,059
I don't know why

1981
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:11,840
I said my wife

1982
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,940
I get that now

1983
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,440
guys going

1984
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:14,739
get out mate

1985
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:15,619
just a photo for the missus

1986
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:17,059
you can say it's for you

1987
00:35:17,059 --> 00:35:17,699
anyway

1988
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:18,900
and we got this photo together

1989
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,860
and I put it on Instagram

1990
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,380
and tagged him

1991
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,460
hoping we'd become friends

1992
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,039
and it worked

1993
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,119
but we were sort of

1994
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:24,719
in touch a little bit

1995
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,599
and didn't hear a thing

1996
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,099
for two years

1997
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:27,300
two years later

1998
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:27,780
out of nowhere

1999
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,619
I get a message from

2000
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:29,860
I don't know three years

2001
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,599
from Ryan saying

2002
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:31,480
hi mate

2003
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,360
not sure if you remember me

2004
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,039
but I was just wondering

2005
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:33,699
if you wanted to catch up

2006
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,199
and he'd had this

2007
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,860
existential crisis

2008
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,820
when he was away

2009
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:37,980
with his

2010
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,119
with his

2011
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:38,139
with his

2012
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:38,280
with his

2013
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:38,300
with his

2014
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:38,440
partner

2015
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,599
he'd realised

2016
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,079
that he said

2017
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,099
if I realised

2018
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,239
if I got the TV show

2019
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:43,760
I just want to have

2020
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,559
my own TV show

2021
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,420
and have it be voted

2022
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,139
the best TV show

2023
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:46,559
in the world

2024
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:47,639
even if I got that

2025
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:48,280
I wouldn't be happy

2026
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,519
I wouldn't

2027
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:50,320
that wouldn't make me happy

2028
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,440
and I'm feeling very lost

2029
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,460
and we talked

2030
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,760
for hours

2031
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,360
and we caught up

2032
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,280
a couple times a week

2033
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,139
and he just shared

2034
00:35:56,139 --> 00:35:57,059
his story with me

2035
00:35:57,059 --> 00:35:58,320
I didn't say much

2036
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,960
I'm not a counsellor

2037
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,440
I'm not a therapist

2038
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,300
I just listened to him

2039
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,000
and quite a bit

2040
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,659
quite emotional

2041
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,519
about the relationship

2042
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:03,039
with Hamish

2043
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:04,179
and how it's become

2044
00:36:04,179 --> 00:36:04,760
Hamish and Andy

2045
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,380
it's you know

2046
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:05,960
he was always

2047
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,719
growing up

2048
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,139
it was him and Hamish

2049
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:09,119
and that was difficult

2050
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,699
and I was listening

2051
00:36:10,699 --> 00:36:11,480
one of the stories

2052
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:11,900
he told me

2053
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,219
I can't remember

2054
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:12,619
which one it was

2055
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:13,460
but he was so emotional

2056
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,019
and there was a couple

2057
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:15,780
sitting near us

2058
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,420
and I remember

2059
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,059
leaving the cafe

2060
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:17,519
thinking

2061
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:18,440
we were new friends

2062
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:18,960
at this point

2063
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,940
and I was thinking

2064
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,300
God for anyone

2065
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,460
eavesdropping that conversation

2066
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:22,940
that would have been

2067
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,760
the best conversation

2068
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,159
to hear

2069
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:25,519
because I've always

2070
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,280
looked at Ryan

2071
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:26,519
and thought

2072
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,460
if you were Ryan Shelton

2073
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,800
like

2074
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,639
you're best mates

2075
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:30,099
with Hamish and Andy

2076
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:31,079
you're creating TV shows

2077
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:31,820
and you travel the world

2078
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,079
with them

2079
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,159
life is amazing

2080
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:34,159
and he was basically

2081
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:34,579
saying to me

2082
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:35,119
no it's not

2083
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,440
like my life is not amazing

2084
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,059
and here's why

2085
00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:37,820
and I remember thinking

2086
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,500
everyone needs to hear this

2087
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,039
because I'm feeling

2088
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:41,480
so much better

2089
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,239
just knowing that

2090
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,300
his life isn't perfect

2091
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,000
and I can't think of anyone

2092
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,539
I'd rather be

2093
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:46,239
than Ryan Shelton

2094
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:46,739
and so

2095
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:47,619
I asked him

2096
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:49,139
that night I messaged him

2097
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:49,840
11.30 and said

2098
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,139
I've had no idea

2099
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:51,679
for a podcast

2100
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:52,659
would you be interested

2101
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:53,559
and the next day

2102
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:53,900
we caught up

2103
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,420
I told him

2104
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,320
and he said

2105
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,599
happy to help produce it

2106
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:57,360
but I don't need to be on it

2107
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,079
I'm not going to be on that

2108
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:58,880
and I said how come

2109
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,079
he said I'm not qualified

2110
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:00,579
and I said no no

2111
00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:01,099
I think it would be

2112
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:02,059
really great to have you there

2113
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:03,679
because the humour

2114
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,940
really makes it so accessible

2115
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,800
and he said no

2116
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,380
I wouldn't be comfortable

2117
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,800
and it took

2118
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,039
a year to convince him

2119
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:10,420
it was a year of him saying

2120
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,079
no I'm not doing that

2121
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:11,800
he said I'll help

2122
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
because I'd love the idea of it

2123
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,219
but I'm not going to be

2124
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:13,739
a part of it

2125
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:15,039
and I think his partner

2126
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:16,260
Jam convinced him as well

2127
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,360
but then when

2128
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,179
the podcast started

2129
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:19,099
I'd already had

2130
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:19,960
almost my biggest learning

2131
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,440
of like

2132
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,960
hearing that

2133
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,599
we all look at people

2134
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,460
lives

2135
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,440
I mean people look at you

2136
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:25,760
and just go

2137
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,440
well my god

2138
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,099
imagine you look dusty

2139
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:28,059
imagine that

2140
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:29,699
that's life sorted

2141
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:30,460
but you know

2142
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:30,880
when you should

2143
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,659
come home and

2144
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:34,340
see the chaos

2145
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,099
see me getting yelled at

2146
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:37,719
as I should

2147
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:37,780
do

2148
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,820
from time to time

2149
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,380
but you're right

2150
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:39,760
isn't it

2151
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
it's yeah

2152
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,760
we're all peddling

2153
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,920
super hard aren't we

2154
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,659
yeah and we've

2155
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:44,420
sort of touched on this already

2156
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,039
but it's like

2157
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:46,739
I realise after doing

2158
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:47,219
a year and a half

2159
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:47,619
of the podcast

2160
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:49,099
I had never really been

2161
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:49,980
overly vulnerable

2162
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,079
with how I was

2163
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:51,840
going in my life

2164
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,980
I'd facilitated

2165
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,179
conversations with other people

2166
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:54,820
and Ryan had done

2167
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,579
a beautiful episode

2168
00:37:55,579 --> 00:37:56,139
on his friendship

2169
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:56,539
with Hamish

2170
00:37:56,539 --> 00:37:57,760
and then I did an episode

2171
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,340
on how I really

2172
00:37:59,340 --> 00:37:59,840
wasn't coping

2173
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,360
during COVID

2174
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,119
which looking back

2175
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,179
isn't overly revolutionary

2176
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:02,800
a lot of people

2177
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,340
weren't coping

2178
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,380
but I was quite early

2179
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:04,920
to say

2180
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,320
I'm really struggling

2181
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:06,760
in fact I remember

2182
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,239
doing an interview

2183
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:07,599
with you

2184
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,739
and Ed about this

2185
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:09,579
but I said

2186
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:10,420
I'm really struggling

2187
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,679
and I was at

2188
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:12,440
Baker's Delight

2189
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:12,940
that afternoon

2190
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,400
and a lady

2191
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,099
drove past

2192
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:14,500
very slowly

2193
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,380
in her Volvo

2194
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,260
XC40

2195
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:16,880
and ran down the window

2196
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,500
and she said

2197
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,219
I needed to hear

2198
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:18,820
that so desperately

2199
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,219
from you

2200
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:19,619
and she said

2201
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:20,280
I like you now

2202
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,159
I wasn't sure

2203
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:21,880
but I like you now

2204
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,440
and whilst it was

2205
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,179
a very sort of

2206
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:24,760
bold thing

2207
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,440
to just announce

2208
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,599
I don't know

2209
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:26,940
what I'd done

2210
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,380
previously

2211
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,059
to upset you

2212
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:29,179
but I think

2213
00:38:29,179 --> 00:38:29,659
what she was saying

2214
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:30,079
was like

2215
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:30,940
you've been very honest

2216
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,420
with your life

2217
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,440
and that makes you

2218
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:32,920
more relatable

2219
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,440
and I reckon

2220
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:34,739
that's probably

2221
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:35,360
my biggest learning

2222
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,800
yeah and you mentioned

2223
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,539
asking this question

2224
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:39,559
around vulnerability

2225
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:41,139
becoming this buzzword

2226
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:41,519
almost

2227
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,280
and you referenced

2228
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:42,840
Brené Brown

2229
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,079
who's been the person

2230
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:44,860
who's put that on the map

2231
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,519
more than anyone

2232
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:46,340
and then I think

2233
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,079
even she says

2234
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:47,639
like the needles

2235
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:48,460
move too much

2236
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:48,940
like yes

2237
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,179
authentic

2238
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:51,820
is first and foremost

2239
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,539
and that people

2240
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,440
are oversharing

2241
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,239
perhaps getting it wrong

2242
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,320
in this sort of stretch

2243
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
to try and be something

2244
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:57,880
they're not

2245
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,460
is that something

2246
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,519
that you think

2247
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:00,000
everyone needs

2248
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
to understand as well

2249
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,960
absolutely

2250
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,280
and that's where

2251
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,400
this stuff

2252
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,320
is so beautifully

2253
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:06,699
like

2254
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:07,300
psychologists

2255
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:07,980
and therapists

2256
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,480
have trained

2257
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,380
their entire

2258
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,019
background training

2259
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:10,380
is around

2260
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,260
how you facilitate

2261
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,320
safe

2262
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,980
and appropriate

2263
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,039
sharing

2264
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:15,519
and often

2265
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:15,960
that's just

2266
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,159
with a professional

2267
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,699
and I think

2268
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:20,119
it's become trendy

2269
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:20,579
to

2270
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:22,159
especially in sporting clubs

2271
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:22,460
for a while

2272
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,280
to okay

2273
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,119
tell us everything

2274
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:25,619
and then we're closer

2275
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:26,880
and then

2276
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,659
but there's no such thing

2277
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:28,239
as forced vulnerability

2278
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:28,800
so it doesn't

2279
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,599
it doesn't work

2280
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,719
and I actually look back

2281
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:31,179
at my time

2282
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:31,780
at Port Adelaide

2283
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,119
and realise

2284
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,099
I probably made that mistake

2285
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:33,860
with Port Adelaide

2286
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,539
where I'd been with the club

2287
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,119
for a year and a half

2288
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:36,579
at a wonderful

2289
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:37,659
relationship with them

2290
00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:38,099
and we went away

2291
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:38,960
on a pre-season camp

2292
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,960
and probably the most

2293
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,300
powerful two hours

2294
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,280
of my professional career

2295
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:42,920
in a room with

2296
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,639
these guys who

2297
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:45,900
who love each other dearly

2298
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,519
and the coaches

2299
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:47,079
and everyone was

2300
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:47,880
very close

2301
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,599
and it was away on camp

2302
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:49,980
and it was just

2303
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,920
these beautiful stories

2304
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,360
that felt really right

2305
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:52,960
and they felt

2306
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,760
it was genuine

2307
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,119
it was authentic

2308
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:54,980
nothing was forced

2309
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,719
and it was just

2310
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:57,719
it was really beautiful

2311
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:58,719
and having spoken

2312
00:39:58,719 --> 00:39:59,280
to a lot of the players

2313
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,039
since they still talk

2314
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:00,679
about how it was

2315
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:01,300
you know Charlie Dixon

2316
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,000
said it was the moment

2317
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,699
he started to

2318
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:04,460
to actually recover

2319
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,420
and work with his depression

2320
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,380
in a healthy way

2321
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:07,780
that was the moment

2322
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,219
that sharing

2323
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:09,119
and we came back

2324
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,260
to Port Adelaide

2325
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:10,800
weeks later

2326
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,320
and some players

2327
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,380
hadn't had the chance

2328
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:12,719
to share

2329
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:13,179
and we wanted to

2330
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:13,980
give them the chance

2331
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,659
but sitting in the club

2332
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:17,500
rooms with a few staff

2333
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,099
popping in

2334
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:18,739
and it just

2335
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:19,460
and I was saying

2336
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:19,880
come on guys

2337
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,400
we've got to

2338
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,400
get through these stories

2339
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,099
and no one was

2340
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:23,659
no one wanted to do it

2341
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:24,440
and I didn't say

2342
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,559
come on someone do it

2343
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:26,219
but it was just like

2344
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:27,300
it was just silence

2345
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,059
and I said we can wait

2346
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:28,519
that's fine

2347
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:29,800
a couple of players

2348
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,480
I think just did it

2349
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:30,800
because they didn't want

2350
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,179
the silence

2351
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,119
but it wasn't the right reason

2352
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:32,880
and it felt a bit

2353
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,539
I remember that moment

2354
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:33,840
thinking

2355
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,739
I remember the psychologist

2356
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:35,059
was there

2357
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:35,420
and I was like

2358
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,460
God why wasn't she

2359
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,139
at the first session

2360
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:39,360
I told her what I was

2361
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:39,639
going to do

2362
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:39,960
and she's like

2363
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,360
yeah okay

2364
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,559
just you know

2365
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:42,119
but she came to the

2366
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:42,739
second one unfortunately

2367
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:44,599
but it can be

2368
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:45,099
when it's forced

2369
00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:45,699
it doesn't count

2370
00:40:45,699 --> 00:40:46,519
and the person needs

2371
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:47,820
to feel really safe

2372
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,599
and it needs to

2373
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:49,480
I think it's a really

2374
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,320
vulnerable thing to do

2375
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,039
to just write down

2376
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:52,659
the stuff that you're

2377
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:52,940
going through

2378
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,599
write down something

2379
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:54,139
that's in your head

2380
00:40:54,139 --> 00:40:55,659
with the thought

2381
00:40:55,659 --> 00:40:57,219
with the distinct possibility

2382
00:40:57,219 --> 00:40:58,019
that you might share

2383
00:40:58,019 --> 00:40:58,519
it with someone

2384
00:40:58,519 --> 00:40:59,099
one day

2385
00:40:59,099 --> 00:40:59,639
you don't have to

2386
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:00,340
just write it

2387
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:00,860
and see how it feels

2388
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,360
for next month

2389
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,039
how does that feel

2390
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,679
might be an issue

2391
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:04,199
with someone

2392
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:05,099
or something

2393
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:05,840
from your childhood

2394
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,380
with someone else

2395
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,000
and you write a letter

2396
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,539
to that person

2397
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:08,280
you don't have to

2398
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,079
necessarily give it to them

2399
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:09,739
but you might feel

2400
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:10,320
like it eventually

2401
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,739
that kind of stuff

2402
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:12,980
a lot of it I think

2403
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,400
is getting it

2404
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,019
out of your head

2405
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:15,380
like just getting

2406
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,460
this shit out of your head

2407
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,760
and putting it somewhere

2408
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,659
so you can have

2409
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:19,639
a bit of space from it

2410
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:21,400
otherwise it just

2411
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,380
it can eat you up

2412
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,460
the things that you're

2413
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:23,920
ashamed of

2414
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,360
the things you're

2415
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:24,920
struggling with

2416
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,119
get it out of your head

2417
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:28,699
and I think it's gone

2418
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:29,340
I absolutely think

2419
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:29,900
it's gone too far

2420
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,599
I hear some things

2421
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:31,519
that I sometimes hear

2422
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:32,480
podcasts that are

2423
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,179
and I love that people

2424
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:33,780
are trying to do it

2425
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,519
I do love it

2426
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:35,039
because it is a great

2427
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:35,380
thing to do

2428
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,159
but I think I hear

2429
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:37,000
sometimes I feel like

2430
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,639
it's a bit forced

2431
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:39,059
and the person's

2432
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:39,800
not comfortable

2433
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,000
yeah I mean

2434
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,760
I'm reluctant to give

2435
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,139
too much behind the scenes

2436
00:41:44,139 --> 00:41:45,000
stuff with a podcast

2437
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,880
but we will spend

2438
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,139
with the guests

2439
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:48,380
I will spend a fair bit

2440
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:48,739
of time with them

2441
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:49,440
before the interview

2442
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,260
and Bridget spends

2443
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:50,760
a fair bit of time

2444
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:50,980
with them

2445
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,699
so establishing

2446
00:41:52,699 --> 00:41:53,980
where their boundaries

2447
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,820
are where they feel safe

2448
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,019
and building a fair bit

2449
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:56,960
of rapport before it

2450
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,440
so it's not

2451
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,000
they're not walking

2452
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,599
in cold going

2453
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,400
right let's do

2454
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:00,659
vulnerability

2455
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:02,239
you know it's like

2456
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:03,260
and also them

2457
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:03,840
understanding that

2458
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,579
hey we don't want you

2459
00:42:04,579 --> 00:42:05,019
to say anything

2460
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:05,940
that you're not

2461
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,440
comfortable with

2462
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,219
like we're not

2463
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:07,579
looking for that

2464
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:07,880
we're not looking

2465
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,340
for headlines

2466
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:08,619
we're not looking

2467
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:09,119
for controversy

2468
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,400
we would love to

2469
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,099
have a really special

2470
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:11,619
hour with you

2471
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:12,280
where you talk about

2472
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:12,699
something that you

2473
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:13,179
would like to talk

2474
00:42:13,179 --> 00:42:14,340
about but there is

2475
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,380
no pressure on you

2476
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,179
to do anything

2477
00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:17,460
that's going to

2478
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,000
make you put you

2479
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,460
in an uncomfortable

2480
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:18,960
position

2481
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,820
and I think that's

2482
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,340
what comes out

2483
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,139
about you

2484
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:21,480
you've always

2485
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,219
looked like someone

2486
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:23,260
that wants to do

2487
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,719
could and not

2488
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:25,840
looking for an outcome

2489
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,780
that maybe creates

2490
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,639
something that is

2491
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:29,219
manufactured

2492
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:29,719
and I think that

2493
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:30,719
authenticity of yours

2494
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:32,099
is very real

2495
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:33,159
you're kind enough

2496
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,280
to mention a leader

2497
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:34,679
and we've been

2498
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:35,000
fascinated

2499
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Andy Lee to

2500
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,239
introduce you

2501
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:38,119
and someone who

2502
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:39,119
does self-reflection

2503
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:39,639
and leadership

2504
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:40,679
for a long period

2505
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:41,199
of time

2506
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:41,840
I'm always curious

2507
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,079
about you as you

2508
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:43,619

2509
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:44,079

2510
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:44,480
of people

2511
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,280
five or six people

2512
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,760
that you wouldn't

2513
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,920
have been in touch

2514
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,619
with you mentioned

2515
00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:48,440
Troy Flanagan

2516
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,320
from the Walkie Bucks

2517
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,099
and Vanessa Ford

2518
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:51,280
is a remarkable

2519
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,960
lady doing

2520
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,760
incredible stuff

2521
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,780
you know from her

2522
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,460
home in Portugal

2523
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,820
and Amit Baines

2524
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,059
is an incredible

2525
00:42:57,059 --> 00:42:57,820
person as a CEO

2526
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,300
of the Bulldogs

2527
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:58,980
Tyson Ballard

2528
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:59,780
someone that got

2529
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,360
enormous respect

2530
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,559
for what did you

2531
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:02,619
take out of that

2532
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:03,139
as someone that's

2533
00:43:03,139 --> 00:43:03,599
probably in that

2534
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:04,380
space all the time

2535
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:04,780
what was

2536
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,780
valuable for you

2537
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,280
to me it was

2538
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,760
having these

2539
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,079
like four people

2540
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:10,599
from around

2541
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:11,679
five people from

2542
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:12,320
around the world

2543
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:12,780
who I knew

2544
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,340
really cared

2545
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,559
about things

2546
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:14,960
I was going

2547
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,179
through

2548
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:15,800
so we would

2549
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,519
share challenges

2550
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:17,119
that we had

2551
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,940
and Dr.

2552
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:19,480
Troy Flanagan

2553
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,019
who's the one

2554
00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:20,380
who really

2555
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,360
burst the door

2556
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,019
he's the one

2557
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:22,219
who really

2558
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:22,619
burst the door

2559
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:22,960
for us

2560
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,139
and went

2561
00:43:23,139 --> 00:43:23,599
okay well

2562
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,079
I want to

2563
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:25,500
talk about

2564
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,579
real stuff

2565
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:26,880
that's happening

2566
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,519
not just like

2567
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:27,980
oh I'm having

2568
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:28,199
an issue

2569
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:28,559
with a staff

2570
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:29,039
member who's

2571
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:29,500
which is all

2572
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:29,980
fine if that's

2573
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:30,219
what people

2574
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:30,579
have an issue

2575
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:31,079
with but

2576
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:31,900
for him it

2577
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,239
was a much

2578
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:33,219
deeper question

2579
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:34,380
around purpose

2580
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:34,679
and what it

2581
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:34,760
was to do

2582
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:34,780
and I think

2583
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,320
with his life

2584
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,780
I mean he went

2585
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,400
there it just

2586
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,000
encouraged us all

2587
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,400
to go well

2588
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,559
what is actually

2589
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:40,079
my biggest

2590
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,719
what is really

2591
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,159
keeping me up

2592
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:42,460
at night

2593
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,099
not like

2594
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:44,420
I'm not sure

2595
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:44,739
how much to

2596
00:43:44,739 --> 00:43:45,260
pay this staff

2597
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,539
member I'm

2598
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:45,960
not sure

2599
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,599
you know

2600
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:48,400
what it was

2601
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,659
real deep

2602
00:43:49,659 --> 00:43:50,500
stuff and

2603
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,599
then to share

2604
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:52,320
that and know

2605
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:52,679

2607
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:54,780
time and to

everyone really

2610
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:56,760
cared and there's

2611
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,300
a WhatsApp group

2612
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:57,719
that comes off

2613
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:58,039
the back room

2614
00:43:58,039 --> 00:43:58,659
people check in

2615
00:43:58,659 --> 00:43:59,239
with each other

2616
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:00,139
I'm fascinated

2617
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:01,440
by Amit who's

2618
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,179
the CEO of

2619
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:02,699
the Bulldogs

2620
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:03,679
and someone who

2621
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:04,760
loves sport and

2622
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,739
is now sort of

2623
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:06,260
interested in the

2624
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,320

giant organization

2632
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:13,699
and from what I've

2633
00:44:13,699 --> 00:44:14,800
learned about CEOs

2634
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,539
a lot of their job

2635
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:16,300
is just dealing

2636
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:16,739

in the media

2645
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,559

00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:51,380
this is amazing

2695
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,039
I just found

2696
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:52,579
incredible but

2697
00:44:52,579 --> 00:44:53,239
then the

2698
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:53,820
diversity of

2699
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:54,619
people I

2700
00:44:54,619 --> 00:44:55,039
really liked

2701
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:55,280
with our

2702
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,420
group were

2703
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,099
so different

2704
00:44:57,099 --> 00:44:57,440
we're all

2705
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:57,800
doing very

2706
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,480
different things

2707
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,260
and I think

2708
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,179
it's just like

2709
00:45:01,179 --> 00:45:01,840
I'm giving you

2710
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,360
very long answers

2711
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:02,860
today sorry

2712
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,179
but it was

2713
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:05,059
I said there's

2714
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:05,440
people from

2715
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:05,639
around the

2716
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:05,860
world who

2717
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:06,380
really cared

2718
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,320
who really

2719
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:07,960
care about me

2720
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,280
and what I'm

2721
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:08,820
trying to do

2722
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,880
and know that I

2723
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,400
really care about

2724
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,840
them and it's

2725
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,400
just like having

2726
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,460

2727
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,300

2728
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:15,739
being a sporting

2729
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:16,320

corner like that

2760
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,719
you think is

2761
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:38,679
really valuable

2762
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:39,340
Troy Flanagan

2763
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,820
shared a story

2764
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:41,840
with me recently

2765
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,539
which was

2766
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:43,099
inspiring we

2767
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:43,699
love that you

2768
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,059
know sometimes

2769
00:45:44,059 --> 00:45:44,519
these grand

2770
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:45,019
things happen

2771
00:45:45,019 --> 00:45:46,099
he was looking

2772
00:45:46,099 --> 00:45:47,400
at Vanessa and

2773
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,360
Super Sima and

2774
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,320
her contribution

2775
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,539
to community and

2776
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,579
having more

2777
00:45:51,579 --> 00:45:52,039
black women

2778
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:52,880
appear on screen

2779
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,559
so that her

2780
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:54,019
kids and a

2781
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:54,820
generation of

2782
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,000
black kids who

2783
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,739
haven't seen

2784
00:45:56,739 --> 00:45:58,260
superheroes and

2785
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,079
the superhero and

2786
00:45:59,079 --> 00:45:59,760
Super Sima's

2787
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,940
superpower science

2788
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,320
and he was so

2789
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,579
inspired by the

2790
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:04,559
contribution level

2791
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:05,360
that you know the

2792
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,380
next week went and

2793
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,139
you know saw the

2794
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:07,539
owner of the

2795
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:08,019
Milwaukee Bucks

2796
00:46:08,019 --> 00:46:08,699
got five million

2797
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:09,940
dollars and he's

2798
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,039
now fighting the

2799
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:12,079
obesity epidemic in

2800
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:12,780
the Milwaukee area

2801
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,360
on the back of a

2802
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,519
connection a random

2803
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:16,260
connection and I

2804
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,460
think that's what

2805
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:18,079
I've watched I

2806
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:18,500
watched that

2807
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,219
connection happen

2808
00:46:19,219 --> 00:46:20,260
over zoom I saw

2809
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,579
the you could

2810
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:21,980
because you can

2811
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,440
see everyone's

2812
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,079
faces and I

2813
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:23,519
remember when

2814
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:23,900
Vanessa would

2815
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,239
talk about what

2816
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:24,800
she was doing I

2817
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,239
could I was

2818
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:25,880
looking at him

2819
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,860
I was like there

2820
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:27,280
is something

2821
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:27,940
happening in his

2822
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,480
brain right now

2823
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,380
he looks so

2824
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,119
moved by what

2825
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:33,159
Vanessa's doing

2826
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:34,039
like it was

2827
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:35,480
amazing to watch

2828
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,380
and that's what

2829
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,079
the connection did

2830
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:37,960
that's they

2831
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:38,420
wouldn't have

2832
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,099
met there's no

2833
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:40,579
way in any

2834
00:46:40,579 --> 00:46:41,119
other situation

2835
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:41,579
those two would

2836
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:42,500
have met and

2837
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:42,940
you look at the

2838
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:43,619
result it has

2839
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:44,460
brilliant and we

2840
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,300
we love it and

2841
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,059
and it's part of

2842
00:46:46,059 --> 00:46:46,860
this sort of the

2843
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,500
privilege of being

2844
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:47,800
in those

2845
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,699
conversations as a

2846
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:49,699
team what we do

2847
00:46:49,699 --> 00:46:50,119
we're a bit

2848
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:51,500
enamored with the

2849
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,179
idea of inspiring

2850
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:52,960
connections and

2851
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,480
and this sort of

2852
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:53,760
world of

2853
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,559
collaboration and

2854
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:55,440
then this idea

2855
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,239
that success leaves

2856
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:57,360
clues is a term I

2857
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,019
use every week on

2858
00:46:58,019 --> 00:46:58,960
this podcast and

2859
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,900
we've seen these

2860
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,519
traits of different

2861
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:01,039
leaders and I'm

2862
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:01,840
fascinated with you

2863
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,280
because you're such

2864
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,380
a deep thinker and

2865
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,840
and so articulate

2866
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,460
the idea that it's

2867
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:05,980
hard to lead

2868
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:06,500
anyone else

2869
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,039
without a sense

2870
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:07,960
of self-leadership

2871
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,860
is something we

2872
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,559
talk about a lot

2873
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:10,019
what does that

2874
00:47:10,019 --> 00:47:10,460
mean to you

2875
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,099
self-leadership

2876
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:12,300
oh self-leadership

2877
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:12,780
I have thought

2878
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,179
about this because

2879
00:47:13,179 --> 00:47:13,800
I hear the term

2880
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,019
come up a bit

2881
00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:15,679
throughout a leader

2882
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:16,500
self-leadership

2883
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,460
I think self-leadership

2884
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,340
is giving yourself

2885
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,599
it's like protecting

2886
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,739
your energy and

2887
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:23,199
giving yourself

2888
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:24,579
space to think

2889
00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:25,139
about what is

2890
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:26,559
best for you

2891
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:27,579
understanding that

2892
00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:28,500
will also be

2893
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,940
best for the

2894
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:30,500
people who are

2895
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,679
around you and

2896
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:32,039
I think the

2897
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:33,739
tendency for a lot

2898
00:47:33,739 --> 00:47:34,739
of us is to see

2899
00:47:34,739 --> 00:47:35,579
a spare hour in

2900
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:36,219
our calendar and

2901
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:37,920
fill it or see

2902
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,719
a spare afternoon

2903
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:39,119
in the calendar

2904
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:39,619
just fill and go

2905
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:40,260
oh I could do

2906
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:40,699
this then I

2907
00:47:40,699 --> 00:47:41,079
could do this

2908
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:41,480
then and we go

2909
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:41,940
from one thing

2910
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,059
to the next and

2911
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:44,739
the more in the

2912
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:45,199
last few years

2913
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:45,639
that I have

2914
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:46,739
protected those

2915
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:47,900
like just have

2916
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:48,539
nothing to do

2917
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:49,500
I think more

2918
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,239
creatively I

2919
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:50,920
think about I

2920
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,300
end up thinking

2921
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:51,820
about the people

2922
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,739
around me like I

2923
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:53,179
think about our

2924
00:47:53,179 --> 00:47:53,800
podcast team I

2925
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,119
think about the

2926
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:54,679
resilience project

2927
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:57,360
team and I

2928
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,059
think about what's

2929
00:47:58,059 --> 00:47:59,719
what I need to do

2930
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:00,599
for myself to be

2931
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:01,280
in a good place

2932
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,179
and I prioritize

2933
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,619
that stuff I

2934
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:04,300
think that makes

2935
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:04,579
me a better

2936
00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:05,260
leader the more

2937
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,539
time ironically

2938
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:07,099
the more time I

2939
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:08,559
have off the

2940
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:09,840
better leader I

2941
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,360
am I think

2942
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,239
it's a brilliant

2943
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:11,739
answer and I

2944
00:48:11,739 --> 00:48:12,219
haven't heard

2945
00:48:12,219 --> 00:48:12,860
anyone go there

2946
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:13,619
before isn't it

2947
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:14,679
around yeah

2948
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:15,280
allocating that

2949
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,159
free time and

2950
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:16,820
my mind was

2951
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:17,260
going to that

2952
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:17,980
analogy of the

2953
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:18,960
give yourself the

2954
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,920
oxygen mask first

2955
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,400
on the plane

2956
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,079
because you

2957
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:21,800
can't say the

2958
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,119
next to you

2959
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:23,780
is that is that

2960
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,400
I think so I

2961
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,300
remember I

2962
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:27,739
can't remember

2963
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:28,840
like protect your

2964
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,519
energy has been a

2965
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:30,059
big thing for me

2966
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:31,099
in the last year

2967
00:48:31,099 --> 00:48:31,260
or two

2968
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:31,559
because I've

2969
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:32,199
burnt out I

2970
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:33,539
think 2019

2971
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:34,820
2020 I burnt

2972
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,360
out three years

2973
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:35,699
in a row I

2974
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:36,199
got to November

2975
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:37,699
and I was really

2976
00:48:37,699 --> 00:48:39,760
unwell and I

2977
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,239
wouldn't say it

2978
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:41,480
was like it I

2979
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,159
wore it as a

2980
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:42,579
badge of honor

2981
00:48:42,579 --> 00:48:43,079
but I was like

2982
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:43,519
well I've given

2983
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,000
everything this

2984
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,440
year I've gone

2985
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,559
so hard but

2986
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:46,639
then when you

2987
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:47,539
go so hard like

2988
00:48:47,539 --> 00:48:48,599
that you're not

2989
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:49,219
the only one who

2990
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:50,019
suffers like the

2991
00:48:50,019 --> 00:48:50,699
people that you

2992
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:51,940
love most in your

2993
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:52,699
life suffer the

2994
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:53,119
people who are

2995
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:53,780
closest to you

2996
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,260
suffer so my

2997
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,360
partner my kids

2998
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,300
and the teams

2999
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,780
that I I love

3000
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,079
my podcast team

3001
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:00,900
and I love my

3002
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:01,079
resilience

3003
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:01,860
project team

3004
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,599
they suffer too

3005
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:04,099
and I think we

3006
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:04,599
forget that

3007
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:05,619
sometimes and so

3008
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:06,599
I managed to

3009
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:07,139
work out a way

3010
00:49:07,139 --> 00:49:07,719
of like I'm

3011
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:09,099
protecting but my

3012
00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:09,639
overall thing is

3013
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:10,300
protect your energy

3014
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,480
and to do that

3015
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,420
protect this time

3016
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,219
so I've got in my

3017
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:14,440
calendar I've got

3018
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:14,820
there are four

3019
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,380
people have access

3020
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:15,900
to my calendar

3021
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,440
and can schedule

3022
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,099
stuff for me

3023
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:17,699
and I've just

3024
00:49:17,699 --> 00:49:18,380
got Hugh not

3025
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:18,980
available and

3026
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:19,739
these big chunks

3027
00:49:19,739 --> 00:49:20,480
that go for the

3028
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,360
next two years

3029
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:21,699
I've already got

3030
00:49:21,699 --> 00:49:22,199
them just out

3031
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:22,539
there and I'm

3032
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:23,099
not they're not

3033
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:23,519
allowed to touch

3034
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:23,880
them I know

3035
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,380
they can't touch

3036
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:25,480
them and it's

3037
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,380
not I'm being

3038
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,920
lazy it's like I'm

3039
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,179
Billy Slater said

3040
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:30,420
the 2020

3041
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:30,719
2020

3042
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:32,239
two series

3043
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:33,679
save origin series

3044
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,239
he said to the

3045
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:34,639
players really

3046
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:35,139
early on camp

3047
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:35,599
he said you

3048
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:36,539
only have one

3049
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:37,179
energy pool

3050
00:49:37,179 --> 00:49:37,639
they said you've

3051
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:38,320
got one energy

3052
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,360
and we've got a

3053
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,179
game in 10 days

3054
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:41,659
time and I want

3055
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:42,420
you to remember

3056
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,579
that the time you

3057
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:44,219
spend on social

3058
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:44,739
media worrying

3059
00:49:44,739 --> 00:49:45,380
about what fans

3060
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:46,460
think the times

3061
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,340
you spend reading

3062
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:48,019
what the paper

3063
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:48,800
says the time

3064
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,019
you spend in

3065
00:49:50,019 --> 00:49:50,880
this 10-day camp

3066
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,760
I want this to be

3067
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,699
about protecting

3068
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:53,559
as much energy as

3069
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:54,619
possible he didn't

3070
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:55,019
say protecting

3071
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:55,679
energy he said I

3072
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:56,320
want it to be about

3073
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,420
understanding you

3074
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:58,000
have one energy

3075
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,440
it's not like you

3076
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,199
can go well I'll

3077
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:00,559
just lie on the

3078
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:00,699
couch

3079
00:50:00,699 --> 00:50:01,179
and give those

3080
00:50:01,179 --> 00:50:02,159
energy to social

3081
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:02,780
media and have

3082
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,400
energy left for the

3083
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,239
game tomorrow night

3084
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:05,239
so you've got one

3085
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:05,980
energy and I want

3086
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:06,760
you to be very

3087
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,579
focused on keeping

3088
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:08,340
it as full as

3089
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,280
possible and that

3090
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,159
really spoke to me

3091
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:11,960
not about state of

3092
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,019
origin that was not

3093
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:14,219
for me it was just

3094
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:15,239
yeah I only have

3095
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:16,519
I only have one

3096
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:17,320
energy and I think

3097
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,719
to myself I can do

3098
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:19,500
all these talks

3099
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,440
and I can run

3100
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,360
during the day and

3101
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:22,800
then I can come

3102
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,099
home and have

3103
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:23,559
energy for the

3104
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:24,380
family but you

3105
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,139
only have this one

3106
00:50:25,139 --> 00:50:26,699
energy so my

3107
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:27,539
running is the

3108
00:50:27,539 --> 00:50:28,119
analogy of running

3109
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:28,599
is like I'm a

3110
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:29,139
sprinter and with

3111
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:30,539
sprinters it's like

3112
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:31,599
it's preparation for

3113
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:32,360
races is trying to

3114
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:32,960
have as much energy

3115
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,719
as possible so you

3116
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:34,500
don't smash yourself

3117
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,179
in the wake letting

3118
00:50:35,179 --> 00:50:36,420
up to the training

3119
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,219
you you're really

3120
00:50:38,219 --> 00:50:38,940
clever about it and

3121
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,219
you taper and it's

3122
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:40,760
almost like I'm sort

3123
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,480
of tapering for life

3124
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,860
now I'm like if I

3125
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,360
want to have energy

3126
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:43,760
at the end of the

3127
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,559
day for the kids

3128
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:45,219
which is the hardest

3129
00:50:45,219 --> 00:50:46,780
part of the day I

3130
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:47,559
can't do four talks

3131
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:49,039
I can't run I need

3132
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:50,059
to have time where

3133
00:50:50,059 --> 00:50:52,039
that to me is like I

3134
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:53,199
know it it doesn't

3135
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:53,739
sound like self

3136
00:50:53,739 --> 00:50:54,760
leadership but my

3137
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,579
version of that is

3138
00:50:55,579 --> 00:50:57,019
it's like look after

3139
00:50:57,019 --> 00:50:59,480
yourself leave a lot

3140
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,000
of petrol in the

3141
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,019
tank for the people

3142
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:01,960
around you it sounds

3143
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,719
exactly like self

3144
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:03,599
leadership and I

3145
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:04,340
love it you're not

3146
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,559
available is just

3147
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:06,719
brilliant you know

3148
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:07,559
we grew up in an era

3149
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:09,000
where if you're out

3150
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:09,780
having a walk with

3151
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:10,860
your wife on the

3152
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:11,860
phone you'd say oh

3153
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,880
I'm in a meeting I'm

3154
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,920
busy yeah because you

3155
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,579
didn't want people to

3156
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:15,960
think oh how lazy is

3157
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,039
he yes you know he's

3158
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:18,320
out you know how

3159
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,179
he gets time to walk

3160
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:20,659
it's like we should

3161
00:51:20,659 --> 00:51:21,340
flip that shouldn't

3162
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,460
we I'm actually going

3163
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,300
for a walk with

3164
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,420
Bec now I'm

3165
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,460
unavailable this is

3166
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,099
the most important

3167
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:27,300
thing or I think

3168
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,199
you've yeah brought

3169
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:28,800
that to the table

3170
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,599
I kind of also

3171
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:29,980
learned that from

3172
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,179
Ryan Shelton because

3173
00:51:31,179 --> 00:51:32,840
he has these holidays

3174
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,619
throughout the year

3175
00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:34,400
where he'll go away

3176
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,659
to he's in the US at

3177
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:36,420
the moment he goes to

3178
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,619
Europe as well and

3179
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:38,320
when we're planning the

3180
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,039
year out and we're

3181
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:39,760
looking at the podcast

3182
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,400
I'm like gosh he's

3183
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,920
away a bit but he

3184
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,099
always has his best

3185
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:43,880
he's the most creative

3186
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,320
person I've never seen

3187
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,039
him come up with ideas

3188
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:47,280
like his ideas are

3189
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,460
our live show he did

3190
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,159
was pretty much his

3191
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:50,920
brain like it was

3192
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,820
just his the ideas

3193
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:52,320
he'd come up with

3194
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,539
and he always comes

3195
00:51:53,539 --> 00:51:53,860
up with them when

3196
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:54,440
he's overseas or

3197
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:54,900
he's come back from

3198
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,639
overseas like he has

3199
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:56,179
that time where he

3200
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,059
just stops and he

3201
00:51:58,059 --> 00:51:59,440
lets his brain wonder

3202
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,920
and we don't let our

3203
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,639
brains wander they

3204
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:02,380
never wonder they're

3205
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,679
always on whether

3206
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:04,480
we're walking listening

3207
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,280
to a podcast or

3208
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,280
we're listening to

3209
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,480
music or we're

3210
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,260
sending emails as

3211
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,079
we're walking we

3212
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:09,719
go let our minds

3213
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:10,699
wonder and he does

3214
00:52:10,699 --> 00:52:11,639
that and that's he

3215
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:12,300
comes up with the

3216
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,139
best he's an ideas

3217
00:52:13,139 --> 00:52:14,739
machine and he

3218
00:52:14,739 --> 00:52:15,340
comes up those

3219
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,579
ideas when he's

3220
00:52:16,579 --> 00:52:17,840
Ryan not available

3221
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,599
because he actually

3222
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:19,519
creates the time to

3223
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:20,199
do it which is

3224
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:20,940
brilliant to share

3225
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:21,780
the idea of a

3226
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,659
positively impacting

3227
00:52:22,659 --> 00:52:23,539
people in the

3228
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:24,119
environment you're

3229
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:24,599
around I've heard you

3230
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:25,179
talk about that

3231
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:26,300
already around I

3232
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:26,900
care so much for

3233
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,659
the resilience project

3234
00:52:27,659 --> 00:52:29,340
team I care for the

3235
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:31,480
imperfects team and

3236
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,199
it sounds like you

3237
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:33,000
think about that

3238
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,440
impact a lot can you

3239
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,179
share with us how

3240
00:52:35,179 --> 00:52:35,599
you've gone about

3241
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,019
that well I've said

3242
00:52:37,019 --> 00:52:38,099
I've said it five

3243
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:38,420
minutes ago I

3244
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,360
genuinely love the

3245
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,000
people that I work

3246
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,239
with and and feel

3247
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:42,579
very much it's like a

3248
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:45,239
family and so I

3249
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:45,820
think I think about

3250
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:46,460
them in that way as

3251
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,000
in like I just love

3252
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,840
listening to them

3253
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,699
talk I love knowing

3254
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:50,099
what's happening in

3255
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:50,800
their lives and I

3256
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,360
love I think a lot

3257
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,039
about what is best

3258
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:54,559
for them because I

3259
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:55,099
think what is best

3260
00:52:55,099 --> 00:52:55,739
for them is what's

3261
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,820
best for the

3262
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:58,480
imperfects or the

3263
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,139
resilience project

3264
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,940
and so I think

3265
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:01,539
probably a lot of

3266
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:02,059
leaders probably think

3267
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:02,699
like that these days

3268
00:53:02,699 --> 00:53:03,579
but not sure about

3269
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:05,079
that yeah I don't

3270
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:05,780
know all I know is

3271
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,579
resilience project and

3272
00:53:06,579 --> 00:53:07,300
the imperfects but I

3273
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,000
do know that we we

3274
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,980
try very hard to

3275
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,139
think about what I

3276
00:53:11,139 --> 00:53:12,079
I'm going to go back

3277
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:12,559
to state of origin

3278
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,320
again I can't speak

3279
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:14,900
to New South Wales

3280
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,519
but I can't speak to

3281
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:16,739
Queensland their

3282
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:18,039
philosophy and having

3283
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:19,260
spoken a lot to the

3284
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:19,860
head of strength and

3285
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:20,340
conditioning and

3286
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,900
Billy is so it's

3287
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:22,900
mid-season for them

3288
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,039
so they're halfway

3289
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:24,699
through their season

3290
00:53:24,699 --> 00:53:26,900
and when they come

3291
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,739
into camp their

3292
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:28,239
whole thing is

3293
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:28,820
healthy and happy

3294
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:29,179
athletes

3295
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,179
let's just have

3296
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:30,719
healthy and happy

3297
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:31,619
so you do what you

3298
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:32,179
need to do to be

3299
00:53:32,179 --> 00:53:33,559
healthy and to be

3300
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:34,380
happy because that

3301
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,059
will give us the

3302
00:53:35,059 --> 00:53:36,380
best result I don't

3303
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,659
know I've heard that

3304
00:53:37,659 --> 00:53:38,880
New South Wales work

3305
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,039
a lot harder on camp

3306
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:40,719
there's a lot more

3307
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:41,980
physical demands I

3308
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:42,619
don't know if that's

3309
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:43,420
it has been the case

3310
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,239
I'm not in a position

3311
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:45,460
to tell so though we

3312
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:45,940
feel this in this

3313
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:46,420
area part of New

3314
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,000
South Wales camp

3315
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:47,679
that's not the case

3316
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:48,659
and I apologize but

3317
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:49,199
that's sort of what

3318
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:50,199
I've heard at stages

3319
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:51,500
that that is the

3320
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,900
difference and that's

3321
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:53,619
kind of what I think

3322
00:53:53,619 --> 00:53:54,480
about for my team

3323
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,840
what healthy happy

3324
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,420
people like I really

3325
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,860
I really hope that

3326
00:53:58,860 --> 00:53:59,320
people who work

3327
00:53:59,320 --> 00:53:59,920
for the resilience

3328
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,079
project feel there's a

3329
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:03,440
genuine sense of care

3330
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,119
from and that's not

3331
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:05,039
driven by me that is

3332
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:06,199
driven by our CEO

3333
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:07,280
Ben Waterman who is

3334
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,019
also in a leader

3335
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:09,659
group he drives out

3336
00:54:09,659 --> 00:54:10,400
so one of it we've

3337
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,159
got four key

3338
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:12,980
performance areas and

3339
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,659
one of them is staff

3340
00:54:13,659 --> 00:54:14,500
well-being so we

3341
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,079
measure staff

3342
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:15,679
well-being every

3343
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:17,360
single month and we

3344
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:17,960
present it to the

3345
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,440
staff I need to stop

3346
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,079
saying we Ben

3347
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:20,840
presents that to the

3348
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,340
staff and we look at

3349
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:22,940
the 10 different

3350
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:23,840
areas of well-being

3351
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,559
and how it's trending

3352
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:26,119
and how everyone's

3353
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:26,800
going we talk about

3354
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,699
every single one with

3355
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:28,699
everyone we get

3356
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:29,300
everyone's buy in

3357
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,340
on it buy in's not

3358
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,260
the right word we get

3359
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:31,940
them just to talk

3360
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:32,920
openly about how

3361
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,559
they feel about you

3362
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:34,300
know a question like

3363
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,480
I'm able to switch

3364
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,119
off when I get home

3365
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:36,500
at the end of the

3366
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,199
day that might have

3367
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:39,340
gone down point to

3368
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,099
mark and so we'll

3369
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:41,780
just chat and say

3370
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,320
how's everyone going

3371
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,800
there what's what's

3372
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,539
what's happening here

3373
00:54:44,539 --> 00:54:46,480
and that is very

3374
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,119
much I don't take

3375
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:47,820
any credit for that

3376
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:49,280
but I'm so supportive

3377
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:49,960
of Ben doing that

3378
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,480
because yes I just

3379
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,340
feel like it's it's

3380
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,480
just so common sense

3381
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,360
to me like the

3382
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,139
healthier and happier

3383
00:54:55,139 --> 00:54:55,679
they are the more

3384
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:57,019
they will just and

3385
00:54:57,019 --> 00:54:58,199
it's not about making

3386
00:54:58,199 --> 00:54:58,940
them better at their

3387
00:54:58,940 --> 00:54:59,280
job

3388
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,079
but it is one of the

3389
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:00,440
results

3390
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,860
yeah I love if you're

3391
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:02,480
in the business of

3392
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,820
teaching people those

3393
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,019
things if you're not

3394
00:55:05,019 --> 00:55:05,860
running that that way

3395
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:06,639
with your own team

3396
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:07,579
it's never going to

3397
00:55:07,579 --> 00:55:08,340
work is it yeah

3398
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:08,920
the fact that you

3399
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,619
practice that so

3400
00:55:09,619 --> 00:55:10,380
clearly and you've

3401
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,440
got the team you

3402
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,699
have makes an

3403
00:55:12,699 --> 00:55:13,280
enormous amount of

3404
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,019
sense to me you've

3405
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,539
had some big visions

3406
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:16,500
haven't you to take

3407
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,579
on what you've done

3408
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:18,179
and you've wandered

3409
00:55:18,179 --> 00:55:19,780
into over a thousand

3410
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,000
schools and been

3411
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,059
able to bring you

3412
00:55:22,059 --> 00:55:22,539
know this term

3413
00:55:22,539 --> 00:55:23,739
resilience and and

3414
00:55:23,739 --> 00:55:24,760
all those other key

3415
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,480
attributes to the

3416
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,079
world have you gone

3417
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,340
about the imperfect

3418
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:28,219
is another big vision

3419
00:55:28,219 --> 00:55:29,019
creating and sharing

3420
00:55:29,019 --> 00:55:29,280
that

3421
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,300
that vision with the

3422
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:30,960
team to bring it to

3423
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,420
life there's a lot of

3424
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,260
we do a lot of stuff

3425
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:34,199
on especially the

3426
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:34,880
resilience project on

3427
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:35,940
vision and mission and

3428
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:36,559
all that kind of stuff

3429
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,119
but I think in a very

3430
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:39,579
basic level so for the

3431
00:55:39,579 --> 00:55:40,280
imperfects we are

3432
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,039
trying very hard to

3433
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:41,679
create a show that we

3434
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:43,079
love that's it we just

3435
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:43,960
what what do we love

3436
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,800
doing and what do we

3437
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,619
love hearing and that's

3438
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:47,300
what we try and

3439
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,340
because that's the

3440
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,300
easiest I mean that's

3441
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,000
the I think that's the

3442
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,599
best way to do it like

3443
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:52,920
what do we love the

3444
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:53,559
second you go and

3445
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:54,139
what do people want to

3446
00:55:54,139 --> 00:55:55,000
hear right now what's

3447
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,860
popular what what's

3448
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:57,659
everyone talking about

3449
00:55:57,659 --> 00:55:59,119
I feel like that's

3450
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:00,239
exhausting I reckon if

3451
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:01,119
you're constantly chasing

3452
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:02,380
what everyone if you

3453
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:03,280
just go here's what we

3454
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,400
love this makes us

3455
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,559
laugh this makes us

3456
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:06,920
cry this moves us this

3457
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,559
teaches us something

3458
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:08,579
let's just explore this

3459
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:09,920
and it's kind of the

3460
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:10,460
same the resilience

3461
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:11,840
project I just loved

3462
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,420
in the first instance

3463
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:14,260
going to schools

3464
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,519
getting to know the

3465
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:16,139
staff getting to know

3466
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:17,340
the kids putting

3467
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,300
together a program that

3468
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:18,900
would benefit that

3469
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,099
school and that

3470
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:21,679
community and that

3471
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:22,300
school community that

3472
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,760
was it for me and I've

3473
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,719
tried it's hard to

3474
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:25,780
scale now there's like

3475
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:28,519
nearly 40 staff now but

3476
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:30,019
we're still essentially

3477
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:30,659
trying to create that

3478
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:31,340
experience for any

3479
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,179
school that joins us

3480
00:56:32,179 --> 00:56:33,139
it's just what is best

3481
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,579
for this school how do

3482
00:56:34,579 --> 00:56:35,320
we improve the school

3483
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:35,920
community how do we

3484
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,500
improve the well-being

3485
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,260
the school community and

3486
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,800
it's it sounds very

3487
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:40,739
cliche it's one one

3488
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:41,440
school just one week

3489
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,139
at a time one school

3490
00:56:42,139 --> 00:56:42,820
at a time and

3491
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:43,480
everyone's got the

3492
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,199
schools I look after

3493
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:44,940
and that's kind of what

3494
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,559
they do and I don't

3495
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:47,199
think it's ever been

3496
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:48,739
about let's be the

3497
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:49,300
biggest well-being

3498
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,239
program let's be the

3499
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:52,039
it's just let's be

3500
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:53,280
really let's be really

3501
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,280
great in this school

3502
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,440
here and then

3503
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:55,960
tomorrow we have

3504
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:56,460
that school let's be

3505
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,000
really great in that

3506
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
school and let's have

3507
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,460
a really big

3508
00:56:58,519 --> 00:56:59,940
impact here and I

3509
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:00,639
think with a podcast

3510
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:01,300
it's just hey what

3511
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:01,880
show do we want to

3512
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,679
make let's make that

3513
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:04,960
and if people listen

3514
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:05,500
to it that's great

3515
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,219
which they are it's

3516
00:57:06,219 --> 00:57:07,099
great and that way

3517
00:57:07,099 --> 00:57:07,739
you just enjoy it so

3518
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:08,579
much more doing what

3519
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:09,099
you want to do

3520
00:57:09,099 --> 00:57:09,619
yeah it's really

3521
00:57:09,619 --> 00:57:10,519
clear it's easy to

3522
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:11,300
understand too isn't

3523
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,739
it it narrows your

3524
00:57:12,739 --> 00:57:13,380
focus I feel like

3525
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,000
you've done that for

3526
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,280
many years with like

3527
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,280
with your shows on

3528
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,059
Triple M and the

3529
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,099
footy I feel like you

3530
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:19,019
guys are so good at

3531
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,340
creating shows I

3532
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:20,699
mean you hear you

3533
00:57:20,699 --> 00:57:21,860
guys laugh like you're

3534
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:22,519
not putting it on like

3535
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:23,460
it's very genuine you

3536
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:24,360
are having so much

3537
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,280
fun doing it it's

3538
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,880
lightweight too it's

3539
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,059
but I think you're

3540
00:57:28,059 --> 00:57:28,500
right I think that's

3541
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,539
the key if you're

3542
00:57:29,539 --> 00:57:30,260
sitting there and

3543
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,239
going what makes you

3544
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,460
laugh what makes not

3545
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:33,519
what you think could

3546
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:35,239
possibly be for us

3547
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:36,139
it's like the locker

3548
00:57:36,139 --> 00:57:37,280
room was a funny most

3549
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,780
enjoyable funny yes

3550
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,940
you just knew you

3551
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:40,699
know if you had your

3552
00:57:40,699 --> 00:57:41,900
hair slightly as

3553
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,559
you've been inside

3554
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,119
those locker rooms

3555
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:43,960
now someone's going to

3556
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:44,699
call you out on that

3557
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:47,099
ridiculous sledging but

3558
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:48,079
good-natured sledging

3559
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,559
it was saying stuff

3560
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:50,179
you'd say to your

3561
00:57:50,179 --> 00:57:51,179
mates that could

3562
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:51,980
probably inappropriate

3563
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,480
in other places but it

3564
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,260
was done with love

3565
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:55,519
yeah that was

3566
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:56,340
probably I reckon

3567
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,360
when we've done that

3568
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,239
at our best you feel

3569
00:57:58,239 --> 00:57:58,480
like you're sitting

3570
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,219
back in the locker

3571
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:00,340
room yeah and even

3572
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:00,920
though at times it

3573
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:01,800
sounds pretty full-on

3574
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,599
but that's what the

3575
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:03,840
audience I feel like

3576
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:04,679
listen to you guys I

3577
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:05,300
feel like I'm in the

3578
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,780
locker room and I'm

3579
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:07,639
not able to participate

3580
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:08,340
which is probably the

3581
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:09,119
way I like it I can

3582
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:09,619
just sit back and

3583
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:10,639
listen and laugh and

3584
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:11,480
it's great I think it's

3585
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,219
at its best when you're

3586
00:58:12,219 --> 00:58:13,019
aiming at each other

3587
00:58:13,019 --> 00:58:13,739
and I think when we

3588
00:58:13,739 --> 00:58:14,539
get it wrong is we

3589
00:58:14,539 --> 00:58:15,719
probably aim at people

3590
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:16,599
outside and maybe

3591
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:17,739
miss the context of it

3592
00:58:17,739 --> 00:58:18,679
right okay and then

3593
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:19,260
it's gone wrong

3594
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:20,039
occasionally is my

3595
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:21,880
view yeah well

3596
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,900
meaning yeah not

3597
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,559
nasty but it's like I

3598
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:25,320
can say stuff to

3599
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,139
Nathan Brown or do

3600
00:58:26,139 --> 00:58:27,460
tripling 40 with that

3601
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,219
is completely

3602
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,780
inappropriate he moved

3603
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:30,480
into my house when he

3604
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,960
was 17 he's a

3605
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:32,820
bogan from Bendigo

3606
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,000
yeah we had to teach

3607
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,280
him to just be normal

3608
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,159
you know when he was

3609
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,300
17 but we love him

3610
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,440
he's yeah the success

3611
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,579
he's had in life and

3612
00:58:39,579 --> 00:58:41,099
he's now a born-again

3613
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:41,780
Christian or whatever

3614
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,000
he is and you know

3615
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,619
he's married this

3616
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:44,659
beautiful partner so

3617
00:58:44,659 --> 00:58:45,659
we love but the

3618
00:58:45,659 --> 00:58:46,980
hanging shit part is a

3619
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,019
fun part yes but done

3620
00:58:48,019 --> 00:58:49,079
with love yeah totally

3621
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:50,119
he's probably you know

3622
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:50,760
I don't think we say

3623
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,599
that on triple M40

3624
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,159
done with love but

3625
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:54,199
but yeah again you

3626
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:54,960
pull that out of me

3627
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,739
man I sit across from

3628
00:58:55,739 --> 00:58:57,159
you and and and the

3629
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,460
real language I

3630
00:58:58,460 --> 00:58:59,360
which comes out so I

3631
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,239
think it's it's probably

3632
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:01,199
yeah absolutely but

3633
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:01,940
you know as a listener

3634
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,360
like I'll say this on

3635
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,039
the way up into this

3636
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:05,260
studio but I listen to

3637
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,760
triple M40 since I

3638
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,800
remember I would go to

3639
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,840
when I lived in

3640
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,679
Richmond I would I

3641
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:10,780
was like single living

3642
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,380
apartment in Richmond

3643
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,179
and I would always

3644
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:13,380
take my headphones down

3645
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,039
to this cafe at

3646
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:15,480
midday on Saturdays

3647
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,320
and I would just I

3648
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:16,900
would listen to every

3649
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,159
single show when I was

3650
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:19,079
in India in 2008 I

3651
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:19,719
would listen to the

3652
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:20,360
we could find it

3653
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,139
online I listened to

3654
00:59:21,139 --> 00:59:22,480
it and it was always

3655
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,139
I think that's if it

3656
00:59:24,139 --> 00:59:24,880
wasn't done with love

3657
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,400
I wouldn't have

3658
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:25,900
listened to it I

3659
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:26,380
wouldn't have liked

3660
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:27,039
it if it was like

3661
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:27,960
these guys are just

3662
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:28,320
like

3663
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:29,360
they're really at

3664
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:29,960
each other it was

3665
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,679
just yes

3666
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:32,059
you can hear the

3667
00:59:32,059 --> 00:59:33,280
the good-natured part

3668
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,639
of it I reckon even

3669
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:36,320
delivered over the

3670
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:36,900
journey and it

3671
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:37,539
been a lot of fun to

3672
00:59:37,539 --> 00:59:38,480
do it curiosities

3673
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,119
are where we use a

3674
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,199
lot here and we see

3675
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:41,099
that turn up a lot

3676
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:41,719
with people and

3677
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:42,420
they're just

3678
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,199
inherently curious

3679
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:44,219
and they're constantly

3680
00:59:44,219 --> 00:59:45,380
wanting to get better

3681
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:46,019
and everything they

3682
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:46,880
do through curiosity

3683
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:47,420
is that you

3684
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,039
yeah we one of our

3685
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:49,679
values at Resonance

3686
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:50,559
Project is curiosity

3687
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:51,460
not not I didn't

3688
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,239
suggest that that was

3689
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:52,840
our partnerships

3690
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,719
manager Kim Smiley

3691
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:56,380
but yeah curiosity

3692
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:57,300
is it's a big part

3693
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:57,940
of the Resonance

3694
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:58,440
Project and

3695
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:58,960
it's become

3696
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,579
I guess since I

3697
01:00:01,579 --> 01:00:03,079
first put my hand

3698
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:03,619
up during COVID

3699
01:00:03,619 --> 01:00:03,960
and said I'm

3700
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:04,539
really struggling

3701
01:00:04,539 --> 01:00:05,420
the first thing

3702
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:05,940
happened was I

3703
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,159
became immensely

3704
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:08,000
curious around okay

3705
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,599
well what do I do

3706
01:00:08,599 --> 01:00:09,539
now like it was

3707
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:10,219
it was a very

3708
01:00:10,219 --> 01:00:11,059
strong feeling of

3709
01:00:11,059 --> 01:00:11,639
when I said I'm

3710
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:13,519
not okay I

3711
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:14,019
remember I

3712
01:00:14,019 --> 01:00:16,019
actually the

3713
01:00:16,019 --> 01:00:16,500
reason it happened

3714
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,039
was I did an

3715
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:17,579
interview on

3716
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:18,940
Dave Hughes radio

3717
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,059
show in Sydney

3718
01:00:20,059 --> 01:00:21,199
and it was

3719
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:22,760
7.15 it was

3720
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,199
during COVID

3721
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:23,840
7.15 in the

3722
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,940
morning and I

3723
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:27,599
was struggling a

3724
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:27,860
bit but I

3725
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:28,099
hadn't really

3726
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:28,420
set it out

3727
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:29,480
loud and I

3728
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:30,199
had an hour

3729
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:30,539
and a half

3730
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:31,079
sleep because

3731
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:32,380
our daughter was

3732
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:32,940
eight months at

3733
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:33,360
time she wasn't

3734
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,219
sleeping at all

3735
01:00:34,219 --> 01:00:35,780
and I wanted to

3736
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:36,119
cancel the

3737
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:36,480
interview because

3738
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,119
I felt you know

3739
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:37,480
when you use that

3740
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:37,860
time you just

3741
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:38,400
feel sick and

3742
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,199
you just verbal

3743
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:39,980
fluency is gone

3744
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:40,500
and it's a problem

3745
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:40,840
when you're trying

3746
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,119
to interview and

3747
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:42,760
I thought no I'll

3748
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:43,179
just do it it's

3749
01:00:43,179 --> 01:00:43,679
fine it's gonna be

3750
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:44,199
more trouble it's

3751
01:00:44,199 --> 01:00:44,880
worth to cancel

3752
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,079
it and then at

3753
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:46,980
the end he was

3754
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:47,400
in Sydney he

3755
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:47,739
said mate I

3756
01:00:47,739 --> 01:00:48,079
know you're in

3757
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:48,340
Melbourne I

3758
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:48,599
should probably

3759
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:49,380
check hey how

3760
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,219
are you and I

3761
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:51,239
said I said I'm

3762
01:00:51,239 --> 01:00:51,780
totally and utterly

3763
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,239
broken and I said

3764
01:00:53,239 --> 01:00:53,760
it and just cover

3765
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,280
my mouth and went

3766
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:54,940
oh shit what have

3767
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:55,539
I done I'm the

3768
01:00:55,539 --> 01:00:56,239
resilience guy I

3769
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:56,599
shouldn't have said

3770
01:00:56,599 --> 01:00:58,079
that and he they're

3771
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:58,639
a comedy show

3772
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:00,159
oh okay good

3773
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:00,739
stuff mate well

3774
01:01:00,739 --> 01:01:02,000
we'll have a good

3775
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,619
day chat to you

3776
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:03,099
soon and they

3777
01:01:03,099 --> 01:01:04,380
were gone I

3778
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:04,760
went and told

3779
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,239
Penny when I

3780
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:05,840
said I can't I

3781
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:06,300
just don't I'm

3782
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:06,679
just done I

3783
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:06,900
don't have

3784
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:07,340
people listen to

3785
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:07,940
that show but

3786
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:08,639
I've just said

3787
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:10,239
to thousands of

3788
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:10,619
people I'm not

3789
01:01:10,619 --> 01:01:11,760
okay this could

3790
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:12,260
be a problem for

3791
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:13,679
the resilience guy

3792
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:15,559
but then instantly I

3793
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:16,059
remember just feeling

3794
01:01:16,059 --> 01:01:16,659
so much better and

3795
01:01:16,659 --> 01:01:17,559
thinking okay so

3796
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:18,280
what do I do what

3797
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,159
do I do now so

3798
01:01:19,159 --> 01:01:20,480
whether it's you

3799
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,360
yourself what do I

3800
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,119
do for myself to be

3801
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:23,360
better or your

3802
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,039
organization or

3803
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:24,820
people around you I

3804
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:24,920
think

3805
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,019
it's a lovely I

3806
01:01:27,019 --> 01:01:27,539
think you get to a

3807
01:01:27,539 --> 01:01:28,579
point I feel like

3808
01:01:28,579 --> 01:01:28,980
certainly my

3809
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,480
upbringing and this

3810
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:30,760
is a big

3811
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:31,480
generalization but

3812
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,619
going to a private

3813
01:01:32,619 --> 01:01:34,099
school and I know

3814
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:34,579
it's not like this

3815
01:01:34,579 --> 01:01:35,760
anymore but certainly

3816
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,300
back in the 90s it

3817
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:38,500
kind of felt like you

3818
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,260
get the best mark you

3819
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,420
possibly can then you

3820
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:41,179
go to university you

3821
01:01:41,179 --> 01:01:41,900
get the best job you

3822
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,559
can you get paid as

3823
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:44,199
much as you possibly

3824
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:44,780
can get as many

3825
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,599
promotions as you can

3826
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,099
and then that's it

3827
01:01:46,099 --> 01:01:46,800
that's the that's

3828
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:47,559
you're happy that's

3829
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:49,980
it but I think a

3830
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:50,739
lot of people when

3831
01:01:50,739 --> 01:01:51,360
they get in their

3832
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,219
30s and 40s and

3833
01:01:52,219 --> 01:01:53,179
realize I've done all

3834
01:01:53,179 --> 01:01:54,199
that like I feel like

3835
01:01:54,199 --> 01:01:54,639
a lot of men in

3836
01:01:54,639 --> 01:01:54,900
their 40s and

3837
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,760
40s or 50s go like

3838
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,199
I've done everything

3839
01:01:57,199 --> 01:01:58,139
I was promised I was

3840
01:01:58,139 --> 01:01:59,059
told if I did this but

3841
01:01:59,059 --> 01:02:00,440
I'm like I'm missing

3842
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,659
something here I feel

3843
01:02:01,659 --> 01:02:03,199
like I'm the minute

3844
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:03,880
you sort of admit that

3845
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,260
you then become curious

3846
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:06,679
to okay what what else

3847
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:07,539
could I be doing here

3848
01:02:07,539 --> 01:02:08,199
like I've had an

3849
01:02:08,199 --> 01:02:09,260
enormous success in my

3850
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:10,719
career but what am I

3851
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:11,340
missing what have I

3852
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:12,679
missed out on and that

3853
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:13,699
curiosity can lead you

3854
01:02:13,699 --> 01:02:14,559
to I think there's a

3855
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:15,360
lot of curious people

3856
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,300
in their 40s and 50s

3857
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,059
going ah no no I'm

3858
01:02:18,059 --> 01:02:18,820
not pretending that I

3859
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:19,719
know everything so I

3860
01:02:19,719 --> 01:02:20,760
could get the best so

3861
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:21,519
I can climb the

3862
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:22,000
corporate ladders

3863
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,559
you know at times in

3864
01:02:23,559 --> 01:02:24,320
my 20s and 30s

3865
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:24,860
people would ask me a

3866
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:24,900
question and I'd

3867
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,579
and I would say with

3868
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:27,380
authority I had no

3869
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:27,760
idea what I was

3870
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:28,420
talking about but I'd

3871
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:29,059
answer with authority

3872
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:30,579
like oh yeah so what

3873
01:02:30,579 --> 01:02:31,380
you'll find actually is

3874
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,139
the reason and I'm

3875
01:02:32,139 --> 01:02:33,039
like I look back and

3876
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:33,760
go you didn't know

3877
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:34,920
like you're just making

3878
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:35,480
it up because you

3879
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,119
wanted to sound like

3880
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:36,400
you had all the

3881
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,760
answers as soon as you

3882
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:38,300
don't have all the

3883
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,900
answers and the amount

3884
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:40,360
of times I have a

3885
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:40,920
staff meeting I'm

3886
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,420
asked a question as

3887
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,219
the founder of the

3888
01:02:43,219 --> 01:02:43,900
organization I just

3889
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,159
go I've got no idea

3890
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:46,019
who does anyone know

3891
01:02:46,019 --> 01:02:46,920
I don't know why

3892
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,400
are you asking me and

3893
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,260
it's just it's a much

3894
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:50,000
more relaxing position

3895
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:50,820
to come from but it

3896
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:51,599
leads to curiosity

3897
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:52,219
amongst the whole

3898
01:02:52,219 --> 01:02:53,519
group as well yeah

3899
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:54,400
brilliant answer and I

3900
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:54,840
think you allow people

3901
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,099
that don't you by not

3902
01:02:56,099 --> 01:02:57,480
as you said I'm the

3903
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,219
founder I've got to

3904
01:02:59,219 --> 01:03:00,000
say something here

3905
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,619
now and it's disarming

3906
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:02,599
to say I don't know

3907
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:03,440
isn't it and then

3908
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,380
empowering people to

3909
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:05,079
ask that question

3910
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:06,199
communicating with

3911
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,880
clarity you get your

3912
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,039
message out in such a

3913
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:09,880
powerful way the

3914
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,699
resilience project as

3915
01:03:11,699 --> 01:03:13,199
a brand to use a

3916
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:13,940
marketing term I

3917
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:14,420
actually hate that

3918
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,579
term but it's in the

3919
01:03:16,579 --> 01:03:17,340
language now you've

3920
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:18,019
become part of the

3921
01:03:18,019 --> 01:03:19,000
language and you

3922
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:19,820
yourself have become

3923
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:20,500
part of the language

3924
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,019
how did you go about

3925
01:03:22,019 --> 01:03:22,860
that with your

3926
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:23,659
communication?

3927
01:03:23,659 --> 01:03:25,940
We love stories human

3928
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:27,219
beings love stories and

3929
01:03:27,219 --> 01:03:29,019
I you know I have

3930
01:03:29,019 --> 01:03:31,739
memories really strong

3931
01:03:31,739 --> 01:03:33,840
memories of growing up

3932
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,179
we had this couch and

3933
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:36,219
as a kid that literally

3934
01:03:36,219 --> 01:03:36,800
I don't know why we

3935
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,260
didn't get a big one

3936
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:38,559
but the family would

3937
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:39,840
squeeze onto it like we

3938
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,900
were just like the

3939
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:41,340
person in the middle

3940
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:41,760
would have to sit

3941
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:42,760
forward so that we

3942
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,019
could all and we

3943
01:03:45,019 --> 01:03:46,559
would squeeze onto

3944
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,260
this couch and we

3945
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:48,880
would watch Billy

3946
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:49,679
Connolly the comedian

3947
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:50,739
mum and dad just love

3948
01:03:50,739 --> 01:03:51,480
Billy Connolly so we

3949
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,420
all did and in our

3950
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:54,300
darkest times of my

3951
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,179
sister's mental illness

3952
01:03:55,179 --> 01:03:56,099
we'd put Billy Connolly

3953
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:57,340
on and I would be

3954
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:58,159
watching Billy Connolly

3955
01:03:58,159 --> 01:03:59,119
but I'd also be

3956
01:03:59,119 --> 01:03:59,900
watching mum and dad

3957
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:01,900
and just seeing just

3958
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:02,920
how happy he made

3959
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,519
them and how engaged

3960
01:04:04,519 --> 01:04:05,480
they were with him

3961
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,880
and when I started

3962
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,400
doing talks in

3963
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,139
schools I

3964
01:04:09,139 --> 01:04:10,380
unashamedly copied

3965
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,780
his style of like he

3966
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:12,699
was just story after

3967
01:04:12,699 --> 01:04:14,860
story after story and

3968
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:15,579
I'd try and make

3969
01:04:15,579 --> 01:04:16,340
them funny stories but

3970
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:17,659
just I'll say

3971
01:04:17,659 --> 01:04:18,440
emotionally engaging

3972
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,340
stories not all funny

3973
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:21,280
some were like my

3974
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,000
sister's story whatever

3975
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,119
it was be quite

3976
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:23,400
emotional but I'd be

3977
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,960
emotional but I tried

3978
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,920
to tell stories and

3979
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:26,780
what I noticed from

3980
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,039
doing you know four

3981
01:04:28,039 --> 01:04:28,860
or five talks a day

3982
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:30,460
for over 10 years

3983
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:32,039
people would go to

3984
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:32,780
my talks with a pen

3985
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:33,179
and paper because I

3986
01:04:33,179 --> 01:04:33,699
want to write stuff

3987
01:04:33,699 --> 01:04:35,460
down and the only

3988
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:36,019
time they'll write

3989
01:04:36,019 --> 01:04:36,639
stuff down was when

3990
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:37,219
I was saying here are

3991
01:04:37,219 --> 01:04:37,880
the statistics of

3992
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:38,599
mental health or here

3993
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:40,300
are the strategies but

3994
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:40,820
when I was telling a

3995
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:41,519
story they'd put the

3996
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:42,260
pen and paper down

3997
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:43,260
because we remember

3998
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,079
stories they're not

3999
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:44,739
going oh and his

4000
01:04:44,739 --> 01:04:46,000
sister was this age

4001
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:46,480
and then this happened

4002
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,039
to her because they

4003
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:48,039
will remember we

4004
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:48,980
remember stories we

4005
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:50,480
we love stories you

4006
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,719
know the only way I

4007
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:52,699
can get my daughter

4008
01:04:52,699 --> 01:04:53,400
to into bed is

4009
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:54,159
to say I'm going to

4010
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:54,900
tell you a story and

4011
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:55,380
I make up those

4012
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:57,059
stories for her that's

4013
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:57,920
and she just listens

4014
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:58,880
to they're the worst

4015
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,599
stories they're so

4016
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:00,480
boring because I've

4017
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,280
run out of ideas but

4018
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,139
she will listen to

4019
01:05:02,139 --> 01:05:03,579
them and she loves

4020
01:05:03,579 --> 01:05:05,099
them and we as

4021
01:05:05,099 --> 01:05:05,679
humans we love

4022
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:06,440
stories so we've

4023
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:07,199
always I've always

4024
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:08,739
said to anyone who

4025
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:09,659
works with us we've

4026
01:05:09,659 --> 01:05:10,320
now got I think

4027
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:10,719
there's about 10

4028
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:11,280
people who go out

4029
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:11,840
and present in

4030
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:12,760
schools or workplaces

4031
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,579
the majority of what

4032
01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:15,260
you say needs to be

4033
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:16,460
a story like it has

4034
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:17,280
to be a story that

4035
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,019
that that threads

4036
01:05:19,019 --> 01:05:20,099
them the whole way

4037
01:05:20,099 --> 01:05:21,059
through your hour in

4038
01:05:21,059 --> 01:05:21,900
front of people because

4039
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:22,760
that's what people

4040
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:23,400
listen to.

4041
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:23,940
That's what we

4042
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:25,699
respond to so I know

4043
01:05:25,699 --> 01:05:26,159
exactly what you

4044
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:26,599
mean when you say

4045
01:05:26,599 --> 01:05:27,659
the marketing the

4046
01:05:27,659 --> 01:05:28,860
marketing strategy or

4047
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:30,039
the the brands I

4048
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:31,199
know it it feels

4049
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:32,800
icky to me but if

4050
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,599
I was to say that

4051
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:35,139
the resilience project

4052
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,760
experience it's I

4053
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:37,840
hope people well I'll

4054
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,340
speak for me I hope

4055
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:39,900
when people hear me

4056
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:40,800
speak they feel like

4057
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,260
they've been at the

4058
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:43,179
pub holding a pint

4059
01:05:43,179 --> 01:05:43,980
listening to me talk

4060
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:44,860
or at a cafe with a

4061
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:46,059
coffee whatever their

4062
01:05:46,059 --> 01:05:46,820
reference point is

4063
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:48,260
that when you catch

4064
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:49,519
up with someone I

4065
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:49,940
don't really drink

4066
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:51,539
anymore but I have

4067
01:05:51,539 --> 01:05:52,659
the best memories of

4068
01:05:52,659 --> 01:05:53,320
standing at a

4069
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:53,400
pub and I

4070
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,579
have the beer in my

4071
01:05:54,579 --> 01:05:55,079
hand listening to

4072
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:55,679
people just tell

4073
01:05:55,679 --> 01:05:57,280
stories the most it's

4074
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,119
the it's the best

4075
01:05:58,119 --> 01:05:58,900
feeling and it's like

4076
01:05:58,900 --> 01:05:59,900
people take it in

4077
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:00,719
terms to tell stories

4078
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:02,159
and I don't know if

4079
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:02,760
you've noticed this but

4080
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,400
I reckon you know back

4081
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,260
in the day playing

4082
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:06,659
sport you could tell

4083
01:06:06,659 --> 01:06:07,119
a story you go for

4084
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:07,760
20 minutes and people

4085
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,360
stand over the pint

4086
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,360
listen these days I

4087
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,360
feel like when I go

4088
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:10,820
back to my career

4089
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:11,539
club now I feel like

4090
01:06:11,539 --> 01:06:12,219
my story's got a

4091
01:06:12,219 --> 01:06:13,119
maximum of 30 seconds

4092
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:13,679
before it will lose

4093
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:15,019
interest but it's

4094
01:06:15,019 --> 01:06:16,000
stories nonetheless and

4095
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,980
so I hope that a bit

4096
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:17,579
sidetracked here but

4097
01:06:17,579 --> 01:06:18,519
the people who hear

4098
01:06:18,519 --> 01:06:19,079
me or the resilience

4099
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:20,340
project speak I hope

4100
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:21,360
they don't feel like

4101
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:21,920
they've been lectured

4102
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:22,639
to I hope they don't

4103
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:23,320
feel like they're

4104
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,000
someone's trying to

4105
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:24,840
impart knowledge on

4106
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:25,599
them I hope someone's

4107
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,079
not trying to they

4108
01:06:27,079 --> 01:06:27,500
don't feel like they're

4109
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,440
watching a TED talk I

4110
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,019
hope they feel like

4111
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:30,320
they're at the pub or

4112
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,340
at a cafe just having a

4113
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:31,860
coffee with someone

4114
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:33,099
a relatable story it's

4115
01:06:33,099 --> 01:06:34,219
a it's a great message

4116
01:06:34,219 --> 01:06:35,000
the art of storytelling

4117
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,079
and for you to pick

4118
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,539
that up and you must

4119
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:38,139
have got pretty much

4120
01:06:38,139 --> 01:06:39,380
fit for four talks a

4121
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:41,059
day I had the stuff

4122
01:06:41,059 --> 01:06:42,800
that I I was so

4123
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,019
talking fit it was

4124
01:06:44,019 --> 01:06:45,559
just I could I could

4125
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:46,820
do a talk on anything

4126
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:49,480
at any point but now

4127
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,400
I've sort of stopped

4128
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,139
and pulled back and

4129
01:06:52,139 --> 01:06:53,300
it's I noticed that

4130
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,260
they're like I'm unfit

4131
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,280
I'm untalking fit it

4132
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,079
also takes me a while

4133
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,079
to get going but you

4134
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:57,880
understand it might be

4135
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:58,659
better than you than

4136
01:06:58,659 --> 01:06:59,320
you ever have done

4137
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,039
before how important

4138
01:07:00,039 --> 01:07:01,059
collaboration been for

4139
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:01,900
you and what you've

4140
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,199
done yeah it's a

4141
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:04,340
really interesting one

4142
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:05,599
yeah really important

4143
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,820
but I think it's a

4144
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:09,539
funny word for me

4145
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:12,260
because I never dared

4146
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:13,519
when I started

4147
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:14,039
resilience project

4148
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:14,559
asking anyone to

4149
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,159
collaborate because I

4150
01:07:15,159 --> 01:07:16,280
thought well a

4151
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,019
collaboration a

4152
01:07:17,019 --> 01:07:18,320
partnership has to

4153
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,420
benefit both people

4154
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:20,679
both parties have to

4155
01:07:20,679 --> 01:07:22,340
benefit from it and I

4156
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:22,739
think a lot of people

4157
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:23,880
will forget that and

4158
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:24,840
it's funny a lot of

4159
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:25,960
people who I love

4160
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:26,679
helping people out I

4161
01:07:26,679 --> 01:07:27,800
absolutely love it but

4162
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:28,380
I'll often get people

4163
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:29,019
saying how to start

4164
01:07:29,019 --> 01:07:30,400
this business it's a

4165
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,059
mental health we should

4166
01:07:31,059 --> 01:07:31,719
we should collaborate

4167
01:07:31,719 --> 01:07:32,559
with resilience project

4168
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:33,840
I'm like wow okay so I

4169
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,960
totally get why that's

4170
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:35,920
really good for you but

4171
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,539
if we're going to spend

4172
01:07:37,539 --> 01:07:38,260
all this time together

4173
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,519
like it needs to for a

4174
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:40,579
partnership it's just if

4175
01:07:40,579 --> 01:07:41,340
it's a proper

4176
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:42,400
collaboration partnership

4177
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,599
both parties have to

4178
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:44,079
feel like they're getting

4179
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:44,579
something from it

4180
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:46,380
otherwise I can help

4181
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:48,360
here because I want to

4182
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:48,940
help you and that's

4183
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:49,699
really good but I think

4184
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:50,320
after a while there

4185
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:50,780
might be a bit of

4186
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:52,119
resentment build and

4187
01:07:52,119 --> 01:07:52,679
resentment's an

4188
01:07:52,679 --> 01:07:53,539
awful feeling to have

4189
01:07:53,539 --> 01:07:54,320
towards anyone especially

4190
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,000
someone who's trying to

4191
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:55,559
do something really

4192
01:07:55,559 --> 01:07:56,219
good like they're

4193
01:07:56,219 --> 01:07:56,639
trying to do something

4194
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:57,920
in mental health so I

4195
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,760
think partnerships work

4196
01:07:58,760 --> 01:07:59,539
really well when you

4197
01:07:59,539 --> 01:08:00,860
have organizations who

4198
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:01,900
are a similar level of

4199
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:03,719
establishment yeah and

4200
01:08:03,719 --> 01:08:04,719
I don't want to I

4201
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:05,199
think I'm sounding a

4202
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:05,599
bit of an asshole

4203
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,300
saying this but I

4204
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:07,880
think a good

4205
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:08,800
collaboration is when

4206
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,079
both people both

4207
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:11,420
parties are benefiting

4208
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,099
so there's no

4209
01:08:12,099 --> 01:08:12,739
resentment at any

4210
01:08:12,739 --> 01:08:14,139
point and you're very

4211
01:08:14,139 --> 01:08:14,940
clear along the way

4212
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:17,000
so collaboration we

4213
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:17,939
have incredible

4214
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:18,939
partners at resilience

4215
01:08:18,939 --> 01:08:19,539
project our

4216
01:08:19,539 --> 01:08:20,479
collaboration with

4217
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:22,159
resilient youth who

4218
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:24,279
have surveyed now I

4219
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:25,300
think they survey about

4220
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:27,699
with us I think that's

4221
01:08:27,699 --> 01:08:28,479
I think every student

4222
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:29,300
who does our program

4223
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,579
has comprehensive

4224
01:08:30,579 --> 01:08:31,899
rigorous well-being

4225
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:32,720
assessments done

4226
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:33,380
throughout the year

4227
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,779
and we have the

4228
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:36,819
most incredible data

4229
01:08:36,819 --> 01:08:37,460
on the schools and

4230
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:38,119
the kids we work with

4231
01:08:38,119 --> 01:08:38,640
because of that

4232
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:39,899
collaboration when

4233
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:41,359
they first I don't

4234
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:41,840
know who approached

4235
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,659
her it was many

4236
01:08:42,659 --> 01:08:44,439
many years ago but

4237
01:08:44,439 --> 01:08:45,140
we'd both been in

4238
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:45,779
industry for about

4239
01:08:45,779 --> 01:08:46,420
the same time we

4240
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:47,079
both had similar

4241
01:08:47,079 --> 01:08:47,779
runs on the board

4242
01:08:47,779 --> 01:08:49,180
and it's just been

4243
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:49,880
this really great

4244
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,460
marriage product

4245
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,020
dynamics it's

4246
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:53,760
the number one

4247
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,859
school diary company

4248
01:08:54,859 --> 01:08:55,420
in Australia so they

4249
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:56,359
provide school diaries

4250
01:08:56,359 --> 01:08:58,779
this lovely girl who

4251
01:08:58,779 --> 01:08:59,680
works at Anushka

4252
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:00,500
said to me once

4253
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,359
she was at a

4254
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:02,939
conference I was at

4255
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:03,420
and she said we

4256
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:04,300
provide diaries to

4257
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:05,460
similar amount of

4258
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:05,939
schools that you

4259
01:09:05,939 --> 01:09:06,619
go and do talks at

4260
01:09:06,619 --> 01:09:07,399
and she said we

4261
01:09:07,399 --> 01:09:08,140
could do something

4262
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:08,819
together like we

4263
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:09,220
could have your

4264
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:09,699
stuff in our

4265
01:09:09,699 --> 01:09:11,439
diaries you could

4266
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:12,180
reach more people

4267
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:13,260
it'll make our

4268
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:13,760
diaries better

4269
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,619
and they now do

4270
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:17,500
every school does

4271
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,819
our curriculum if

4272
01:09:18,819 --> 01:09:19,180
you work with us

4273
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:19,479
you do the

4274
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:20,220
curriculum and

4275
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:21,659
it's you know it's

4276
01:09:21,659 --> 01:09:22,079
like I don't know

4277
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:22,140
how many people

4278
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:22,619
how many kids but

4279
01:09:22,619 --> 01:09:23,840
it's that's like

4280
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,239
probably close to

4281
01:09:25,239 --> 01:09:25,739
three or four hundred

4282
01:09:25,739 --> 01:09:26,420
thousand kids doing

4283
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:27,039
it every single day

4284
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:27,920
and they've got the

4285
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:28,500
product dynamic

4286
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,939
diary so there's

4287
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:31,239
great collaboration

4288
01:09:31,239 --> 01:09:31,859
and partnership with

4289
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:32,420
them I think

4290
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,340
it's not to

4291
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:34,939
discourage people

4292
01:09:34,939 --> 01:09:35,680
from reaching out

4293
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:36,020
to people that

4294
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:36,539
look up to me to

4295
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:37,600
say hey like I

4296
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,020
love what you're

4297
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:39,560
doing I just think

4298
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:40,359
the best partnerships

4299
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:41,319
in my experience

4300
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:42,140
are the ones where

4301
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:42,739
you're both

4302
01:09:42,739 --> 01:09:43,180
benefiting

4303
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:44,039
it's a great way

4304
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:44,699
to explain and I

4305
01:09:44,699 --> 01:09:45,739
think it everything

4306
01:09:45,739 --> 01:09:46,500
finds its level

4307
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:47,500
yes and you get

4308
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,159
in trouble when

4309
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,100
you're not isn't

4310
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:49,600
as you said it's

4311
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,439
great to try and be

4312
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:51,140
aspirational and

4313
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:52,060
that's different

4314
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:52,460
isn't it maybe

4315
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:52,960
reaching out for

4316
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:53,560
someone for some

4317
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,380
advice but

4318
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:55,239
collaborations do

4319
01:09:55,239 --> 01:09:55,899
work whenever and

4320
01:09:55,899 --> 01:09:57,319
almost benefit equally

4321
01:09:57,319 --> 01:09:58,539
yes the more equal

4322
01:09:58,539 --> 01:09:59,220
it is the better the

4323
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,020
collaboration most

4324
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:00,720
times isn't it

4325
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,600
it's a bit like you

4326
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,159
and Ryan Sheldon on

4327
01:10:03,159 --> 01:10:03,760
is a great

4328
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:04,979
collaboration probably

4329
01:10:04,979 --> 01:10:05,619
because at the right

4330
01:10:05,619 --> 01:10:06,539
time you know if

4331
01:10:06,539 --> 01:10:07,000
you had gone to

4332
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:07,680
Hamish and said I

4333
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,079
want to start a

4334
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:09,600
podcast that maybe

4335
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,300
wasn't

4336
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:11,020
it's that yeah

4337
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:11,880
that's great for me

4338
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,939
great for everyone

4339
01:10:13,939 --> 01:10:15,300
who wants to do a

4340
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,199
podcast but

4341
01:10:16,199 --> 01:10:17,100
yeah that is

4342
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:18,060
actually the perfect

4343
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:19,079
example I feel like

4344
01:10:19,079 --> 01:10:20,520
Ryan had so many

4345
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,239
runs on the board

4346
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:22,000
in the

4347
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:22,840
comedy space

4348
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:23,880
wasn't doing a

4349
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:24,720
podcast I feel like

4350
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,260
I had a few runs

4351
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:25,859
on the board with

4352
01:10:25,859 --> 01:10:27,039
mental health space

4353
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:28,420
and storytelling and

4354
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:29,880
my brother Josh who

4355
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,060
was in it from day

4356
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:31,699
one as our tech

4357
01:10:31,699 --> 01:10:32,359
support person

4358
01:10:32,359 --> 01:10:32,880
started the tech

4359
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,439
support person he

4360
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:35,039
had so many runs

4361
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:35,659
on the board as

4362
01:10:35,659 --> 01:10:36,600
someone who told

4363
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,180
stories through

4364
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:37,880
videography and

4365
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:38,760
creating ads and

4366
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,039
stories for

4367
01:10:40,039 --> 01:10:42,159
organizations and

4368
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:42,939
we came together

4369
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:43,800
with like yeah I

4370
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,039
think we can and

4371
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:45,619
then Bridget comes

4372
01:10:45,619 --> 01:10:46,399
to us who has

4373
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:47,199
been producing

4374
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:48,060
Masterchef she's

4375
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:48,760
producing your

4376
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,300
shows producing

4377
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,239
radio for 10

4378
01:10:51,239 --> 01:10:51,760
years and

4379
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,300
similar level of

4380
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:53,979
experience we all

4381
01:10:53,979 --> 01:10:54,420
brought different

4382
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:55,079
stuff to the table

4383
01:10:55,079 --> 01:10:56,579
and it's a great

4384
01:10:56,579 --> 01:10:57,800
I mean I feel like

4385
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,500
our podcast works

4386
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,000
because I can talk

4387
01:10:59,000 --> 01:10:59,720
about heavy stuff

4388
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,000
and Ryan can take

4389
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:01,600
the piss out of me

4390
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,460
straight away and

4391
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:03,720
it's accessible to

4392
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,479
anyone because of

4393
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:06,039
that so that is a

4394
01:11:06,039 --> 01:11:06,819
really nice example

4395
01:11:06,819 --> 01:11:07,359
of a collaboration

4396
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:09,460
it's such a good

4397
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:09,939
example like I

4398
01:11:09,939 --> 01:11:10,800
wouldn't go to the

4399
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,579
best podcaster in

4400
01:11:11,579 --> 01:11:12,819
Australia and go

4401
01:11:12,819 --> 01:11:13,260
hey we should

4402
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:13,899
collaborate because

4403
01:11:13,899 --> 01:11:14,680
it's like well mate

4404
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:15,159
yeah I can see

4405
01:11:15,159 --> 01:11:15,800
that's great for

4406
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,220
you what am I

4407
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,539
getting like so

4408
01:11:18,539 --> 01:11:19,539
it's a great example

4409
01:11:19,539 --> 01:11:20,319
who's been the

4410
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:20,880
greatest leader in

4411
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:21,239
your life

4412
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,899
oh my gosh it's a

4413
01:11:23,899 --> 01:11:24,859
very cliche answer

4414
01:11:24,859 --> 01:11:25,560
but mum and dad

4415
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,680
mum and dad would

4416
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:27,500
be that for me

4417
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,579
I mean the best

4418
01:11:28,579 --> 01:11:28,979
leader I've ever

4419
01:11:28,979 --> 01:11:29,399
worked with is

4420
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:29,859
Billy Slater

4421
01:11:29,859 --> 01:11:31,100
we did a whole

4422
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:32,579
episode on his

4423
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:33,159
leadership on the

4424
01:11:33,159 --> 01:11:33,880
Imperfects that came

4425
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:34,399
out a few weeks

4426
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,239
ago he's the best

4427
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:36,840
leader I've ever

4428
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:37,680
seen and I've never

4429
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:38,359
seen anything like

4430
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:39,460
it and I'm happy

4431
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:39,859
to come back and

4432
01:11:39,859 --> 01:11:40,680
do a whole series

4433
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:41,439
on him if you'd

4434
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:42,279
like because he

4435
01:11:42,279 --> 01:11:43,100
is extraordinary

4436
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,260
but leadership in

4437
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:46,260

4438
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,060

4439
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:47,880

4440
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:48,920

4441
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:49,439
me stuff from a

4442
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:51,100
young age I'm not

4443
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:51,920

4444
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:52,520

mates in year 8

4452
01:11:56,939 --> 01:11:58,960

4453
01:11:58,960 --> 01:11:59,960
to stand up for

4454
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:00,600
what I believe in

4455
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,600
like he just did

4456
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,020
that from a young

4457
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:03,100
age and I was

4458
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:03,699

4459
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:05,060

4463
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:09,300
Tim Collins who

4464
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,579
he was such a

4465
01:12:10,579 --> 01:12:11,359
great listener and

4466
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:12,000
he would ask when

4467
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:12,560
he's 20 he taught

4468
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:13,000

4469
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:13,659
conversations with

4470
01:12:13,659 --> 01:12:14,600
adults he just

4471
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,000
asked so many

4472
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:15,619
questions he still

4473
01:12:15,619 --> 01:12:16,279
does the weirdest

4474
01:12:16,279 --> 01:12:16,899
questions but he's

4475
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:17,260
still asking

4476
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:19,579
questions Dolly

4477
01:12:19,579 --> 01:12:20,239

4478
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:21,859
mates who who

01:12:22,539 --> 01:12:23,520
me how to be a

4481
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,439
loyal friend Luke

4482
01:12:24,439 --> 01:12:25,000
North one of my

4483
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:25,560
really good mates

4484
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,039
who taught me

4485
01:12:26,039 --> 01:12:27,659
about confidence

4486
01:12:27,659 --> 01:12:28,819
like believing in

4487
01:12:28,819 --> 01:12:29,859
yourself it helped

4488
01:12:29,859 --> 01:12:30,439
he's still the most

4489
01:12:30,439 --> 01:12:30,939
beautiful man I've

4490
01:12:30,939 --> 01:12:31,760
ever seen but like

4491
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,840
you know just mates

4492
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,539
like friends of

4493
01:12:34,539 --> 01:12:35,359
mine great leaders

4494
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:36,800
I'm fascinated by

4495
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:37,500
that answer I love

4496
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,319
it it's like you're

4497
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:39,079
picking out the

4498
01:12:39,079 --> 01:12:39,960
things that you

4499
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,380
have got from your

4500
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:42,420
great people in the

4501
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:43,300
world and it's nice

4502
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:43,920
to go back and

4503
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,460
acknowledge that

4504
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:45,119
isn't it that I'm

4505
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:45,699
a better person

4506
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:46,640
because we often

4507
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,239
say that you're

4508
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:48,899
some of the five

4509
01:12:48,899 --> 01:12:49,340
people you spend

4510
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:50,060
the most time with

4511
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:50,699
and I believe that

4512
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:51,800
I think you've just

4513
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,600
articulated that

4514
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,199
do I haven't done

4515
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:53,819
I've never actually

4516
01:12:53,819 --> 01:12:55,039
told that to them

4517
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:55,899
to them that's my

4518
01:12:55,899 --> 01:12:56,600
next I have to do

4519
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:57,100
that I'll give

4520
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:57,859
myself a month I

4521
01:12:57,859 --> 01:12:58,439
need to start to

4522
01:12:58,439 --> 01:12:58,659
them

4523
01:12:58,659 --> 01:13:00,439
we'll get him

4524
01:13:00,439 --> 01:13:00,979
you

4525
01:13:00,979 --> 01:13:02,060
mom and dad very

4526
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:02,619
quickly I just have

4527
01:13:02,619 --> 01:13:03,539
to I've started with

4528
01:13:03,539 --> 01:13:04,119
them so just to

4529
01:13:04,119 --> 01:13:04,699
elaborate on that I

4530
01:13:04,699 --> 01:13:05,840
mean my dad I've

4531
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:06,359
never met a more

4532
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:07,500
humble person that

4533
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,560
to me is that's one

4534
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:09,140
of the values the

4535
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:09,640
resilience project

4536
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:10,220
that was like my

4537
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,359
absolute when we

4538
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:12,079
first did that was

4539
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:12,720
like that's it I

4540
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:13,119
don't we're not

4541
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:13,880
discussing it that's

4542
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,260
humility that is

4543
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:15,859
it's we're a humble

4544
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:18,159
group and mom mom

4545
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:19,279
is just so mom's a

4546
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:19,939
great storyteller

4547
01:13:19,939 --> 01:13:21,779
herself I love the

4548
01:13:21,779 --> 01:13:23,460
stories and she's

4549
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:24,039
just so fiercely

4550
01:13:24,039 --> 01:13:26,659
loyal and loves you

4551
01:13:26,659 --> 01:13:27,399
know her version of

4552
01:13:27,399 --> 01:13:28,239
how to love someone

4553
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:30,260
is like I hope my

4554
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:33,039
kids feel loved

4555
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:33,779
from me the same

4556
01:13:33,779 --> 01:13:34,500
way that I feel

4557
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,159
from mom that's

4558
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:35,640
what I really hope

4559
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,460
and that I mean

4560
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:37,060
that's the most

4561
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:37,819
important relationships

4562
01:13:37,819 --> 01:13:38,640
in my life and my

4563
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,060
mom and dad have

4564
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:40,539
taught me how to

4565
01:13:40,539 --> 01:13:41,100
mom and dad have

4566
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:41,539
taught me how to

4567
01:13:41,539 --> 01:13:43,020
be in this stage

4568
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:43,479
of my life now

4569
01:13:43,479 --> 01:13:44,000
which is the most

4570
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:44,720
important stage of

4571
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:45,560
my life so you

4572
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,199
have to say they're

4573
01:13:46,199 --> 01:13:46,779
the most important

4574
01:13:46,779 --> 01:13:47,479
leaders in my life

4575
01:13:47,479 --> 01:13:48,319
and I love asking

4576
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:49,039
that question because

4577
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:50,279
it's it's I love

4578
01:13:50,279 --> 01:13:51,180
that goes out into

4579
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:53,000
into the air and

4580
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:53,899
and hopefully they

4581
01:13:53,899 --> 01:13:54,720
get to hear that

4582
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:55,479
because it's something

4583
01:13:55,479 --> 01:13:56,800
that we probably

4584
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:57,460
don't spend enough

4585
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:58,220
time doing I'll

4586
01:13:58,220 --> 01:13:58,840
clip it up for them

4587
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,539
we'll send it out

4588
01:14:00,539 --> 01:14:02,640
we're a bit obsessed

4589
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,539
with collaboration as

4590
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:04,520
you know from the

4591
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,439
leader program we've

4592
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:05,960
loved having you

4593
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:06,779
in it and and

4594
01:14:06,779 --> 01:14:08,500
you've got access to

4595
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,140
be able to do that

4596
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:09,739
in so many different

4597
01:14:09,739 --> 01:14:10,340
areas and I love

4598
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:11,479
you know you turn

4599
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:12,260
up you know trying

4600
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:12,840
to break a national

4601
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:13,760
running record you

4602
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:14,960
start a podcast and

4603
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:15,720
you've got friendships

4604
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,060
and such an

4605
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:18,119
interesting life but

4606
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:18,800
if you thought god

4607
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,220
for this passion in

4608
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:21,060
my life I love

4609
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:21,979
to collaborate with

4610
01:14:21,979 --> 01:14:23,079
someone is there a

4611
01:14:23,079 --> 01:14:23,800
name that springs to

4612
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:24,539
mind in any of the

4613
01:14:24,539 --> 01:14:25,479
areas that you're

4614
01:14:25,479 --> 01:14:26,260
passionate about

4615
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:27,539
what a great question

4616
01:14:27,539 --> 01:14:30,060
so I mean I have

4617
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:30,779
to say like when

4618
01:14:30,779 --> 01:14:31,140
you asked about

4619
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:31,680
collaboration before

4620
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,380
I feel like I went

4621
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:32,800
with a negative

4622
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,500
straight away as in

4623
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:34,479
like here's what

4624
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:35,720
doesn't work yeah

4625
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:36,340
I mean collaboration

4626
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:37,079
has led to all the

4627
01:14:37,079 --> 01:14:38,199
best things in my

4628
01:14:38,199 --> 01:14:39,279
life really like it

4629
01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:40,239
really has so it's

4630
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:43,220
a it's it's good

4631
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:43,619
good good

4632
01:14:43,619 --> 01:14:44,300
collaborations are

4633
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,600
everything gosh

4634
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,119
who do I collaborate

4635
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:47,039
with the most um

4636
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:48,020
I don't really know

4637
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,020
who I am right now

4638
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:49,479
I don't really know

4639
01:14:49,479 --> 01:14:51,020
what I like I know

4640
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:51,739
I do this podcast

4641
01:14:51,739 --> 01:14:53,760
which reaches a few

4642
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:54,319
people but then the

4643
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:55,319
resilience project it

4644
01:14:55,319 --> 01:14:55,739
does something very

4645
01:14:55,739 --> 01:14:58,659
different sort of so

4646
01:14:58,659 --> 01:14:59,140
it's like I don't

4647
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:01,279
really know I don't

4648
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:01,560
know how to answer

4649
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,020
that question I'm

4650
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:02,479
still trying to work

4651
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:03,380
out what exactly it

4652
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:05,100
is that I do to

4653
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,000
then go right so

4654
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:06,699
who else is doing

4655
01:15:06,699 --> 01:15:07,140
that I heard I

4656
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:07,640
collaborate with

4657
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,300
but my hero is

4658
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,140
Billy Connolly he is

4659
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:11,500
my absolute hero so

4660
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:12,279
the lazy way of

4661
01:15:12,279 --> 01:15:12,819
answering a question

4662
01:15:12,819 --> 01:15:13,960
is like he's the

4663
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:14,539
person I'd like to

4664
01:15:14,539 --> 01:15:15,260
interview most on our

4665
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,119
podcast and I don't

4666
01:15:16,119 --> 01:15:16,460
think we'll ever get

4667
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:17,000
the chance I know

4668
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:17,600
he's very unwell

4669
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,380
yeah but I mean he

4670
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:20,140
taught me nine

4671
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:21,779
tenths of my job

4672
01:15:21,779 --> 01:15:23,079
really he really did

4673
01:15:23,079 --> 01:15:24,579
and I don't know if

4674
01:15:24,579 --> 01:15:25,039
doing an interview

4675
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:25,479
with someone is

4676
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:26,119
collaborating I don't

4677
01:15:26,119 --> 01:15:26,779
know if it's a

4678
01:15:26,779 --> 01:15:27,420
collaboration I think

4679
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:28,020
it probably is when

4680
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:28,520
you reach a lot of

4681
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:29,880
people after you

4682
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:30,359
Darce probably

4683
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:31,140
Billy Connolly

4684
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:33,600
I was waiting for

4685
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,319
that mate I was

4686
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:35,020

4688
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:37,479
