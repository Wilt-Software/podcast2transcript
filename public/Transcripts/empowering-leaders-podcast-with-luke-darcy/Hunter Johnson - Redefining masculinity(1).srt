1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,320
a listener production. I generally enjoy this week's conversation on the Empowering Leaders

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,079
podcast. It's with the founder of the Man Cave, Hunter Johnson. The Man Cave is an incredible

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,100
not-for-profit that's changing the lives of young men around Australia. And you'll hear this right

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,920
throughout the conversation with Hunter, but I think it's their mission statement that says it

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,280
all. We're here to empower boys to become great men by providing them and their communities with

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:36,020
impactful programs, role models, and resources. The Man Cave is truly an incredible organisation.

7
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,740
Hunter has impacted tens of thousands of boys since the Man Cave was founded in 2016. It's a

8
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:48,520
conversation that I thought was remarkable, one I really loved and was inspired by as a father of

9
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,219
four to see the impact Hunter has right around Australia, but also around the world. He's been

10
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:59,939
recognised with awards and grants to support the organisation, the Man Cave. Maybe the ultimate

11
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:00,259
record.

12
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,500
Perhaps of meeting the Queen and collaborating with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle,

13
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:10,980
which is a really amazing story. Social ventures like the Man Cave and people like Hunter Johnson

14
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,719
who are involved in this space are really linked to the passion of mine and something that we are

15
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:21,719
exploring at Alita, an organisation founded with my great mate, Matt Wadowitz, where incredible

16
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:27,299
leaders come together to collaborate and learn from each other and open up about the world that

17
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,219
they share and sharing great learning and leading experiences.

18
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,739
If you're interested in this space, you can find it all at alitacollective.com. There are some

19
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:41,760
fantastic resources there. I would encourage you to check out our signature Alita Connect program

20
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:48,180
to get started and to understand how, like Hunter and the people at Man Cave, you're leading in your

21
00:01:48,180 --> 00:02:03,750
world. Hunter Johnson is driven by a lifelong passion for social change through seeing the

22
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,789
impact of mental illness and domestic violence. He saw the need to work with young men at a

23
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,430
preventative level, empowering them to be able to do what they love. He saw the need to work with

24
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:16,389
themselves, their relationships and their community. Hunter co-founded the Man Cave in 2014

25
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:21,990
and has positively impacted tens of thousands of boys, parents and teachers across Australia

26
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:27,469
with programs that allow young men to explore and express their full humanity. The vision of the Man

27
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:32,050
Cave is to support a world in which every man has healthy relationships, contributes to his community

28
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,490
and reaches his full potential through empowering boys to become great men by providing them with

29
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,409
impactful programs, role models and resources.

30
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,550
Hunter, congratulations on the incredible work you do. You literally have changed the lives of

31
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:50,750
tens of thousands of young boys, turning them into healthy adults. Can I ask, where did that

32
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,830
passion and drive come from within you? Yeah, thanks. Well, first of all, it's so good to be

33
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:59,669
here and hang out. I've been looking forward to this for a while and excited to just unravel with

34
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:05,449
you. Great, mate. The passion, listen, I grew up in a family environment that, you know, I think

35
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:10,129
encouraged me to be useful and get up to something that matters. And I definitely

36
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,909
held against that for as long as possible and probably used my leadership abilities for

37
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:21,490
entertainment purposes more than anything else. And yeah, but I think it's one of those things

38
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,590
around family values as I got older and had more experiences and recognized what's important to me.

39
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:31,909
I just started to discover that I wanted to make a difference and I didn't necessarily know how to

40
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:36,870
at the beginning, but I just tried a bunch of things. And for me, it was, yeah, a pretty

41
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,409
important lesson that my grandfather really instilled in me, which was to,

42
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,169
you know, invest in experiences. And I think the amount of different experiences, one of the

43
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:49,150
things I've committed to doing every single year is to invest in a life-changing experience

44
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,870
and something that's off-brand for me. So something I would never do. So one year I did a,

45
00:03:53,949 --> 00:04:00,969
I'm still cringing, did a stand-up comedy course at NIDA. And I'm not like a funny guy. It's not

46
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:04,830
like, you know, and I remember sitting there at the like original circle where everyone's talking

47
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,569
about why they're at this course and people like, you know, I'm really funny. And this person's like,

48
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:10,409
I've always wanted to be a comedian. And I'm like,

49
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,750
everything, my identity is telling me not to be here. I'm shitting myself, but I figured I'd

50
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,790
learn something. So I think through investing in different experiences, I got to discover what I

51
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,970
am really passionate about. And for me, that's really at this point in my life, supporting boys

52
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:29,129
on their journey into manhood, because I know it's not just about young men having a good life

53
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:33,569
themselves. It's their relationships, it's their communities and who they'll be in the world that

54
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:37,829
we engage with. I love that advice from your grandfather, invest in experiences. And it's

55
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:40,410
often, you know, we're quite often happy to spend time with people who are not as good as we are.

56
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,610
We spend money on things that don't mean a lot, but we are reluctant sometimes, aren't we,

57
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:48,850
to do something like you said. I mean, that's a pretty brave experience. But, and then I want

58
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,269
to go back to what you said before about you grew up in a family where it was expected that you were

59
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:57,050
going to do good. Can you break that down a bit for me? What was that like? You just felt growing

60
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,329
up that, hey, you need to find purpose in your life. How was that come across to you?

61
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,850
Yeah. So I guess I originally thought I was going to play professional sport. Like that,

62
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:10,329
I grew up in Sydney, so rugby was what I loved. And I built my

63
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,990
identity around that. Had a really serious life and life-threatening injury on the field when I

64
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,889
was about 16. And that was in retrospect, the worst, but also the best thing that ever happened

65
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:26,470
to me. And it kind of slowed me down off a path that I think I was heading down. And I definitely

66
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,430
wasn't being myself. You know, I was trying to just fit in with my mates and just play into a

67
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,310
lot of the boyish behavior, which I'm sure we're both familiar with at certain times. But yeah,

68
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,709
I think, you know, my dad is a psychologist,

69
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:43,170
so he's done a lot of work in high performance and high performing teams.

70
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:48,990
And my mom is an entrepreneur. She does a lot of work in artificial intelligence and now how

71
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,269
artificial intelligence and consciousness relate, which is, that's a whole other podcast in and of

72
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:58,170
itself. They split up when I was like two years old. So I kind of grew up with two different

73
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:03,389
worlds, but I think just the environment that my family created of being people who just

74
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:08,250
challenged the system and wanted to create a better world subtly just impacted me.

75
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,550
And then when I started to,

76
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:14,829
pop out of my education at school, I was like, right, what do I want to do? And, you know, for me,

77
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,970
it was going and working at places like the National Center of Indigenous Excellence in

78
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:24,689
Sydney. And again, it just blew my world open. I got to see, you know, my privilege, my whiteness,

79
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,430
the opportunity I've had. And then that just opened doors for me to realize that,

80
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,569
okay, I've got all these gifts. I do come from a background that, you know, as a white,

81
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:38,189
you know, sporty guy, that means I can move through the world and do certain things that

82
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,670
other people can't. Okay.

83
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:44,209
How am I going to put that to use? And that really opened up for me when I moved down to

84
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:48,250
Melbourne when I was about 21. And I started working at an organization called the Foundation

85
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,250
for Young Australians. And within two weeks, I was helping run indigenous leadership programs

86
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:58,589
in the Northern Territory, running an employment program for young asylum seekers and refugees

87
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:02,829
who'd just entered Australia to then learning about partnerships and business development.

88
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:07,550
And that's where it really opened up for me. And I worked out that doing well financially

89
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,250
and doing good socially,

90
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:13,389
and not mutually exclusive. And I think that's a really exciting thing that, you know,

91
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,990
I can get paid to make an impact in this world, not just be about making more and more and more

92
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,589
money. So that's kind of, I guess, the essence. And then really, it's just the power of the work

93
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:27,170
now, you know, getting to have authentic, beautiful conversations with teenage boys and

94
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:32,310
just seeing that, how much it changes their life. I'm like, oh, that's all the reward I need now.

95
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:36,110
And I love that path, isn't it? Because, you know, so much of what we're told at school,

96
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,670
and you'd be at the coalface of this is that, what do you want to be? And,

97
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:44,209
pick your path and your ATAR is so important. But you look at you sampling a range of different

98
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:47,449
things, you know, living the advice that your grandfather told, and that there's a fair bit of

99
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:51,610
diversity in that. And suddenly you've just stumbled across the essence of what you are

100
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,509
and to be able to turn that passion into something for good. And I love what you said at the end

101
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:58,889
there as well, Hunter, because I think there's this thing that a lot of us want to do good,

102
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,509
but we have our own families and we think, God, how am I going to support my family,

103
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:09,250
run a social venture or contribute in the meaningful way that you are? And you're saying

104
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:09,689
they're not mutually exclusive, but you're saying they're not mutually exclusive.

105
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:14,449
That you can earn and still live a good life and contribute at the same time. You've been

106
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:17,529
able to strike that balance? Yeah, I think it's independent to

107
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:22,610
people's own personality types and, you know, career ambitions, of course, you know, but I'm

108
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,389
probably one of those, I guess, the next generation coming through that, you know,

109
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:32,009
wants to create a better world. And I think, you know, for me, using a business mindset or

110
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:36,070
commercial mindset to solve social problems is really interesting. I'm like, well, that's a

111
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,909
good challenge I want to sink my teeth into. And yeah, I also think we've kind of grown up in this

112
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:46,690
like very Western context, which is like accumulate more or like the way to win the game is individual

113
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,049
success, you know, but I've just sat in enough rooms with, you know, some of the, you know,

114
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,529
very fortunately sat in enough rooms with some of the wealthiest people in this country. And I go,

115
00:08:54,889 --> 00:09:00,450
oh, they don't have anything that you and I don't. And actually external validation is never going

116
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,750
to be the thing that fulfills you like internal validation does. And I think I was just really

117
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,850
lucky to see that.

118
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:11,789
In my early twenties. And it just came back to like, what is purpose? You know, what is my

119
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:16,850
purpose? How do I support others in fighting their purpose? And I think it's really service

120
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,649
is the gateway to that. It's like the best way to work out more of who you are because it's not

121
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:27,330
about you. Yeah, really profound thing for you to understand at such a young age. And, you know,

122
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,210
a lot of us never get there. So the fact that you've been able to dedicate, I want to dive into

123
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:35,110
that passion a little bit. I hear you talk a lot about, we've got to stop having conversations

124
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,049
about boys and girls. And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point.

125
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,169
And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's

126
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:36,210
a really good point. And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point.

127
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:41,549
And start having more conversations with these young men. And I know you're, you're really across

128
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:46,870
the, um, what I think is a national disgrace, the domestic violence stats and ever increasing in

129
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:51,149
recent time, you're really big about changing this narrative. Can you tell us, you know,

130
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,950
how you're going to go about solving it in your world? Yeah, well, let's just start with the stats

131
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:01,049
just so we got the baseline there. So it's, you know, one in three women is likely to experience

132
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:06,009
physical or sexual abuse in their lifetime. And then more than one woman every week in a

133
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:12,450
is killed through intimate male partner violence. And it's just crazy. Like we're in Australia,

134
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:17,789
like what is going on? And I think for me, that's, there's like a sense of like,

135
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:23,669
almost not like a duty, but a responsibility. And I think we talked about this recently around,

136
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,730
like, this isn't just for us. This is for our kids, kids, you know, like, how do we start

137
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:32,769
thinking through that mindset? And for me, yeah, I just say often, you know, when I hear the terms,

138
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:35,929
even toxic masculinity, I don't use that personally. I just feel like,

139
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:41,470
it's too divisive. But what I do think of is intergenerational trauma. You know, a lot of the

140
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:46,649
world, particularly in Australian, white Australian context, the men who have gone away to war,

141
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,509
you know, World War II and beyond, come back to Australia to integrate, carrying extreme levels

142
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:56,309
of trauma. And then that becomes how they parent, that becomes who they are in their workplaces.

143
00:10:56,509 --> 00:11:01,789
That then is, you know, sometimes consciously and unconsciously transmissioned onto their kids.

144
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:05,690
And then their kids grow up with that as a model of masculinity, right? And I just think we're at

145
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:11,590
a time where we're, you know, a mythologist who I love, a guy called Michael Mead, talks about,

146
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:16,809
we're in between stories. So what was, you know, the model of masculinity for, you know, our fathers

147
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:21,190
or grandfather's generation is different to us now. Something new is being required, but we're

148
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,090
kind of discovering, it's kind of, we're alive, you know, like this is an active conversation.

149
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:30,429
And I think it's like, we just got to keep bringing it to the surface and have the space to have

150
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:34,929
really messy, politically incorrect conversations, because it's the only way we're going to learn.

151
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:36,049
And I think, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

152
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:40,129
you know, whether it is the systems around domestic violence, gender equality, or mental

153
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:46,830
illness, so much funding, so much funding goes to crisis management. And I'm like, why don't we go

154
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:52,769
preventative? Why don't we go and focus on boys' strengths rather than their deficits? That is

155
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:58,009
going to create a very different future for these young men who feel inspired and hopeful, opposed

156
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:01,389
to growing up with a narrative that they're all bad and wrong and they need to be fixed.

157
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:04,909
I want to come back to that term toxic masculinity, get your thoughts on that.

158
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:09,129
But I think you sum it up really well, and it resonates incredibly strongly with me. And,

159
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:13,210
you know, without, you know, having to get too deep into the political world, crisis

160
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,230
is where funding goes, because it gets the most attention, it gets the headlines.

161
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:22,149
But as we know, it's the sugar hit for the short term. It's important too, when people are in

162
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:27,110
crisis, we need to support them. But that early intervention, preventative programs that are a

163
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,710
generational change, what you're talking about is getting to 12 and 13 year olds, giving them

164
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,889
better language, understanding them better. And, and the evidence, the evidence, the evidence, the

165
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:39,549
evidence is when you do, are you seeing meaningful change when you get in with a man cave into

166
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:43,990
schools and run those programs? Yeah, absolutely. I think, you know, just on that, we learn from

167
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:50,830
people we respect. And I think for us, the model is using super diverse, very relatable male

168
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:56,330
facilitators who go into high schools across the country. And they're like that cooler cousin that

169
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,590
your family get together, you know, who you just want to sit next to, and you just want them to

170
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:04,429
ask you how you're going, you know? And, and I think the lesson that we've found, particularly

171
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:09,090
boys who have grown up in a really confusing time of masculinity, where it's, you know, toughen up,

172
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:13,450
don't cry, don't be gay, don't be like a girl. But now it's like, cry more often, be more vulnerable,

173
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,149
you know, you're privileged, you've had it so good for so long, you're part of the patriarchy.

174
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:21,929
You know, as for men, we're like, fuck, how do we even navigate this? You know, let alone teenage

175
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:26,929
boys and everything else that's going on, plus social media. So our whole thing is, you know,

176
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,889
finding people who these boys are inspired by, and they want to be like, and the lesson there

177
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:36,590
that we found is often the messenger is as important, if not more important than the message,

178
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:40,710
which is a really different way to how teaching is traditionally done. And so for us, we've now

179
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:46,950
worked with, you know, 30,000, probably 35,000 young men across the country, and it's growing

180
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:52,230
huge demand. And the whole thing for us is creating spaces of psychological safety for

181
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,350
these boys where they feel probably for the first time in their life, safe enough to take off the

182
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:00,830
mask they're wearing and start to open up and sit opposite their best mate and be like, this bloke's

183
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,870
been my best mate for five years. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's

184
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:07,169
just learned more about him in five minutes than five years of our friendship. And what we're now

185
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:11,330
starting to see as these boys are developing levels of emotional literacy, they're able to

186
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:15,669
take responsibility for their behavior. And suddenly they're not living into the script

187
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:19,870
that the media writes for them, which is young men are a problem to be solved. And that's the

188
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,870
scary thing I think is like often the stories we're told are what we become, and it kind of

189
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,830
becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. And so what we're really trying to do is like create this

190
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:31,870
positive future state for masculinity that men can get around, women can get around, and men can get

191
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,409
around, non-binary people can get around. And it's inspiring because that's just not a public

192
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,610
narrative that's out there right now. Yeah. It's interesting to hear, I mean,

193
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:45,850
sum that up incredibly well, just how confusing it is. The needle goes from one extreme to the

194
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:51,649
other extreme. And as you said, for 47-year-old adults, it's confusing. It's challenging.

195
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:57,129
You're nervous now with a microphone in front of you, not that you intend to say something that's

196
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:01,850
going to upset anyone, but it's so nuanced now that you're almost going to be like,

197
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:07,250
are you lucky to get through without trying to upset people? That's how delicate it seems it's

198
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:12,250
become. But fascinating to hear you say that it's more powerful is actually the messenger than the

199
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:17,950
actual message. So how do you find those role models with the values that clearly come out of

200
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:22,090
you? That must be challenging. And you really feel as though the messenger's the key, is it?

201
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:29,350
Yeah, absolutely. We have about 35 facilitators now who are very diverse and intersectional in

202
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,590
their backgrounds. These are guys, over the years,

203
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:38,750
it's ranged from First Nations people to former refugees and asylum seekers to Melbourne hipsters

204
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:44,610
to footie jocks to drama kids to musos that represent effectively the diversity of masculinity.

205
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:50,090
So that if we put these facilitators in front of a classroom of, it might be young Islamic men,

206
00:15:50,169 --> 00:15:56,070
they see someone like them, they go, shit, that's possible. I can be like that. And yeah,

207
00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:00,289
the really important thing for us is we train these guys like a sports team. They're walking

208
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:01,850
into rooms of teenage boys who have- Yeah.

209
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:08,309
Amazing bullshit detectors. They sniff you out a mile away. They will test you to see if you can

210
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:13,529
hold it. And it's a rowdy group of boys. That's one of the hardest things to capture the attention of,

211
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,549
let alone get them to talk about their feelings afterwards.

212
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:17,870
It's a high bar when you sum it up like that, isn't it?

213
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:22,909
Yeah, big time. And remember high school. High school's intense. High school's about a social

214
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:27,450
hierarchy. You work out who you need to be. You play that persona. Sometimes that works for people,

215
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,690
sometimes that doesn't. And for us, a really important thing we've had to train,

216
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,769
to be discerning about with our facilitators, is this isn't people coming back for their own

217
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:42,470
therapy. This isn't them coming back to come in on a shining horse with the armor on. It's like,

218
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:46,909
no, we're here to do the best job we can possibly do. And yet we get some great recognition and

219
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:51,070
support out of it. But there are people who are doing a lot more intense work on the front line

220
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:55,629
to support humanity than us that do not get the recognition or attention. So come in and be really

221
00:16:55,629 --> 00:17:00,870
humble about this. So yeah, one of the, I think learning, I didn't grow up knowing what a

222
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,850
facilitator was. I didn't grow up knowing what a facilitator was. I didn't grow up knowing what a

223
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:07,609
even how you can host this. It's a full skill set. And there's a difference between presenting

224
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,809
and facilitating too. Presenter might come in with a PowerPoint presentation that takes you

225
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:17,450
through a script. A facilitator has the ability to withdraw out information, which actually is like

226
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:23,289
the epidemiology of the word educator, is to draw out, not to put in, which is actually very

227
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:27,809
different to how we educate people. And so for us, training people on how to facilitate, so they can

228
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:31,769
walk into a room of these teenage boys and understand who's the jock that just wants a

229
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:35,890
bit of power, you know, that wants to be the center of attention. How do you mobilize him for,

230
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:39,789
you know, leadership abilities, not just in, as we were joking before, in entertainment ways,

231
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:45,170
but in, you know, leadership ways. Who's the kid who's, you know, the quiet observer at the back

232
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,769
that doesn't offer much, but when he does, it's gold. Or who's the kid that's going to derail the

233
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:52,470
classroom because he's an oversharer. You eventually get to work out these patterns

234
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:58,049
just from FaceTime with the boys. And you learn how to take them on a journey basically to

235
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:01,750
creating an environment where they feel safe to be themselves, which a lot of them,

236
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:04,410
haven't felt because they're mostly exist in a culture of banter.

237
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,650
Yeah. And it's such, as you said, you go back, it's a, it can be a brutal environment as we

238
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:13,069
know, and it's where it does get lost. And sometimes some of those young boys don't

239
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:16,950
ever get it back because of what happens in that environment. And that happens in all

240
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:21,369
parts of the country. I want to go back to the needle going too far. There was a story

241
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:27,309
recently in a Victorian school where they made all the boys stand up. I can see you nodding.

242
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:31,190
It's a story I'm sure you know, and turn to their female colleagues and apologize

243
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:36,230
for effectively being male. I mean, I'm sure that that's not helpful. Is that,

244
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,789
I'm sure the intentions are good. Is that's what's happening too often now is that we're

245
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:44,049
over-correcting in some ways to try and address this problem. Do you feel that way?

246
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:49,309
I don't think there's an easy answer to this. I think it's really layered and nuanced. And I think,

247
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:54,529
yeah, in that circumstance, there was a lot of backlash, you know, from these boys who felt like

248
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:59,069
they were just, they weren't part of the group of boys who would, you know, cause the issue at the

249
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:00,890
school. But it's also really layered, right? Because we are, you know, we're not, you know, we're not

250
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,049
in a group of boys who would, you know, cause the issue at the school. But it's also really layered, right?

251
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:05,309
Because we are in a system which is called the patriarchy, which effectively

252
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:12,230
means that the things are designed in a way that benefits men. But the challenging thing is we've

253
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:17,029
been born into that. Like we, you and I didn't choose that, but we're kind of in it. And it also,

254
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:21,250
the, I think what gets lost when, even when we talk about the patriarchy, the big scary word

255
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:28,049
that it is, is that some people can interpret it going that it's their life isn't hard, you know,

256
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:31,029
things haven't been a struggle for them. And that's not the conversation.

257
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:35,789
It's a conversation around privilege. And my journey with privilege, you know, as a white dude

258
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:40,089
is really just kind of understanding that privilege isn't necessarily a dirty word,

259
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:46,369
but it's, it's how I use it. Right. And I think often they say that privilege is invisible to

260
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:52,250
those who have it. So for my friends who are people of color in, when they walked into a room,

261
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,150
you know, sorry, when they looked into a mirror, when they were younger, they saw someone who was

262
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,450
brown. Whereas I was probably mid twenties before I even registered that I was white, you know,

263
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,450
consciously. Right. I just thought that's how things were. So I think we've got a long way to

264
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:10,549
kind of move through this very edgy, very emotional, very personal space around

265
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:16,849
where masculinity is up to, because one of the things that I think is important is it might not

266
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:22,170
be our fault that we're born into a system like this, but I do think it is our responsibility

267
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,390
to do something around creating a more equal world. And that doesn't have to be, you know,

268
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:30,430
this big, huge thing. It can just be who you are in your relationship,

269
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,390
in your family, in your friendships. And I think just starting there.

270
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,210
And we always think that's a great place to start Hunter, isn't it? That ability to impact

271
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,349
positively. And, and you're right. I mean, I'm in that exact bracket as you, you know,

272
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:47,769
sporting background, white male, haven't got the slightest understanding really what it's like to

273
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:51,789
not live your world because it's very hard to, isn't it? And you like to think you have empathy

274
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:56,089
and you want to have these conversations, but you're right. I mean, it's that privilege still

275
00:20:56,089 --> 00:21:00,430
feels as though then it becomes a slur almost as opposed to, well, it's just sort of the reality.

276
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:05,509
It doesn't mean you can't meaningfully have an impact and try and understand and try and have

277
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:10,549
better empathy. I said, we'll come back to the term toxic masculinity because it's a,

278
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:14,910
it's a hot one that isn't it? And I like your, and this is to me, the thing that's the art that's

279
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:19,569
been lost is having uncomfortable conversations and where does it sit? I mean, do you comfortable

280
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:23,490
with that word and what it means? Uh, listen, I get, it's really important

281
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:30,170
for certain people given the life experiences and probably the, you know, trauma or abuse

282
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,710
they may have experienced because it becomes, you know, language is a tool and it can be used

283
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:40,150
as a tool to agitate in which to have uncomfortable and messy conversations. So I get, I get the point

284
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:45,170
of it and what it represents. I think where the nuance often gets lost, particularly with teenage

285
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:50,430
boys and a lot of men is this assumption that it's like a brush that means that all men are

286
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:55,369
toxic. And it's, it's my understanding is that's not the intention of it. The intention of it is

287
00:21:55,369 --> 00:22:00,269
to identify that there are some toxic behaviors, um, that are part of probably

288
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:05,809
some more traditional masculine beliefs around being a man is about conquest, power, control,

289
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:11,730
dominance, individual success, believing in very rigid gender norms, you know, being homophobic.

290
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:17,470
Um, you know, your masculinity is like how good you are at sport or how good looking you are or

291
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,430
how much money you make, right? Well, these are kind of traditional marketing things more than

292
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,750
anything else. And I think what we're starting to evolve out of now is going, okay, well,

293
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:30,250
how do we develop more range in our masculinity? You know, how is it that we can be stoic,

294
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:34,710
but the next day we can be vulnerable and this becomes a practice. It's a training ground.

295
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,329
And yeah, I think for me, you know, one of the things, you know, with the workshops we run,

296
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,150
I remember when the term first came out, you know, a female teacher at a school

297
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,670
pulled me aside and was like, oh, these boys are all toxic. And I was like, okay,

298
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:51,630
we'll just be really like careful with that term because have you actually explained to them what

299
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:56,609
toxic masculinity means? And when you say that and she goes, no, I go, okay. So let me, let's

300
00:22:56,609 --> 00:23:00,190
pause the whole session here. Hey, fellas, can I get you to raise your,

301
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:05,230
and if you've heard of the word toxic masculinity or words, they all burst out laughing. And I'm

302
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,230
like, all right. I'm like, who knows what it means? No hands go up. There's 50 boys just

303
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:13,250
sitting there, but then they can make an assumption of what it means. And then they live into it.

304
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,650
Because if they're going to be told they're naughty, they're going to be naughty. Right.

305
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:21,849
And I think one of the things that particularly around teenagers is when you're told not to do

306
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:26,329
something, that's like the gateway to go do it, you know? And I think, you know, if these boys

307
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:30,170
are being told, you know, be good boys, but you know, don't be like that, they're going to,

308
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:34,970
try and flex their, you know, identity in different ways. And, you know, that's probably

309
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,690
something which I assume you would have talked about on the Anna Rubenstein podcast as well.

310
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:43,569
Yeah. And, um, yeah, good point to, uh, to jump in there. The, uh, the family connection with,

311
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:49,069
uh, with Anna and I had the, um, great pleasure the day I was out at, uh, his property and I love

312
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:53,569
that catch up. It had so much reflection for me as a, as a father of four and, you know,

313
00:23:53,569 --> 00:23:57,809
the rites of passage. If you haven't heard Anna's podcast, I encourage you to go and do it. It is

314
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:04,289
so much wisdom in, in how to, um, raise teenagers and bringing back the rites of passage. And, um,

315
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:09,930
I know his partner is your mother and I got, I got to see you, uh, that day. How much, um,

316
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,809
has he influenced you in, in, in this stage of your life? Cause it feels like your work

317
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:19,410
is pretty, uh, pretty close, uh, cousins. Yeah. That's, it's funny. We, um, there's

318
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:23,190
definitely something higher going on. We both joke around. We're like, no idea how this has

319
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:27,789
happened, but we're here. Um, but yeah, so I, when I was, when man cave was just a concept,

320
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:33,089
you know, when I was like 21 and I remember I pitched at some event and this guy was like,

321
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:35,829
you got to go meet this guy, Anna Rubenstein. And I was like, who? I couldn't even pronounce

322
00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:39,890
his name. Like Arnie Rubenstein, like, sorry, done a Ted talk, written a book. I was like,

323
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:44,509
okay, this seems pretty legit. And, uh, anyway, I caught up with him in this like dingy cafe in

324
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:48,809
Sydney. And, uh, first thing he said to me was, what's your story? I was like, who is this guy?

325
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:55,250
And, um, anyway, that was kind of the inception of our, I guess, relationship was him, um, going,

326
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,789
well, you should come up to my property and do my rites of passage leadership.

327
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:01,769
Training. And that opened up a whole world for me because I remember we ran this,

328
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:05,569
he took us through a rite of passage and a rite of passage for anyone who hasn't listened is

329
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:11,630
effectively a structured transition from one state to another. And it could be, um, a rite

330
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,970
of passage could be, you know, a bar mitzvah or a wedding, um, or it can be intentionally designed

331
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:21,789
to transition from one state of psychology to the next, which was used to initiate particularly

332
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:27,130
young men into their manhood for effectively eons, right? It's a technology of human nature

333
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:27,789
is how I relate.

334
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:32,150
And we obviously don't have a lot of rite of passage in our context now. It's kind of like

335
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:35,190
go to schoolies, get drunk first time, might be doing drugs, whatever it is.

336
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:40,630
And that was his point that if you don't formalize it, we make it up as kids and that's what plays

337
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:46,009
out, isn't it? Your rite of passage is schoolies week or, or the crazy behavior that we all probably

338
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:49,950
went down the path without it being formalized. Yeah. So that was, that was the genesis really

339
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,569
of where you started with Man Cave, wasn't it? Yeah, exactly. So I kind of had this concept.

340
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:56,670
I didn't really know where to begin, went to the training. And I remember

341
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:02,049
one of the final components of a rite of passage is to, is an honoring. So you go through this big

342
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:06,369
experience, huge challenge. You create a vision for who you want to be after you let go of the

343
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:10,190
behaviors you want to step into. And then there's an honoring. And at the end of the honoring,

344
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:14,529
I remember I was in front of this guy who just made a huge impact on me. And I realized I couldn't

345
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:18,589
even articulate what I wanted to feel. I felt this like emotional block. I was like, I don't

346
00:26:18,589 --> 00:26:24,569
have bloody language to tell him. I'm like, I need to go look at this. Like, I can't speak.

347
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,589
And that was like the moment.

348
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:31,369
Where like the kind of, I got cracked open a bit. I was like, okay, there's something here. My soul

349
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:37,369
has been drawn to something bigger, higher than me. And I don't know why, but I have to keep going

350
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:42,490
down this path. And so, yeah, I've, I've, you know, run some of the most incredible or been a

351
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,470
part of some of the most incredible experiences of my life with, you know, with Onana's property

352
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:51,769
and Yarra Kura up behind Mullumbimby with, you know, 50 men and the boys in their lives,

353
00:26:51,829 --> 00:26:56,309
taking them through a four day rite of passage. And it is truly magical. Like if I,

354
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:01,710
I was probably skeptical of is magic real, you know, previously, but what I've seen

355
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:07,509
is truly, truly incredible. And it's really interesting because a lot of the, um, the men

356
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:12,549
think they're taking the boys there for the boys, but it is as profound and special for the men,

357
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:17,069
if not more. Can't wait to experience it. And, uh, I'm looking forward to, I've got two in that

358
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:23,069
zone still that, uh, I'm, uh, I'm on the path to, to having been at the property and seen,

359
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:25,650
as you said, there is something magic about just walking up the driveway.

360
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,990
And, and then, um, he ends up with your mom as well. So

361
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:38,190
I know. So yeah, I remember somehow they got connected and, um, he was like, Hey,

362
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:42,890
I keep hearing about your mom. I'm like, that's weird. I was like, well, I guess if you're a

363
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:47,950
mentor of mine, that's pretty good criteria. Mom was single at the time. So they've since

364
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:52,569
been together for about seven or eight years now. Ah, brilliant. I love it. Uh, can I ask you,

365
00:27:52,569 --> 00:27:56,509
there'll be a lot of parents listening to this and, you know, we want our kids to be

366
00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:01,509
emotionally intelligent. We want them to be resilient and, and that's the space you deal

367
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:06,029
in every day. What do you, what do you say to parents? How do we raise particularly our young

368
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:10,569
boys? That's your space to be emotionally intelligent and resilient. First of all,

369
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:16,009
as you are the role model, they are always watching. And I think we, as a society get

370
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:21,210
very good at telling people things, but actually living the values and the actions. Like it's that

371
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:26,250
whole concept of deeds, not words is the most important thing. So they're always,

372
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,369
always watching. Right. And one of the most powerful things as a parent is to admit your

373
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:36,250
faults. If you've made mistakes to let go of any pride and use that as teachable moments inside of

374
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:41,630
your relationship with the kids in your life, that is deeply profound and deeply healing because they

375
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:47,190
get to see you as yes, a parent, but also as a person and that role models to them from a very

376
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:53,289
young age that it's okay to take responsibility for your behavior. Excuse me. Second thing is,

377
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:56,130
is sharing your story. You know, what was life like?

378
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:03,150
And you were, you know, five, six, 15, 25, not through the lens of philosophizing or giving

379
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:07,269
life advice, but genuinely, what were some of the things that happened to your life that shaped who

380
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:12,650
you are and your character? And then the third thing I'll say is seeing their unique gifts and

381
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:17,470
talents. So again, coming back to this concept of honoring or acknowledging them, not validating

382
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:21,490
them for their performance. Like, you know, Johnny did a good job because he kicked six goals on the

383
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:26,069
weekend, but actually had Johnny, you know, I saw how you treated your friend the other day. And I

384
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:31,670
respect your kindness. I love seeing that side of you. So this whole concept of getting kids to

385
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:36,410
understand that their internal validation of themselves, first of all, is the most important

386
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:40,769
thing. But if you can internally validate the things about their character, that's so important.

387
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:45,410
External validation is just very temporary. We know this. So I think they're just three low

388
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:50,609
hanging fruit. Well, I think that's a sort of parenting masterclass in lots of ways. And it's

389
00:29:50,609 --> 00:29:55,849
the parenting puzzle, I call it, because you want to always describe it as the thing that you think

390
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:01,789
most, or certainly do. And you want to be as profoundly good at it as anything, but often

391
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:06,109
you're fumbling your way through. But it resonates with me, putting your hand up when you get it

392
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:10,089
wrong. And that's something Beck and I have always tried to do. It probably wasn't something past

393
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:14,950
generations had in their repertoire at all. And it's incredibly powerful because we do get it

394
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:19,730
wrong. You blow up or you yell at them and you know you overstepped the mark. But when you actually

395
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:23,809
sit down and just say, hey, look, I got that wrong. I'm really sorry. I had a bad day. And we did.

396
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:25,690
That is a really profound thing.

397
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:33,890
Likewise, isn't it? Over-celebrating the moments as opposed to just the qualities that you see.

398
00:30:34,829 --> 00:30:39,990
You see a lot of that in the junior sporting world that you see. There's just so much focus

399
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:43,349
on achievement as opposed to the character that you talk about.

400
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:49,089
I think just the other bit I'll jump in there, Luke, is anger is really important. And anger

401
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:53,950
gets really shut away in our society. Anger is an important part of our emotional range as a human.

402
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,650
And I think role modeling,

403
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:01,250
that we sometimes do get angry and things do kind of open up and potentially explode. But you also

404
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,130
have the ability to come back and recognize that and go, well, that wasn't who I wanted to be in

405
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:09,990
that moment. But I'm not going to hide this away from you. This is who I am. And of course,

406
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:15,369
be responsible with your anger, of course. But understanding that that isn't something to just

407
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:19,890
suppress because then that manifests in some really unhealthy ways that we see later in life

408
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:24,609
too. And again, it's just practice. It's not about being a polished parent. It's just about

409
00:31:24,609 --> 00:31:25,789
being a parent of character.

410
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:30,950
Yeah. Well said again, isn't it? It's funny that the anger part is the thing I reckon I always

411
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:37,410
helpful when you're playing AFL football. Not so helpful sometimes when you're losing your cool

412
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:40,450
around the home. And that's something I've wrestled with. But you're right. If someone's

413
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:44,289
breaking the door down in the house, you don't want to have forgotten your anger because that's

414
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:49,069
appropriate. And sometimes it's appropriate, as you said, around the house. It's when you're,

415
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:53,089
as you said, not pretending it's not there or not part of who you are. As you said,

416
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,230
that suppression becomes a challenge. And that guilt sort of,

417
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,410
the cycle kicks in a bit then.

418
00:31:57,809 --> 00:32:04,049
Yeah. And I think as well, for masculinity, where we're up to now, life is very sterile. We're not

419
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:08,970
out doing the things that we used to do. And I think there is this inherent desire in men to

420
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:15,190
push ourselves, to be in extreme circumstances, to feel this deep sense of brotherhood, which

421
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:19,309
often we do get through sport, but often that trails off for so many people. But there's still

422
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:24,650
this desire. So I think for me, there's this beautiful quote that you don't give a sword to

423
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,849
a man who can't dance.

424
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:32,230
And I really love that, right? Because for me, it talks to this balance of like,

425
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:37,630
if the man is in touch with himself and he's got range and he can be playful and silly and creative,

426
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:42,210
but also he can step into, if he needs to be dangerous to protect his family, then that's

427
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,990
something that's important. And I think it's just because we also hear so many very horrific

428
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:51,589
stories around men who have been really irresponsible with their masculinity and

429
00:32:51,589 --> 00:32:55,410
their violence, that then a lot of it gets shut away. But like,

430
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:59,769
I know for me, and I assume with you, sport was an incredible training ground for understanding my

431
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:05,250
body, understanding the physicalness inside of who I am. And I loved it. But again, if we look

432
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,569
back at humanity, that's been an important part of masculinity forever, is training, wrestling,

433
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:14,069
hunting, going out to protect is a really important part of who we are. And it's only

434
00:33:14,069 --> 00:33:17,890
in very recent times that things have been really sterilized and we just watch Netflix.

435
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,490
Well, I love that you brought that up. And my mind's going to Steve Biddulph,

436
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:26,769
the brilliant author of Raising Boys, Raising Girls. He sold over 4 million copies of probably

437
00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:33,890
globally one of the most renowned authors in the space of how we bring up our kids. And he talks

438
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:40,210
about audience of women and what they want out of a male partner in these days. And he breaks it

439
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:44,630
down beautifully. I think about this all the time. It's like, we do want to see that empathy and we

440
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:49,150
want that care and genuine connection. But you listen to him at the same time, they go, I don't

441
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,990
want a guy soft. I want a guy...

442
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:58,049
He breaks it down to heart and to backbone. So if you can have those two sides to you,

443
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:01,329
it's very possible. You still want to have that strength. You want to have some go and you want

444
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:05,250
to have, as you said, the protector of your family. It's not a bad thing to have as part of,

445
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:09,809
but is the heart there with it? It's not a bad way to think about it, I think.

446
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,489
Yeah. And it's interesting, even in... So Brene Brown, who you might be familiar with,

447
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:17,730
does a lot of work around vulnerability and courage. I remember in her book, Daring Greatly,

448
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,449
she talked about interviewing a bunch of women if they actually

449
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:21,469
want to be a part of the family. And I think that's a really good thing.

450
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:21,489
Yeah. I think that's a really good thing. I think that's a really good thing. I think that's a really good thing.

451
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:28,730
A lot of the women said no. So again, this is this kind of confusing time where it's like,

452
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:33,829
no, I want my man to be stoic and strong, but then also at times, maybe I don't want that.

453
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:38,650
I want him to be in touch with his masculinity and hold himself together, but maybe I do want

454
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:43,289
it to be open. So again, I just use that as an example of like, it's just really late.

455
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:51,469
I don't think there's this one clean answer. It's like, we're moving through this time in

456
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:56,670
that helped us get from A to B previously and not necessarily the models we need to get forward

457
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:03,510
now. There's a great example in my mind, and I hope this will remain timeless given the interview,

458
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:08,389
but the AFL grand final has just happened. And I feel like sports transformed itself.

459
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:15,250
The senior coaches now have really moved away from the old hierarchy of coaches and a lot of

460
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,730
personal abuse. And we sort of laugh about it now, but it was pretty crazy. You probably would

461
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,449
experience it as well, but they're really empathetic. Joel Selwood's the person who's

462
00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:25,590
a premiership captain in Geelong. If you haven't, go and look up Joel Selwood and look at him on

463
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:30,269
grand final. One of the bravest, toughest warriors that ever played our game. One of the greatest

464
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:35,989
players of all time. But his thought process grand final day was taking out Gary Ablett,

465
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:43,929
his teammate's child, who's got severe genetic illness. So post grand final, their water boy is

466
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:50,409
a beautiful young down syndrome boy. He spent the next 10 hours we find with Joel. He rang his mom

467
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:51,429
on the ground and said, Hey, I've got a problem. I've got a problem. I've got a problem. I've got a

468
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:54,769
problem. I've got, I can't think of the young boy's name. Wish I could at the moment, but you

469
00:35:54,769 --> 00:36:00,489
know, you go, that is sort of a living, breathing example, authentically understanding that brilliant

470
00:36:00,489 --> 00:36:06,409
heart and as tough and brave as you can come. So it's out there. We're seeing those, as you said,

471
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:11,650
the examples we need to share more often, don't you? Because when it is as brilliant as that,

472
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:16,389
it's a pretty profound thing to see for sure. I just love those stories so much, right? And

473
00:36:16,389 --> 00:36:21,250
particularly with these people that transcend the game, you know, like it becomes about,

474
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:27,309
you know, humanity and like just wholesomeness opposed to, yeah, grand final awesome. But like,

475
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:31,650
think about what this means to the family, the kids, you know, the guy who walked up into the

476
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:35,489
crowd who has down syndrome that he hugged, you know, like all of that, just so profound.

477
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:39,150
And I think we are starting to say that, which is a really interesting thing to note. Like,

478
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:44,289
you know, I think even LeBron James in the NBA, how, what he does outside of the sport is

479
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:48,510
incredible for supporting black and minority communities. But at the same time, like,

480
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:51,369
I know there's that like Sonny Bill Williams example when they won the,

481
00:36:51,429 --> 00:36:57,429
well, cup, the All Blacks, he walked over, this kid jumped the fence in the stadium and he gives

482
00:36:57,429 --> 00:37:03,230
him his medal. Security guards were wrestling the kid to the ground. That's right. And I remember

483
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:07,289
that it's, they're profound moments, aren't they? For sure. I want to talk, you know, Hunter,

484
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:12,130
about, you know, a lot of people have the idea of wanting to do good and then you start a not

485
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:16,469
for profit. That is no easy thing to do. And you've got to get funding. And I want to talk

486
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:21,329
about what you're doing now. You're creating your own brand, cool stuff. You've got some serious,

487
00:37:21,429 --> 00:37:26,409
uh, investors, a couple of former Wallabee captains on board your investment group. Tell

488
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:31,349
us about the complexity of, of what you're doing and how you're going about it. Yeah. I love talking

489
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:35,510
about this because I think, you know, the speaking from the heart space, like we've done just is

490
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:40,510
awesome. But also like, I love, you know, problem solving and I love the concept of how do we

491
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:45,389
leverage business to create a better world for everyone. And, um, so Man Cave, Man Cave's a

492
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:51,409
charity. We're about 60% funded by philanthropy, high net worth grants, about 35% of our,

493
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:56,130
income comes from charging schools on their socioeconomic status. So private schools will

494
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:00,869
pay a premium. Um, or we work with regional and lower socioeconomic schools that pay a subsidy.

495
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:05,449
And then about 5% is like community fundraising. So about four years ago, I was like, right,

496
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:09,889
how do we diversify our income streams? We've got all this demand. Like it actually came after I got

497
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:14,929
an award from the queen, which was amazing. Um, I was over in Buckingham palace and got to meet

498
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:18,510
the queen, got to meet the queen. It was a live stream through the Royal family's Facebook page.

499
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:22,789
I didn't know they had, but, um, yeah, literally in Buckingham palace. And it was like, you know,

500
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:28,210
a black gospel choir behind me. It was like, I remember this moment. I, um, as I'm walking up,

501
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:32,329
like knowing it's on national TV in the UK and back in Australia, it was about four years ago.

502
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:36,170
And I'm walking out the very front. I'm just panicking. I'm going to faint. And I'm just

503
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:40,329
going, Oh, come on. And I remember going, all right, look over, you walk in the front,

504
00:38:40,389 --> 00:38:43,309
you're about to like meet the queen, bow down. She'll say a few words to you.

505
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:47,849
And I look over and there's like the former prime minister. There's like, um,

506
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:54,429
um, Harry, uh, Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, uh, a few Olympians. And then I see David Beckham

507
00:38:54,429 --> 00:38:59,750
and I'm like, epic. And I'm like, okay, do the right thing. Look at everyone as they're looking

508
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,769
at you. They'll probably look at the Royal family. I just look at Beckham straight away. And then he

509
00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:08,409
just winks at me and I just twitch back at him. I was like, Oh God, I was just crushed.

510
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:16,650
Well, there's a moment ever. And, um, but yeah, you know, after that award, um, I got one of the

511
00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:22,110
other name of it came up to me and said, Harry would like to meet you. And they just showed the

512
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:26,949
man cave video in Buckingham palace. And I joke that the Australian accent has never sounded more

513
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:33,050
Bogan moment there, but it was memorable. And, um, so I got taken into this room and, um, Prince

514
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:37,170
Harry and Meghan Markle walked in and they knew everything we're doing at the man cave. Harry

515
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:40,909
really got it from a mental health perspective. Cause you know, his journey, which we, we only

516
00:39:40,909 --> 00:39:45,670
see the tabloid version, you know, him losing his mom when he was like six and then like going on

517
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,530
his own mental health journey. Um,

518
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:52,610
but in the public eye, then going and serving in Afghanistan on the front line, then he sets up,

519
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:58,309
um, uh, uh, the, he's a chair of the Commonwealth youth foundation. So largely the Commonwealth,

520
00:39:58,469 --> 00:40:03,070
which is like 2.3 billion people, 50 odd countries, largely developing countries. So he's on the front

521
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:08,070
line meeting these people. Then he comes back and sets up Invictus games. Like we don't hear that

522
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:13,449
story. And then, you know, he chooses his family values, his intimate family values over the system

523
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:17,269
that he's inherited. So it's just a very different narrative. Anyway. So I'm speaking, I'm going,

524
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:23,329
this guy's a legend. And, um, then Megan Markle comes over. She's like, listen, I really love

525
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:27,429
this from a gender equality perspective. Like, let us know how we can help. I was like, what do you

526
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:32,170
respond to that? And that brought a lot of attention for us. And so I was like, great. Okay.

527
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:36,489
We've got schools across the world coming to us. Like we're still pretty young charity. How the

528
00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:42,110
hell do we capitalize on this? And so at the time I saw a lot of social impact businesses starting to

529
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:46,909
be born, like, thank you. He gives a crap, Tom organic. And I was like, right,

530
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:52,309
there's nothing in the masculinity space. All the marketing is super misogynistic, very old,

531
00:40:52,429 --> 00:40:56,929
you know, spray yourself with a double can of wings. You know, the girls have come chasing you

532
00:40:56,929 --> 00:41:02,170
and we, we both know that doesn't work. Um, and you know, all the old spice guy, you know, on the

533
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:08,030
horse and it's like, it's so silly, but it's like, you know, ages of like 12, you know, 11, 12 years

534
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:12,130
old boys are, you know, being exposed to that. And we wonder where this like real subtle

535
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:16,550
objectification begins. Yeah. And you laugh at it, don't you? But you, you, you laugh at

536
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:22,570
ridiculous, but, but yeah, subliminally, as you said, it becomes reality, doesn't it? And I love

537
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:29,510
what, so your idea is to tap into that space stuff as a brand and, and use, you know, some of the

538
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:33,050
proceeds of that to fund the man cave. Exactly. Tell it what sort of products you get getting

539
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:37,329
into. Yeah. So we, we effectively early days were like, right, it has to be a commercial product.

540
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:43,050
We know that at the end of the day, good marketing just helps a bad product fail faster. And we can't

541
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:46,750
rely on the fact we have a social purpose. It's got to be really high quality. And I

542
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:50,650
did a lot of research and saw that the men's grooming space hadn't been disrupted in a while,

543
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:55,230
but huge potential, no real Australian brands out there that are doing like what I would say

544
00:41:55,230 --> 00:42:01,010
a job that reflects modern masculinity really well. And, um, that was the inception. And so,

545
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:05,050
yeah, basically I've been very, very lucky to work with people who've worked in some of the

546
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:10,449
biggest brands in Australia and pull them in both to work in staff as a staff member or an investor,

547
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:16,190
you know, have worked at ESOP, you know, Mecca, Thank You, Afterpay, Country Road, Swiss,

548
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,909
Meyer. So they've worked in brands before and I've managed to pull them by the values and get

549
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:26,190
them to work with us at stuff. And effectively we chose the name cause it's super simple and,

550
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:29,170
you know, stuff for your pits, stuff for your face, stuff for your head and body. And

551
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:35,829
basically, yeah, we, uh, we launched in, uh, February last year. Uh, we've now secured

552
00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:39,630
distribution through Woolies, which is awesome. Like really good to do after just about a year

553
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:44,849
and a bit of being in the wild. Huge effort. Huge effort. And, um, yeah, so basically we've got,

554
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,789
um, uh, moisturizers,

555
00:42:46,909 --> 00:42:52,389
face scrub, face wash, shaving gel, um, body wash shampoos, deodorants, and we're soon to release

556
00:42:52,389 --> 00:42:58,750
an SPF in, in coming for summer. Um, Ian Thorpe has just come on as an investor, uh, an ambassador

557
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:03,889
as well, just given his story, super aligned. And, um, what I've really tried to curate from

558
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:09,150
an investor point of view is like really values aligned investors and, you know, a saying,

559
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:13,170
which I'm sure you're familiar with, if it's kind of summarizes it, it was really like a no dickhead

560
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:16,889
policy. So just like people who are in this, yes, um, to, um, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to,

561
00:43:16,909 --> 00:43:21,650
you know, do good, but also there's opportunity for commercial return. And so how we set up the

562
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:26,010
business is that man cave, the charity is the largest shareholder in the business. The rest

563
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:31,409
is split between the investors. And then for every thousand dollars in sales, it'll fund a boy from a

564
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:35,889
low socioeconomic community to go through the man cave. So really we just give consumers that point

565
00:43:35,889 --> 00:43:40,070
of purchase decision going, I can choose, you know, links or old spies or whatever it may be,

566
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:45,030
or I can choose, uh, stuff, which I know will help a boy become a better man. That's actually

567
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,329
about his relationships too.

568
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:52,769
Brilliant idea. And, and I love it. It's, uh, as you said, you've given some serious thought to it

569
00:43:52,769 --> 00:43:57,510
and, and then to be able to bring in that quality of, uh, of Lido, you know, we spoke before you

570
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:02,449
catching up with the CEO of, uh, of Woolworths in the coming weeks to get a product into Woolworths

571
00:44:02,449 --> 00:44:07,730
is a, is a huge F at the same time. And it's, it's inspiring Hunter because, you know, you can

572
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:12,409
tell you started fully with purpose and to use your problem solving brain at the same time. It's,

573
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:16,289
uh, it's profound. How do, how do people get involved? Is it simple as just, you know, if you

574
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:17,670
see it, make the choice, buy the product?

575
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:23,369
Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. I think absolutely. Yeah. It's like we sell, obviously have our own website as

576
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:29,829
well. It's literally called www.websiteofstuff.com. And so that's like the direct to consumer route,

577
00:44:29,929 --> 00:44:34,590
but yeah, we're in, in Woolies at the moment. We're in the final stages, fingers crossed that

578
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:41,429
we confirm, uh, a major pharmacy channel as well. We're in shaver shop, uh, too. So if you see it,

579
00:44:41,449 --> 00:44:45,710
yeah. And then, um, just tag us there. Cause we're really trying to create again, using the power

580
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:51,289
of consumerism, you know, even in the marketing, we use all our man cave facilitators. So really

581
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:55,469
creating this like really positive groundswell for men and masculinity. And one of the things

582
00:44:55,469 --> 00:45:00,530
which I'm doing now, as I'm in it, I mentioned to you in a capital raise at the moment is working

583
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:05,650
with a bunch of athletes or people who have been previously athletes to bring them in, you know?

584
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:10,570
So how do we use people that people are inspired by, you know, the community is inspired by to go,

585
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:14,969
these are the role models, the men of character that we want to kind of help us get to this next

586
00:45:14,969 --> 00:45:16,050
stage for masculinity. So, you know, I think it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

587
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:20,690
yeah, very much, um, yeah, an open invitation for anyone's interested just to reach out.

588
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:32,880
We see, uh, leadership in the world that we're passionate about Hunter and love talking to

589
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,480
leaders and doing stuff like you're doing in such a unique way, but there's some genuine, uh,

590
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:41,099
dimensions that we think are really common with leaders. I'd love to ask you about them

591
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:45,659
starting with self-leadership. We don't think you can really lead others unless you've got

592
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:50,099
an idea of self-leadership. Does that make sense to you? Uh, literally? Yes.

593
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:51,920
So

594
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,079
That's interesting, right? So I'm fascinated because I think personal development is like

595
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,099
what the old spiritual development used to be. And I think, you know, looking back at history,

596
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:05,119
I think religions kind of become the middleman between us and spirituality. And that may really

597
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,920
work well for some people, but for some people not. But if we go back pre-organized religion,

598
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,039
one of the foundational teachings of spirituality was know thyself, which literally that's like as

599
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:21,820
pure as it gets. And so for me, absolutely. The journey I'm on is that like the better care I

600
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:26,619
take of myself, the better I can serve others. And that's been really tough because I'm just so

601
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:30,280
used to just putting others first. Like it's, I don't know, it's a family thing, I guess.

602
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:35,079
I had to really come back and go, okay, if I'm not taking care of myself, then my cup is empty.

603
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:40,940
But when my cup is full, it overflows. I can share that with others. And yeah, I have a lot of

604
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:47,199
personal, I guess, reflection practices because yeah, I fundamentally believe that the more I

605
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:51,800
kind of support and heal myself, not as if like I'm broken or fixed or need to be fixed,

606
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:58,480
but the better person I can be. And my partner, she's an amazing yoga teacher. She shared with me

607
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,079
this quote, which is just always stuck with two things, actually. One, that your energy introduces

608
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,380
you before you speak, which I think is so profound. It's so true. Like we just know,

609
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:14,599
like we really know. And the second is the body whispers before it screams. I love that too,

610
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:20,119
because my journey coming from contact sport was just keep pushing through. And I've had to become

611
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:27,239
and the intelligence of my body and my gut. So a lot of my journey now is listening to my gut,

612
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:32,699
not my mind. And what I've found is my mind is awesome at thinking in like logic and past,

613
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:38,280
present and future and trying to problem solve, but it's limited. Whereas I find my gut is like

614
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:43,539
my subconscious. So my subconscious is always taking in all my surroundings. And often my gut

615
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:48,260
feeling is my instinct. And it knows which way to go. It might not be logical, but I'm starting to

616
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,360
really lean into that going, I'm just going to back my gut here. And

617
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,480
there might be some short-term discomfort, but I'm backing it in. And it's really been quite

618
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,760
profound, the results that have come from it. It's fascinating to hear you say that. There's

619
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:03,960
lots of people I've had the great privilege of speaking to really come back to that. All the

620
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,400
times they've made great decisions, it's been on that pure gut instinct. And anytime they've gone

621
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,780
away from that is where they've got themselves into trouble or they've aligned themselves with

622
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:19,000
someone that didn't have the same values. Nicole Gibson is an incredible young Australian. Love

623
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,260
out loud is her community. You would have heard of Nicole's stuff.

624
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:27,300
She's brilliant. She's creating some tech around. We've all got our phones attached to us

625
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:33,360
around how you can actually get some data on making decisions from your gut. And we can

626
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:39,099
measure that now, can't we, with heart rate and with the dilation of your pupils and all that.

627
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:43,760
So she's doing some amazing stuff in that space. I'm not surprised that you went there in that

628
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:50,000
world. The things that you're tackling, changing masculinity, talking about having an impact on

629
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,340
domestic violence, a huge thing. Nicole Gibson is an incredible young Australian. Love out loud is her

630
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:56,119
The next dimension I want to talk to you about is how you go about positively impacting others

631
00:48:56,119 --> 00:49:00,599
in your environment. But what you said before made sense to me is that they're big things,

632
00:49:00,699 --> 00:49:05,380
but every day we can have an impact on someone close to us. How have you thought about that in

633
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:08,780
your day-to-day world? First thing is actually just having a

634
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:15,300
conversation with my partner, Loz, around how I can better support her. Literally, it starts there.

635
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:20,519
What am I doing? Or how can I better be of service inside of our relationship?

636
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,139
Like even having that conversation where I thought I was really good and helping out in all the ways

637
00:49:25,139 --> 00:49:29,639
that I thought I could. And yeah, she just gave me some real low-hanging fruit. I was like, oh shit,

638
00:49:29,739 --> 00:49:34,820
sorry. But like that's, you know, just like what? Can you give me an example? Oh, this is super

639
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:39,320
basic. But so I travel a bit for work. And so when I come home, I just like really like chill it out.

640
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,280
And, you know, she was just like to me, when you just come back home, even if you've been traveling,

641
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:50,260
if you literally just take two minutes to just clean up the whole place, that means so much to

642
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,340
me. And I was like, oh, I'm going to do that. And she was like, I'm going to do that. And I was like,

643
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:55,360
I just kind of clean when like, I feel like I'm ready and I'm not a dirty guy at all. But like,

644
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:58,280
you know, or we have a conversation, I do it. She's like, yeah, but it's just these acts of

645
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:04,699
service that become like a load off my mind. And so I know that's like a really basic thing,

646
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,460
but that's been huge. The other big thing is like inside of when she's dealing with a problem,

647
00:50:09,739 --> 00:50:13,179
actually just asking her, hey, what type of conversation would you like to have here?

648
00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:15,699
Would you like me to help you solve this? Or would you like me just to listen?

649
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:21,260
That has been a game changer because my, you know, usual approach previous years was like,

650
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:24,980
let me help you solve this. This is my way of helping, contributing. She's like, I don't want

651
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:29,599
that. I just want to unravel here. I want you to hold space for me. I'm like, wow, I reckon a few

652
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,420
of my mates could learn from this one. Yeah. You know, I'm learning. I'm writing that down,

653
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:37,000
mate, isn't it? As males, we want to solve problems, don't we, all the time. And sometimes

654
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,420
your partner looking at you going, just stay out of it. Yeah. Like not for you this time.

655
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:46,019
Yeah. And we forget to ask too, don't we? We forget to ask, you know, what can we do better?

656
00:50:46,019 --> 00:50:51,239
A good distinction there is this concept of permission versus trespass. So permission is,

657
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:56,260
hey, Loz, do you mind if I ask you a few more questions? Or, hey, how can I best support you

658
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:01,619
here? Right? So I'm seeking permission from her where she keeps the power. Whereas trespass is

659
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:05,940
really me just overstepping her boundaries and making assumptions and just going in with whatever

660
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:11,599
my contribution answer offering is, right? And that's often where the friction can be. So I found

661
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,880
that to be like a nice little mental model that's just like, all right, permission versus trespass.

662
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,760
Yeah. It's huge, isn't it? And you think of, you know, still one of the most profound things,

663
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,300
isn't it, is breaking up a relationship.

664
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:26,360
Whatever stage it's at. And I always think, you know, a lot of us apply our brains to

665
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:30,820
creating what you're doing, which is a huge undertaking and the social venture,

666
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,340
but we don't apply that same sort of intensity to our relationships and we expect them to be

667
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:39,619
outstanding. It's literally hilarious that we create

668
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:46,000
visions and missions and purpose and values for our businesses and the key behaviors that

669
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
underpin those values and we create a culture code. But in terms of our relationship,

670
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:55,619
like that's really rare. Like, do we sit down and map out what is our vision for us? You know,

671
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:59,980
what are the behaviors we want to have as important to us? What do we think the values of our

672
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:04,239
relationship are? You know, what are the goals that we want to achieve? Maybe we do that in a

673
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:08,519
financial sense, but like, do we do that from a, how do we want to feel about each other? How do

674
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:14,019
we want to feel inside of this relationship? It's kind of comical when you go, wow, we've really

675
00:52:14,019 --> 00:52:19,559
kind of gone that in like a really commercial way, but not an interpersonal way. And I think

676
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:21,260
there's just, you know, lessons there.

677
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,800
How we can use like the masculine and feminine approaches to not making it

678
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,900
too much like a business plan, you know, your relationship. But, you know, I think that's

679
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:33,460
where the middle ground, you know, you can meet. We see leaders are really clear on how they

680
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:39,179
create and share their vision. You've had the Royal Family support your vision. How have you

681
00:52:39,179 --> 00:52:42,400
thought about creating and sharing the vision for the Man Cave and what you're doing?

682
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:48,079
Yeah. So for me, opportunities like this are awesome. So thank you. I really do appreciate it.

683
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,199
Yeah. For me, Man Cave is now,

684
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:54,659
it's really interesting juncture where I think, you know, we started this like

685
00:52:54,659 --> 00:53:00,619
pre Harvey Weinstein, Donald Trump, you know, the Me Too movement or any of this

686
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:04,900
like kind of groundswell. So we were like early on, you know, feet on the ground in 2014.

687
00:53:05,739 --> 00:53:10,039
And now it's like, there's like this opening of this zeitgeist where people are like,

688
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,440
we should do something about this. This is really important. So for me, it's really,

689
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,960
we're now starting to have a lot of government meetings across, you know,

690
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,539
state and federal government to see how we can really establish like more,

691
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,760
support around the emotional and social development of young men.

692
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,440
And again, not through this lens of being super woke or like virtue signaling. It doesn't have

693
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,420
to be this big, scary or progressive thing. It's like, no, it's like, it's just values-based

694
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:38,300
education in a way that resonates with young men. So that's been, you know, really important.

695
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:43,000
And then, yeah, where Man Cave is now about to do a lot of work kind of digitally. So

696
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,199
we've started to run our programs on Twitch, which is the largest game streaming platform

697
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:51,139
in the world. Took me a little while to kind of catch up to what that was, but it's basically,

698
00:53:51,139 --> 00:53:56,019
young people log onto this platform. They watch other, you know, their favorite YouTubers or

699
00:53:56,019 --> 00:54:00,579
gamers game. And some of these kids have like tens of millions of followers. It's a whole other world.

700
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:05,800
I guess it's like us going to the G and watching our favorite athletes run around. But yeah,

701
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:09,960
we're now starting to run our mental health programs on Twitch. So kids go through,

702
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:13,980
you know, the programs at school, they come home, hopefully do their homework,

703
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,800
log onto Twitch. And then they're now having like conversations with our facilitators,

704
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,780
which is like a talk show.

705
00:54:21,139 --> 00:54:26,219
A podcast meets like a segment. And the boys love it because it's entertaining,

706
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,059
but it's also educational as well. And they can talk and have open,

707
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:35,440
anonymous conversations around mental health, you know, relationships, sex, death, everything in

708
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,679
between. And I think that's really exciting because the possibilities of that digitally

709
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:44,860
open up so much. And, you know, we partnered with Australia's leading e-sports team to do

710
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:50,480
that as well. Got like 60,000 people streaming in and even had this one kid, his name was,

711
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,639
um, yeah, Bo Johnson just found us randomly online as an indigenous kid from central Victoria.

712
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:59,920
And he was like, how the hell do I get you guys to my school? And so we built this like

713
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,300
relationship with him online. And, and, you know, he got us into his high school and we rock up and

714
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:09,340
he's in all man cave merchandise. And he was like the hero of the town. And, you know, I think it's

715
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,920
a really powerful story of how digital can be used for good. Cause we often hear they're really

716
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:17,159
negative stories of, of digital and algorithms. And where you're meeting them is, is where

717
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:20,460
they're at, isn't it? I think for most parents, you know, Twitch is what the hell is they're

718
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,820
and yeah, I've spoken to you about that previously and it's so hard to get your head

719
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:27,860
around. And for most parents, you go, that's the nightmare. You know, my kid's up watching

720
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:33,280
gamers game all night. How can there be anything positive in that? But that's where a lot of the

721
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,000
passion space lies. So, you know, again, the brilliance of you to, to meet kids where they're

722
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,440
at and have those conversations, which segues well into curiosity as a dimension of leadership.

723
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:45,860
We just see people like you who are doing incredible things in leadership are really

724
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:50,039
curious. Is that word, you know, jump off the page out here? Yeah. I think,

725
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:54,260
it's like that child psychology, you know, the kids are always just asking why? Yeah,

726
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:58,480
absolutely. Like some reason we just lose that. And it's like, well, we just got to assume that

727
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:04,059
we know and go work it out privately. So I think, yeah, absolutely. I'm endlessly curious and

728
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:08,340
sometimes I have to like limit the curiosity cause I can just keep going. But yeah, curiosity,

729
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:13,460
I think in understanding is everything from understanding the people that we're sitting

730
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:18,659
opposite from to the history, to the real reason for things. And I think, you know, sometimes

731
00:56:18,659 --> 00:56:24,059
humanity, we are a species with amnesia. We like forget why the way things have been done,

732
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:28,480
you know, and we just focus, which is probably some, you know, biological evolutionary reason

733
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,500
that's like, don't look back for the wine, keep going for the, you know, the berry.

734
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:37,400
But yeah, I think, yeah, curiosity alongside vision, you know, the ability to, you know,

735
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:43,219
let, and I think for me as a leader, it's back to vision very briefly. That's where my gifts are. I

736
00:56:43,219 --> 00:56:48,519
don't know why, but I can just see things a few steps down the track and I can see how exponentially

737
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:53,900
if you do this and this and you pull it together, it can create its own, you know, momentum. I don't

738
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:58,059
know why, but it's just something that can happen. And my role as a leader has been surrounding

739
00:56:58,059 --> 00:57:02,199
myself with people who can then take care of the operations. Um, and that's what I think an

740
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:07,420
effective, you know, manager of a team is you design the team around people in their sweet

741
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:12,940
spots to get the desired outcome. And, and for me, you know, uh, where I do my best work is

742
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:17,280
getting curious about things like, you know, as I said before around, okay, why is religion the

743
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,460
way that religion is being done?

744
00:57:18,659 --> 00:57:22,860
What's the origins of spirituality? I'm like going down that and understanding that has helped

745
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:28,840
me be a better leader because I realized simple tenants like know thyself means that I can be

746
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:34,159
better, not just for myself, but for those I'm around. So someone on this podcast, and I wish I

747
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,739
could remember it wasn't it. I think about all the time talked about great leaders and great

748
00:57:37,739 --> 00:57:43,039
partnerships around, you need shared values, but complimentary capabilities. So you're looking

749
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:48,119
for, you don't have to be a great operational person. You clearly understand that where your

750
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:52,760
strength is and surrounding that, but the intelligence and the leadership is to actually

751
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:57,340
say, God, I've got a gap here. Can I get other people to compliment me? Sounds like you've done

752
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:03,059
that really strategically and really successfully, uh, communicating with clarity. You, um, articulate

753
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:08,880
yourself as well as I can't say articulate as I try and, uh, compliment you for how well, uh, you

754
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,559
get your words across. Has that always been something that's, that's come easy to you around

755
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:16,739
communicating and what's been your communication strategy? Because, you know, it feels like you

756
00:58:16,739 --> 00:58:17,639
get it out there really well.

757
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:23,159
Thanks. I think I honed it getting out of detentions at school is probably where I probably

758
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:28,800
worked out. I was like, all right, I can say a few things here. Um, nah, I joke, but kind of

759
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:37,960
serious. Um, the, I think really just time in the ring. And I say this, but like when in doubt be

760
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:42,679
authentic has been a game changer for me. Like if I don't know the answer, like I'm very comfortable

761
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:47,219
to say that. And, um, I think again, coming back to just the work I've done to feel comfortable

762
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:54,239
which is an endless, you know, task, um, allows me to, I think, speak, you know, from my heart.

763
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:58,239
And I think coming back to, you know, that at Ana's training, right. Where I had that ability

764
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:02,440
where I was like, well, there's a real block here. I can't actually articulate myself. And I think

765
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:07,619
using that as a training ground, um, or as an inception to go and find training grounds,

766
00:59:07,659 --> 00:59:13,219
I should say has been, yeah, absolutely a game changer for me. And it's been a practice of

767
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:18,099
getting really uncomfortable. So for instance, doing the standup comedy cause was just, you know,

768
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:23,699
standing up and failing for like three days in front of people and recognizing that I will

769
00:59:23,699 --> 00:59:28,800
survive, like the world will go on. And so, you know, I think around particularly around high

770
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,480
performance, that's really what my model of high performance is, is getting myself in environments

771
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:38,260
that I don't have my usual tools, um, to whip out. And actually I've got to be quite instinctual and

772
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:43,059
find my edges. And then on the edge is where the gold is. You mentioned earlier, and I meant to

773
00:59:43,059 --> 00:59:46,800
ask you about, you said, I've got a range of self-reflective practices. I think it was when

774
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:53,019
leadership, I meant to come back to it. Um, it just sparked my attention again there. Can you

775
00:59:53,019 --> 00:59:59,219
give us some detail around what that looks like for people? Sure. Yeah. Well, I think the easiest

776
00:59:59,219 --> 01:00:04,579
low hanging fruit is just journaling. I think like, I remember you do that daily or I used to,

777
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:10,500
and now it's, um, I realized that my mind made it a task and then it become like, oh shit,

778
01:00:10,519 --> 01:00:14,239
I'm not journaling. And then it became like, oh, that's not that point of journaling. And so now

779
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:18,099
I look at it as like, it's a gift, you know, it's like, I feel like unpacking,

780
01:00:18,099 --> 01:00:22,280
something and just letting my unconscious unravel. But I remember when I started journaling,

781
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:27,420
I, I like, I was like, shit, how do I write the perfect journal? Do I start dear diary? Like,

782
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,360
what do you do? And now it's just whatever comes out, but I do try to end on three things I'm

783
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:36,400
grateful for. And I find, you know, just understanding the research on gratitude,

784
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:42,059
just like speaking it out into existence actually does rewire the chemicals in our brain and gets us

785
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:47,239
to be really appreciative. And I think, yeah, the more grateful I am, the more amazing things

786
01:00:48,099 --> 01:00:54,460
shape things. So journaling's been massive coming from a contact sport and getting into yoga has

787
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:58,960
been huge. Um, I remember, you know, again, early twenties and I did yoga and I felt this like level

788
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,599
of like intimacy with my body. I was like, what the hell is this feeling? And, um, that has just

789
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:08,159
been a beautiful practice for me again, like, you know, maybe once a week. So it's not like

790
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:12,880
this thing I drill myself on, but it's a chance for me to slow my system down and get out of my

791
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:18,079
head into my body. That's been a game changer. And then I also do this practice, which is kind

792
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:22,860
of, I guess, a version of like internal family systems, which is like a type of psychology

793
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:29,300
where basically if I feel an emotion come up, I try and like have a practice of speaking to

794
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:33,539
that emotion and understanding it and feeling it. And basically it's like parenting the inner

795
01:01:33,539 --> 01:01:37,840
selves that I have. And that's, that's been a game changer because often like, say for instance,

796
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:41,739
I might be triggered by something happened or I might, you know, go to do a talk or something

797
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:45,760
and I'm feeling anxious. I would actually create a practice as part of like a meditation routine

798
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,059
where I'll just slow down, speak to the part of my body that I'm not feeling anxious about,

799
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:53,119
that feels anxious, ask of it if it needs anything. Literally as a, as a kid, it has been

800
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:58,780
a game changer for me in terms of like feeling, just giving myself the love I wish I had in that

801
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:02,619
moment. Often it's some like childhood thing where I didn't get the attention or, you know,

802
01:02:02,659 --> 01:02:07,519
reward I wanted. And then through that, I've also worked out the ability to start to speak to my gut,

803
01:02:07,739 --> 01:02:11,599
you know, and ask, okay, well, what do you think gut? What should we do? And again, it's just

804
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:16,039
developing relationships with the different parts of our psyche or our consciousness has been huge.

805
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:18,019
Which sounds fairly esoteric, but

806
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:22,619
makes perfect sense to me. You mentioned before is, you know, there's only a handful of emotions

807
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:26,820
we will experience. Everyone experiences it. Even if you're not a jealous person, everyone knows what

808
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:31,480
jealousy feels like. And when that comes up, as you said, if you actually sort of almost go,

809
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:35,800
well, that's jealousy. That's just quite natural. It happens. It doesn't tend to, or that's anger,

810
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:41,179
as you said before, I don't then feel guilt about having anger or all of the emotions and the rains

811
01:02:41,179 --> 01:02:46,780
and to be able to express it like that in the end, it's almost, you know, it takes away any of the

812
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:48,059
overthinking that comes next to it.

813
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:54,679
I can relate. We both, my Bex, a yoga instructor as well. And so brought that into our life. I think

814
01:02:54,679 --> 01:02:59,880
when it's that close to you, isn't it? You realize how profound that practice is. I can relate to

815
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:06,280
that. I've got a very ordinary 35 minutes that I do most days, but I love it. It's been a game

816
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:11,760
changer. I think so. Just to jump in on just that for me, it's also, you know, we talk about whether

817
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:17,360
it's the guilt or the frustration or the shame, really learning to unconditionally love and

818
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,059
accept those emotions. And I think that's a really important thing. I think that's a really important

819
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:18,099
thing. I think that's a really important thing. I think that's a really important thing. I think

820
01:03:18,099 --> 01:03:24,199
those parts of myself have been a life changer because, you know, parts of myself that I may

821
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:32,260
have shame about, if I am able to accept that, love myself, irrespective of that, that is telling

822
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:37,380
myself, which I'm always aware of how I'm going, whether I'm conscious of it or not, my body is

823
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:42,239
keeping a read on it. That really sends the signal to me that I unconditionally love myself, which

824
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:47,280
is crazy. Like it's so wild to me that we don't teach kids how to love themselves. It's so crazy.

825
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,760
Like it's like, it's, it's even the concept, it's like a bit woo woo, but I'm like, you know,

826
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:55,360
loving yourself and being comfortable with yourself, whatever language you want to say

827
01:03:55,360 --> 01:04:00,179
is one of the greatest feelings in the world. And it's, it's, I think it's wild. We don't teach our

828
01:04:00,179 --> 01:04:04,860
kids this. Well, it's funny, isn't it? It's going back to that whole schoolyard thing. You're in

829
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:09,619
love with yourself, you know, you're that the negative connotation to getting ahead of yourself,

830
01:04:09,699 --> 01:04:12,719
you know, in Australia, we, you know, talk, that's sort of the foundation and talk poppy.

831
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:15,719
Is that, you know, what you're happy if you'd be reasonably successful, you get two success,

832
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:17,260
we're going to smash it. Yeah, exactly.

833
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:20,480
And I think that is a big thing to still unravel, isn't it? Yeah.

834
01:04:20,539 --> 01:04:24,820
Coming, comes back to where we started, that sense of self, that sense of self leadership.

835
01:04:25,019 --> 01:04:26,059
Yeah. If you haven't got a healthy,

836
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:30,559
yeah. Um, you know, understanding of yourself and care for yourself or love for yourself,

837
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:34,699
to use the word you're after, how do you then project anything positive going forward?

838
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:39,579
And I think the tricky thing is we see those people who often have the most, um, who were,

839
01:04:39,659 --> 01:04:43,900
you know, sometimes the loudest in the room, the biggest performers, you know, often it's

840
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,960
projecting something, you know, they're not actually that comfortable with themselves. Some

841
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:47,199
are.

842
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:52,199
Of course, but often, you know, they're, they're doing it to create, you know, uh, a distance

843
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:56,280
from who they really are. And I think that's the really important thing. I love that you brought

844
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:59,219
that up because yeah, there, there are those people who are like, Oh, that's a bit arrogant

845
01:04:59,219 --> 01:05:03,179
and wanky and like what, you know, but then I think there's like a difference where we know

846
01:05:03,179 --> 01:05:07,679
people who are comfortable with themselves. We feel it. And, um, we also, you know, feel often

847
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:11,539
the unconditional love of our mothers, you know, if you're lucky enough to have that, that is an

848
01:05:11,539 --> 01:05:15,960
epic feeling if you're experiencing that. So yeah, I'm just glad you brought that in.

849
01:05:16,219 --> 01:05:17,260
Yeah. And I'm, I love the way that you, you know, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,

850
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:21,400
you just delve into those stuff. As you said now, because of the way the world is and

851
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:27,519
cancel culture, they're tricky conversations. And, and I know a lot of males that in the past

852
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:30,860
would have been open to having that conversation. Just don't want to go near it for sake of,

853
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:35,239
you know, you're going to offend someone and now you can't disagree. You really then,

854
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:40,840
you know, it is canceled culture. So I love the fact that, um, clearly you know it so well,

855
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,920
you know, where you sit on it so well, but I think we need to have more of these conversations.

856
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,480
It's clearly what you're doing in schools too, isn't it? It's getting in,

857
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:47,139
teaching,

858
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:52,179
these are the most important conversations that we could probably have. So well done again.

859
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,260
I'm interested in, you know, what's comeback culture. Like we don't, you know, because like,

860
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:59,480
we're not talking about that because if we're just sending a signal to everyone that's made

861
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:05,119
a mistake in their life, which is everyone, then there's not much incentive to really want to step

862
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:09,500
forward and take responsibility. Right. Because my career, my family, my income is on the line.

863
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:12,699
And that doesn't mean you don't take responsibility for what's happened,

864
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:16,320
but I'm really interested. What's the next cultural wave? Because we're going to have

865
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:16,860
like,

866
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:21,320
keep having this distance where men aren't going to speak their truth or feel empowered and that's

867
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:24,579
not going to end well. Yeah. I'd like to get behind comeback culture with you. I mean,

868
01:06:24,619 --> 01:06:29,719
people will say, how many, how many chances does someone need? As many as it could possibly take,

869
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:35,280
it's an infinite amount of chances. We're all going to make mistakes. It's this sort of joy

870
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:41,940
people get around, you know, seeing someone fall off their ledge and be taken out. It's horrific.

871
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:45,760
You know, I'm with you. We need to sort of support comeback culture in a big way. I love that term.

872
01:06:46,019 --> 01:06:46,840
Haven't heard it before.

873
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:49,480
Haven't heard it before. Who's been the greatest leader in your life, Hunter?

874
01:06:51,139 --> 01:06:56,960
Greatest leader in my life. I would say my grandfather. Yeah. I think he, I don't know why,

875
01:06:57,059 --> 01:07:00,800
but just really invested in me when I was young. Like there was some pretty tough years for me as

876
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:08,099
a really young kid. And yeah, he just, he just took me under his wing and, you know, really

877
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:13,719
invested in, you know, little things like he'd go give me 50 bucks to go give to that man who

878
01:07:13,719 --> 01:07:16,719
was experiencing homelessness or, you know, when,

879
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:21,980
when we were lucky enough to travel, he would bring a bunch of soccer balls and pens and papers

880
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:27,219
and he'd go, go kick with the kids who were, you know, over there on the street. And so just little

881
01:07:27,219 --> 01:07:33,559
things that started to shape my character. He really did. And he died in such an amazing way.

882
01:07:33,659 --> 01:07:38,960
He was planting a tree on a property so that there'd be more shade for the grandkids,

883
01:07:39,019 --> 01:07:43,139
which is similar to what we were talking about the other day. But yeah, I think that's a cracker

884
01:07:43,139 --> 01:07:46,739
of a way to go out having a heart attack doing that. But yeah, he really,

885
01:07:46,739 --> 01:07:51,099
was really important to me. And yeah. And also, you know, my parents have been fantastic

886
01:07:51,099 --> 01:07:55,380
and my step-parents and my mom's new partner as well. Got a tribe.

887
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:59,219
It's brilliant, isn't it? If you're lucky enough to have that in your life, but

888
01:07:59,219 --> 01:08:01,960
what was your grandfather's line again? Invest in-

889
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:06,139
Invest in experiences. Yeah. And it doesn't have to be monetary experiences, but it's just like

890
01:08:06,139 --> 01:08:12,019
find yourself in environments that are off brand for you. And yeah, that was one of the things I

891
01:08:12,019 --> 01:08:15,239
tried to do all through my twenties was just find myself in rooms of people who I'm like,

892
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:16,699
I should not be here, but-

893
01:08:16,739 --> 01:08:20,239
I'm here and I'm learning more about myself because it gives me more range and more tools

894
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:22,720
in my tool belt. I think I accidentally slipped over

895
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:27,560
collaboration, but I'll pick it up now. We really feel as though leaders more than ever

896
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:32,439
focused on collaboration. And I'm sure that is going to be a huge part. I can hear it already

897
01:08:32,439 --> 01:08:39,420
in what you're doing with stuff and with the man cave. But if you could collaborate with anyone

898
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:46,520
on any part of your life, who might it be? Oh, amazing. Well, I think collaboration

899
01:08:46,739 --> 01:08:50,359
has to go in terms of leadership hand in hand with trust. And I think that's a really important

900
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:55,960
part of my leadership journey. And yeah, just going, people are going to make mistakes and

901
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:00,060
yeah, I trust them that they'll keep coming back and doing a good job. So I think that's been big

902
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:05,800
in terms of who can I collaborate with? Well, listen, it depends on what area, but right now

903
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:10,760
I'm particularly with teenage boys. I'm really interested in who they are inspired by. So

904
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:16,279
I would love from an Australian context to like get Chris Hemsworth involved in what we're doing

905
01:09:16,739 --> 01:09:21,399
man cave. I think he'd be awesome. And then from a US context, there's a guy called Logan Paul,

906
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:26,819
who has like, he just understands the internet very well. Does he ever? Crazy. And a 12 year

907
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:33,100
old and a 15 year old. And, and, you know, I've had a quick lesson on Logan Paul. It's like,

908
01:09:33,619 --> 01:09:38,140
he's got it, hasn't he? With that age group. It is wild. These are the children that have

909
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:42,359
been raised by the internet, right? And he's part of that. So he gets the game better than the media

910
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:46,539
get the game. And this guy just happens to be an absolute specimen at the same time,

911
01:09:46,739 --> 01:09:50,920
too. Like he's, he's the one that's doing all the boxing. Yeah. Him and his brother, aren't they?

912
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:55,779
They, yeah. Challenge, you know, and have commercialized that in a serious way. Next

913
01:09:55,779 --> 01:10:00,600
level. And literally like they get culture, you know, they get how culture works. They're not,

914
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:05,079
they're now at a point where they're creating culture as well, which is like, that's the level

915
01:10:05,079 --> 01:10:09,319
of like Jay-Z, Kanye West, where you're creating, you're not just inheriting culture, you're creating

916
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:14,340
culture. So what's the culture they're creating on what? I guess it's like this internet generation

917
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:18,380
of you can do anything no matter who you are. Like we're in a time where power has been,

918
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:22,520
or some power has been democratized away from the big institutions. And we're seeing these kids,

919
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:27,140
you know, who are like, you know, mid twenties have more eyeballs and attention than like,

920
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:31,340
you know, the old school movie celebrities or the, like, you know, the big media houses.

921
01:10:31,779 --> 01:10:36,819
And, um, you know, Logan Paul, the fact that he can, you know, just, you know, be a fit guy,

922
01:10:36,819 --> 01:10:43,840
but also choose to fight Floyd Mayweather in his second professional boxing fight ever.

923
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:48,199
And not get knocked out. Okay. There's some size difference between them, but Floyd, you know,

924
01:10:48,279 --> 01:10:50,539
arguably the greatest boxer of all time. Yeah, correct.

925
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,600
To not, um, to, first of all, that's his second fight. And then I think his brother's fighting

926
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,180
like Anderson Da Silva or something. You know what? I know that because my 12 year old said

927
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:04,439
that to me last night, I got home from Adelaide and he said, Logan Paul's fighting Anderson. So

928
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:10,180
he's a legend of MMA and, and on the surface you're going, but that, that is tapped right

929
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:13,859
into that age group, isn't it? And we're talking, you know, when he fought Floyd,

930
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:18,979
we're talking paydays of hundreds of millions, aren't we? And we're in, you know, well past

931
01:11:18,979 --> 01:11:23,359
tens of millions of dollars. So, and it's like these guys get attention, right? Cause that's

932
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:30,739
all it is. It's sensationalized, um, storytelling of a little bit shocking and wild. And it's like,

933
01:11:30,739 --> 01:11:35,680
how does a YouTuber, you know, collaborate with or fight, you know, the, one of the best

934
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:39,760
boxers of all time, but then like collaborate with the other, his other arch nemesis, who

935
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:44,020
is a huge UK, um, uh, YouTuber.

936
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:48,180
They then decide to collaborate and create a drink company called Prime, which I'm

937
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:54,899
I know all about this, mate. I, I was in London, uh, watching my daughter row and, uh, and

938
01:11:54,899 --> 01:11:58,500
Max and Will before we left, you know, can you bring back some Prime from the UK?

939
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,720
Oh, I see where you're going, right?

940
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,479
It's like, what are you talking about?

941
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:06,420
I know. So Logan Paul, if you're listening or Chris Hemsworth, if anyone has any connections,

942
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:08,039
we're doing good work. It can really help.

943
01:12:08,039 --> 01:12:13,800
Wouldn't you love to see that? Because to, to use that audience and, and translate into

944
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:14,319
best for best.

945
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:19,960
A version of masculinity into what the man cave is doing. They would be great, uh, investors

946
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:25,399
in stuff. They would be, uh, you know, able to, to turn that huge audience for, for, well,

947
01:12:25,399 --> 01:12:30,100
I think for, you know, it's almost, you, you can't even not talk males and females at the

948
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:33,539
same time. I like the fact that you're saying, Hey, I'm going to specialize in this because

949
01:12:33,539 --> 01:12:38,220
it will impact, you know, perhaps the thing we might need to change most is horrific thing

950
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:42,720
of the way males treat women and, uh, uh, you know, more strength to your arm, who,

951
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,300
you know, who's going to say that you wouldn't, uh,

952
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:45,300
Yeah.

953
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,739
Get those collaborations and, and also all the work with, uh, with stuff from the man

954
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:52,600
cave, uh, look up Hunter Johnson's work. It's really profound. It's an incredible story

955
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:58,060
of, uh, combining, uh, intellect and skill with purpose and passion. It's, uh, it's incredible.

956
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:02,539
I really, yeah. Uh, I'm inspired by everything you do. Thanks for spending the time today.

957
01:13:02,539 --> 01:13:06,859
Mate, uh, right back at you. No, I really, really mean that. Thank you for being a role

958
01:13:06,859 --> 01:13:09,939
model. Like I really appreciate it. You know, we're talking about, it's kind of hard to

959
01:13:09,939 --> 01:13:14,100
pick who are the role models that we look to, given the uncertainty of where men and

960
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:17,640
masculinity is up to, and you know, you're someone I look to. So I just want to say I

961
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:21,239
really appreciate it. And again, thank you for the opportunity, you know, on the house

962
01:13:21,239 --> 01:13:25,859
of wellness to this right here. It makes a huge difference. So thank you.

963
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:30,060
Yeah. Thank you. And I, and the learning experience, uh, you know, from, uh, from meeting you at

964
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:34,180
Anna's property and, uh, and wanting to go back there and take the kids, the, the learning

965
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:38,939
is never ending. So, um, it's been a lot of, uh, a lot of fun, but also, um, profound.

966
01:13:38,939 --> 01:13:39,939
So thanks again.

967
01:13:39,939 --> 01:13:40,939
Thanks mate.
