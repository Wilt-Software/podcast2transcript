1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,320
a listener production. I generally enjoy this week's conversation on the Empowering Leaders

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,079
podcast. It's with the founder of the Man Cave, Hunter Johnson. The Man Cave is an incredible

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,100
not-for-profit that's changing the lives of young men around Australia. And you'll hear this right

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,920
throughout the conversation with Hunter, but I think it's their mission statement that says it

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,280
all. We're here to empower boys to become great men by providing them and their communities with

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:36,020
impactful programs, role models, and resources. The Man Cave is truly an incredible organization.

7
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,740
Hunter has impacted tens of thousands of boys since the Man Cave was founded in 2016. It's a

8
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:48,520
conversation that I thought was remarkable, one I really loved and was inspired by as a father of

9
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,219
four to see the impact Hunter has right around Australia, but also around the world. He's been

10
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:59,939
recognized with awards and grants to support the organization, the Man Cave, maybe the ultimate

11
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:00,259
record.

12
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,280
Perhaps of meeting the queen and collaborating with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, which is a

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,379
really amazing story. Social ventures like the Man Cave and people like Hunter Johnson who are

14
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:16,239
involved in this space are really linked to the passion of mine and something that we are exploring

15
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:22,019
at Alita, an organization founded with my great mate, Matt Waterwitz, where incredible leaders

16
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:27,959
come together to collaborate and learn from each other and open up about the world that they share

17
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,219
and sharing great learning and leading experiences.

18
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,739
If you're interested in this space, you can find it all at alitacollective.com. There are some

19
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:41,780
fantastic resources there. I would encourage you to check out our signature Alita Connect program

20
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:48,180
to get started and to understand how, like Hunter and the people at Man Cave, you're leading in your

21
00:01:48,180 --> 00:02:03,750
world. Hunter Johnson is driven by a lifelong passion for social change through seeing the

22
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:10,430
impact of mental illness and domestic violence. He saw the need to work with young men at a

23
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,530
young age to become great men for themselves, their relationships and their community. Hunter

24
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,969
co-founded the Man Cave in 2014 and has positively impacted tens of thousands of boys, parents and

25
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:25,770
teachers across Australia with programs that allow young men to explore and express their full

26
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,909
humanity. The vision of the Man Cave is to support a world in which every man has healthy relationships,

27
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:35,729
contributes to his community and reaches his full potential through empowering boys to become great

28
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:40,409
men by providing them with impactful programs, role models and resources.

29
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,969
Hunter, congratulations on the incredible work you do. Literally have changed the lives of tens of

30
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:51,610
thousands of young boys, turning them into healthy adults. Can I ask, where did that passion and drive

31
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,629
come from within you? Yeah, thank you. Well, first of all, it's so good to be here and hang out.

32
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,870
I've been looking forward to this for a while and excited to just unravel with you.

33
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:03,409
Great, man. The passion, listen, I grew up in a family

34
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:08,530
environment that I think encouraged me to be useful and get up to something that matters.

35
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,409
And I definitely rebel.

36
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:18,689
I probably used my leadership abilities for entertainment purposes more than anything else.

37
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:23,990
And yeah, but I think it's one of those things around family values as I got older and had more

38
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:29,930
experiences and recognize what's important to me. I just started to discover that I wanted to make

39
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,770
a difference. And I didn't necessarily know how to at the beginning, but I just tried a bunch of

40
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:39,789
things. And for me, it was a pretty important lesson that my grandfather really instilled in

41
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:40,409
me, which was to ensure that I was able to do what I wanted to do. And I think that's what I'm

42
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:40,629
going to do. And I think that's what I'm going to do. And I think that's what I'm going to do. And I

43
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:40,729
think that's what I'm going to do. And I think that's what I'm going to do. And I think that's what I'm

44
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:46,189
going to do. And I think the amount of different experiences, one of the things I've committed to

45
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:50,710
doing every single year is to invest in a life-changing experience and something that's

46
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:55,090
off-brand for me. So something I would never do. So one year I did, I'm still cringing,

47
00:03:55,449 --> 00:04:01,289
did a stand-up comedy course at NIDA. And I'm not like a funny guy. It's not like,

48
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,830
you know, and I remember sitting there at the like original circle where everyone's talking

49
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,189
about why they're at this course and people like, you know, I'm really funny. And this

50
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:11,849
person's like, I've always wanted to be a comedian. And I'm like, everything in my identity

51
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:15,289
is telling me not to be here. I'm shitting myself, but I figured I'd learn something.

52
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:19,930
So I think through investing in different experiences, I got to discover what I am

53
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,589
really passionate about. And for me, that's really at this point in my life, supporting

54
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:28,209
boys on their journey into manhood, because I know it's not just about young men having

55
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:32,529
a good life themselves. It's their relationships, it's their communities and who they'll be

56
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:35,870
in the world that we engage with. I love that advice from your grandfather,

57
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:38,149
invest in experiences, isn't it? It's often,

58
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:42,470
you know, we're quite often happy to spend money on things that don't mean a lot,

59
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,889
but we are reluctant sometimes, aren't we, to do something like you said. I mean,

60
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:50,170
that's a pretty brave experience. And then I want to go back to what you said before about

61
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:54,290
you grew up in a family where it was expected that you were going to do good. Can you break

62
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,490
that down a bit for me? What was that like? You just felt growing up that you need to find

63
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,569
purpose in your life. How was that come across to you? Yeah. So I guess I originally thought

64
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:08,129
I was going to play professional sport. I grew up in Sydney, so rugby was

65
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:14,250
what I loved and I built my whole identity around that. I had a really serious life and

66
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,689
life-threatening injury on the field when I was about 16. And that was in retrospect,

67
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:24,149
the worst, but also the best thing that ever happened to me. And it kind of slowed me down

68
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:28,569
off a path that I think I was heading down. And I definitely wasn't being myself. You know,

69
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:32,389
I was trying to just fit in with my mates and just play into a lot of the boyish behavior,

70
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:37,550
which I'm sure we're both familiar with at certain times. But yeah, I think, you know, my

71
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:43,170
dad is a psychologist, so he's done a lot of work in high performance and high performing teams.

72
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:48,990
And my mom is an entrepreneur. She does a lot of work in artificial intelligence and now how

73
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,269
artificial intelligence and consciousness relate, which is, that's a whole other podcast in and of

74
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:58,170
itself. They split up when I was like two years old. So I kind of grew up with two different

75
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:03,370
worlds, but I think just the environment that my family created of being people who just

76
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,170
challenged the system and wanted to create a better world subtly just impacted me.

77
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:12,550
And then when I started to pop out of my education at school, I was like, right,

78
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:17,350
what do I want to do? And, you know, for me, it was going and working at places like the National

79
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:22,050
Center of Indigenous Excellence in Sydney. And again, it just blew my world open. I got to see,

80
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:27,750
you know, my privilege, my whiteness, the opportunity I've had. And then that just

81
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,550
opened doors for me to realize that, okay, I've got all these gifts. I do come from a background

82
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,490
that, you know, as a white, you know, sporty guy, that means I can move through the world and do

83
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,850
certain things that other people can't. Okay. How am I going to put that to use? And that really

84
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,829
opened up for me when I moved down to Melbourne when I was about 21. And I started working at

85
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:51,629
an organization called the Foundation for Young Australians. And within two weeks, I was helping

86
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:56,889
run indigenous leadership programs in the Northern Territory, running an employment program for young

87
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:01,910
asylum seekers and refugees who'd just entered Australia to then learning about partnerships

88
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,170
and business development. And that's where it really opened up for me. And I worked out that

89
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,470
doing well financially, I was able to do that. And I was able to do that. And I was able to do that.

90
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,449
And doing good socially and not mutually exclusive. And I think that's a really exciting

91
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:17,069
thing that, you know, I can get paid to make an impact in this world, not just be about making

92
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:21,790
more and more and more money. So that's kind of, I guess, the essence. And then really, it's just

93
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,990
the power of the work now, you know, getting to have authentic, beautiful conversations with

94
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,649
teenage boys and just seeing that, how much it changes their life. I'm like, oh, that's all

95
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:35,329
the reward I need now. And I love that path, isn't it? Because, you know, so much of what we're

96
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,470
told at school, and you'd be at the coalface, and you'd be at the coalface, and you'd be at the

97
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,290
coalface of this, is that, what do you want to be? And pick your path, and your ATAR is so

98
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,449
important. But you look at you sampling a range of different things, you know, living the advice

99
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:48,990
that your grandfather told, and that there's a fair bit of diversity in that. And suddenly,

100
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:53,370
you've just stumbled across the essence of what you are, and to be able to turn that passion

101
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,709
into something for good. And I love what you said at the end there as well, Hunter, because I think

102
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:00,889
there's this thing that a lot of us want to do good, but we have our own families, and we think,

103
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:07,310
how am I going to support my family, run a social venture, or contribute in the meaningful

104
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:12,129
way that you are? And you're saying they're not mutually exclusive, that you can earn and still

105
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:15,250
live a good life and contribute at the same time. You've been able to strike that balance?

106
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:20,930
Yeah, I think it's independent to people's own personality types and, you know, career ambitions,

107
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,930
of course, you know. But I'm probably one of those, I guess, the next generation coming through that,

108
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,350
you know, wants to create a better world. And I think, you know, for me,

109
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:35,169
using a business mindset or commercial mindset to solve social problems is really interesting.

110
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:40,029
I'm like, well, that's a good challenge I want to sink my teeth into. And yeah, I also think we've

111
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:45,309
kind of grown up in this like very Western context, which is like accumulate more or like the way to

112
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:49,929
win the game is individual success, you know. But I've just sat in enough rooms with, you know,

113
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,710
some of the, you know, very fortunately sat in enough rooms with some of the wealthiest people

114
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,690
in this country. And I go, oh, they don't have anything that you and I don't. And actually,

115
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,730
external validation is never going to be the thing that fulfills you like internal validation does.

116
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,070
And I think I was just really lucky.

117
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:11,070
To see that firsthand in my early 20s. And it just came back to like, what is purpose? You know,

118
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,870
what is my purpose? How do I support others in fighting their purpose? And I think it's

119
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,129
really service is the gateway to that. It's like the best way to work out more of who you are,

120
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:26,350
because it's not about you. Yeah, really profound thing for you to understand at such a young age.

121
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:30,210
And, you know, a lot of us never get there. So the fact that you've been able to dedicate,

122
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:33,850
I want to dive into that passion a little bit. I hear you talk a lot about we've got to stop having

123
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,149
conversations.

124
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:41,070
about boys and start having more conversations with these young men. And I know you're really

125
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:46,710
across the, what I think is a national disgrace, the domestic violence stats and ever increasing

126
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,129
in recent time. You're really big about changing this narrative. Can you tell us, you know,

127
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:53,690
how you're going to go about solving it in your world?

128
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,990
Yeah, well, let's just start with the stats, just so we got the baseline there. So it's,

129
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:02,809
you know, one in three women is likely to experience physical or sexual abuse in their

130
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:05,149
lifetime. And then more than one woman every week.

131
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:11,610
In Australia is killed through intimate male partner violence. And it's just crazy. Like

132
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:17,309
we're in Australia, like what is going on? And I think for me, that's, there's like a sense of

133
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:23,669
like, almost not like a duty, but a responsibility. And I think we talked about this recently around

134
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:27,730
like, this isn't just for us. This is for our kids, kids, you know, like how do we start

135
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:32,769
thinking through that mindset? And for me, yeah, I just say often, you know, when I hear the terms,

136
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:34,870
even toxic masculinity, I don't use that.

137
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:39,870
Personally, I just feel like it's too divisive. But what I do think of is intergenerational trauma.

138
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,990
You know, a lot of the world, particularly in Australian, white Australian context,

139
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:49,429
the men who have gone away to war, you know, World War II and beyond, come back to Australia

140
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:55,070
to integrate, carrying extreme levels of trauma. And then that becomes how they parent, that becomes

141
00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:00,009
who they are in their workplaces. That then is, you know, sometimes consciously and unconsciously

142
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:04,009
transmissioned onto their kids. And then their kids grow up with that as a model of masculinity,

143
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,450
right?

144
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:09,649
And I just think we're at this time where we're, you know, a mythologist who I love,

145
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,710
a guy called Michael Mead talks about, we're in between stories. So what was, you know,

146
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,370
the model of masculinity for, you know, our fathers or grandfathers generation is different

147
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,190
to us now. Something new is being required, but we're kind of discovering, it's kind of,

148
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:26,929
we're alive, you know, like this is an active conversation. And I think it's like, we just

149
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:31,070
got to keep bringing it to the surface and have the space to have really messy,

150
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:33,570
politically incorrect conversations.

151
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:39,750
And I think, you know, whether it is the systems around domestic violence, gender equality or

152
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:46,570
mental illness, so much funding, so much funding goes to crisis management. And I'm like, why don't

153
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,669
we go preventative? Why don't we go and focus on boys' strengths rather than their deficits?

154
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:57,250
That is going to create a very different future for these young men who feel inspired and hopeful

155
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,389
opposed to growing up with a narrative that they're all bad and wrong and they need to be fixed.

156
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,429
I want to come back to that term toxic masculinity, get your thoughts,

157
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:09,110
but I think you sum it up really well and it resonates incredibly strongly with me. And,

158
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:14,710
you know, without having to get too deep into the political world, crisis is where funding goes

159
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:20,169
because it gets the most attention, it gets the headlines. But as we know, it's the sugar hit for

160
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:23,629
the short term. It's important too, when people are in crisis, we need to support them. But

161
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:28,509
that early intervention, preventative programs that are a generational change, what you're

162
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:33,370
talking about is getting to 12 and 13 year olds, giving them better language, understanding them

163
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:38,830
better. And the evidence is when you do, are you seeing meaningful change when you get in with

164
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,330
the man cave into schools and run those programs? Yeah, absolutely. I think, you know, just on that,

165
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:49,610
we learn from people we respect. And I think for us, the model is using super diverse,

166
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,970
very relatable male facilitators who go into high schools across the country. And they're like that

167
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,789
cooler cousin that your family get together, you know, who you just want to sit next to,

168
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:03,230
and you just want them to ask you, how are you going? You know? And, and I think the lesson

169
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:07,049
that we've found, particularly for these boys who have grown up in a really confusing time of

170
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:11,289
masculinity, where it's, you know, toughen up, don't cry, don't be gay, don't be like a girl.

171
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:14,870
But now it's like, cry more often, be more vulnerable. You know, you're privileged. You've

172
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,889
had it so good for so long. You're part of the patriarchy. You know, as for men, we're like,

173
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:23,590
fuck, how do we even navigate this? You know, let alone teenage boys and everything else that's

174
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:28,529
going on plus social media. So our whole thing is, you know, finding people who these boys are

175
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:33,090
inspired by and they want to be like. And the lesson there that we found is often the

176
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:38,009
is as important, if not more important than the message, which is a really different way to how

177
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:42,850
teaching is traditionally done. And so for us, we've now worked with, you know, 30,000, probably

178
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:49,690
35,000 young men across the country, and it's growing huge demand. And the whole thing for us

179
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:54,429
is creating spaces of psychological safety for these boys, where they feel probably for the

180
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:58,909
first time in their life, safe enough to take off the mask they're wearing and start to open up and

181
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:02,129
sit opposite their best mate and be like, this bloke's been my best mate for five years. And

182
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:06,850
I've just learned more about him in five minutes than five years of our friendship. And what we're

183
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,529
now starting to see as these boys are developing levels of emotional literacy, they're able to take

184
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:16,470
responsibility for their behavior. And suddenly they're not living into the script that the media

185
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,750
writes for them, which is young men are a problem to be solved. And that's the scary thing I think

186
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,809
is like often the stories we're told are what we become, and it kind of becomes a self-fulfilling

187
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:29,350
prophecy. And so what we're really trying to do is like create this positive future state for

188
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:36,409
non-binary people can get around and it's inspiring because that's just not a public

189
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,610
narrative that's out there right now. Yeah. It's interesting to hear, I mean,

190
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:45,509
sum that up incredibly well, just how confusing it is. You know, the needle goes from one extreme

191
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:50,950
to the other extreme. And, you know, as you said, for 47 year old adults, it's confusing.

192
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:56,009
It's challenging. You're nervous now with a microphone in front of you, not that you intend

193
00:14:56,009 --> 00:15:00,889
to say something that's going to upset anyone, but it's so nuanced now that you're almost

194
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:07,029
lucky to get through without, you know, trying to upset people. That's how delicate it seems

195
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:11,909
it's become. But fascinating to hear you say that it's more powerful is actually the messenger than

196
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:17,950
the actual message. So how do you find those role models with the values that clearly come out of

197
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:22,090
you? That must be challenging. And you really feel as though the messenger is the key, is it?

198
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:29,350
Yeah, absolutely. We have about 35 facilitators now who are very diverse and intersectional in

199
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,830
their backgrounds. You know, these are guys over the years, you know,

200
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:39,450
first nations people to former refugees and asylum seekers to Melbourne hipsters to, you know,

201
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:45,090
footy jocks to drama kids to musos that represent effectively the diversity of masculinity. So that

202
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:49,769
if we put these facilitators in front of a classroom of, you know, it might be young Islamic

203
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:56,070
men, they see someone like them, they go, shit, that's possible. I can be like that. And yeah,

204
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:59,750
the really important thing for us is we train these guys like a sports team. You know,

205
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,929
they're walking into rooms of teenage boys who have,

206
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:08,309
amazing bullshit detectors. They sniff fear out a mile away. They will test you to see if you can

207
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:12,490
hold it. And, you know, it's a rowdy group of boys. That's like one of the hardest things to

208
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,529
capture the attention of, let alone get them to talk about their feelings afterwards.

209
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:17,870
It's a high bar when you sum it up like that, isn't it?

210
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:21,789
Yeah, big time. And that's, you know, remember high school, high school's intense. You know,

211
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,769
high school's about a social hierarchy. You know, you work out who you need to be. You play that

212
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:29,690
persona. Sometimes that works for people. Sometimes that doesn't. And, you know, for us,

213
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,049
a really important thing we've had to train and be,

214
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:36,129
discerning about with our facilitators is this isn't people coming back for their own therapy.

215
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:40,889
You know, this isn't them coming back to, you know, come in on a shining horse, you know,

216
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,889
with the armor on. It's like, no, we're here to do the best job we can possibly do. And yet we get

217
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:50,049
some great recognition and support out of it. But there are people who are doing a lot more intense

218
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:54,509
work on the front line to support humanity than us that do not get the recognition or attention.

219
00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:00,110
So come in and be really humble about this. So yeah, one of the, I think learning, I didn't grow

220
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,070
up knowing what a facilitator was. Like,

221
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:06,470
even, you know, how you can host this and like, it's a full skill set. And there's a difference

222
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:11,410
between presenting and facilitating too. Presenter might come in with a PowerPoint presentation that

223
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:16,509
takes you through a script. A facilitator has the ability to withdraw out information,

224
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:22,569
which actually is like the epidemiology of the word educator is to draw out, not to put in,

225
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:26,849
which is actually very different to how we educate people. And so for us, training people on how to

226
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:31,329
facilitate so they can walk into a room of these teenage boys and understand who's the jock that

227
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:32,109
just wants a bit of power. And then they can come in and say, hey, I'm going to do this. I'm going to

228
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:32,569
do this. And then they can come in and say, hey, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. And then

229
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:32,609
they can come in and say, hey, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

230
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:36,269
You know, that wants to be the center of attention. How do you mobilize him for, you know,

231
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:40,950
leadership abilities, not just in, as we were joking before, in entertainment ways, but in,

232
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,329
you know, leadership ways. Who's the kid who's, you know, the quiet observer at the back that

233
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:48,769
doesn't offer much, but when he does, it's gold. Or who's the kid that's going to derail the

234
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:52,509
classroom because he's an oversharer. You eventually get to work out these patterns

235
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:58,049
just from FaceTime with the boys. And you learn how to take them on a journey basically to

236
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:02,410
creating an environment where they feel safe to be themselves, which a lot of them haven't felt

237
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,609
because they mostly exist in a culture of banter. Yeah. And it's such, as you said, you go back,

238
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:10,730
it can be a brutal environment as we know, and it's where it does get lost. And sometimes

239
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:16,150
some of those young boys don't ever get it back because of what happens in that environment. And

240
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:20,890
that happens in all parts of the country. I want to go back to the needle going too far. There was

241
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:27,309
a story recently in a Victorian school where they made all the boys stand up. I can see you nodding.

242
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:31,190
It's a story I'm sure you know, and turn to their female colleagues and apologize

243
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:37,549
for effectively being male. I mean, I'm sure that that's not helpful. I'm sure the intentions are

244
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:42,690
good. Is that what's happening too often now is that we're over-correcting in some ways to try

245
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,789
and address this problem? Do you feel that way? I don't think there's an easy answer to this. I

246
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:51,750
think it's really layered and nuanced. And I think, yeah, in that circumstance, there was a lot of

247
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:57,289
backlash from these boys who felt like they weren't part of the group of boys who were

248
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:02,849
cause the issue at the school. But it's also really layered, right? Because we are in a system

249
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:09,710
which is called the patriarchy, which effectively means that things are designed in a way that

250
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:14,970
benefits men. But the challenging thing is we've been born into that. You and I didn't choose that,

251
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:19,789
but we're kind of in it. And it also, I think what gets lost when even when we talk about

252
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:25,690
the patriarchy, the big scary word that it is, is that some people can interpret it going that

253
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,289
their life isn't hard.

254
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:31,029
You know, things haven't been a struggle for them. And that's not the conversation.

255
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,529
It's a conversation around privilege. And my journey with privilege, you know, as a white

256
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:40,089
dude is really just kind of understanding that privilege isn't necessarily a dirty word,

257
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:46,630
but it's how I use it, right? And I think often they say that privilege is invisible to those

258
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:52,769
who have it. So for my friends who are people of color, when they walked into a room, you know,

259
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:56,470
when they looked into a mirror when they were younger, they saw someone who was brown.

260
00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:01,210
I was probably mid-20s before I even registered that I was white, you know, consciously, right?

261
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:06,210
I just thought that's how things were. So I think we've got a long way to kind of move through this

262
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:14,329
very edgy, very emotional, very personal space around where masculinity is up to. Because one

263
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:19,309
of the things that I think is important is it might not be our fault that we're born into a

264
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:23,809
system like this, but I do think it is our responsibility to do something around creating

265
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:27,190
a more equal world. And that doesn't have to be, you know, this big,

266
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:31,769
huge thing. It can just be who you are in your relationships, in your family, in your

267
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:35,230
friendships. And I think just starting there. And we always think that's a great place to

268
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,410
start, Hunter, isn't it? That ability to impact positively. And you're right. I mean,

269
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:45,670
in that exact bracket as you, you know, sporting background, white male, haven't got the slightest

270
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:50,109
understanding really what it's like to not live your world because it's very hard to, isn't it?

271
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:53,950
And you like to think you have empathy and you want to have these conversations, but you're

272
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,289
right. I mean, it's that privilege still feels as though then it becomes,

273
00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:01,250
a slur almost as opposed to, well, it's just sort of the reality of what you grew up in.

274
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:05,509
It doesn't mean you can't meaningfully have an impact and try and understand and try and have

275
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:11,390
better empathy. I said, we'll come back to the term toxic masculinity because it's a hot one

276
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:15,410
that, isn't it? And I like your, and this is to me, the thing that's, the art that's been lost

277
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,809
is having uncomfortable conversations and where does it sit? I mean, are you comfortable with

278
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:24,470
that word and what it means? Listen, I get it's really important for certain people,

279
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,670
given the life experiences and

280
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:32,190
probably the, you know, trauma or abuse that they may have experienced because it becomes,

281
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:37,109
you know, language is a tool and it can be used as a tool to agitate in which to have uncomfortable

282
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:42,369
and messy conversations. So I get, I get the point of it and what it represents. I think where the

283
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:48,369
nuance often gets lost, particularly with teenage boys and a lot of men is this assumption that

284
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:52,930
it's like a brush that means that all men are toxic. And it's, it's my understanding is that's

285
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:57,049
not the intention of it. The intention of it is to identify that there are some toxic

286
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:03,730
behaviors that are part of probably some more traditional masculine beliefs around being a man

287
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:09,430
is about conquest, power, control, dominance, individual success, believing in very rigid

288
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:15,609
gender norms, you know, being homophobic. You know, your masculinity is like how good you are

289
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:19,650
at sport or how good looking you are or how much money you make, right? Well, these are kind of

290
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:24,410
traditional marketing things more than anything else. And I think what we're starting to evolve

291
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,289
out of now is going, okay, well, how do we develop more range in our masculinity?

292
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:32,890
You know, how is it that we can be stoic, but the next day we can be vulnerable and this becomes

293
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:37,809
a practice. It's a training ground. And yeah, I think for me, you know, one of the things,

294
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:42,369
you know, with the workshops we run, I remember when the term first came out, you know, a female

295
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:46,329
teacher at a school pulled me aside and was like, oh, these boys are all toxic. And I was like,

296
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:51,490
okay, we'll just be really like careful with that term because have you actually explained to them

297
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:56,470
what toxic masculinity means? And when you say that and she goes, no, I go, okay, so let me,

298
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,289
let's just pause the, pause the, pause the, pause the, pause the, pause the, pause the, pause the,

299
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:00,970
pause the whole session here. Hey fellas, can I get you to raise your hand if you've heard of

300
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:06,089
the word toxic masculinity or words? They all burst out laughing. And I'm like, all right. I'm

301
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:10,910
like, who knows what it means? No hands go up. There's 50 boys just sitting there, but then they

302
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,990
can make an assumption of what it means. And then they live into it because if they're going to be

303
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,109
told they're naughty, they're going to be naughty. Right. And I think one of the things that

304
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:23,569
particularly around teenagers is when you're told not to do something, that's like the gateway to

305
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,930
go do it, you know? And, and I think, you know, if these boys are being told,

306
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:31,329
you know, be good boys, but you know, don't be like that. They're gonna try and flex their,

307
00:23:31,329 --> 00:23:36,009
you know, identity in different ways. And, you know, that's probably something which I assume

308
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:40,750
you would have talked about on the Anna Rubenstein podcast as well. Yeah. And, um, yeah, good point

309
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:45,730
to, uh, to jump in there. The, the family connection with, uh, with Anna and I had the,

310
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:50,890
um, great pleasure the day I was out at, uh, his property. And I love that catch up. It had so much

311
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,809
reflection for me as a, as a father of four and, you know, the rites of passage. If you haven't

312
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:57,269
heard Anna's podcast, I encourage you to go and do it.

313
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:03,390
It is so much a wisdom in, in how to, um, raise teenagers and bringing back the rites of passage.

314
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:09,170
And, um, I know where his partner is your mother and I got, I got to see you, uh, that day. How

315
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:13,809
much, um, has he influenced you in, in, in this stage of your life? Cause it feels like your work

316
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:19,410
is pretty, uh, pretty close, uh, cousins. Yeah. That's, it's funny. We, um, there's

317
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:23,430
definitely something higher going on. We both joke around. We go, no idea how this has happened,

318
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:27,269
but we're here. Um, but yeah, so I, when I was, when Man Cave was just,

319
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:32,890
just a concept, you know, when I was like 21 and I remember I pitched at some event and this guy

320
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,509
was like, you got to go meet this guy, Arne Rubenstein. And I was like, who? I couldn't

321
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:39,569
even pronounce his name. Like Arne Rubenstein? Like, sorry, done a TED talk, written a book.

322
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,490
I was like, okay, this seems pretty legit. And, um, anyway, I caught up with him in this like

323
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,829
dingy cafe in Sydney. And, uh, first thing he said to me was, what's your story? I was like,

324
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:52,589
who is this guy? And, um, anyway, that was kind of the inception of our, I guess,

325
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:57,269
relationship was him, um, going, well, you should come up to my property and do my rites of passage.

326
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:01,769
Leadership training. And that opened up a whole world for me because I remember we ran this,

327
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:05,569
he took us through a rite of passage and a rite of passage for anyone who hasn't listened is

328
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:11,630
effectively a structured transition from one state to another. And it could be, um, a rite

329
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,970
of passage could be, you know, a bar mitzvah or a wedding, um, or it can be intentionally designed

330
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:21,769
to transition from one state of psychology to the next, which was used to initiate particularly

331
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:27,130
young men into their manhood for effectively eons, right? It's a technology of human nature

332
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:27,269
as well.

333
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:31,829
I relate to it. And we obviously don't have a lot of rite of passage in our context now. It's

334
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:35,210
kind of like go to schoolies, get drunk first time, might be doing drugs, whatever it is.

335
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:40,630
And that was his point that if you don't formalize it, we make it up as kids and that's what plays

336
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:45,630
out, isn't it? You, your rite of passage is school is weak or, or the crazy behavior that we all

337
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:49,410
probably went down the path without it being formalized. Yeah. So that was, that was the

338
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,349
genesis really of where you started with Man Cave, wasn't it?

339
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:55,130
Yeah, exactly. So I kind of had this concept. I didn't really know where to begin,

340
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,690
went to the training. And I remember,

341
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:02,049
one of the final components of a rite of passage is to, is an honoring. So you go through this big

342
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:06,369
experience, huge challenge. You create a vision for who you want to be after you let go of the

343
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:10,190
behaviors you want to step into. And then there's an honoring. And at the end of the honoring,

344
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,529
I remember I was in front of this guy who just made a huge impact on me. And I realized I couldn't

345
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:18,589
even articulate what I wanted to feel. I felt this like emotional block. I was like, I don't

346
00:26:18,589 --> 00:26:24,569
have bloody language to tell him. I'm like, I need to go look at this. Like, I can't speak.

347
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,569
And that was like the moment,

348
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:31,369
where like the kind of, I got cracked open a bit. I was like, okay, there's something here. My soul

349
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:37,369
has been drawn to something bigger, higher than me. And I don't know why, but I have to keep going

350
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:42,490
down this path. And so, yeah, I've, I've, you know, run some of the most incredible or been a

351
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,450
part of some of the most incredible experiences of my life with, you know, with Onana's property

352
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:51,769
and Yarra Kura up behind Mullumbimby with, you know, 50 men and the boys in their lives,

353
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:56,329
taking them through a four-day rite of passage. And it is truly magical. Like if I,

354
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:03,150
probably skeptical of is magic real, you know, previously, but what I've seen is truly,

355
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:08,009
truly incredible. And it's really interesting because a lot of the, um, the men think they're

356
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:13,230
taking the boys there for the boys, but it is as profound and special for the men, if not more.

357
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:18,029
Can't wait to experience it. And, uh, I'm looking forward to, I've got two in that zone still that,

358
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:23,809
uh, I'm, uh, I'm on the path to, to having been at the property and seen, as you said,

359
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,670
there is something magic about just walking up the driveway.

360
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,990
And, and then, um, he ends up with your mom as well. So

361
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:38,190
I know. So yeah, I remember somehow they got connected and, um, he was like, Hey,

362
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:42,890
I keep hearing about your mom. I'm like, that's weird. I was like, well, I guess if you're a

363
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:47,950
mentor of mine, that's pretty good criteria. Mom was single at the time. So they've since

364
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:52,569
been together for about seven or eight years now. Ah, brilliant. I love it. Uh, can I ask you,

365
00:27:52,569 --> 00:27:56,509
there'll be a lot of parents listening to this and, you know, we want our kids to be

366
00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:01,509
emotionally intelligent. We want them to be resilient and, and that's the space you deal

367
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:05,670
in every day. What, what, what do you, what do you say to parents? How do we raise particularly

368
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:09,289
our young boys? That's your space to be emotionally intelligent and resilient.

369
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:16,009
First of all, as you are the role model, they are always watching. And I think we as a society get

370
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:21,210
very good at telling people things, but actually living the values and the actions. Like it's that

371
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:26,490
whole concept of deeds, not words is the most important thing. So they're always watching.

372
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:31,549
Right. And one of the most powerful things as a parent is to admit your faults. If you've made

373
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:37,130
mistakes to let go of any pride and use that as teachable moments inside of your relationship with

374
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:42,910
the kids in your life, that is deeply profound and deeply healing because they get to see you as yes,

375
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:47,809
a parent, but also as a person. And that role models to them from a very young age

376
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:53,269
that it's okay to take responsibility for your behavior. Excuse me. Second thing is,

377
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:56,470
is sharing your story. You know, what was life like when you,

378
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:03,829
you know, five, six, 15, 25, not through the lens of philosophizing or giving life advice,

379
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:07,690
but genuinely what were some of the things that happened to your life that shaped who you are and

380
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:13,069
your character? And then the third thing I'll say is seeing their unique gifts and talents.

381
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:17,890
So again, coming back to this concept of honoring or acknowledging them, not validating them for

382
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:21,849
their performance. Like, you know, Johnny did a good job because he kicked six goals on the weekend,

383
00:29:21,849 --> 00:29:26,269
but actually had Johnny, you know, I saw how you treated your friend the other day. And I really,

384
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:31,670
respect your kindness. I love seeing that side of you. So this whole concept of getting kids to

385
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:36,410
understand that their internal validation of themselves, first of all, is the most important

386
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:40,769
thing. But if you can internally validate the things about their character, that's so important.

387
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:45,089
External validation is just very temporary. We know this. So I think they're just three

388
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:50,269
low hanging fruit. Well, I think that's a sort of parenting masterclass in lots of ways. And

389
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:55,269
it's the parenting puzzle, I call it, because you want to always describe it as the thing that you

390
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,069
think about.

391
00:29:56,269 --> 00:30:02,430
I certainly do. And you want to be as profoundly good at it as anything, but often you're fumbling

392
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:06,710
your way through. But it resonates with me putting your hand up when you get it wrong. And that's

393
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,690
something Beck and I have always tried to do. It probably wasn't something past generations

394
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:16,130
had in their repertoire at all. And it's incredibly powerful because we do get it wrong. You blow up

395
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:20,490
or you yell at them and you know you overstepped the mark. But when you actually sit down and just

396
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:24,269
say, hey, look, I got that wrong. I'm really sorry. I had a bad day. And we did. That is a

397
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:26,250
really profound thing. And like I said, it's a really powerful thing. And I think it's a really

398
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:33,569
powerful thing, isn't it? Over-celebrating the moments as opposed to just the qualities that you

399
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:39,529
see. And you see a lot of that in the junior sporting world that you see. There's just so much

400
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:43,349
focus on achievement as opposed to the character that you talk about.

401
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:49,089
I think just the other bit I'll jump in there, Luke, is anger is really important. And anger

402
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:53,950
gets really shut away in our society. Anger is an important part of our emotional range as a human.

403
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,630
And I think role modeling,

404
00:30:56,269 --> 00:31:01,250
that we sometimes do get angry and things do kind of open up and potentially explode. But you also

405
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,130
have the ability to come back and recognize that and go, well, that wasn't who I wanted to be in

406
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:09,990
that moment. But I'm not going to hide this away from you. This is who I am. And of course,

407
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:15,349
be responsible with your anger, of course. But understanding that that isn't something to just

408
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:19,890
suppress because then that manifests in some really unhealthy ways that we see later in life

409
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:24,609
too. And again, it's just practice. It's not about being a polished parent. It's just about

410
00:31:24,609 --> 00:31:25,789
being a parent of character.

411
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:30,950
Yeah. Well said again, isn't it? It's funny that the anger part is the thing I reckon I always

412
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:35,950
helpful when you're playing AFL football. Not so helpful sometimes when you're

413
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:40,069
losing your cool around the home. And that's something I've wrestled with. But you're right.

414
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,490
Someone's breaking the door down in the house. You don't want to have forgotten your anger

415
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:47,809
because that's appropriate. And sometimes it's appropriate, as you said, around the house. It's

416
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:53,089
when you're, as you said, not pretending it's not there or not part of who you are. As you said,

417
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:55,490
that suppression becomes a challenge. And that,

418
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,410
guilt sort of cycle kicks in a bit then.

419
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:03,269
Yeah. And I think as well, like for masculinity, where we're up to now, like life is very sterile.

420
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:07,670
You know, we're not out doing the things that we used to do. And I think there is this inherent

421
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:14,049
desire in men to push ourselves, you know, to be in extreme circumstances, to feel this deep

422
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:17,930
sense of brotherhood, which often we do get through sport, but often that trails off for so

423
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:22,589
many people, but there's still this desire. So I think, you know, for me, there's this beautiful

424
00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:25,769
quote that you don't give a sword to a man who can't dance.

425
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:31,269
And I really love that, right? Because there's this, what for that, for me, it talks to this

426
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:36,069
balance of like, you know, if the man is in touch with himself and he's got range and he can be

427
00:32:36,069 --> 00:32:40,930
playful and silly and creative, but also, you know, he can step into, if he needs to be dangerous to

428
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:45,549
protect his family, then that's something that's important. And I think it's just because we also

429
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:50,609
hear so many very horrific stories around men who have been really irresponsible with their

430
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:55,430
masculinity and their violence, that then a lot of it gets shut away. But like,

431
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:59,769
I know for me, and I assume with you, sport was an incredible training ground for understanding my

432
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:05,470
body, understanding the physicalness inside of who I am. And I loved it. But again, if we look back

433
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:09,569
at humanity, like that's been an important part of masculinity forever, is training, wrestling,

434
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:13,970
hunting, you know, going out to protect is a really important part of who we are. And it's

435
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,970
only in very recent times that things have been really sterilized and we just watch Netflix.

436
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:22,549
Well, I love that you brought that up. And my mind's going to Steve Biddle for the brilliant

437
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:24,970
author of Raising Boys, Raising Girls. He's sold,

438
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:31,250
four million copies of probably globally one of the most renowned authors in the space of how we

439
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:38,490
bring up our kids. And he talks about audience of women and what they want out of a male partner in

440
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:42,569
these days. And he breaks it down beautifully. I think about this all the time. It's like,

441
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:48,069
we do want to see that empathy and we want that care and genuine connection. But you listen to

442
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:53,170
him at the same time, they go, I don't want a guy soft. I want a guy, he breaks it down to heart

443
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,269
and to backbone. It's the two things. So if you can,

444
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:59,670
if you can have those two sides to you, it's very possible. You still want to have that strength.

445
00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:03,490
They want, you want to have some go and you want to have, as you said, the protector of your family

446
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:09,210
is not a bad thing to have as part of, but is the heart there with it? Is it not a bad way to think

447
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:13,349
about it? I think. Yeah. And it's interesting, even in, so Brené Brown, who you might be familiar

448
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:17,730
with, does a lot of work around vulnerability and courage. I remember in her book, Daring Greatly,

449
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,730
she talked about interviewing a bunch of women if they actually want men to be vulnerable.

450
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,389
A lot of the women said, no.

451
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:30,289
Again, this is this like kind of confusing time where it's like, no, I want my man to be stoic and

452
00:34:30,289 --> 00:34:34,929
strong, but then also at times, you know, maybe I don't want that. You know, I want him to be in

453
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:39,570
touch with his masculinity and hold himself together, but maybe I do want it to be, you know,

454
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:43,989
open. So again, I just use that as an example of like, it's just really late. I don't think

455
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:49,309
there's this like one clean answer. It's like, we're moving through this time in between stories

456
00:34:49,309 --> 00:34:54,610
where, you know, the models of masculinity that helped us get, you know, from A to B previously

457
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,309
are not necessarily the models we need to get forward now.

458
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:03,510
There's a great example in my mind, and I hope this will remain timeless given the interview,

459
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:08,389
but the AFL Grand Final has just happened. And I feel like sports transformed itself.

460
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:14,949
The senior coaches now have really moved away from the old hierarchy of coaches and, you know,

461
00:35:14,969 --> 00:35:18,449
a lot of personal abuse. And we sort of laugh about it now, but it was pretty crazy. You

462
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,369
probably would have experienced it as well, but they're really empathetic.

463
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:24,369
Joel Selwood's the premiership captain in Geelong. If you haven't, go and look up Joel

464
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:24,590
Selwood. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great

465
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:28,909
guy. And look at him on Grand Final. One of the bravest, toughest warriors that ever played our

466
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:34,250
game. One of the greatest players of all time. But his thought process Grand Final day was

467
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:41,469
taking out Gary Ablett, his teammate's child, who's got severe genetic illness. So post Grand

468
00:35:41,469 --> 00:35:47,809
Final, their water boy is a beautiful young Down syndrome boy. He's onto the field. He spent the

469
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:51,610
next 10 hours, we find, with Joel. He rang his mum on the ground and said, hey, I've got,

470
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,449
I can't think of the young boy's name. I wish I could at the moment. But,

471
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,710
you know, you go, that is sort of a living, breathing example, authentically

472
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:03,190
understanding that brilliant heart and as tough and brave as you can come. So

473
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:08,610
it's out there. We're seeing those, as you said, the examples we need to share more often,

474
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:13,949
don't you? Because when it is as brilliant as that, it's a pretty profound thing to see for sure.

475
00:36:13,949 --> 00:36:18,309
I just love those stories so much, right? And particularly with these people that transcend

476
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:24,590
the game, you know, like it becomes about humanity and like just wholesome,

477
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:29,449
as opposed to, yeah, Grand Final, awesome. But like, think about what this means to the family,

478
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:33,769
the kids, you know, the guy who walked up into the crowd who has Down syndrome that he hugged,

479
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:37,389
you know, like all of that, just so profound. And I think we are starting to see that,

480
00:36:37,469 --> 00:36:41,590
which is a really interesting thing to note. Like, you know, I think even LeBron James in the NBA,

481
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:47,329
what he does outside of the sport is incredible for supporting black and minority communities.

482
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,489
But at the same time, like I know there's that like Sonny Bill Williams example,

483
00:36:50,489 --> 00:36:54,510
when they won the World Cup, the All Blacks, he walked over, this kid,

484
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,909
jumped the fence in the stadium and he gives him his medal.

485
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,690
Security guards were wrestling the kid to the ground. That's right.

486
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:07,070
And I remember that. They're profound moments, aren't they? For sure. I want to talk, you know,

487
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:12,010
Hunter, about, you know, a lot of people have the idea of wanting to do good and then you start a

488
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:16,469
not-for-profit. That is no easy thing to do and you've got to get funding. And I want to talk

489
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:21,369
about what you're doing now. You're creating your own brand, cool stuff. You've got some serious

490
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:23,829
investors, a couple of former Wallaby captains.

491
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:29,469
On board your investment group. Tell us about the complexity of what you're doing and how you're

492
00:37:29,469 --> 00:37:33,710
going about it. Yeah, I love talking about this because I think, you know, speaking from the

493
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:38,869
heart space like we've done just is awesome. But also like I love, you know, problem solving and

494
00:37:38,869 --> 00:37:44,309
I love the concept of how do we leverage business to create a better world for everyone. And so

495
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:49,730
Man Cave, Man Cave's a charity. We're about 60% funded by philanthropy, high net worth grants,

496
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:54,510
about 35% of our income comes from charging schools on their socioeconomic status.

497
00:37:54,610 --> 00:38:00,349
So private schools will pay a premium or we work with regional and lower socioeconomic schools that

498
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:05,289
pay a subsidy. And then about 5% is like community fundraising. So about four years ago, I was like,

499
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:09,550
right, how do we diversify our income streams? We've got all this demand. Like it actually came

500
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:14,269
after I got an award from the Queen, which was amazing. I was over in Buckingham Palace and

501
00:38:14,269 --> 00:38:15,250
Got to meet the Queen?

502
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:18,630
Got to meet the Queen. It was a live stream through the Royal Family's Facebook page. I

503
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,769
didn't know they had, but yeah, literally in Buckingham Palace. And there was like, you know,

504
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:24,550
a black gospel choir behind me.

505
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:29,949
It was like, I remember this moment. I, as I'm walking up, like knowing it's on national TV in

506
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:34,090
the UK and back in Australia, it was about four years ago. And I'm walking out the very front,

507
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:37,909
I'm just panicking. I'm going to faint. And I'm just going, oh, come on. And I remember going,

508
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:42,210
all right, look over, you walk in the front, you're about to like meet the Queen, bow down,

509
00:38:42,309 --> 00:38:45,989
she'll say a few words to you. And I look over and there's like the former prime minister,

510
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:54,429
there's like Harry, Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, a few Olympians. And then I see David Beckham.

511
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:59,909
And I'm like, epic. And I'm like, okay, do the right thing. Look at everyone as they're looking at

512
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:03,769
you. They'll probably look at the Royal Family. I just look at Beckham straight away. And then he

513
00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:10,710
just winks at me and I just twitch back at him. I was like, oh God, I just crushed my cringiest

514
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:18,050
moment ever. But yeah, you know, after that award, I got one of the like chaperones, I don't even

515
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:22,130
know the name of it, came up to me and said, Harry would like to meet you. And they just showed the

516
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,070
video in Buckingham Palace.

517
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:28,869
I joke that the Australian accent has never sounded more bogan than in that moment there,

518
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:33,969
but it was memorable. And so I got taken into this room and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle

519
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:38,150
walked in and they knew everything we were doing at the man cave. Harry really got it from a mental

520
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:42,590
health perspective because, you know, his journey, which we only see the tabloid version, you know,

521
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:46,969
him losing his mum when he was like six and then like going on his own mental health journey,

522
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:52,690
but in the public eye, then going and serving in Afghanistan on the front line. Then he sets up

523
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,590
a

524
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:59,289
he's a chair of the Commonwealth Youth Foundation. So largely the Commonwealth, which is like 2.3

525
00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:03,070
billion people, 50 odd countries, largely developing countries. So he's on the front

526
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:08,070
line meeting these people. Then he comes back and sets up Invictus Games. Like we don't hear that

527
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:13,449
story. And then, you know, he chooses his family values, his intimate family values over the system

528
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:17,269
that he's inherited. So it's just a very different narrative. Anyway, so I'm speaking, I'm going,

529
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:23,610
this guy's a legend. And then Meghan Markle comes over. She's like, listen, I really love this from

530
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:24,590
a gender equality perspective. And I'm like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't

531
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:29,110
know. Like, let us know how we can help. And I was like, what do you respond to that? And that

532
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:33,150
brought a lot of attention for us. And so I was like, great. Okay. We've got schools across the

533
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:37,670
world coming to us. Like we're still pretty young charity. How the hell do we capitalize on this?

534
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:43,690
And so at the time I saw a lot of social impact businesses starting to be born, like, thank you.

535
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:49,130
Who gives a crap? Tom organic. And I was like, right, there's nothing in the masculinity space.

536
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:54,550
All the marketing is super misogynistic, very old, you know, spray yourself with a double can

537
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:58,869
of wings. You know, the girls will come chasing you. And we, we both know that doesn't work.

538
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:04,730
And, you know, all the old spice guy, you know, on the horse and it's like, it's so silly,

539
00:41:04,889 --> 00:41:09,230
but it's like, you know, ages of like 12, you know, 11, 12 years old boys are, you know,

540
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:13,550
being exposed to that. And we wonder where this like real subtle objectification begins.

541
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:17,289
Yeah. And you laugh at it, don't you? But you, you, you laugh at it because it's so ridiculous,

542
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:22,769
but, but yeah, subliminally, as you said, it becomes reality, doesn't it? And I love what,

543
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:24,570
so your idea is to,

544
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:30,329
to tap into that space stuff as a brand and, and use, you know, some of the proceeds of that to

545
00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:33,349
fund the man cave. Exactly. Tell it what sort of products you get getting into.

546
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:37,329
Yeah. So we, we effectively early days were like, right, it has to be a commercial product.

547
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:43,050
We know that at the end of the day, good marketing just helps a bad product fail faster. And we can't

548
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:47,150
rely on the fact we have a social purpose. It's got to be really high quality. And I just did a

549
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:51,510
lot of research and saw that the men's grooming space hadn't been disrupted in a while, but huge

550
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,530
potential, no real Australian brands out there that are doing like,

551
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:59,829
what I would say a job that reflects modern masculinity really well. And, um, that was

552
00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:04,610
the inception. And so, yeah, basically I've been very, very lucky to work with people who've worked

553
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:09,349
in some of the biggest brands in Australia and pull them in both to work in staff as a staff

554
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:14,530
member or an investor, you know, who've worked at ESOP, you know, Mecca, Thank You, Afterpay,

555
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:19,530
Country Road, Swiss, um, Meijer. So they've worked in brands before and I've managed to

556
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:24,550
pull them by the values and get them to work, uh, with us at stuff. And effectively we chose,

557
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:28,050
the name cause it's super simple and, you know, stuff for your pits, stuff for your face,

558
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:33,610
stuff for your head and body. And basically, yeah, we, uh, we launched in, uh, February last year.

559
00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:38,630
Uh, we've now secured distribution through Woolies, which is awesome. Like really good to do

560
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:43,909
after just about a year and a bit of being in the wild. Huge effort. Huge effort. And, um, yeah,

561
00:42:43,909 --> 00:42:49,829
so basically we've got, um, uh, moisturizers, face scrub, face wash, shaving gel, um, body

562
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:54,329
wash shampoos, deodorants, and we're soon to release an SPF in, in coming for summer.

563
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:59,269
Yeah. Um, Ian Thorpe has just come on as an investor, uh, an ambassador as well,

564
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:03,889
just given his story, super aligned. Yeah. And, um, what I've really tried to curate from

565
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:09,150
an investor point of view is like really values aligned investors and, you know, a saying,

566
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:13,570
which I'm sure you're familiar with, it's kind of summarizes it really like a no dickhead policy.

567
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:18,909
So just like people who are in this, yes, um, to, you know, do good, but also there's an

568
00:43:18,909 --> 00:43:23,449
opportunity for commercial return. And so how we set up the business is that Man Cave, the charity

569
00:43:23,449 --> 00:43:28,070
is the largest shareholder in the business. The rest is split between the investors. And then

570
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:33,110
for every thousand dollars in sales, it'll fund a boy from a low socioeconomic community to go

571
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,909
through the Man Cave. So really we just give consumers that point of purchase decision going,

572
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:42,510
I can choose, you know, links or old spas or whatever it may be, or I can choose, uh, stuff,

573
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:46,329
which I know will help a boy become a better man. That's actually about his relationships too.

574
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:52,769
Brilliant idea. And, and I love it. It's, uh, as you said, you've given some serious thought to it

575
00:43:52,769 --> 00:43:57,510
and, and then to be able to bring in that quality of, uh, of lead, I, you know, we spoke before you

576
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:02,449
catching up with the CEO of, uh, of Woolworths in the coming weeks to get a product into Woolworths

577
00:44:02,449 --> 00:44:07,929
is a, is a huge F at the same time. And it's, it's inspiring Hunter because, you know, you can tell

578
00:44:07,929 --> 00:44:12,630
you started fully with purpose and to use your problem solving brain at the same time. It's, uh,

579
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:16,550
it's profound. How do, how do people get involved? Is it simple as just, you know, if you see it,

580
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:21,429
make the choice, buy the product? Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. I think absolutely. Yeah. It's like we

581
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:22,750
sell, obviously have our own, our own, our own, our own, our own, our own, our own, our own, our own,

582
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:28,730
website as well. It's literally called www.websiteofstuff.com. And so that's like

583
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:33,289
the direct to consumer route, but yeah, we're in, in Woolies at the moment. We're in the final

584
00:44:33,289 --> 00:44:39,010
stages, fingers crossed that we confirm, uh, a major pharmacy channel as well. We're in shaver

585
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:43,969
shop, uh, too. So if you say it, yeah. And then, um, just tag us that cause we're really trying

586
00:44:43,969 --> 00:44:48,590
to create, again, using the power of brand and consumerism, you know, even in the marketing,

587
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:52,530
we use all our man cave facilitators. So really creating this like really positive,

588
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:57,269
groundswell for men and masculinity. And one of the things that I'm doing now, as I'm in it,

589
00:44:57,309 --> 00:45:02,329
I mentioned to you in a capital raise at the moment is working with a bunch of athletes or

590
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:07,369
people who have been previously athletes to bring them in, you know? So how do we use people that

591
00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:11,469
people are inspired by, you know, the community is inspired by to go, these are the role models,

592
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:16,269
the men of character that we want to kind of help us get to this next stage for masculinity. So

593
00:45:16,269 --> 00:45:20,670
yeah, very much, um, yeah. An open invitation for anyone's interested just to reach out.

594
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:32,880
We see, uh, leadership in the world that we're passionate about Hunter and love talking to

595
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,480
leaders and doing stuff like you're doing in such a unique way, but there's some genuine, uh,

596
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:41,099
dimensions that we think are really common with leaders. I'd love to ask you about them

597
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:45,739
starting with self-leadership. We don't think you can really lead others unless you've got an

598
00:45:45,739 --> 00:45:50,099
idea of self-leadership. Does that make sense to you? Uh, literally? Yes.

599
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:56,320
So it's interesting, right? So I'm, I'm fascinated cause I think personal development is like what

600
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,019
the old, you know, the old, you know, the old, you know, the old, you know, the old, you know,

601
00:45:57,019 --> 00:46:00,320
spiritual development used to be. And I think, you know, looking back at history, I think

602
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:05,619
religions kind of become the middleman between us and spirituality. And that may really work well

603
00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:10,539
for some people, but for some people not, but if we go back pre organized religion, one of the

604
00:46:10,539 --> 00:46:16,639
foundational teachings of spirituality was know thyself, which literally that's like as pure as

605
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:22,360
it gets. And so for me, absolutely. The journey I'm on is that like the better care I take of

606
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:27,000
myself, the better I can serve others. And that's been really tough cause I'm just so used to just

607
00:46:27,019 --> 00:46:31,400
putting others first. Like it's, I don't know. It's a family thing, I guess. I had to really come

608
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,920
back and go, okay, if I'm not taking care of myself, then my cup is empty. But when my cup

609
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,460
is full, it overflows. I can share that with others. And yeah, I, my purse, you know, I have

610
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:46,360
a lot of personal, I guess, reflection practices because yeah, I fundamentally believe that I,

611
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:51,920
the more I kind of support and heal myself, not as if like I'm broken or fixed or need to be fixed

612
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,579
or anything, but the better person I can be. And you know, my, my partner, she's a,

613
00:46:56,579 --> 00:47:01,360
amazing yoga teacher. She shared with me this quote, which is just always stuck with two things,

614
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,880
actually. One that your energy introduces you before you speak, which I think is so profound.

615
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,380
It's so true. Like we just know, like we really know. And the second is the body whispers before

616
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:17,559
it screams. I love that too, because my journey coming from like, you know, contact sport was

617
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:22,340
just keep pushing through and I've had to become really receptive to the intuition and the

618
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:26,519
intelligence of my body and my gut. Yeah. So a lot of my journey now is listening,

619
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:32,360
to my gut, not my mind. And what I've found is my mind is awesome at thinking in like logic and

620
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:37,739
past, present and future and trying to problem solve, but it's limited. Whereas I find my gut

621
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:42,039
is like my subconscious. So my subconscious is always taking in all my surroundings.

622
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:46,820
And often my gut feeling is my instinct and it knows which way to go. It might not be logical,

623
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:51,840
but I'm starting to really lean into that going, I'm just going to back my gut here. And there

624
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,480
might be some short-term discomfort, but I'm backing it in. And it's, it's really been quite

625
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,559
profound. The results that have come out of that. Yeah.

626
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:01,699
It's fascinating to hear you say that. There's lots of people I've had the great privilege of

627
00:48:01,699 --> 00:48:05,659
speaking to really come back to that. All the times I've made great decisions, it's been on

628
00:48:05,659 --> 00:48:11,000
that pure gut instinct. And anytime they've gone away from that is where they've got themselves

629
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,139
into trouble or they've aligned themselves with someone that didn't have the same values.

630
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:20,460
Nicole Gibson is an incredible young Australian, love out loud is her community, would have heard

631
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:25,719
Nicole's stuff. And she's brilliant. She's creating some tech around. Really, you know,

632
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:31,440
we've all got our phones attached to us around how you can actually get some data on, you know,

633
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,179
making decisions from your gut. And we can measure that now, can't we, with heart rate and with,

634
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,760
you know, the, the, the dilation of your pupils and all that. So she's doing some amazing stuff

635
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:45,739
in that space. I'm not surprised that you went there in that world. A lot of the things that

636
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:50,300
you're tackling, you know, changing masculinity, talking about having an impact on domestic

637
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,780
violence, they're huge things. And it's, you know, the next dimension I want to talk to you about is

638
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,699
how you go about positively impacting your gut. And I think that's, I think that's a really,

639
00:48:55,699 --> 00:49:00,599
in your environment. But what you said before made sense to me is that just they're big things,

640
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:05,380
but every day we can have an impact on someone close to us. How have you thought about that in

641
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:10,599
your day-to-day world? First thing is actually just having a conversation with my partner,

642
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:16,440
Loz, around how I can better support her. Like literally it starts there. Like, what am I doing?

643
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:22,340
Or how can I better be of service inside of our relationship? And like, even having that

644
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:25,480
conversation where I thought I was really good and helping out and all the ways that I thought

645
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:29,960
I was good. And yeah, she just gave me some real low-hanging fruit. I was like, oh shit, sorry.

646
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,519
But like, that's, you know, just like, what? Can you give me an example?

647
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,679
Oh, this is super basic. But so I travel a bit for work. And so when I come home,

648
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:41,019
I just like really like chill it out. And, you know, she was just like to me,

649
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:45,360
when you just come back home, even if you've been traveling, if you literally just take

650
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:51,420
two minutes to just clean up the whole place, that means so much to me. And I was like, oh,

651
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,340
I just kind of clean when like, I feel like I'm ready and I'm not a dirty guy at all, but like,

652
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:58,280
you know, or we have a conversation, I do it. She's like, yeah, but it's just these acts of

653
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:04,679
service that become like a load off my mind. And so I know that's like a really basic thing,

654
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,460
but that's been huge. The other big thing is like inside of when she's dealing with a problem,

655
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:13,179
actually just asking her, hey, what type of conversation would you like to have here?

656
00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:15,699
Would you like me to help you solve this? Or would you like me just to listen?

657
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:21,260
That has been a game changer because my, you know, usual approach previous years was like,

658
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,980
hey, let me help you solve this. This is my way of helping, contributing. She's like, I don't want

659
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,159
that.

660
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:29,800
I just want to unravel here. I want you to hold space for me. I'm like, wow, I reckon a few of my

661
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,840
mates could learn from this one. Yeah. You know, I'm learning. I'm writing that down, mate, isn't

662
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,619
it? As males, we want to solve problems, don't we, all the time. And sometimes your partner's

663
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:43,420
looking at you going, just stay out of it. Yeah. Like not for you this time. And we forget to ask

664
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:47,739
too, don't we? We forget to ask, what can we do better? A good distinction there is this concept

665
00:50:47,739 --> 00:50:54,079
of permission versus trespass. So permission is, hey, Loz, do you mind if I ask you a few more

666
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,139
questions? Or, hey, how do I help you solve this? And I'm like, well, I don't know. I don't know.

667
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:59,679
How can I best support you here? Right? So I'm seeking permission from her where she keeps the

668
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:04,480
power. Whereas trespass is really me just overstepping her boundaries and making assumptions

669
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,659
and just going in with whatever my contribution answer offering is, right? And that's often where

670
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:14,239
the friction can be. So I found that to be like a nice little mental model that's just like, all

671
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:18,920
right, permission versus trespass. Yeah. It's huge, isn't it? And you think of, you know, still one

672
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,739
of the most profound things, isn't it, is breaking up a relationship, whatever stage it's at. And

673
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,019
I always think, you know, a lot of us,

674
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:30,559
we apply our brains to creating what you're doing, which is a huge undertaking and the social

675
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:35,719
venture, but we don't apply that same sort of intensity to our relationships and we expect

676
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:42,460
them to be outstanding. It's literally hilarious that we create visions and missions and purpose

677
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:47,780
and values for our businesses and the key behaviors that underpin those values. And we create a

678
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:53,599
culture code, but in terms of our relationship, like that's really rare. Like, do we sit down

679
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,139
and map out what is our vision for us? And we don't apply that same sort of intensity to our

680
00:51:55,159 --> 00:51:58,639
relationships. You know, what are, what are the behaviors we want to have as important to us?

681
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:03,219
What do we think the values of our relationship are? You know, what are the goals that we want

682
00:52:03,219 --> 00:52:07,340
to achieve? Maybe we do that in a financial sense, but like, do we do that from a, how do we want to

683
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:12,159
feel about each other? How do we want to feel inside of this relationship? It's, it's kind of

684
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:17,280
comical when you go, wow, we've really kind of gone that in like a really commercial way, but not

685
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:22,440
an interpersonal way. And I think there's just, you know, lessons there around how we can use like

686
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,980
the masculine and feminine approaches to not making it, to not making it, you know, it's just,

687
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:29,079
too much like a business plan, you know, your relationship, but you know, I think that's where

688
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:33,460
the middle ground, you know, you can meet. We see leaders are really clear on how they

689
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:39,179
create and share their vision. You've had the Royal Family support your vision. How have you

690
00:52:39,179 --> 00:52:42,400
thought about creating and sharing the vision for the Man Cave and what you're doing?

691
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:47,699
Yeah. So for me, opportunities like this are awesome. So thank you. I really do appreciate

692
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:53,500
it. Yeah. For me, Man Cave is now this really interesting juncture where I think, you know,

693
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:59,679
we started this like pre Harvey Weinstein, Donald Trump, you know, the Me Too movement or

694
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:04,460
any of this like kind of groundswell. So we were like early on, you know, feet on the ground in

695
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:10,039
2014. And now it's like, there's like this opening of this zeitgeist where people are like,

696
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,440
we should do something about this. This is really important. So for me, it's really,

697
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,619
we're now starting to have a lot of government meetings across, you know, state and federal

698
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:22,800
government to see how we can really establish like more support around the emotional and social

699
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,480
development of young people. And I think that's really important. And I think that's really

700
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:23,500
important. I think that's really important. I think that's really important. I think that's really

701
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,159
important. I think that's really important. And again, not through this lens of being super

702
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:31,699
woke or like virtue signaling. It doesn't have to be this big, scary or progressive thing. It's like,

703
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:35,519
no, it's like, it's just values-based education in a way that resonates with young men.

704
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:41,639
So that's been, you know, really important. And then, yeah, where Man Cave is now about to do a

705
00:53:41,639 --> 00:53:46,099
lot of work kind of digitally. So we've started to run our programs on Twitch, which is the largest

706
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:50,239
game streaming platform in the world. Took me a little while to kind of catch up to what that was,

707
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:53,360
but it's basically young people log on to this platform. They,

708
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:58,480
watch other, you know, their favorite YouTubers or gamers game. And some of these kids have like

709
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,380
tens of millions of followers. It's a whole other world. I guess it's like us going to the G and

710
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:07,320
watching our favorite athletes run around. But yeah, we're now starting to run our mental health

711
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:13,079
programs on Twitch. So kids go through, you know, the programs at school, they come home,

712
00:54:13,239 --> 00:54:17,139
hopefully do their homework, log on to Twitch. And then they're now having like conversations

713
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:23,219
with our facilitators, which is like a, it's like a talk show meets a podcast meets like a

714
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:28,159
segment. And the boys love it because it's entertaining, but it's also educational as

715
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:33,039
well. And they can talk and have open anonymous conversations around mental health, you know,

716
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:39,260
relationships, sex, death, everything in between. And I think that's really exciting because the

717
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:43,599
possibilities of that digitally open up so much. And, you know, we partnered with Australia's

718
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:49,659
leading e-sports team to do that as well. Got like 60,000 people streaming in and even had this one

719
00:54:49,659 --> 00:54:53,199
kid, his name was, um, yeah, Bo Johnson just found us around. And he was like, I'm going to do this

720
00:54:53,219 --> 00:54:57,880
online. He's an indigenous kid from central Victoria. And he was like, how the hell do I get

721
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:02,000
you guys to my school? And so we built this like relationship with him online. And, and, you know,

722
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,780
he got us into his high school and we rock up and he's in all man cave merchandise. And he was like

723
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:11,579
the hero of the town. And, you know, I think it's a really powerful story of how digital can be used

724
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:15,300
for good. Cause we often hear they're really negative stories of, of digital and algorithms.

725
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,440
And where you're meeting them is, is where they're at, isn't it? I think for most parents,

726
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,280
you know, Twitch is what the hell is even. Yeah. I've spoken to you about that.

727
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:26,440
Obviously. And it's so hard to get your head around. And for most parents, you go, that's the

728
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:31,360
nightmare. You know, my kid's up watching gamers game all night. How can there be anything positive

729
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,579
in that? But that's where a lot of the passion space lies. So, you know, again, the brilliance

730
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:39,840
of you to, to meet kids where they're at and have those conversations, which segues well into

731
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:44,800
curiosity as a dimension of leadership. We just see people like you who are doing incredible things

732
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,019
in leadership are really curious. Is that word, you know, jump off the page at you?

733
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:53,099
Yeah. I think it's like that child psychology. You know, the kids are always just asking,

734
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:57,500
why? Yeah, absolutely. Like some reason we just lose that. And it's like, well,

735
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:02,480
we just got to assume that we know and go work it out privately. So I think, yeah, absolutely. I'm

736
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:07,260
endlessly curious and sometimes have to like limit the curiosity because I can just keep going. But

737
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:13,139
yeah, curiosity, I think in understanding is everything from understanding the people that

738
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:16,840
we're sitting opposite from to the history, to the real reason for things. And I think,

739
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:23,139
you know, sometimes humanity, we are a species with amnesia. We like forget why the way things

740
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:27,239
have been done, you know, and we just focus, which is probably some, you know, biological

741
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:31,219
evolutionary reason that's like, don't look back for the wine, keep going for the, you know, the

742
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:36,719
berry. Um, but yeah, I think, yeah, curiosity alongside vision, you know, the ability to,

743
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,360
you know, let, and I think for me as a leader, it's back to vision very briefly. That's where

744
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:47,159
my gifts are. I don't know why, but I can just see things a few steps down the track and I can see

745
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:51,820
how exponentially, if you do this and this and you pull it together, it can create its own,

746
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:52,579
you know,

747
00:56:53,219 --> 00:56:57,079
momentum. I don't know why, but it's just something that can happen. And my role as a

748
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:01,340
leader has been surrounding myself with people who can then take care of the operations. Um,

749
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:06,159
and that's what I think an effective, you know, manager of a team is you design the team around

750
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:11,920
people in their sweet spots to get the desired outcome. And, and for me, you know, uh, where I

751
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,179
do my best work is getting curious about things like, you know, as I said before around, okay,

752
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:20,460
why is religion the way that religion is being done? What's the origins of spirituality? I'm

753
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:23,199
going down that and understanding that has helped me be,

754
00:57:23,219 --> 00:57:28,840
be a better leader because I realized simple tenants like know thyself means that I can be

755
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:34,159
better, not just for myself, but for those I'm around. So someone on this podcast, and I wish I

756
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,739
could remember it wasn't it. I think about all the time talked about great leaders and great

757
00:57:37,739 --> 00:57:43,019
partnerships around, you need shared values, but complimentary capabilities. So you're looking

758
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:48,119
for, you don't have to be a great operational person. You clearly understand that where your

759
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:52,739
strength is and surrounding that, but the intelligence and the leadership is to actually

760
00:57:52,739 --> 00:57:53,019
say,

761
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:57,340
I've got, I've got a gap here. Can I get other people to compliment me? Sounds like you've done

762
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:03,079
that really strategically and really successfully, uh, communicating with clarity. You, um, articulate

763
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:08,880
yourself as well as I can't say articulate as I try and, uh, compliment you for how well, uh, you

764
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,559
get your words across. Has that always been something that's, that's come easy to you around

765
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:16,460
communicating and, and what's been your communication strategy? Because, you know, it feels

766
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:21,300
like you get it out there really well. Thanks. I think I honed it getting out of detentions at

767
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,159
school. It's probably where I probably,

768
00:58:23,219 --> 00:58:28,800
worked out. I was like, all right, I can say a few things here. Um, no, I, I joke, but kind of

769
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:37,780
serious. Um, the, uh, I think really just time in the ring. And I say this, but like when in doubt,

770
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:42,280
be authentic has been a game changer for me. Like if I don't know the answer, like I'm very

771
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,760
comfortable to say that. And, um, I think again, coming back to just the work I've done to feel

772
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:52,860
comfortable inside of myself, which is an endless, you know, task, um, allows me to, I think, speak

773
00:58:53,219 --> 00:58:57,739
from my heart. And I think coming back to, you know, that at Ana's training, right, where I had

774
00:58:57,739 --> 00:59:01,440
that ability where I was like, well, there's a real block here. I can't actually articulate myself.

775
00:59:01,699 --> 00:59:07,360
And I think using that as a training ground, um, or as an inception to go and find training

776
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:12,980
grounds, I should say has been, yeah, absolutely a game changer for me. And it's been a practice

777
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:18,440
of getting really uncomfortable. So for instance, doing the standup comedy course was just standing

778
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:22,059
up and failing for like three days in front of people and recognizing that, you know, I'm not

779
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:22,159
going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it.

780
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:22,199
I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it.

781
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:28,059
And recognizing that I will survive, like the world will go on. And so, you know, I think around,

782
00:59:28,219 --> 00:59:31,119
particularly around high performance, that's really what my model of high performance is,

783
00:59:31,139 --> 00:59:36,340
is getting myself in environments that I don't have my usual tools, um, to whip out. And actually

784
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:41,360
I've got to be quite instinctual and find my edges. And then on the edge is where the gold is.

785
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:44,659
You mentioned earlier, and I meant to ask you about it. You said, I've got a range of

786
00:59:44,659 --> 00:59:48,760
self-reflective practices. I think it was when I was asking you about self-leadership,

787
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,039
I meant to come back to it. Um, it just sparked my attention.

788
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:56,340
Can you give us some detail around what that looks like for people?

789
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:02,679
Sure. Yeah. Well, I think the easiest low-hanging fruit is just journaling. I think like, I remember-

790
01:00:02,679 --> 01:00:03,679
Do you do that daily or?

791
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,940
I used to. And now it's, um, I realized that my mind made it a task and then it become like,

792
01:00:10,019 --> 01:00:13,360
oh shit, I'm not journaling. And then it become like, oh, that's not the point of journaling.

793
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:18,579
And so now I look at it as like, it's a gift, you know, it's like, I feel like unpacking something

794
01:00:18,579 --> 01:00:22,179
and just letting my unconscious unravel. But I remember when I started journaling,

795
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:26,940
I, I like, I was like, shit, how do I write the perfect journal? Do I start Dear Diary?

796
01:00:27,099 --> 01:00:32,219
Like, what do you do? And now it's just whatever comes out, but I do try to end on three things

797
01:00:32,219 --> 01:00:36,380
I'm grateful for. And I find, you know, just understanding the research on gratitude,

798
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:41,940
just like speaking it out into existence actually does rewire the chemicals in our brain and gets

799
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:47,260
us to be really appreciative. And I think, yeah, the more grateful I am, the more amazing things

800
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:50,679
happen and I appreciate things. So journaling's been massive.

801
01:00:50,679 --> 01:00:56,880
Coming from a contact sport and getting into yoga has been huge. I remember, you know, again,

802
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:00,519
early twenties and I did yoga and I felt this like level of like intimacy with my body. I was like,

803
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:05,619
what the hell is this feeling? And that has just been a beautiful practice for me. Again, like,

804
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:09,500
you know, maybe once a week. So it's not like this thing I drill myself on,

805
01:01:09,659 --> 01:01:13,880
but it's a chance for me to slow my system down, get out of my head, into my body.

806
01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:18,659
That's been a game changer. And then I also do this practice, which is kind of, I guess,

807
01:01:18,659 --> 01:01:24,440
a version of like internal family systems, which is like a type of psychology where basically if I

808
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:30,039
feel an emotion come up, I try and like have a practice of speaking to that emotion and

809
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:34,559
understanding it and feeling it. And basically it's like parenting the inner selves that I have.

810
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:38,840
And that's been a game changer because often like, say for instance, I might be triggered by

811
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,659
something happened or I might, you know, go to do a talk or something and I'm feeling anxious.

812
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,960
I would actually create a practice as part of like a meditation routine where I'll just slow down,

813
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:48,639
speak to the part of myself that feels,

814
01:01:48,659 --> 01:01:54,639
ask of it if it needs anything. Literally as a kid, it has been a game changer for me

815
01:01:54,639 --> 01:01:59,639
in terms of like feeling, just giving myself the love I wish I had in that moment. Often it's some

816
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:03,440
like childhood thing where I didn't get the attention or, you know, reward I wanted.

817
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,519
And then through that, I've also worked out the ability to start to speak to my gut,

818
01:02:07,739 --> 01:02:11,199
you know, and ask, okay, well, what do you think gut? What should we do? And again,

819
01:02:11,219 --> 01:02:15,179
it's just developing relationships with the different parts of our psyche or our consciousness

820
01:02:15,179 --> 01:02:18,380
has been huge. Which sounds fairly esoteric, but it makes

821
01:02:18,659 --> 01:02:21,980
perfect sense to me. You mentioned before, isn't it? You know, there's only a handful of

822
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:26,139
emotions we will experience. Everyone experiences it. Even if you're not a jealous person,

823
01:02:26,219 --> 01:02:30,400
everyone knows what jealousy feels like. And when that comes up, as you said, if you actually

824
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:35,059
sort of almost go, well, that's jealousy. That's just quite natural. It happens. It doesn't tend

825
01:02:35,059 --> 01:02:40,099
to, or that's anger, as you said before, I don't then feel guilt about having anger or all of the

826
01:02:40,099 --> 01:02:45,079
emotions and the reins. And to be able to express it like that in the end, it's almost, you know,

827
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:48,340
takes away any of the overthinking that comes next to it.

828
01:02:48,659 --> 01:02:54,679
We can relate. We both, my Bex, a yoga instructor as well. And so brought that into our life. I think

829
01:02:54,679 --> 01:02:59,880
when it's that close to you, isn't it? You realize how profound that practice is. I can relate to

830
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:06,280
that. I've got a very ordinary 35 minutes that I do most days, but I love it. It's been a game

831
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:11,760
changer. I think so. Just to jump in on just that, for me, it's also, you know, we talk about whether

832
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:17,780
it's the guilt or the frustration or the shame, really learning to unconditionally love and accept

833
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:18,639
those parts of our psyche. And I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good

834
01:03:18,659 --> 01:03:18,699
point. I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really

835
01:03:18,699 --> 01:03:18,900
good point. I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point. I think that's

836
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:18,960
a really good point. I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point. I think

837
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,039
that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point.

838
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:26,599
have been a life changer because, you know, parts of myself that I may have shame about, if I am able to

839
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:34,800
accept that, love myself, irrespective of that, that is telling myself, which I'm always aware of how

840
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:39,539
I'm going, whether I'm conscious of it or not, my body is keeping a read on it. That really sends

841
01:03:39,539 --> 01:03:44,260
the signal to me that I unconditionally love myself, which is crazy. Like it's so wild to me

842
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:45,980
that we don't teach kids how to love themselves.

843
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:47,280
It's so crazy.

844
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:50,099
Like, it's like, even the concept, it's like a bit woo-woo.

845
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:54,079
But I'm like, you know, loving yourself and being comfortable with yourself,

846
01:03:54,179 --> 01:03:57,460
whatever language you want to say, is one of the greatest feelings in the world.

847
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:00,679
And I think it's wild we don't teach our kids this.

848
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:01,820
Well, it's funny, isn't it?

849
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:04,500
It's going back to that whole schoolyard thing.

850
01:04:04,599 --> 01:04:05,880
You're in love with yourself, you know.

851
01:04:06,219 --> 01:04:10,000
The negative connotation to getting ahead of yourself, you know.

852
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,659
In Australia, that's sort of the foundation of Talk Poppy.

853
01:04:12,659 --> 01:04:14,820
You know, what, you're happy if you be reasonably successful.

854
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,679
You get too successful, we're going to smash you.

855
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:17,280
Yeah, exactly.

856
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,219
And I think that is a big thing to still unravel, isn't it?

857
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:20,480
Yeah.

858
01:04:20,539 --> 01:04:23,659
It comes back to where we started, that sense of self,

859
01:04:23,739 --> 01:04:24,920
that sense of self-leadership.

860
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,139
Yeah.

861
01:04:25,159 --> 01:04:28,920
If you haven't got a healthy, you know, understanding of yourself

862
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:31,639
and care for yourself or love for yourself, to use the word you're after,

863
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:34,679
how do you then project anything positive going forward?

864
01:04:34,739 --> 01:04:37,960
And I think the tricky thing is we see those people who often have the most,

865
01:04:38,539 --> 01:04:41,539
who are, you know, sometimes the loudest in the room,

866
01:04:41,539 --> 01:04:42,500
the biggest performers.

867
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,619
You know, often it's projecting something.

868
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,659
You know, they're not actually that comfortable with themselves.

869
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:50,400
Some are, of course, but often, you know, they're doing it to create,

870
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,659
you know, a distance from who they really are.

871
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,659
And I think that's a really important thing.

872
01:04:55,719 --> 01:04:57,960
I love that you brought that up because, yeah, there are those people

873
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,880
who are like, oh, that's a bit arrogant and wanky and like, what?

874
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,719
You know, but then I think there's like a difference.

875
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,519
Well, we know people who are comfortable with themselves.

876
01:05:04,619 --> 01:05:05,179
We feel it.

877
01:05:05,659 --> 01:05:09,239
And we also, you know, feel often the unconditional love of our mothers,

878
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,780
you know, if you're lucky enough to have that.

879
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,340
That is an epic feeling.

880
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:13,880
You're experiencing that.

881
01:05:14,059 --> 01:05:15,960
So, yeah, I'm just glad you brought that in.

882
01:05:16,219 --> 01:05:18,659
Yeah, I love the way that you just delve into those stuff.

883
01:05:18,699 --> 01:05:22,519
As you said, now, because of the way the world is and cancel culture,

884
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,059
they're tricky conversations.

885
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:28,440
And I know a lot of males that in the past would have been open

886
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:28,980
to having that conversation.

887
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:31,400
Just don't want to go near it for sake of, you know,

888
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,500
you're going to offend someone.

889
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:33,739
And now you can't disagree.

890
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:37,079
You really then, you know, it is cancel culture.

891
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,840
So I love the fact that clearly you know it so well.

892
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,360
You know where you sit on it so well.

893
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,900
But I think we need to have more of these conversations.

894
01:05:44,059 --> 01:05:45,800
It's clearly what you're doing in schools too, isn't it?

895
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,300
It's getting in, teaching kids that these are the most important conversations

896
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,179
that we could probably have.

897
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,179
So well done again.

898
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,440
I'm interested in, you know, what's comeback culture.

899
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,219
Like, you know, because like we're not talking about that.

900
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,900
Because if we're just sending a signal to everyone that's made a mistake

901
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:03,840
in their life, which is everyone, then there's not much incentive

902
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,760
to really want to step forward and take responsibility, right?

903
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:09,500
Because my career, my family, my income is on the line.

904
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,900
And that doesn't mean you don't take responsibility

905
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:12,340
for what's happening.

906
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,260
But I'm really interested, what's the next cultural wave?

907
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:18,159
Because we're going to have like keep having this distance

908
01:06:18,159 --> 01:06:20,659
where men aren't going to speak their truth or feel empowered

909
01:06:20,659 --> 01:06:21,980
and that's not going to end well.

910
01:06:22,199 --> 01:06:24,380
Yeah, I'd like to get behind comeback culture with you.

911
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:27,340
I mean, people always say how many chances does someone need?

912
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,719
As many as it could possibly take.

913
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,380
It's an infinite amount of chances.

914
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:33,420
We're, you know, all going to make mistakes.

915
01:06:33,579 --> 01:06:37,039
It's this sort of joy people get around, you know,

916
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:40,320
seeing someone fall off their ledge and be taken out.

917
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,300
It's horrific, you know.

918
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:42,940
I'm with you.

919
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:45,179
We need to sort of support comeback culture in a big way.

920
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:45,760
I love that term.

921
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:46,960
Haven't heard it before.

922
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,460
Who's been the greatest leader in your life, Hunter?

923
01:06:51,139 --> 01:06:52,699
Greatest leader in my life.

924
01:06:53,239 --> 01:06:54,719
I would say my grandfather.

925
01:06:55,139 --> 01:06:56,960
Yeah, I think he, I don't know why,

926
01:06:57,059 --> 01:06:59,019
but just really invested in me when I was young.

927
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:02,300
Like there was some pretty tough years for me as a really young kid.

928
01:07:02,539 --> 01:07:07,380
And yeah, he just took me under his wing and, you know,

929
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,980
really invested in, you know, little things like he'd go give me 50 bucks

930
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:12,340
to go.

931
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:16,179
Give to that man who was experiencing homelessness or, you know,

932
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:18,420
when we were lucky enough to travel,

933
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:22,780
he would bring a bunch of soccer balls and pens and papers and he'd go,

934
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,980
go kick with the kids who were, you know, over there on the street.

935
01:07:26,179 --> 01:07:29,139
And so just little things that started to shape my character.

936
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,320
He really did.

937
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,559
And he died in such an amazing way.

938
01:07:33,659 --> 01:07:38,500
He was planting a tree on a property so that there'd be more shade for the

939
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,119
grandkids, which is similar to what we were talking about the other day.

940
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:42,320
But yeah,

941
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,539
I think that's a cracker of a way to go out having a heart attack doing that.

942
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:48,260
But yeah, he really was really important to me.

943
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,159
And yeah.

944
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:49,780
And also, you know,

945
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:53,300
my parents have been fantastic and my step parents and my mom's new partner

946
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:53,760
as well.

947
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:55,400
Got a tribe.

948
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,340
It's brilliant, isn't it?

949
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,920
If you're lucky enough to have that in your life.

950
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:01,179
But what was your grandfather's line again?

951
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:01,739
Invest in.

952
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:02,920
Invest in experiences.

953
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:03,380
Yeah.

954
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,260
And it doesn't have to be monetary experiences,

955
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,940
but it's just like find yourself in environments that are off brand for you.

956
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:09,239
Yeah.

957
01:08:09,639 --> 01:08:10,400
And yeah,

958
01:08:10,699 --> 01:08:10,880
that,

959
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,460
that was one of the things I tried to do all through my twenties was just

960
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:15,239
find myself in rooms of people who I'm like,

961
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,340
I should not be here,

962
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:19,619
but I'm here and I'm learning more about myself because it gives me more range

963
01:08:19,619 --> 01:08:20,800
and more tools in my tool belt.

964
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:23,260
I think I accidentally slipped over collaboration,

965
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:24,180
but I'll pick it up now.

966
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:29,220
We really feel as though leaders more than ever focused on collaboration.

967
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:29,680
And I'm,

968
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,680
I'm sure that is going to be a huge part.

969
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:34,060
I can hear it already in what you're doing with,

970
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:36,079
with stuff and with the man cave.

971
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:40,760
But if you could collaborate with anyone on any,

972
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:41,699
any part of your life,

973
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,520
who might it be?

974
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:43,880
Oh,

975
01:08:43,899 --> 01:08:44,300
amazing.

976
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:45,500
Well,

977
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,100
I think collaboration has to go in terms of leadership hand in hand with trust.

978
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:52,439
And I think that's a really important part of my leadership journey.

979
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,279
And yeah,

980
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:54,739
just going,

981
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,239
people are going to make mistakes and yeah,

982
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,479
I trust them that they'll keep coming back and doing a good job.

983
01:08:58,579 --> 01:09:02,260
So I think that's been big in terms of who can I collaborate with?

984
01:09:02,539 --> 01:09:02,800
Well,

985
01:09:02,819 --> 01:09:03,079
listen,

986
01:09:03,159 --> 01:09:04,319
it depends on what area,

987
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:05,119
but you know,

988
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:08,279
right now I'm particularly with teenage boys.

989
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:10,399
I'm really interested in who they are inspired by.

990
01:09:10,619 --> 01:09:10,739
So,

991
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:14,420
so I would love from an Australian context to like get Chris,

992
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:17,159
Chris Hemsworth involved in what we're doing with man cave.

993
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:17,979
I think he'd be awesome.

994
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:19,920
And then from a U S context,

995
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,399
there's a guy called Logan Paul who has like,

996
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:24,500
he just understands the internet very well.

997
01:09:24,699 --> 01:09:28,140
Does he ever crazy and a 12 year old and a 15 year old.

998
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:28,420
And,

999
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:29,659
and you know,

1000
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:32,340
I've had a quick lesson on Logan Paul.

1001
01:09:32,699 --> 01:09:33,119
It's like,

1002
01:09:33,619 --> 01:09:34,180
he's got it,

1003
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:34,460
hasn't he?

1004
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:35,180
With that age group.

1005
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:36,239
It is wild.

1006
01:09:36,859 --> 01:09:39,279
These are the children that have been raised by the internet,

1007
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:39,560
right?

1008
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:40,680
And he's part of that.

1009
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:43,079
So he gets the game better than the media get the game.

1010
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:46,800
And this guy just happens to be an absolute specimen at the same time too.

1011
01:09:46,899 --> 01:09:47,380
Like he's,

1012
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,119
he's the one that's doing all the boxing.

1013
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:49,779
Yeah.

1014
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:50,479
Him and his brother,

1015
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:50,920
aren't they?

1016
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:51,159
They,

1017
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:51,560
yeah.

1018
01:09:51,739 --> 01:09:52,100
Challenge,

1019
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:52,539
you know,

1020
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,420
and have commercialized that in a serious way.

1021
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,079
Next level.

1022
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:58,100
And literally like they get culture,

1023
01:09:58,340 --> 01:09:58,619
you know,

1024
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:00,220
they get how culture works.

1025
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:00,600
They're not,

1026
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:03,619
they're now at a point where they're creating culture as well,

1027
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:04,319
which is like,

1028
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,960
that's the level of like Jay-Z,

1029
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:06,640
Kanye West,

1030
01:10:06,739 --> 01:10:07,039
where you're,

1031
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:08,600
you're not just inheriting culture,

1032
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,739
you're creating culture.

1033
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:10,560
So what's the,

1034
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:11,920
what's the culture they're creating on what?

1035
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:14,600
I guess it's like this internet generation of,

1036
01:10:14,699 --> 01:10:16,260
you can do anything no matter who you are.

1037
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:18,380
Like we're in a time where power has been,

1038
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:21,239
or some power has been democratized away from the big institutions.

1039
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:22,520
And we're seeing these kids,

1040
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:22,939
you know,

1041
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:23,739
who are like,

1042
01:10:23,859 --> 01:10:24,180
you know,

1043
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,140
mid twenties have more eyeballs and attention than like,

1044
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:27,380
you know,

1045
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:29,899
the old school movie celebrities or the,

1046
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:30,260
like,

1047
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:30,460
you know,

1048
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:31,340
the big media houses.

1049
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:32,039
And,

1050
01:10:32,119 --> 01:10:32,840
um,

1051
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:33,199
you know,

1052
01:10:33,239 --> 01:10:33,720
Logan Paul,

1053
01:10:33,779 --> 01:10:34,779
the fact that he can,

1054
01:10:34,859 --> 01:10:35,100
you know,

1055
01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:35,420
just,

1056
01:10:35,579 --> 01:10:35,899
you know,

1057
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:36,819
be a fit guy,

1058
01:10:36,939 --> 01:10:40,659
but also choose to fight Floyd Mayweather,

1059
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:45,640
in his second professional boxing fight ever and not get knocked out.

1060
01:10:45,699 --> 01:10:45,979
Okay.

1061
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,420
There's some size difference between them,

1062
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:47,939
but Floyd,

1063
01:10:48,039 --> 01:10:48,199
you know,

1064
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:49,979
arguably the greatest boxer of all time.

1065
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:50,180
Yeah.

1066
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:50,539
Correct.

1067
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:51,359
To not,

1068
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:52,060
um,

1069
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:52,760
to first of all,

1070
01:10:52,779 --> 01:10:53,779
that's his second fight.

1071
01:10:53,939 --> 01:10:57,619
And then I think his brother's fighting like Anderson to silver or something.

1072
01:10:57,779 --> 01:10:58,439
You know what?

1073
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:01,100
I know that because my 12 year old said that to me last night,

1074
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:02,539
I got home from Adelaide and he said,

1075
01:11:02,579 --> 01:11:04,159
Logan Paul's fighting Anderson.

1076
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:05,779
So he was a legend of MMA.

1077
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:06,199
And,

1078
01:11:06,279 --> 01:11:08,060
and on the surface you're going,

1079
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:08,939
but that,

1080
01:11:08,939 --> 01:11:10,619
that is tapped right into that.

1081
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:11,079
Age group.

1082
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:11,300
Yeah.

1083
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,600
And we're talking,

1084
01:11:12,899 --> 01:11:13,180
you know,

1085
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:13,939
when he fought flame,

1086
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:17,119
we're talking paydays of hundreds of millions,

1087
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:17,500
aren't we?

1088
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,020
And we're in,

1089
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:18,340
you know,

1090
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:20,180
well past tens of millions of dollars.

1091
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:20,579
So,

1092
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,579
and it's like these guys get attention,

1093
01:11:22,579 --> 01:11:23,000
right?

1094
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:23,859
Cause that's all it is.

1095
01:11:23,859 --> 01:11:24,100
It's,

1096
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:26,159
it's sensationalized,

1097
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:27,060
um,

1098
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:30,020
storytelling of a little bit shocking and wild.

1099
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:30,739
And it's like,

1100
01:11:30,739 --> 01:11:31,899
how does a YouTuber,

1101
01:11:31,899 --> 01:11:32,779
you know,

1102
01:11:32,779 --> 01:11:34,539
collaborate with or fight,

1103
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:34,979
you know,

1104
01:11:34,979 --> 01:11:36,439
one of the best boxers of all time,

1105
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:38,180
but then like collaborate with the other,

1106
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,439
his other arch nemesis,

1107
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:41,039
who is a huge UK,

1108
01:11:41,359 --> 01:11:41,899
um,

1109
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:43,220
uh,

1110
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,020
YouTuber.

1111
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:47,920
They then decide to collaborate and create a drink company called prime.

1112
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:49,140
I know all about this,

1113
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:49,579
but I,

1114
01:11:49,659 --> 01:11:51,520
I was in London,

1115
01:11:51,739 --> 01:11:52,239
uh,

1116
01:11:52,359 --> 01:11:53,960
watching my daughter row and,

1117
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:54,319
uh,

1118
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,079
and Max and Will before we left,

1119
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:56,439
you know,

1120
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:57,899
can you bring back some pride?

1121
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:01,520
What are you talking about?

1122
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:02,520
Uh,

1123
01:12:02,779 --> 01:12:03,399
Logan Paul,

1124
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:05,220
if you're listening or Chris Hemsworth,

1125
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,420
if anyone has any connections,

1126
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:07,359
we're doing good work.

1127
01:12:07,399 --> 01:12:08,060
It can really help.

1128
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,420
Wouldn't you love to see that?

1129
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:10,159
Because to,

1130
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,560
to use that audience and,

1131
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:17,420
and translate into best version of masculinity into what the man cave is doing,

1132
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,600
they would be great,

1133
01:12:18,699 --> 01:12:19,000
uh,

1134
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:20,600
investors in stuff.

1135
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:21,439
They would be,

1136
01:12:21,439 --> 01:12:21,880
uh,

1137
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:22,279
you know,

1138
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:22,859
able to,

1139
01:12:22,859 --> 01:12:24,720
to turn that huge audience for,

1140
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,000
for what I think for,

1141
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:26,640
you know,

1142
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:27,180
it's almost,

1143
01:12:27,319 --> 01:12:27,439
you,

1144
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,319
you can't even not talk males and females at the same time.

1145
01:12:30,439 --> 01:12:31,279
I like the fact that you're saying,

1146
01:12:31,359 --> 01:12:31,960
Hey,

1147
01:12:31,979 --> 01:12:34,399
I'm going to specialize in this because it will impact,

1148
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:34,920
you know,

1149
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:39,159
perhaps the thing we might need to change most is horrific thing of the way males treat

1150
01:12:39,159 --> 01:12:39,420
women.

1151
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:40,359
And,

1152
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:40,859
uh,

1153
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:41,180
uh,

1154
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:41,380
you know,

1155
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:42,420
more strength to your arm,

1156
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:42,819
you know,

1157
01:12:42,819 --> 01:12:44,140
who's going to say that you wouldn't,

1158
01:12:44,199 --> 01:12:44,420
uh,

1159
01:12:44,859 --> 01:12:46,420
get those collaborations and,

1160
01:12:46,479 --> 01:12:47,680
and also all the work with,

1161
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:47,899
uh,

1162
01:12:47,899 --> 01:12:49,159
with stuff from the man cave,

1163
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:49,460
uh,

1164
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:50,680
look up Hunter Johnson's work.

1165
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:51,600
It's really profound.

1166
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:52,840
It's an incredible story of,

1167
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:53,079
uh,

1168
01:12:53,399 --> 01:12:53,899
combining,

1169
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:54,479
uh,

1170
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:56,800
intellect and skill with purpose and passion.

1171
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:57,100
It's,

1172
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:57,380
uh,

1173
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:57,880
it's incredible.

1174
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:58,199
I really,

1175
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:58,460
yeah,

1176
01:12:59,000 --> 01:12:59,380
uh,

1177
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:00,899
I'm inspired by everything you do.

1178
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,020
Thanks for spending the time today,

1179
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:03,060
mate,

1180
01:13:03,159 --> 01:13:03,500
uh,

1181
01:13:03,659 --> 01:13:04,659
right back at you.

1182
01:13:04,739 --> 01:13:04,880
No,

1183
01:13:04,899 --> 01:13:05,180
I really,

1184
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:05,840
really mean that.

1185
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,319
Thank you for being a role model.

1186
01:13:07,319 --> 01:13:08,420
Like I really appreciate it.

1187
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:08,600
You know,

1188
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,180
we're talking about,

1189
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:12,180
it's kind of hard to pick who are the role models that we look to,

1190
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:14,920
given the uncertainty of where men and masculinity is up to.

1191
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:15,180
And,

1192
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:15,439
you know,

1193
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:16,760
you're someone I look to.

1194
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:17,479
So I just want to say,

1195
01:13:17,539 --> 01:13:18,479
