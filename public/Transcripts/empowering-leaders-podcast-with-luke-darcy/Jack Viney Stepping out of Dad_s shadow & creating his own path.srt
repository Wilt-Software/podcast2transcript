00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,109
I'm sure you're going to enjoy this week's episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,669
with AFL legend Jack Viney.

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,769
Hear Jack talk about the lengths he goes to in the off-season to better himself.

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:20,609
So whether it's meditation, Zen Buddhism, finance, measures and acquisitions,

5
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:23,850
I'm always looking to expose myself of different ways of thinking.

6
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,070
What works for me? What makes me tick?

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,649
What makes me a better human, better leader, a better football player?

8
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:33,149
How his leadership style shows up at work and at home with his family.

9
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,210
You know, I don't like to sweat the small stuff.

10
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:38,490
You know, if there's something that's major, I'll come in and make a call.

11
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:41,229
But, you know, if it's something like a mess around the house

12
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:44,350
or the kids are staying up a little bit later than usual,

13
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,049
I'm kind of like, you know what, we'll just let this one slide.

14
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,890
You know, I've got the nails painted today in beautiful colours.

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,030
So, yeah, embracing the girl dad.

16
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:56,270
And you're going to love his take on giving and receiving feedback.

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,329
AFL and Clubland, like, communication is so important

18
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,170
and it's practiced daily.

19
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,750
And it's two-way feedback.

20
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,709
It's how you receive feedback and, you know, how you give feedback.

21
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,549
And the reasons we give feedback is because we care about people.

22
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:13,069
We want to, like, if we didn't want people to improve and get better,

23
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,069
then we wouldn't tell them.

24
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:15,969
We'd just ignore, get on with our lives.

25
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:19,390
We feel very privileged to have Jack Viney in our Leader Connect community.

26
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,310
We bring together leaders from diverse and unique backgrounds

27
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,530
in groups of five to six to come together to learn, to connect and share.

28
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,870
You don't have to be an AFL legend like Jack Viney to be part of it.

29
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,549
We'd love you to book a discovery call.

30
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,329
Leadercollective.com.

31
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,349
Huge thanks to Jason Nicholas and his team from Temper Bedding.

32
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:37,689
NASA approved.

33
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,170
A mattress like no other.

34
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:40,650
Invest in a temper.

35
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:41,709
It will change your life.

36
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:45,629
Jack Viney is a legend of the Melbourne Football Club.

37
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:50,590
A premiership player in 2021, ending a 57-year drought for his football club.

38
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:51,769
A best and fairest winner.

39
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:55,670
Former club captain who's played 219 games over the last 12 years

40
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,269
and regarded and respected as one of the toughest competitors in the game.

41
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:01,629
Jack, it's been a brilliant history that you've had.

42
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:03,609
And of success in your career.

43
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,329
Plenty more to come, by the way.

44
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:06,890
But do you feel proud of what you've achieved?

45
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,569
Yeah, it does.

46
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,509
Thanks for having me on the podcast.

47
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:14,110
Yeah, I'm kind of just a keep moving forward type of operator.

48
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,069
So I haven't had a great deal of reflection about, you know,

49
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,629
the past kind of achievements or path I've taken.

50
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,789
Try and, you know, reflect and learn on the go.

51
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:29,310
But always kind of searching for how do we keep improving?

52
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,810
How do we keep getting better?

53
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:31,310
And growing?

54
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:38,250
So I think there will come a day where we sit back and have a look at what was and...

55
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:38,750
Not for now.

56
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:39,409
Not for now.

57
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:41,949
Don't stop to celebrate at all and think, you know...

58
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:42,650
Probably not enough.

59
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:43,770
I should do it more.

60
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,050
But I think that's just, you know, how I'm wired is to keep searching, keep evolving.

61
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:50,930
Yeah, that's all I hear.

62
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:54,330
Your dad, Tom, one of the toughest competitors of all time.

63
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,250
Two-time best and fairest winner at your club.

64
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,870
And I look at you and I just can't believe how incredibly like him you are in so many ways,

65
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:01,250
which is a...

66
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:02,789
Which is a big compliment.

67
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:05,110
Can you tell us the influence he's had on you?

68
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:05,710
Yeah.

69
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:11,629
So old man, you know, obviously a legend of the D's and quite fortunate growing up.

70
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:17,889
I got to have him as my old man and showed a real interest and passion for footy early days.

71
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:22,949
You know, being able to see him go about his business and the way he behaved and acted

72
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:29,069
and, you know, the values that he, you know, implemented to have the career he did.

73
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:31,430
And I tried to tap into that pretty young.

74
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,610
Like he wasn't the forceful type of father.

75
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,569
It was more my passion and enthusiasm for footy.

76
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:41,090
That was, I saw my dad do it.

77
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,370
That's what I wanted to do.

78
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:49,909
So I'd tap into the old man's expertise growing up and just hearing dad talk about stuff like

79
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:54,990
hard work and, you know, sacrifice and, you know, the best players that he ever came across

80
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,310
were the hardest working.

81
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:01,509
So kind of these mindsets or philosophies, I guess, were ingrained.

82
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:07,169
They were ingrained in me from a pretty young age and, you know, extremely grateful for that

83
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:11,710
because, you know, I probably got to 18, 19, 20 years old.

84
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,709
And, you know, some of my teammates were probably learning some of that stuff from scratch

85
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,089
where I had a pretty good lead in to it.

86
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,589
But you always felt, Jack, that he was happy to let you be who you wanted to be

87
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:25,550
and it wasn't Todd driving the ship.

88
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:27,410
It was you and your passion.

89
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:29,850
You never felt like that pressure was there?

90
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:31,430
You know, I never felt pressure.

91
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:32,129
It was your expectation.

92
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:35,170
But there were certainly times where dad challenged me growing up.

93
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:39,149
You know, it was, you know, I'm telling dad, I want to be an AFL player.

94
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:42,230
And then dad saying, well, you're telling me that you want to be an AFL player,

95
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:46,110
but you want to go miss a training session to do something with your friends.

96
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:53,769
So, you know, he always kept it real with me and 100% never sugar-coated any feedback for me.

97
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:58,410
You know, whether I had a bad game of football, there was, all right, well,

98
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,269
this is where your performance fell away, this game.

99
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:08,310
So whilst he never was, you know, forced his own views on me and, you know,

100
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,649
drove me to be something that I didn't want to be, that was always me.

101
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:13,709
He was always real and honest with me.

102
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:18,170
So I always knew the areas that I had to improve on and get better at.

103
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,069
You're a father of two young girls yourself now.

104
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,730
What type of parent are you on the home front?

105
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:31,250
I've got two girls at home and I think probably my wife,

106
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,629
sees me as the good cop at the moment.

107
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,250
You know, she feels like she's the one enforcing a lot of the rules

108
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:41,209
and that kind of stuff around the house.

109
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:45,089
And I come in and just the soft touch from time to time.

110
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:49,269
But, you know, I look forward to, you know,

111
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:54,110
the challenges going forward as the kids get older and kind of developing

112
00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:00,050
that parenting philosophy of being on the team with your wife.

113
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,170
Where are we?

114
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,250
You know, what are we going to accept and where are we going to help steer our kids?

115
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,509
So, yeah, I'd say at the moment I'm a bit of a softie at home.

116
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:13,329
And that makes me smile, mate, so much because I love it.

117
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,050
The toughest, hardest competitors you're ever going to meet in your life

118
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,629
fall apart around their young daughters.

119
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:21,329
And my wife would say the same.

120
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,810
We've got Sienna who's 19 and she's got me wrapped around a little thing.

121
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:28,389
Has done from the very youngest of age.

122
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:29,990
Three boys are a bit different, I think.

123
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:30,930
But.

124
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,370
That's interesting, isn't it?

125
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,230
You just feel as though on the home front you like to just let things slide a bit more.

126
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:37,709
Yeah.

127
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:43,949
You know, I think just the job that I do, I feel like, you know,

128
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:47,050
there's a lot of stress from a day-to-day point of view.

129
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:50,550
So when I get home, you know, I don't like to sweat the small stuff.

130
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:55,089
You know, if there's something that's major, I'll come in and make a call.

131
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,870
But, you know, if it's something like a mess around the house

132
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,009
or the kids are staying up a little bit later than usual,

133
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:03,689
I'm kind of like, you know what, we'll just let this one slide.

134
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,829
You know, I've got the nails painted today in beautiful colours.

135
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:13,569
So, yeah, embracing the girl, the girl dad.

136
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:14,829
I love it.

137
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:19,170
Speaking of the ferocious competitor that you are,

138
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:22,209
I've always admired you from the very start of your career

139
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:25,410
that you look like the sort of teammate that everyone would love to play with.

140
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:27,430
You play your heart out for the team week in, week out.

141
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,829
Even if it's not going your way, you go, you look at Jack Viney

142
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:30,990
and think, oh, I'm going to win.

143
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,209
I feel like you're going to give something that everyone wants.

144
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,050
What does it look like to you when you're out in the field

145
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,949
and you're playing that way?

146
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:41,750
Yeah, you know, similar to what, you know, these principles,

147
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,449
I was taught from a young age was, you know, we do play a team sport

148
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:51,889
and whilst we might want to be, kick the most goals

149
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:55,149
or have the most possessions, you know, the successful teams

150
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:59,310
are not necessarily made up of the most exceptional players.

151
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,810
It's how do we all function together?

152
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,250
It's how do we all function together to help each other

153
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,110
and get the desired results?

154
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,470
So that's always been my, what I've wanted to achieve.

155
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,149
I've wanted to be part of a successful team

156
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:20,269
and at times that's role playing, that's sacrificing for the team

157
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:25,889
and I've been, you know, willing to do that to the best of my ability.

158
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,569
So, you know, whatever role that, that, that,

159
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,429
that takes or whatever shape that takes for the, for the team,

160
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:40,789
I'll give it 100% effort and intensity and we'll, we'll go from there.

161
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:45,789
There's a apocryphal story, Jay, you've got to tell me if this is true or not,

162
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,490
but your dad was assistant coach at Hawthorne under Alistair Clarkson,

163
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,450
legendary four-time premiership coach and word comes through

164
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,929
that young Jack Vining at school might've stood up to the school bully

165
00:08:56,929 --> 00:09:00,690
and, and, and Alistair Clarkson really,

166
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:04,629
you know, embraced that story, felt proud of you

167
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:07,830
and he used that as motivation for the current Hawks players.

168
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,070
Is that true, that story?

169
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:10,250
I think so.

170
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,350
I'm pretty sure back in, might've been 2005,

171
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,330
I was living in Echuca.

172
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,250
Things were a little bit rougher in the schoolyard in Echuca

173
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,590
than back in the Glen Iris days.

174
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:27,309
But yeah, one of my friends was,

175
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:29,690
was kind of getting picked on in, in the schoolyard

176
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,789
and, you know, I went over,

177
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:34,470
and tried to stand up for him and end up getting,

178
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,289
you know, punched and, and, and fought back

179
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:42,309
and, and broke my hand in the schoolyard.

180
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:44,529
And, you know, it made its way to, to Clarko

181
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:47,750
and I think he ended up using it in one of his pregame speeches

182
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,549
for the Hawks, who then ended up going on to win the flag in 08.

183
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,929
So we can say that, you know, I'll probably take some credit

184
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,809
in that flag, the 08 flag.

185
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:00,490
But yeah, no, funny story.

186
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,350
I'm told there was a decent, decent age gap between you

187
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,789
and the guy that was standing over your mate.

188
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,730
Is that correct or not?

189
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,029
Oh, there was a year.

190
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:08,929
There was a year gap.

191
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:09,210
Okay.

192
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:11,269
I was in grade five and I reckon it was, you know,

193
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:11,690
the grade six bully.

194
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,990
The big grade six boy bully.

195
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,090
Yeah.

196
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,210
And, and that would have just been in your DNA.

197
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:17,490
We're not going to stick up for my mate.

198
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,509
That's just who you are.

199
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:19,129
Yeah.

200
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:19,529
Yeah.

201
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:23,330
There was just, you know, what's, what's fair and right.

202
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:28,330
And I think, what do you, what do you want to stand,

203
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,629
you know, what do you want to stand for?

204
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,330
Whether you're,

205
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,990
um, put yourself in, in danger or, or whatnot.

206
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:37,570
So I just saw this, this moment unfold as a little

207
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,629
tacker and, um, yeah, it was probably like, you know,

208
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:41,909
I need to stick up for my mate here.

209
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,049
This is, this is a time where he needs, needs some

210
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:48,610
help and, um, yeah, the rest kind of unfolded, uh,

211
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,549
as, uh, as it did.

212
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:52,549
Your mate wasn't Ollie Wines, was it?

213
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,490
He was your old school mate.

214
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:55,409
He was in the, he was in the schoolyard too.

215
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:57,730
Although he wasn't the one being picked on.

216
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,309
Um, he, he was around there.

217
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,649
He had your back.

218
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:05,049
If, if, uh, you win a premiership, you've been

219
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:08,809
top four consistently in this period of time, the

220
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,990
Melbourne Football Club, I think there was a stat

221
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,730
this year, I read 82 weeks consecutively in the top

222
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,590
eight, so remarkable period of success in one of

223
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,990
the most competitive sports in the world.

224
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:23,149
Yet it feels as an outsider looking at Melbourne,

225
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:25,629
that you and your team have faced more public

226
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:28,629
criticism, more hand grenades have been

227
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,470
thrown at your group than maybe any other sport.

228
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,230
Sporting code, I could possibly imagine.

229
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,210
Have you found that hard to deal with given the

230
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,110
success that you've had?

231
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:39,429
Oh, certainly challenging when there's so much, you

232
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:44,210
know, noise and, um, media around, around your

233
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,809
football club, cause it does unsettle, um, you

234
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:52,009
know, things in internally, but I guess, um, you

235
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:55,769
know, you, you try and best keep, keep, you've

236
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:58,929
got to keep an eye on it and, and, and check in

237
00:11:58,929 --> 00:11:59,769
from time to time.

238
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:00,009
But.

239
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:03,769
And if you're constantly looking into it or reading

240
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:06,970
it, I think it, um, can derail you even, even more.

241
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,690
So, um, been trying to find the balance between, you

242
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,289
know, what, uh, what are we doing internally?

243
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:16,289
Are, are, you know, processes and, um, you know,

244
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:19,990
how we're behaving and acting internally, um, still

245
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,990
on track with, with our, um, with our goals and

246
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,509
values, um, as, as opposed to, no, is, is there

247
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:29,190
really something that we need to, um, to look at?

248
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,269
And where are these improvements that we can, we

249
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:32,750
can make?

250
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,870
So, um, you know, whilst, you know, we've had a

251
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,950
really successful few years, um, you know, whether

252
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,350
that's the flag in 21 and, and kind of the

253
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,710
following home and away seasons, um, certainly

254
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,750
we've got to continue to look at our program, um,

255
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,710
our leaders and, you know, how do we continue to

256
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,470
get better?

257
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,750
Um, because it's, it's an ever, ever changing

258
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,429
landscape.

259
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,990
Um, people change, um.

260
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,309
The competition changes.

261
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:04,070
So if we stay, you know, stagnant and, and happy

262
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,789
with where we're at and what we, what we achieve,

263
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:08,350
we're going to get left behind pretty quickly.

264
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,110
And then you get to the end of this season and

265
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,149
you, you get another one to, to deal with.

266
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:15,070
You're one of the elite players of the game,

267
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,549
Christian Petrarca, your great premiership

268
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:19,870
teammate, outwardly expresses the potential

269
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,830
that he may be, he's better off somewhere else.

270
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,710
And the whole footy world sort of is rocked by

271
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,269
that and as your teammate and someone that's

272
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:28,389
obviously played so much.

273
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,950
Great team.

274
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,950
Great footy for you.

275
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,950
He's now committed back to the club, but can

276
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,750
you, can you give us a little bit on that?

277
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,669
How, as a leader and someone who's died for

278
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:38,470
their club, like you have that, that must've

279
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,309
been a challenging one.

280
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,789
Yeah, no, definitely, you know, just the added,

281
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:46,470
um, amount of, you know, pressure and scrutiny

282
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,549
that, that put on, um, you know, different

283
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:52,269
people at the, at the organization.

284
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,509
It just makes, you know, made, made things,

285
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:56,269
you know, challenging, really challenging period.

286
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,269
But, you know, I feel like.

287
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,389
Uh, there's really been really robust discussions,

288
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,389
um, between many different parties at the football

289
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:07,870
club to ultimately create change.

290
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:10,789
And that's, what's really exciting is whilst we've

291
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:13,629
been through this really challenging period, I

292
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:16,029
think, um, you know, when we got all the right

293
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,590
people at the, you know, you've got the right

294
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,629
people at football club, you know, it's going to

295
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:22,110
create a really clear, um, path forward.

296
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,789
So that's what I'm really excited about is, is

297
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:26,629
getting over these little, little hurdles and

298
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:28,950
challenges, um, galvanizing.

299
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,669
together and having a really clear, um, path forward.

300
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,389
Um.

301
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,389
And is that all it is for you when something like

302
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:37,350
comes up, you just, it's a challenge you work

303
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,149
through, pre-season starts and you just, you go

304
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:42,110
back to getting everyone on the same page, even

305
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,789
with someone like Christian who's had that challenge?

306
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:45,750
Yeah, absolutely.

307
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,669
You know, at the end of every season, you, you

308
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:52,029
review your year, um, you review personally as a

309
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:54,350
team, as a leadership group, you know, where do

310
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,230
we, where do we think we did well?

311
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,669
Where do we think we fell away?

312
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,269
What are our opportunities to get better and grow?

313
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:03,870
And we've had some things, you know, like the

314
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,309
Christian stuff really high, you know, make it

315
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:09,590
heightened or, um, awareness on, on some of

316
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,190
these issues.

317
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:13,990
So, yeah, I, I see it as opportunity, you know,

318
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,470
you can look at it, you know, the glass half empty

319
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,470
or glass half full.

320
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,950
And for me, I think it just, it's really

321
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,190
exciting for the future.

322
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:26,549
Um, so now I'm looking forward to, yeah, continue

323
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:28,830
to, to get through, you know, these review, the

324
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,110
these, these reviews going on at the moment.

325
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:34,350
Um, seeing what the, what the outcomes are, we've

326
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,509
already had, you know, great discussions, um,

327
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:39,110
through the playing group, through the leadership

328
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,870
group between, you know, Goody and Richo and, um,

329
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:43,950
and Purdy.

330
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,470
So yeah, I think there's going to be some really

331
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:49,870
positive things come out of this, um, process and

332
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,190
this hardship, I guess.

333
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,909
Love the way you think about Jack, we've been

334
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:56,350
really privileged to have you, um, join our, uh,

335
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,509
leader community where we bring together diverse

336
00:15:58,509 --> 00:15:58,750
groups.

337
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,669
Of people from different backgrounds in groups of

338
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:03,629
five or six and the opportunity we think to

339
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,750
learn and connect and share in unique ways together.

340
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,309
Uh, um, have you found that experience?

341
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:11,350
Yeah, no, I've really enjoyed it.

342
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:14,110
Um, I guess there's a bit of a theme of me wanting

343
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,190
to continue to grow and evolve and, and then, you

344
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,590
know, I was looking at the end of last year about,

345
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,549
you know, what, what are some other leadership

346
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:22,470
opportunities out there?

347
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,710
And my, my coach, Simon Goodwin, being part of the

348
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,149
leader, uh, connect family, um, for, for a while.

349
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:28,629
So.

350
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,389
You know, he recommended the leader program and, you

351
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:33,350
know, the ability to be able to work with, you

352
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,710
know, five or six other like-minded, um,

353
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,190
individuals, um, working in different fields or

354
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,110
something extremely appealing to me.

355
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,149
So I jumped on board and it, you know, the last 12

356
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:45,750
months has been terrific to just about have people

357
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:50,309
to bounce certain things off, um, and, and get

358
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,990
different perspectives on, on things.

359
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:54,389
Trusted environment, a lot of those conversations

360
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,789
are private to you, Jack, but is there anything

361
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:57,509
that you've felt like I've been able to take that

362
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:58,669
away and implement?

363
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:02,389
That into your day-to-day life or into the, your,

364
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,830
your work life and your footy life?

365
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:04,789
Yeah.

366
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:07,670
You know, like, you know, whether it's just getting

367
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,029
confident in it, you might have a thought on, on how

368
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:14,430
to approach an issue and even hearing people say,

369
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:17,390
yeah, no, I think, you know, I align with that or

370
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,750
I think that's a good way, like just the confidence

371
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,069
to then be able to, you know, follow that out and

372
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,549
know, and not doubt yourself.

373
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:28,309
I think that was, that was really, you know, valuable.

374
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:31,630
And, you know, I work with someone who was in kind

375
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,390
of ed education who looked at the world completely

376
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,630
different outside of the football bubble.

377
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,549
So to even be challenged of different ways of thinking,

378
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,309
um, just, just get, you know, I felt like it really

379
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:49,910
gave me balanced, um, view on, on how to approach

380
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,190
different issues and how to get the best outcome.

381
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,910
So, um, yeah, whether it was being supported and

382
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,069
having that, that confidence to be able to really go

383
00:17:58,069 --> 00:18:01,309
after it or, um, or being challenged, maybe I can

384
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:03,910
approach this from a different angle, um, and see

385
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,910
it from a different angle.

386
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:05,549
Yeah.

387
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:06,509
I thought it was invaluable.

388
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:08,309
You're a great self-improver, Jack.

389
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:10,990
You've just done an MBA in the last season, you go and

390
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,670
do an internship with Deloitte, you sign up to

391
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:16,230
collaborative leadership programs like Our World

392
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,710
at Aleda and it's just a great reflection on, on you.

393
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,829
A lot of people would, you know, think footy's enough

394
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:23,910
to bite off at one point in time, but you, you seem

395
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,390
to be constantly finding that.

396
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,509
Ty, how do you get the balance right between all that?

397
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:29,670
Not all the time.

398
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,750
Um, my wife, my wife was under the pump last year

399
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,710
with the internship.

400
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:38,230
Um, and just for the record, I've got the, uh, degree,

401
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,430
not the MBA, haven't quite nailed the, uh, haven't

402
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,309
quite got to the MBA, but got the commerce degree.

403
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,470
Um, you know, I just want to continue to keep the doors

404
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:51,630
open and I want to continue to, to grow and evolve.

405
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,390
And I never want to think I have the answers.

406
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,950
Um, and you know, football is going to

407
00:18:58,069 --> 00:18:59,829
wrap up at one, one point in time.

408
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:03,750
And, um, you know, I, I enjoyed doing my commerce

409
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,789
degree and, and majoring in finance.

410
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,509
And I was like, you know, is this something that I

411
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:10,069
want to continue to challenge myself?

412
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,549
You know, exhaust myself in football playing, maybe

413
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:17,230
post footy, can I go and create a new career for myself?

414
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:20,710
Um, so that's kind of what I'm, I'm exploring at the moment.

415
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,430
I did the, you know, eight week internship at Deloitte

416
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:26,589
the last year in mergers and acquisitions, which was,

417
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:27,589
which was intense, you know?

418
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:27,990
That was a.

419
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:32,349
Um, you know, I was up at 5 00 AM to do my off season

420
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:36,190
training and then go to work on public transport and do

421
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,589
your, your nine to five.

422
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:41,269
Um, although at Deloitte, no one's really budging from

423
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:43,829
their chair at five o'clock there, uh, the hard work is there.

424
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:47,190
So, you know, I'm getting home at seven o'clock, which is

425
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,829
pretty much when my, my kids are asleep.

426
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:53,910
So, you know, balancing the football, the internship and

427
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,950
the family aspect was certainly challenging.

428
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,950
And it's something that I continue to.

429
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:00,950
Check in on from, from time to time, you know, hence why

430
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,069
I'm not doing an internship this off season, um, giving

431
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,710
you a bit more time back to, um, back to the family.

432
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,190
Jack, we love those patterns around what we see great

433
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,910
leadership looks like in different settings.

434
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,670
And you would have heard some of this language through

435
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,829
the leader program, this idea of self-leadership.

436
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:18,869
I want to ask you on that front, how do you make sure

437
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:21,710
you're feeling your best so that you can lead the others

438
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:22,470
in your world?

439
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:25,630
Yeah, I think something that I've really focused on over

440
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,869
the last, you know, back end of, of, of.

441
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:32,029
My career and probably something I learned, um, you

442
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:34,349
know, a few years after being in the system was balance is

443
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:35,190
really important.

444
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,630
You know, my default was to kind of, when things didn't go

445
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,950
well, work harder, do more.

446
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:47,069
Um, but you know, I feel like the more I kind of win at home,

447
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:52,150
I win doing, um, you know, growing, whether it's at uni

448
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,470
or, you know, doing things that I enjoy outside of football,

449
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,309
like surfing or, or camping.

450
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:57,990
The more.

451
00:20:58,069 --> 00:20:59,390
My football actually improved.

452
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:03,390
So for me, it was, it was understanding that, you know,

453
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,710
balance is really important.

454
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,710
Um, checking in with that from time to time.

455
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:12,150
Um, so that, that was, that's been a, uh, something that I

456
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:17,230
continue continually try and evaluate is how am I feeling?

457
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,829
You know, at times this year been under pump, whether it be

458
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:22,710
form or, you know, the external stuff going on.

459
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:27,710
And then it's like, now my default here is to push

460
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:27,869
harder.

461
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:28,029
Push harder.

462
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:34,269
Um, do more, um, and that kind of detracts from the rest of

463
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:37,829
your life and eventually catches up to you up with you, I think.

464
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:41,670
So I think just having that awareness of, of yourself and

465
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,630
when you're at your best and how you operate at your best and

466
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,309
maintaining that.

467
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:48,630
Love this idea of impact on others.

468
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,269
And wanted to ask you, is there one piece of leadership advice

469
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:53,630
that you pass on to others regularly?

470
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:57,869
I think in like the football, football sense, it's, you know,

471
00:21:57,869 --> 00:21:59,630
make sure your, your backyard's clean.

472
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:05,109
I, I think before you can lead and drive and have positive impact on others,

473
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:09,829
it's, um, leading by example, I think is the best form of, of leadership.

474
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:15,470
Um, it's a bit hard for me if, you know, a vice captain of, of the football

475
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:20,190
club to say, Hey, no, we need to be, um, be on time.

476
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,829
Uh, and we need to treat people with respect if, if I'm not doing it myself.

477
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:27,829
So I always start with how am I behaving?

478
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:28,829
How am I acting?

479
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:32,910
Am I living up to the, the values that we say we want to live by?

480
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:38,069
And, um, hopefully people say that, um, the young, young 18 year olds

481
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:41,869
coming into the football club say, you know, that's how our senior players

482
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:44,470
are acting and that's what's expected of, of this group.

483
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,910
So it's probably my first and foremost.

484
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,670
Don't think anyone would doubt Jack Viney on that front at all.

485
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,069
Um, in terms of vision, setting the vision for us is one thing, but do

486
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:57,789
you have any advice on how to successfully deliver that?

487
00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:01,630
Within a time, obviously some clear visions that you've got for success in

488
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,390
your world, how do you go about doing that, executing that with a time?

489
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:11,549
Yeah, I think what, one of the things I really enjoy, I love about team sports

490
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:16,950
and being involved in, um, you know, our leadership group is, we all have

491
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,349
different, you know, you want to have a leadership group that have different

492
00:23:20,349 --> 00:23:24,269
thoughts, different opinions and challenge each other, but then you come

493
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:27,670
to a clear decision and it's like, all right, how do we make this decision?

494
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:33,029
Um, how do we communicate that, communicate that decision clearly to the rest of the

495
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:35,390
group and all be in support of that.

496
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:41,190
So, um, I really love having robust discussions, discussions, but then having

497
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:47,150
that loyalty and that, um, you know, trust in each other to, all right, well, this

498
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,549
is the decision, whether I've agreed with it or not, um, we've got it, we've got to

499
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:53,150
back it in, I've got to support that.

500
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:56,950
Um, so I think, yeah, the, uh.

501
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:02,430
Uh, the getting clarity is, you know, what, what do we stand for?

502
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:07,589
What, what, what do we want to be, um, you know, known for the, how do we want to

503
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:11,950
live and live and breathe and what's our culture, what's our identity being super

504
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:17,470
clear on that and then, you know, when issues arise, you talk it over with, with

505
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:22,069
people who have different thoughts and then, um, through those robust discussions,

506
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:26,910
you, you get clarity and, and then hopefully relay that through, you know,

507
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,750
effective communication to, to the rest of the group.

508
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:31,369
It's a brilliant way to describe that.

509
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,450
And then once it's said, it's this united front, regardless of the differences, you've

510
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,490
got to be united and yeah, it makes, it makes a lot of sense.

511
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:42,710
Curiosity is a word that comes up all the time and successful people like you, we feel

512
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,009
like they're extremely curious.

513
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:48,170
And from a curiosity point of view, can you maybe share a rabbit hole you've gone down

514
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,890
recently that has piqued your interest that you could share with us in terms of curiosity?

515
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,849
Um, you know, I always like using my off season as a.

516
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:02,190
A way of challenging myself, doing things that might peak, uh, spark a little bit

517
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:02,829
interested in me.

518
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:07,250
So obviously the internship last year, which, which was challenging.

519
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,670
And then the year before that I did a five day silent retreat.

520
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:19,589
Um, so whether it's, you know, meditation, you know, Zen Buddhism, um, finance measures

521
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:24,710
and acquisitions, you know, I'm always looking for, for to expose myself of different ways

522
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,750
of thinking how, you know, what works for me.

523
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:31,529
What makes me tick, what makes me a better human, better leader, a better football player.

524
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:36,849
So, yeah, I guess the, uh, the five day silent retreat was, it was an interesting one.

525
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,309
Got to tell me a bit more about that.

526
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,230
Jack, how did that go?

527
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:41,349
It was, it was challenging.

528
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:45,329
Um, definitely one of the most challenging things I've ever done.

529
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:51,589
Um, it was pretty much wake up, um, meditate for most of the day.

530
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:56,930
Um, a few, a few kind of food breaks here or there, but you know, we're talking.

531
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,730
We're talking hours and hours of meditation, no talking.

532
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,410
Um, where did you do it?

533
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:04,230
It was, uh, Byron Bay.

534
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:10,549
Um, kind of like in the, they call it hinterlands, like the, yeah, the, the foresty area of Byron

535
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:10,829
Bay.

536
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:19,960
Um, and it was, it was a really cool experience to be able to just gain clarity on your own

537
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,420
thoughts.

538
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:27,359
Um, and, and what I found as well was like coming back to normal society and getting

539
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,319
back on my phone.

540
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:35,500
Was just understanding how different thing, you know, just the amount of, like whether

541
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:41,839
it's marketing or, um, you know, billboards or the things you follow on social media,

542
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,920
how that makes, how that influences how we, we think.

543
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,400
Um, so just was like, I think the first thing I did was go on my Instagram.

544
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:51,799
I was like, why am I actually following?

545
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:53,799
I don't actually enjoy this.

546
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,759
This doesn't make me happy.

547
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:58,339
This doesn't, um, bring much to my life.

548
00:26:58,339 --> 00:26:59,819
Or add much value to my life.

549
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:06,319
So I think just getting a few different realizations, um, from the experience was pretty cool.

550
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:06,920
Yeah.

551
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,240
Brilliant.

552
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,779
I'm, I'm fascinated by that.

553
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,039
You know, we, they say we have 80,000 thoughts a day and to understand that, you know, if

554
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,559
you slow that down, what does that mean?

555
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,220
And get a sense of your own, uh, mind.

556
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:20,019
I'm, uh, I'm more curious about that.

557
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:20,759
Uh, I'll have to ask.

558
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:21,240
How would you go?

559
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,779
Well, I am passionate about the meditation space.

560
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:28,039
So it's something I've done for more than 25 years, Jack.

561
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:28,619
Three footy.

562
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:29,059
Yup.

563
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:33,720
So I do the 20 minutes twice a day and, and that's been a, just a piece of gold for me.

564
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:34,880
I'm pretty consistent with that.

565
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,539
So I've often thought about, you know, would you extend that out and, uh, read a bit about

566
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:44,819
the silent retreats, but you know, for you to say it's, it's, it's challenging, uh, you

567
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:47,200
know, with your mental toughness is, is interesting, mate.

568
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:48,759
I, uh, I'd be up for it.

569
00:27:48,819 --> 00:27:49,779
I'd be up for it for sure.

570
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:50,440
That's a cool space.

571
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:57,380
I really, um, something that I was introduced to reluctantly through Paul Ruse, um, back

572
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:57,980
in, um.

573
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:03,400
Um, maybe my second, second or third season, he, he kind of made us all do meta or meditate,

574
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:10,180
um, before trainings and being a 19, 20 year old having to sit still for 10, 20 minutes.

575
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,319
I was like, I hated it.

576
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:16,480
But after doing it consistently for, you know, a couple of weeks, I was like, I'm actually

577
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,779
starting to play a little bit better here and I'm thinking a little bit clearer and

578
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:23,079
making some better decisions on the footy field.

579
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:27,420
So since then, yeah, it's been a pretty big part of, of my program.

580
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,759
And keep it, continue to be the best version of myself.

581
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,839
It's interesting, Joe.

582
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,920
I did it all three footy, gave it up the second I retired.

583
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:38,619
And a year later, my wife's going, you're a fucking nightmare.

584
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,559
What has happened?

585
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,359
You need to, and I hadn't really worked out that it was helping me in so many other areas

586
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:47,119
of my life, putting it down to some of this transition.

587
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,240
And, uh, she was a hundred percent right.

588
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,720
Like just what it was doing to calm you, make better decisions, be a better dad.

589
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:55,500
And then I really understood it.

590
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,079
Then I really sort of worked it out.

591
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:57,400
And, uh.

592
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,160
Um, you know, it's been a, been an absolute gift, that one for sure.

593
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,859
In terms of collaboration, we, we love this quote, Jack, the cost of leadership is time.

594
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,359
You mentioned a little bit before about the demands and, and, and workloads and your

595
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:11,279
curiosity taking you into different areas.

596
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,119
You know, how do you manage that and still be the leader that you want to be?

597
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:22,660
Yeah, I guess it, like, it's a really challenging one, Das, like you said, is, uh, I

598
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:27,140
want to continue to find different ways of, of thinking.

599
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:34,140
But at the same, in the same way, I'm, I'm trying to consolidate my own leadership philosophy.

600
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:42,779
So, so how much do you bunker down in what you think, you know, to be true versus what others, um, say, you know?

601
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:46,539
So I think that's just like the journey in mind at the moment as well.

602
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:53,980
It's, I continue to explore different ways of thinking, get exposure to different things, different experiences, you know,

603
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,980
whilst consolidating, you know, this is, this is what.

604
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,759
This is how things have played out in my own life and my own experiences.

605
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:06,480
And, um, yeah, continue to build upon, upon my, my own philosophy.

606
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:13,599
So it's a challenging one that, um, yeah, I don't, I don't have the answers to right now.

607
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:18,160
Communication's a, a, a pillar that we speak about with everyone.

608
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,500
And that idea that that's something that people getting a handle on that consistently.

609
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,140
Have you got a mantra that you live by when it comes to the way you communicate in your world?

610
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:38,670
This is probably something that came to fruition through my leader experience was, I haven't known anything differently about communication.

611
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:49,650
I feel like at, um, AFL and club lands, like communication is so important and it's, um, it's practiced daily and it's two way feedback.

612
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:53,549
It's how you receive feedback and how you give feedback.

613
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,829
But I feel like maybe from a.

614
00:30:56,589 --> 00:30:58,690
Corporate or business point of view.

615
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:13,950
Communication isn't as strong of a, um, you know, key feature, but, um, you know, w we practice so much about, you know, there's, there's, there's feedback, um, to be given what's the most effective way to give that feedback.

616
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:17,950
Um, and the reasons we give feedback is because we care about people.

617
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,930
We want to, we want people to improve.

618
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:26,589
Like if we didn't want people to improve and get better than we wouldn't tell them, we just ignore, ignore it and get on with our lives.

619
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:26,890
But.

620
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:28,549
Yeah.

621
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:34,690
Football context, context, we're all trying to improve and if our teammates are better, we're going to be better as a team.

622
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:41,789
So here's the feedback I'm going to give you because I care about, about you and I'm doing it in a respectful manner.

623
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:54,930
Um, and then on the flip side, there's, there's how I receive the feedback, you know, whilst in the moment I might not agree, I'll get my walls up and get a little bit defensive, which happens most times.

624
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,470
You know, people, people don't like, um.

625
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:04,250
Um, hearing feedback, um, sometimes, but with time you, you process that information.

626
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,130
You say, you know, it's no, it actually is a bit of truth to that.

627
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:11,690
Um, even if they are wrong, you know, I can see where they're coming from.

628
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,490
I can understand their perspective.

629
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:26,069
Um, and then we, we, we galvanize again and, um, come to that United front, um, and try and yeah, deliver a better performance for each other.

630
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:26,650
Um.

631
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:36,849
So I think, yeah, for me, it's that two-way communication, constant feedback, um, and, and circling back, I think that's something as well on a football field.

632
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:40,269
There's not a lot of opportunity to explain where you're coming from.

633
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:46,089
It might be, uh, you know, there's a few expletives, a bit more blunt, bit, bit more direct.

634
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:55,750
Um, but then when you get to the halftime, once you get to the end of the game, you, you got to follow back up and say, you know, this is where, um, this is where I was coming from.

635
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:56,470
I might've been a little bit off.

636
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:56,529
Yeah.

637
00:32:56,529 --> 00:32:56,630
Yeah.

638
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:02,049
I might've been out of line in the moment, but you know, I needed you to do this, um, right then and there.

639
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:07,329
Um, cause there's a lot of trust that can be eroded through poor communication.

640
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:12,009
Um, so just continuing to follow up and, and check in, I think is critical.

641
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,009
Brilliant description.

642
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:15,309
Jack, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

643
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:24,140
Probably cliche, but my old man, you know, we've talked about him a fair bit, um, tonight and my mom as well.

644
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:29,000
You know, there's all the time dad was, um, dad was, was working.

645
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:39,579
Hard and I came home with few issues from school and, um, whether I was being bullied or whatnot, and mom's the one giving me, giving me the philosophies and the solutions to, to move forward.

646
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:48,420
So my parents have been enormous and I've been quite fortunate to have Simon Goodwin as my, my head coach for the last, you know, nine, 10 years.

647
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:58,420
And I think he's a terrific coach and I've lent on him, um, enormously and continuing to be, you know, inspired by the way he, he leads and coaches.

648
00:33:59,019 --> 00:34:04,900
So, um, yeah, I would say, I would say Simon's a massive inspiration to mine as well.

649
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:14,619
Been full of admiration for you from the moment I heard about you as a young kid and the type of person you are and the, the Viney family tradition is, uh, not surprising.

650
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:21,780
Here you talk about values, here you talk about the way you live and, and you live that in every moment that I've ever seen you on a footy field or, or off the footy field.

651
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,619
So congratulations.

652
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:27,119
There's so many great chapters to unfold and, um, been a great pleasure to catch up with you.

653
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:27,539
Thanks for your time.

654
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:28,380
