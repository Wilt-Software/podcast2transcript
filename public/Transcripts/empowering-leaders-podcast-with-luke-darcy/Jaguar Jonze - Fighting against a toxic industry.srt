1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,089
How do you stand up against an environment that's designed to silence you?

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,189
What does it mean to tell your own story, empower others and lead a catalyst for change?

3
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:19,000
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,660
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field has been a lifelong passion of mine.

5
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:27,579
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective.

6
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:33,500
I've had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders in education, sport, industry and the arts

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,920
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership where everyone has a voice.

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,520
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

9
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:03,460
Lena Lynch was born on the 12th of January 1992 in Yokohama, Japan of Taiwanese-Australian descent,

10
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,519
migrating to Australia at the age of six.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Professionally known as Jaguar Jones, she's an extraordinary singer, songwriter,

12
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:10,500
multi-instrumentalist.

13
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,519
and multi-disciplinary artist.

14
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:18,219
Her courage to go public with her own story of sexual assault has in no short part led to a cultural review.

15
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,359
The Australian music industry aimed at stopping sexual harassment and systemic discrimination.

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,359
It is an amazing and unique story of leadership.

17
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:31,480
Jaguar Jones, it's a great pleasure and honour to meet you and I really appreciate you joining me today.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,879
No, thank you so much for having me, Luke.

19
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:40,680
I loved in doing some research for today, there was a quote attributed towards you

20
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:40,700
and I thought it was really interesting.

21
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,799
It resonated with me to sum up the creative explosion that is Dina Lynch into a neat little

22
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:51,620
elevator pitch would have even the most qualified journalist in tears rather than trying to do it

23
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,159
myself and embarrassing me.

24
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,599
I thought, can you maybe sum up your creative genius and describe the passion you have

25
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,000
and the different disciplines that your art takes?

26
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:08,159
I guess my journey into creativity or music or art is really different in the sense that

27
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,240
I wasn't creative growing up.

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,180
I mean, I probably was creative, but it was very repressed and I was very much pushed towards

29
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:22,159
the maths and science angle and coming from, I guess, a troubled background, my obsession

30
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:30,659
and what was drummed into my head was security and stability and to climb up that social ladder

31
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:38,699
so that I can get out of, you know, my situation that, you know, and so taking a punt on something

32
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,219
like music or art.

33
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:42,340
That was never, ever, ever in my trajectory.

34
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,780
I studied engineering at Melbourne Uni and then I went on to, I didn't finish that, but

35
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,879
I went on to business marketing and became a business analyst in a software development

36
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:56,400
company.

37
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,259
So that was so different to where I've ended up now.

38
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:09,199
And the reason is because I've had a lot of trauma growing up, but nowhere to put that

39
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,199
trauma or to process.

40
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:18,080
I had no support and, you know, there was something that happened when I was 18 and

41
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,020
it just kind of pulled the thread and unraveled everything.

42
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:30,500
And I was walking home in Melbourne and past a garage sale and I saw a guitar and I just

43
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,460
saw that guitar and said to myself, I'm going to learn how to play the guitar, but I didn't

44
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,599
learn how to play the guitar.

45
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,360
I just ended up writing.

46
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:48,400
All these songs that I didn't know was, I guess, within me, but basically it was, there

47
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,219
was too much in my body and I had to put that somewhere else.

48
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:58,259
And music became that vessel and communication tool in order for me to be able to start having

49
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:00,580
honest dialogue with myself.

50
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,479
And that became, that started this journey of passion for me.

51
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,460
I think my whole life has been about survival.

52
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,759
And when I came across passion,

53
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,020
it changed my life.

54
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:20,480
And so I decided to take huge change and huge steps to make that passion my everyday reality.

55
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,500
If anyone has heard Jaguar Jones sing, you will hear passion.

56
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,399
I promise you that.

57
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,720
And I've loved the journey for me of going back and listening to what you've written.

58
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,839
And it is amazing.

59
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:32,240
It's brilliant.

60
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,420
I encourage anyone that hasn't heard your music to start there for a start.

61
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,740
And there's other areas that you branch into with your photography.

62
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,920
And so many other creative bits of genius.

63
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,959
As I said, I've got this theory, Jaguar, that people can't, you can't manufacture passion

64
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,699
in someone else.

65
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,420
It's not possible.

66
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,800
But often parents and adults, we try to do that sometimes for good reasons, but it never

67
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,519
works out.

68
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,480
And is that your lived experience that you were sent towards engineering for safety and

69
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,259
climbing the ladder, as you said, but your really life started when you really focused

70
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:04,860
on what you love?

71
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:05,720
Totally.

72
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:05,879
Totally.

73
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,600
And I understand as well, because when I say I had a troubled,

74
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,680
troubled background, you know, I also think my mom went through a really, really difficult

75
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,060
time.

76
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,300
She is the most amazing person and what she wanted out of me and the people around her,

77
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:26,540
what they wanted out of me is for us to all have a different circumstance and for us to

78
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,519
have, I guess, the lowest risk in being able to have the most stable life.

79
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:38,360
And to them, that would mean, you know, I guess, going to university, having education

80
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,579
and then climbing the ladder.

81
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:47,180
But that doesn't mean that if you have security in that financial sense, you'll be happy as

82
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,439
well.

83
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:53,360
And I think the difference in embarking on my own journey is giving myself permission

84
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,459
to not meet anyone else's expectations, but to live my own life because it is what I deserve.

85
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,160
Incredibly authentic way that you've gone about it too, Jagu, in every sense.

86
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,339
And it's a great lesson for all of us listening, isn't it?

87
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:09,579
That in search of something, you're going to find something.

88
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:14,980
Sometimes stability and security, we give up the thing that makes us happy in every sense.

89
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:20,220
Now, at 18, as you said, you stumble across a garage, you pick up a guitar and you start

90
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,279
writing these songs and you're about to embark on the creative pursuit, the music industry.

91
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,180
So that's challenging enough.

92
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:33,459
And yet that industry throws up these incredible hurdles your way that are horrific and extraordinary

93
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:37,800
for you to have to deal with your own sexual assault, discrimination.

94
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,459
And for you to take that on.

95
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:43,120
And for you to take a stand at such an age, you're still only 30 years of age now, and

96
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,220
to say, this is not acceptable.

97
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,220
This has to change.

98
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,339
I'm not going to allow this takes extraordinary courage.

99
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,819
You're taking on powerful people as you have done, Jagu.

100
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:54,459
Where did that self-leadership come from within you?

101
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:01,040
I guess it really does come from where I came from.

102
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:07,279
When I said I come from a troubled background, there was two ways to go about it when given

103
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,879
a certain card.

104
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,879
You know, dealt a certain card in life.

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,120
That is to let it kick you to the curb or bring it to your stride.

106
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:20,500
And I definitely did, like as a younger person, let it kick me to the curb.

107
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,519
And I had my ways of dealing with things that was unhealthy.

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,259
But I then learned to constantly bring it into my stride.

109
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:35,800
And I realized that resilience and passion will get me further every time.

110
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:38,620
And so I think there was this.

111
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:45,500
I don't know, innate feeling in myself of wanting to survive, but also wanting to take

112
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:52,480
the power of my own life and not let anyone else determine what environment I will be

113
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,420
in and what kind of life I will lead.

114
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:01,180
I say this now, like it was just, you know, this quick, easy decision one morning, but

115
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,699
it wasn't.

116
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,639
It's an everyday struggle.

117
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,720
Today is a good day, but maybe tomorrow isn't.

118
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,819
But what I constantly tell myself is.

119
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,660
To fight just a little bit every single day and take those baby steps, because you'll

120
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,819
look back one day and just say, like, that you've conquered mountains and mountains of

121
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:23,279
obstacles when sometimes you're just trudging along that mountain and thinking it's impossible.

122
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,899
You look back and you remind yourself of what you've achieved when you do things bit by bit.

123
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:34,080
And those mountains are enormous already, Jagu, and you think that your story and your

124
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,379
leadership and your courage has inspired this cultural review into the Australian music

125
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:40,279
industry, as I said in the introduction.

126
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,340
And this is all at the sexual harassment that has been commonplace.

127
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,960
I mean, the music industry and other industries, as we know, but no one had really called it

128
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,879
out in Australia like you had and the systemic discrimination going on.

129
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,600
Are you comfortable with the way your industry has responded now over time?

130
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,039
It definitely took time.

131
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,639
When I decided to speak out, it was a very, very different place.

132
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,899
And it was a lot of risk.

133
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:14,320
I didn't have the same power, privilege or platform to be able to make the change that

134
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,860
I've been able to make.

135
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,139
But the truth is, when I spoke out, people were ready for it.

136
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:27,460
They just were waiting for that, I guess, leadership or that space for that wave to

137
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:27,820
happen.

138
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,799
The truth is, I didn't speak out on my own.

139
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:37,500
I spoke out and it just caused ripples amongst many who had had it repressed in them and

140
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,360
needed that change.

141
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:45,220
So it led to a momentum of support and a lot of people on the same side.

142
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:50,500
And to get to a place now where we're able to commission a music industry review has

143
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:56,259
taken so much sacrifice and so much hard work, not just from me, but so many other survivors

144
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:58,879
and incredible women in the industry.

145
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,679
And it just came from this need of change.

146
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:08,080
I don't think this industry can survive.

147
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,299
I don't think this industry can survive in the same way that it did in the past.

148
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:09,519
I don't think this industry can survive in the same way it has been.

149
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,899
And I think the people are sick of the abuse of power that is prevalent in the industry.

150
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:20,399
And Jaguar, people won't understand, and I'm sure you are acutely aware now that often

151
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,840
the laws are set up to protect those in the hierarchy who have got resources and got money

152
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,399
and defamation laws and gag orders.

153
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,159
And it's still probably very hard for you to tell the full truth at times of what happened

154
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,139
to you and what needs to happen to make that change.

155
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:37,320
Are you disappointed in some ways?

156
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:38,139
I mean, emerging artists...

157
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,620
You're a late starter in some ways to the industry that it took someone like you who

158
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,759
probably was more vulnerable than some of the other industry heavyweights that could

159
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:48,519
have spoken out.

160
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,539
Are you a bit surprised by that or a bit disappointed by that?

161
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,460
I'm not surprised, but I'm disappointed.

162
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,159
And I'm extremely hurt by it too, because even though I've been able to create this

163
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:05,659
momentum, there is this expectation on me to give, give, give, give, and the industry

164
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:07,460
to just be able to take, take, take.

165
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:12,840
And I am so tired of having to give from an empty tank.

166
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:20,679
It's a lot easier now having been able to move the industry to a place where they are

167
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:26,799
wanting to grow awareness rather than just deny and dismiss.

168
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:33,120
But there's a lot of healing within me that I have to do at some point because I just

169
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,279
had to keep on fighting on behalf of the industry and on behalf of our leaders who are paid,

170
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:44,860
and in position to be able to make this change without depending on people like me, again,

171
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,919
without the same level of power, privilege, resource, or platform.

172
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:59,679
So it's incredibly difficult, but I just know that it will...

173
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,740
The reason why I did it was because I wish someone did it for me when I didn't have a

174
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,059
voice.

175
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,179
And I know what it's like to be powerless.

176
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,139
And I know what it's like to be powerless for so long.

177
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:15,860
And there was no way that I was going to be content with staying in that culture of silence

178
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,399
and repeating the same pattern that has been systemic in the industry.

179
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:29,799
So I was more happy to risk and cannibalize my career than to just stay quiet and know

180
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,480
that it's happening to other people.

181
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,720
So I had to do something.

182
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,879
Which is the ultimate definition of courage and leadership in my mind.

183
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:43,240
And I sit here and I think of the bravery and it comes in unique forms, Jaguar, to think

184
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:50,779
that you have that within you to take on such a powerful industry that's set up to make

185
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:51,820
that difficult for you.

186
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:57,179
And I hope part of what happens is that the creativity that clearly pours out of you,

187
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,659
you get this up.

188
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:04,240
People like me who aren't from the music industry who hear your story and go, wow, how amazed

189
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,120
and impressed are we?

190
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,860
I love your song, Who Died and Made the X.

191
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:14,720
And I just can't help but smile when I, can I just read the opening lyrics back to you?

192
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:16,059
Clearly they're yours.

193
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,240
But to me, this sums up what you're on about in such a powerful way.

194
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,519
I'm leading on the voice of change.

195
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,840
Your downfall isn't far away.

196
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:26,980
Believing that you're here to stay.

197
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:31,179
Now that you're leaving, we can finally say, who died and made you king?

198
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:55,850
The song for me was all about, I guess the industry is built on all these little kingdoms

199
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,870
and, you know, you could have even like an even bigger kingdom, but there's this kind

200
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,350
of hierarchy of kingdoms in the industry.

201
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:10,669
And on top of every kingdom is a self-made king that has somehow decided to give themselves

202
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:16,710
so much power and exploit so much and cause so much damage because they feel like they

203
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,350
are entitled.

204
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,110
Or have earned the right to that power.

205
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:27,070
And I guess it's all about decentralizing that kind of hierarchical structure of the

206
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:33,789
industry and, you know, trying to instill healthy relationships and healthy environments.

207
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,230
And it just needs a lot of change.

208
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,529
I sit here laughing when you read those lyrics back to me.

209
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:47,590
But at the time, I was, I don't know if I can swear, shitting.

210
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:52,850
Like, I was, I don't know what, how else I could say it, but I don't know if you can,

211
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:53,450
if I can swear.

212
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,669
You can swear as often as you like, you can do whatever you like.

213
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,769
It was an apt description.

214
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:02,409
I have never, ever written a song like that.

215
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:08,250
That song was the first time I allowed myself to feel anger.

216
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:14,950
For so long, I felt like anger was a bad emotion because the people around me used anger in

217
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:15,730
the wrong way.

218
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:17,590
But what I didn't realize was that I was a bad person.

219
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,690
And what I didn't realize is that I wasn't acknowledging myself or giving myself the

220
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:26,429
love that I deserve by holding back the anger I should be allowed to feel because of what

221
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:27,309
has happened to me.

222
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:32,429
That song was this like huge step of change for me.

223
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:38,889
I wrote that song so quickly in one day and listened back to it going like, oh my gosh,

224
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:43,110
who is this person with so much anger and sass?

225
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,049
Like, I don't even recognize her.

226
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:47,070
And then I went down this like,

227
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:52,529
spiral of I'm going to have lawyers all up against me.

228
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,309
I sampled someone as the instrumental.

229
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,830
I sampled someone's speech, hypocritical speech in the instrumental.

230
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:18,710
I just went on this crazy research of, am I going to get sued?

231
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,690
How much risk is this?

232
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:22,210
What am I up against?

233
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,470
Should I do this?

234
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,070
Am I going to get into trouble?

235
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,450
Is it worth it?

236
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:31,649
It was two months of me being in my head going, I don't know if I should do this.

237
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:41,470
But I'm so, so, so glad I did because it ended up coming out hand in hand with the Four Corners

238
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:47,929
documentary behind, I guess, a particular story in the music industry.

239
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:49,250
And it became...

240
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:55,190
It became this like perfect storm of all these elements locking into place so that,

241
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,970
I don't know, survivors can finally find this voice and give themselves the anger that they deserve

242
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,289
and charge on through demanding change.

243
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:10,950
So now I sit here going, I am so proud of myself for pushing against my own fear

244
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:15,329
and claiming my own power back and speaking my truth.

245
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,109
But at the time it was a whole different story.

246
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:18,549
So that...

247
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:27,509
What that has now led to is a better artist within me because I'm now creating music and

248
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:34,650
creating art with less fear and less filter because I'm giving myself permission to speak

249
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,509
my truth, even in my art.

250
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,930
What a powerful message and delivered in the most incredible way.

251
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:47,569
And the sample that you included in your song was that of a 50-year veteran and an incredible

252
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:48,529
position of power.

253
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,029
And I think that's a significant change.

254
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:53,430
And, you know, you can't walk in someone else's shoes.

255
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:57,910
I can't pretend to understand what that must have been like for you, but you summed up

256
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,930
the courage extraordinarily.

257
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:03,349
And it is great to hear that that has then led to you feeling that you have got your

258
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,029
power back.

259
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,630
And, you know, as I said, it's a remarkable story of leadership in every way.

260
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,150
You know, Jacob, to share with you, we feel like, and this podcast has been really in

261
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:18,170
essence about identifying a change in leadership that we're seeing, you know, I come from a

262
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:18,809
sporting background.

263
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:22,930
But people in industry, that there is this new culture, new community where I think the

264
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,970
words you used were sort of breaking down the hierarchy.

265
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:27,269
We're seeing that.

266
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:32,430
We're seeing these great leaders who are powerful, sometimes alpha males, who now see that leading

267
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:37,309
with care and empathy and vulnerability and looking after the whole person is in fact

268
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:42,289
the way to do it and the most powerful thing that you can do and the most sustained success

269
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:42,970
going forward.

270
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:45,309
Is that where you want this to head?

271
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:46,230
This is your industry.

272
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,390
Is there a...

273
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,789
Are you seeing that trend in your industry?

274
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:50,529
Are you seeing that trend in your industry now or is it still a bit slow?

275
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:55,349
I mean, I still think it's a bit slow, but I am seeing that change.

276
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:59,930
And I know that once we embark on that change, things will move quite quickly.

277
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:07,089
It's that initial step that takes a little bit of time and energy and effort because

278
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:14,049
what you're wanting, you're basically breaking down everything you know and everything you're

279
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:16,970
comfortable with and having to unlearn and rebuild.

280
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,390
And that's a huge ask.

281
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:25,950
So I don't blame the industry for being slow because it's been built up for so long on

282
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:30,809
control and shame and denial and dismissal and perception.

283
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,869
And I think that is also a reflection in society too.

284
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:39,670
I think for so long, society has been built on control and shame and having to put on

285
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,490
a certain kind of perception.

286
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:48,690
And this leadership that you're talking about to me is this realization of, you know,

287
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:51,549
we actually can be a lot more happier.

288
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:54,250
We can actually do a lot more.

289
00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:01,730
We can have better and healthier relationships if we flip it on its head and build society

290
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,349
with a different structure.

291
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:07,990
And so we're starting to see less shame in conversations.

292
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,890
You know, I don't know about you, but, you know, things like there's more language to

293
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:18,250
things that the word accountability sounds less like a business term now and more like

294
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:18,609
everyday language.

295
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:24,630
There's things like, you know, toxic masculinity, you know, which wasn't everyday language

296
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,049
before, even things for like male gaze.

297
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,970
What was male gaze when I was in primary school?

298
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:33,569
That wasn't something that we had coined then.

299
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:40,470
So I think we're evolving now to be able to confront things, you know, on its head and

300
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:48,170
label things so that we can start removing things from denial and dismissal and shame

301
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:48,789
and shame.

302
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:52,869
And start looking at the truth about things and growing as society.

303
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,450
That's my opinion though.

304
00:20:54,730 --> 00:21:00,150
Well, and you sum it up eloquently and you make a powerful point again in your language.

305
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:03,829
And, you know, it certainly resonates with me hearing you say that.

306
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:10,089
And I hope part of what we're hoping to do is to share that for people, you know, very

307
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:14,529
different background for me, you know, haven't ever been on the end of discrimination, haven't

308
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:16,710
ever had to deal with anything like you've had to deal with.

309
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,710
So it's very hard.

310
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:21,430
It's very hard for me to even pretend that I understand what that's like, but hopefully

311
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,170
the empathy is there to say, we've got to learn.

312
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:28,589
You know, we've all have a teenage daughter that I want to not have to experience the

313
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:31,569
pain that you've been through to get to the point that you are.

314
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:36,089
And I think that is the essence of it, that the courage of someone like you is going to

315
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:39,369
open those pathways in a much more powerful way.

316
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,849
And I look at your story and I think, I wouldn't underestimate Jaguar Jones in any form or

317
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:48,730
any, I'm changing gear a little bit, but I did read with interest that mid-break, you're

318
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,549
performance, you're fresh from doing Eurovision Australia, that you, and one of your performances,

319
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,990
you've dislocated your shoulder, put it back in.

320
00:21:57,089 --> 00:22:01,130
I mean, the sporting background I come from, most sports people tap them out of dislocated

321
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:01,250
shoulder.

322
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,190
You finished your performance with a dislocated shoulder.

323
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,190
Where do you draw on that sort of courage and resilience from?

324
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:13,650
Um, I, that was my very first live national TV performance.

325
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:18,710
And I remember when it, I remember when it kind of, you know, I was in the middle of

326
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,549
lockdown, you know, locked out, there was all this dread coming over my body.

327
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,250
And I just was saying to myself, oh my gosh, I'm going to have to tell everyone I have

328
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:27,849
to stop.

329
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:34,789
And I've made myself into a national fool for my very first performance and that I've

330
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:37,450
dislocated my shoulder and can't continue this performance.

331
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:44,190
And there was this, I don't know, enormous energy within me and probably a lot of adrenaline

332
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:47,329
as well that said, no way.

333
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:48,609
You have worked.

334
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:56,150
So hard to get to this point, to just let a dislocated shoulder stop you from performing

335
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,109
nationally.

336
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:02,490
This is the first opportunity you've had to be able to perform in front of your whole

337
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:02,990
country.

338
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:09,730
Try and scrape together every bit you've got and finish this performance.

339
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,309
And I just remember like, you can kind of see it if you slow it down.

340
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,329
I'm trying to, there's these different angles.

341
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,609
I'm stuck in this certain position, which I.

342
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:24,089
I made it look like it was kind of choreography, but I was actually stuck lying down just like,

343
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,410
where do we go?

344
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,029
Where do we go?

345
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:26,869
How do we get up?

346
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:29,329
And I locked it in.

347
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:31,730
I was like, oh my God, yes, no way.

348
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,569
And so I continued on.

349
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:41,829
And if you see this video on YouTube, I actually have to push down these walls in the middle

350
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:43,950
of the song to reveal the band.

351
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:47,750
You'll see one arm, one shoulder struggling.

352
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:53,349
To like push it because I had like, it was extremely sore and I was like, oh gosh.

353
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,150
And in my head I had, okay, plan B, just kick it down.

354
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,529
But it eventually did fall over.

355
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,910
But you'll see there's one, one arm is just like bump wall down.

356
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:05,289
And the other one is like, like really pushing for it.

357
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,349
But I think I don't, I don't know.

358
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:14,049
Sometimes I tell myself that the greatest asset that was given to me is resilience and

359
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:14,529
courage.

360
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:17,730
Um, but I am made of.

361
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,789
I don't, I don't know, oxymorons.

362
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:28,150
I don't want to be, um, I guess like, I don't want to pretend I'm a certain way and empower

363
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:31,869
people by saying, just stay strong all the time.

364
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:37,970
Because the truth is, uh, you know, I am courageous, but I am also extremely fearful.

365
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,509
And that's the truth.

366
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:42,650
You know, every day is I'm strong and I'm also weak.

367
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:47,589
Sometimes I can, you know, back people up, but sometimes I need backing up too.

368
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,029
I want to be transparent with my journey.

369
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:53,150
It's, it hasn't been a breeze and it's difficult.

370
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:57,470
And, you know, I wanted to give up so many times, but I didn't.

371
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,829
And I think that's the truth I want to put out there.

372
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,970
I don't want this perception, um, that musicians always have to put out there that, you know,

373
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:09,529
everything is glamorous and glitz and rock and roll.

374
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:10,809
That's not the truth.

375
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:16,750
You know, there's only just this one aspect of the story that we're letting the audiences,

376
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,750
um, get consumed in.

377
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,809
It's up and down.

378
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:25,930
Um, but the most important thing is that you're looking after yourself and you're giving yourself

379
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,109
the love that you deserve.

380
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:33,569
And what I've learned is that you have support around you, like genuine support and that

381
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:37,930
you're in, uh, the healthiest environment that you can be.

382
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:40,950
Um, and that's the truth I want to put out there.

383
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:45,650
And I think that's why I'm able to do things like that on national TV.

384
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,950
That's a, that's a great way to, to explain.

385
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:54,630
And I, and I love that about listening to you and reading about you is that total openness

386
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,210
and total vulnerability and honesty.

387
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,130
And I think if we're all honest, there's, you know, imposter syndrome is a thing, isn't

388
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:01,250
it?

389
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:08,930
Who am I, how am I to, to, to take on, like you have huge, powerful people or who am I

390
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:13,410
to be creative enough to perform in front of a national stage and, you know, the sporting

391
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:16,730
context, that, that great fear combination with that great confidence.

392
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,789
Confidence is, is, is just the truth, isn't it?

393
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:23,849
But it doesn't seem as though, you know, in the world of social media, we don't tend to

394
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:25,289
see that too often these days.

395
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:30,910
And particularly someone like you from, you know, uh, a mixed race background coming to

396
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:36,069
Australia with all the things that have happened to you to be able to still at 30 years of

397
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:36,990
age, share that.

398
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:41,369
Do you see that impact, particularly for young females being something that you're really,

399
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,309
you're really proud of?

400
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,529
So I was telling you before I did Eurovision Australia Decides.

401
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:52,690
It was on Saturday and, um, I released this song called Little Fires and it was my most

402
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,410
vulnerable song I've ever written.

403
00:26:54,990 --> 00:27:00,910
Um, and it speaks about, I guess, the advocacy that I've been doing in the last two years.

404
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:08,049
And the metaphor of Little Fires is, I guess, like, you know, being little fires in every

405
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:12,549
way you can and that everyone is a little fire depends on what you do with that.

406
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:16,529
And together we can fan that, you know, little fire together.

407
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:22,390
And so it's, it's all about fighting that little fight every single day.

408
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:32,269
It was a huge moment for me on TV, um, on Saturday because, um, it was my moment to

409
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:33,509
claim my voice back.

410
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:40,650
And I didn't know I was breaking down backstage, uh, just before I was about to perform.

411
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:46,490
I was all this emotion that was built up within me because I've just been pushing it down and

412
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:49,170
fighting every day and putting on a strong face.

413
00:27:49,349 --> 00:27:55,609
The inner child, I guess, in me was, um, coming up in that moment, needing nurturing.

414
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:00,509
And, um, oh, it was an incredible moment on stage.

415
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:08,109
And the most touching part about doing that, because I didn't know if I should have done it,

416
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,369
was the response I got.

417
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:14,710
And I'm not doing it for response, but I realized that, um,

418
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,470
there's something.

419
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:22,349
There's something incredible when we can connect together and let each other know that

420
00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:23,089
we're not alone.

421
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:28,549
Um, and we don't have to fight alone and people reaching out to me on Twitter or on social

422
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:34,809
media, sharing their stories with me, their stories of survive, like surviving and, you

423
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:40,650
know, uh, abuse and, and whatnot coming to me and sharing their vulnerability with me

424
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:44,849
and me sharing their vulnerability, my vulnerability with them.

425
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,269
It's allowed us to.

426
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,470
Become stronger and to find healing.

427
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,730
And it's incredible.

428
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:56,430
And I just was so emotional, emotional at the response I was receiving after that performance.

429
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:01,170
Um, but I also get so much from that.

430
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:06,670
And, and I think, I think that's, what's super important and is probably what, why you're

431
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:12,569
doing this podcast as well is for people to connect because without connection, you know,

432
00:29:12,569 --> 00:29:16,430
society is nothing, you know, it's so important to maintain that connection.

433
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:23,109
And, and so many times, especially through the pandemic, we can so easily become more

434
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:29,150
detached and dissociated, but it's so important to have honest conversations and to connect

435
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,569
so that we can understand different perspectives.

436
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:38,650
I know I still have a lot to learn, um, from other people and the stories they've been

437
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:42,410
through all the discrimination or injustices that they've had to face.

438
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:46,470
And I think it's just important to just keep dialogues like this, like, you know, I'm not

439
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:50,349
going to do a podcast like this so that, um, we can all grow together.

440
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:51,230
Yeah.

441
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,690
Again, well said.

442
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:56,789
Your language is just so powerful and it resonates and you're right.

443
00:29:56,869 --> 00:30:00,289
The connection is in it when all is said and done, what are you left with?

444
00:30:00,329 --> 00:30:03,049
It's the impact you have and the connection you have on others.

445
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,450
And I love the diversity.

446
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:09,750
Someone with my, you know, white bread background and coming from the world of...

447
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,349
Did you say white bread?

448
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:12,910
I did say white bread because I'm looking at me on the screen.

449
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:16,390
I look even more white bread than, uh, than you could possibly...

450
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,230
You just made me hungry, to be honest.

451
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:23,329
You said you had a big night after Eurovision, so maybe we need to get you a bunning sausage

452
00:30:23,329 --> 00:30:23,809
or something.

453
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:24,509
Yeah, perfect.

454
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:26,809
To, uh, to, to make this go through.

455
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,369
But, but I think about that and I love the fact, you know, we couldn't come from more

456
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:33,650
different worlds, but, but I listened to your story and it inspires me.

457
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:39,730
I'm, you know, inspired by your courage and, and it resonates so powerfully in, in, in

458
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:43,910
so many different ways and, uh, more strength to you, more, more credit to the way that

459
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,369
you've been able to, to, to handle yourself in, in every way.

460
00:30:46,369 --> 00:30:47,049
Every single way.

461
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,410
I mean, are you feeling that coming back your way now?

462
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:53,450
I mean, I think of Grace Tame, well, I was about to transition to there, geez, the Australian

463
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,029
of the year.

464
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:57,670
And again, courage comes in all shapes and sizes.

465
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,849
And I, you know, again, full of admiration, could not come from a more different world.

466
00:31:02,349 --> 00:31:06,630
Really, how do I understand what's happened to that beautiful young girl?

467
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,329
And really, but you can have empathy and you can try and learn.

468
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,529
I suppose that's where I'm coming from in this.

469
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:15,890
But I also feel someone like you and someone like Grace Tame, every time you come and chat

470
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,009
to someone like Grace Tame, I feel like you're coming from a different world.

471
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:16,089
I feel like you're coming from a different world.

472
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:16,349
I feel like you're coming from a different world.

473
00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:19,349
You're reliving the hardship that you face.

474
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:21,589
Is that a challenge as well?

475
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,410
And is there a balance that needs to be struck with that?

476
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:24,529
Definitely.

477
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:31,230
I think at the beginning of my advocacy, I didn't have the boundaries I needed to have

478
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:38,589
to be able to sustain what I was doing by speaking out, especially in the beginning

479
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:43,630
when you don't have that support around you, or you don't even have the belief system around

480
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:43,890
you.

481
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,089
You are putting yourself out there.

482
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:55,269
You're putting yourself out on a limb, and it's so easy to break down from that or have

483
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:57,309
that be used against you.

484
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,750
I'm going to be straight up and say therapy.

485
00:32:02,069 --> 00:32:07,890
I definitely needed therapy before speaking out as well, but to help me go through that

486
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:08,470
process.

487
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:14,250
It is extremely taxing to do what Grace Tame does on a national level every single day.

488
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,650
She is incredible.

489
00:32:16,089 --> 00:32:22,190
And we cannot ever dismiss that or take that for granted.

490
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:28,910
What she's doing, including Brittany Higgins, it takes an insane amount of selflessness

491
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,009
and courage.

492
00:32:31,829 --> 00:32:41,269
And I just hope that people constantly remember or try to learn what it takes to do that and

493
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:44,690
to take that risk and to speak on behalf of so many people.

494
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:45,970
When honestly,

495
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:50,109
survivors don't have the responsibility to do that at all.

496
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:55,490
And the anger that comes from me is that you put yourself out there and then bizarrely

497
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,390
in my mind, there's people who try to undermine that.

498
00:32:58,589 --> 00:33:02,730
And even in recent times, Grace Tame's had to deal with old photos emerging of her with

499
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,150
effectively a bong on it.

500
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:09,130
It's like, seriously, is that as good as we can do?

501
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:14,250
I mean, who would even understand, as she beautifully said afterwards, without necessarily

502
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,069
going in full detail.

503
00:33:16,089 --> 00:33:19,849
That's where the anger steps up for people, perhaps like me, who haven't had to go through

504
00:33:19,849 --> 00:33:23,930
it to say that that's just above and beyond any sense of fairness.

505
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:30,349
Well, I guess it comes back to our culture in Australia as well, that I definitely felt

506
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:34,809
this pressure when you come up on the rise, you know, you're speaking out and you're actually

507
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:37,089
making impact and change.

508
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:43,210
There's this weird shift that happens where you're right on the top and you're feeling

509
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:46,069
so much pressure and people want to take you down.

510
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:51,750
That's where tall poppy syndrome comes in, you know, and that's what you're seeing.

511
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:56,369
Grace has been able to lead such a change and now people want to character assassinate

512
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:59,230
her because they want to take her down.

513
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,230
And what for?

514
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:04,509
And what, like, for what reason does that photo have anything to do with what she's

515
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,549
done outside of that?

516
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:07,549
You know what I mean?

517
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:14,070
And so I think there needs to be a cultural shift of why is there so much toxicity in

518
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,070
our society?

519
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,070
Yeah.

520
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:20,750
And so I think that's where we need to do that or, or to, you know, want to jump for

521
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:27,090
the quick, quick click baits, you know, the quick wins, wins, I say with like quotation

522
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:29,190
marks, because they're not real wins.

523
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:33,150
They're just these like short term, like, oh, we'll be able to get some attention here

524
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:38,190
and we'll be able to get a story here and we can start, you know, some gossip here.

525
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,869
It's just not worth it.

526
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:45,789
What she's doing is incredible and we should just respect that and elevate that and amplify

527
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:46,050
that.

528
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:53,670
Because yeah, it just, it's so important for our society to grow from that and to learn

529
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,670
from that.

530
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,730
And people like her are so rare.

531
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:06,019
We should be protecting her.

532
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:10,800
Part of that cultural shift, Jaguar, that we're hoping to influence in a, in a small

533
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,539
way is identifying the dimensions of what we think makes great leadership so that people

534
00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:15,539
can learn.

535
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:21,380
Sometimes people just don't understand their impact, who are well-meaning and we're identifying

536
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,420
these characteristics.

537
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,559
We're identifying these characteristics that make this modern leadership and the success

538
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:27,659
that it's having and more empathy.

539
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:31,679
And as I said before, more self-awareness, more self-reflection, more collaboration,

540
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,679
all those things.

541
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:36,019
And so I'm really looking forward to your answers because I've been asking a range of

542
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:39,539
different, with your creative mind, I think this will be fascinating.

543
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:40,539
And that's what we want.

544
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:44,320
We want to see people from the arts and from industry and from sport cross over because

545
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,519
there is a lot of shared learning, I think, when you put people together from different

546
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:49,519
environments.

547
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,139
So please expand Jaguar as much as you like.

548
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:57,679
And as I ask these questions, but we see self-leadership in leaders as something that they think of

549
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,760
and where it all starts.

550
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,579
When you think of your own self-leadership, Jaguar, what comes to mind?

551
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:11,900
I think what makes a, I mean, I never thought I was like a leader, but I think what makes

552
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,659
a great leader is someone who listens.

553
00:36:16,659 --> 00:36:21,139
Often we have this, you know, picture painted of a leadership who just takes control and

554
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:22,139
is in front of the pack.

555
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:27,059
But to me, leadership is you're amongst the pack and you're listening to the stories around

556
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,880
you so that you grow your awareness.

557
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:37,619
You come into your empathy and you make decisions based on what is best for the collective.

558
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:39,460
What an answer.

559
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:43,940
It's funny, Jay, the amount of leaders that I've spoken to who say exactly what you said

560
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,940
first.

561
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,940
I never saw myself as a leader.

562
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:50,900
And I think that humility is part of what is the trademark of great leaders that we're

563
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,940
seeing going forward.

564
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,639
And that is certainly in you and all your answers as well.

565
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:59,760
The thought of leaders positively impacting others in their environment and consciously

566
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,179
thinking about how they go about that, how do you think about positively impacting others?

567
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:09,679
Honestly, I just want everyone to lead their

568
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:12,659
best life.

569
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:17,019
And I see so many elements stopping people from doing that.

570
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:21,179
I also was in that same position, you know.

571
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:27,260
And being able to break out of that and grow from that and give myself that freedom and

572
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,940
heal so much in my mental health.

573
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:35,679
All I want to do is give that back to someone else who didn't have the resource or the support

574
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:42,900
or the environment to build that healthy structure for themselves.

575
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:49,880
I feel so blessed that I've been able to move from an unfortunate and disheartening environment,

576
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
you know.

577
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,639
disadvantaged background to where I am now and I'm still fighting for a sustainable career

578
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:04,059
but that change has been incredible and the only way we can do that is by giving back to the

579
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:09,780
community and I'm just trying to do it in my own way and I found that through art and music and

580
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:16,039
contributing to you know culture and the arts and and to create conversations through that so

581
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:23,179
I don't have a big grand plan I just want to do my bit every single day in the way that I can

582
00:38:23,179 --> 00:38:29,639
to hopefully just connect with one other person who's been through a similar situation like me

583
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:36,380
and you sure are making an incredible impact on on every level creating and sharing your vision

584
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:44,039
and yours is such a brilliant unique vision if you check out Jaguar Jones's website go and look

585
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:45,880
is it the Jones Society?

586
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:48,340
you can be a member of do I get that right?

587
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:53,400
yeah yes I have a Patreon I only started this Patreon at the start of the pandemic

588
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:01,139
yeah and so yeah you can be the fans have now called it a cub so if you're a fan of Jaguar

589
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:05,400
Jones and the Jones Society which is everything I do you're a cub

590
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:11,440
I love it it's a it's a great representation of everything you are and I and I read

591
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,300
words attributed to you saying you know taking on multi-disciplines

592
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,019
you know taking on multi-disciplines and you know taking on multi-disciplines

593
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:21,980
could be argued to be insanity in the artistic world but it's a necessity for you and it is a

594
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:27,300
unique vision how have you gone I read about how you've created and shared that vision but

595
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,599
have you thought about it?

596
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:38,900
so it started with music which is a dialogue with myself and my subconscious where I was able to

597
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:44,139
understand what was going on or I was able to process things that were happening to me

598
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:45,360
that I had just denied from I was able to process things that were happening to me

599
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:52,059
denied for so long and repressed for so long because it was too scary to confront so music was

600
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:58,840
I guess it's this like selfish conversation with myself which has allowed me to be more free and

601
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:05,559
more open with myself but then art became conversation with others so I have this visual

602
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:11,380
art project and I interview each person before I draw them and then I draw their story just I guess

603
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:17,639
visually interpret the things that they shared with me and what that has allowed is for me to

604
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:23,500
take my honest truths and conversations from my music and share them with others and for others

605
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:30,099
to share that with me and I realized that when when you have those conversations and you share

606
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:37,619
you grow and you heal so much and so quickly that it's important to me to be the person that I am

607
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:41,119
by continually continually having these conversations

608
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:48,420
so that was that for me and then my photography is all about my relationship with my body

609
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:55,320
and it's very obvious when you look up my photography it's under each one has a name

610
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:03,820
music is jaguar jones art is spectator jones and photography is dusky jones and the photography

611
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:09,579
project is I guess claiming my body back because for so long I felt like it wasn't mine

612
00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:11,099
one

613
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:17,460
you've been through I guess the amount of abuse and terror that I've been through

614
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:25,539
you become so disconnected and dissociated from your body and it was all about loving my body

615
00:41:25,539 --> 00:41:32,039
and the skin that I'm in and exploring that and maintaining the relationship with that and

616
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:39,420
the photography project is extremely beautiful people come to me to do similar things or to

617
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,099
explore their sexuality or to explore their sexuality and to explore their sexuality and

618
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:46,340
to explore the fine lines between femininity and masculinity and embracing both

619
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:55,739
and it's just this incredible journey of refining and redefining our relationship with our bodies so

620
00:41:55,739 --> 00:42:03,300
I really love each of my projects and they give so much to me and has made me who I am now

621
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:08,340
if you had this conversation with me you wouldn't because I wasn't in the same place

622
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,079
but if we talked a

623
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:17,780
couple years back I was a whole different person these projects has been a life-changing journey

624
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:24,719
for me and which is why it's not just a passion and a pursuit it's a necessity for me you can join

625
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:30,360
the jones society and support the you know creative journey that is jaguar jones and you

626
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,940
just heard I won't try and do it justice as the journalist before said I'll end up in tears trying

627
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:40,739
to do that in an elevator pitch format but it is fascinating I really encourage anyone

628
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:46,059
who's listening to this go and check it out online it's a fascinating unique vision that

629
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:49,719
that you've got and as you said it's a necessity for your own well-being it's great you can hear

630
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:54,900
the the uh the sense of self you've got now um without having spoken to you before it comes out

631
00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:01,760
in in all of all of your words um jaguar we see curiosity leaders who are in this community of

632
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,739
of 21st century leadership are really curious and they approach their own sense of learning

633
00:43:06,739 --> 00:43:10,239
and development through curiosity does that resonate with you definitely

634
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:17,380
the other side to all this um like creation and expression is because I never had the childhood

635
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:24,699
I deserved I am living my best childhood now and so I totally understand curiosity the other side

636
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:31,679
to my art and my music is I want to experience and I want to create experiences that we've never

637
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:37,780
seen before and never had around so I'm constantly wanting to push creative boundaries and see what

638
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:41,079
I can do and I think it's this beautiful uh

639
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:48,559
I don't know melting pot of innovation and technology and collaboration and conversation

640
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:54,099
and see where that can lead so curiosity is definitely something that I dabble in

641
00:43:54,099 --> 00:44:00,019
every single day yeah I can hear that come out in your voice um one of the other dimensions we see

642
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:04,900
with leaders across different industries is how they think about communicating with clarity and

643
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:10,460
and we've just heard a lot of your unique uh you know communication through song and through um

644
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:17,019
visual and also through through taking uh photos and portraits what what are your thoughts when

645
00:44:17,019 --> 00:44:23,199
you think about communicating communication is key that sounds like such a like you know

646
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:30,260
coin like I don't know some kind of tagline but communication is so important to me I have

647
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:37,920
amazing communication with my within my working relationships as well um and I try to you know

648
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,079
break down shame um and always encourage people to be able to communicate with me and I try to

649
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:47,539
encourage honesty and transparency even if it's uncomfortable I think it's all about putting

650
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:54,260
your ego aside having an ego so that you love yourself but also putting an ego aside so that

651
00:44:54,260 --> 00:45:02,539
it's not hindering you from the truth and from growing with other people communication is key

652
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:11,079
to be able to do more with your skill set and with people around you um and to make the most of it

653
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:16,960
out of your life so I I think it's all about continually um improving those communication

654
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,780
skills I loved how you described then it was really uh you know you you sort of paused and

655
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,960
went actually having an ego because that's actually you know you don't get on stage and

656
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,559
be jaguar jones I reckon without as a strong sense of self and probably for all of us if we deny that

657
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:38,099
you lose part of you you know the world I was in full of ego still is but you know your definition

658
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:41,079
is saying having that in in control and in its rightful place so I think that's a really good

659
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:47,739
space is did I read that the right way oh totally I had to learn to build an ego um because I was

660
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:55,400
you know raised a certain way as a child to be you know subservient and just continually serve

661
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,280
and to be powerless so I had to grow an ego to be able to get to the place that I am today

662
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:07,800
I see it as this little monster um but you need that monster and it's all about being aware of

663
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,159
that monster and sometimes putting it in your pocket

664
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:17,940
on your shoulder or sometimes being like sit down little monster uh sit down you know pipe it

665
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:25,500
so I think it's all about having that healthy relationship with your ego well I can see you're

666
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,940
about to swear then I was uh it was nearly coming out of you which which would have been very

667
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,519
appropriate uh you've mentioned collaboration that's the final dimension we talk about a lot

668
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:39,059
great leaders now want to collaborate they want to learn from other people how important is is

669
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:40,139
collaboration and how important is collaboration and how important is collaboration and how important

670
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:48,659
is it for you collaboration is everything um for me jaguar jones jones society anything I do

671
00:46:48,659 --> 00:46:56,900
does not exist without collaborating with other people what I've had to do is take time to find

672
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:04,179
the people who want to collaborate with me and who believe in me and it's this constant

673
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:09,460
give and take I'm supporting their dreams and they are supporting my dreams

674
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:16,840
and we have this beautiful relationship of um pushing things further because we're both

675
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:23,719
giving and taking constantly nothing like none of what I do would exist without collaboration

676
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:32,559
music and and art as well but music takes so much collaboration on every single level from

677
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:39,159
writing to recording to you know the marketing side of things to touring playing on stage like

678
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:40,139
it doesn't exist it's just it's just it's just it's just it's just it's just it's just it's just

679
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:46,679
without collaboration so even though it sounds like it's a soul project and jaguar jones is me

680
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:53,880
it's actually a group project of many talented people and it's all about leaning in as well

681
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:00,960
I I can't be everything and I definitely am not talented in every aspect but if you don't

682
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,780
collaborate and if you don't lean in to other people's talents you're limiting yourself by

683
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:10,139
leaning into other people's talents I get to learn and grow every single day and I'm not going to

684
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:16,900
and I think you know society is built and should be built on collaboration yeah brilliant the way

685
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:22,079
that you naturally went to the give and take of of collaboration I think people often see

686
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,820
collaboration is what they're going to get out of and seek out collaboration on that basis but

687
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:30,880
you're right and the ultimate satisfaction isn't it when you contribute as much in that

688
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,460
collaboration I did mention before we started recording in research I I love the collaboration

689
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:40,139
you did on triple j's like a version um nirvana's heart-shaped box and I think it's a really good

690
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:44,539
with an artist called hermitude if I got that right you did check check that out because that

691
00:48:44,539 --> 00:48:51,300
is very very cool um when did you record that one that was two years ago now and I got this

692
00:48:51,300 --> 00:49:00,400
email in my inbox hermitude is a very established artist and two years ago I was far from where I am

693
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:08,059
now um and I got this email and I thought it was spam when they asked me if I would consider doing

694
00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:09,659
the like a version with them

695
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:16,380
and this is where I'm a little bit embarrassed but because I was born in Japan and you know I

696
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:25,500
grew up with my Taiwanese single mother nirvana to me was like a h&m t-shirt you know I don't quite

697
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:31,880
know nirvana's discography and this is why I'm saying I'm living my best childhood now is because

698
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:38,780
I'm discovering all this great music anyway I had to learn heart-shaped box and the lyrics

699
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,139
in three days and I'm like oh my god I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do this

700
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:46,619
and I was so stressed but when I looked up nirvana's lyrics and started learning this song

701
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:54,039
I realized oh this is gonna be so fucking easy because their lyrics are full-on and it just like

702
00:49:54,039 --> 00:50:01,820
drills into your brain straight away you know there's some real graphic vulgar language being

703
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:07,019
used in nirvana but anyway that's that's my little funny story that I'll probably cop some hate for

704
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:10,039
not at all I think if you want an intro to go

705
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:15,059
listen to and it's a great three days to understand you know your your performance

706
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:21,739
I said I'm the least musical person I know people laugh at me actually even opening up

707
00:50:21,739 --> 00:50:24,579
that's why I was making sure I got the pronunciation right but you can't help but

708
00:50:24,579 --> 00:50:30,000
be moved by by that it is brilliant as I said I encourage you to check out all of

709
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,139
Jaguar Jones but I love that one in particular there's two questions I've been asking the

710
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:39,059
range of different leaders and to finish on I'd like to ask you both of them as well who's been

711
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:40,139
the greatest leader in your life?

712
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:52,099
um the greatest leader in my life I would say is my therapist um she gave me the nurturing

713
00:50:52,099 --> 00:51:00,000
that I needed to come into the person that I am um I have I'm not really close to her

714
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:09,739
either because she's an incredible leader in her own space um and and so I've learned so much from

715
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:17,699
her and she's given me so much um and she's allowed me to take the reins on my own life

716
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:24,780
and to make incredible change um so she was the first person that popped up in my head and she's

717
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:29,739
just your everyday person you know she's not someone that's in the media she's not someone

718
00:51:29,739 --> 00:51:38,800
that's um in the limelight of things she's on an island like bribey island I drive an hour and a

719
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,840
half to see her she's on an island like bribey island I drive an hour and a half to see her

720
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:46,760
because she's worth it um and she's making impact in her own way in her own circle and so

721
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:52,840
yeah I owe her so much. What a brilliant answer my mind was going as you were saying that Jaguar to

722
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:57,760
interviewed a young AFL captain called Marcus Bondenpelli he's 25 years of age and he's an

723
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:03,260
incredible young leader and and he referenced the sports psychologist in his world that just

724
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:08,780
it's such a happier place you know when I came through a very different generation to you

725
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,139
you would you wouldn't be able to do that without him.

726
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:14,059
You wouldn't have been open enough to even suggest that you'd seen that there might have been a

727
00:52:14,059 --> 00:52:17,900
psychologist around but you would have thought oh no people are going to think I'm I'm falling

728
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:23,400
apart as opposed to this is making my life better and I and I need to talk about it openly so I love

729
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,579
I'm not surprised hearing it from you but from your generation it's it's such a powerful

730
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:34,619
stance that's so open now um if you could collaborate with anyone in the world in any

731
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:39,920
area of your life I'm assuming we might head to the music part but uh who would you collaborate

732
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,139
with?

733
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:49,300
Oh I I actually would love to collaborate with Guy Ritchie

734
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:56,679
that could happen the film director Guy Ritchie the film director really I'm gonna put that out

735
00:52:56,679 --> 00:53:05,300
there in the universe and manifest um yes uh because you know I I love music and I love art

736
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:09,920
but this unknown world that I want to discover more of

737
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:18,579
is film and the language of film um you know and the world building of film I'm obsessed I I at the

738
00:53:18,579 --> 00:53:23,940
moment I'm directing and producing and editing my own music videos but that took some time for me to

739
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:30,219
really you know step into that and own that and now I'm realizing oh there's another medium and

740
00:53:30,219 --> 00:53:36,079
you know this is coming back to me as a child you know living my childhood right now the amazing

741
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,199
thing I feel like adults forget is um

742
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:47,639
that like willingness to try things without shame and going for it that's the world I'm in right now

743
00:53:47,639 --> 00:53:53,440
where I used to just be like oh no no no I'm not made for that I can't do that or I might wake up

744
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:59,300
tomorrow and feel that way about music too but right now I just want to learn more discover more

745
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:05,000
and so film film is where I want to just kind of tap into and I don't need to be in front of the

746
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,760
camera either but I would love to just dive deeper into it Guy Ritchie hello if you're listening at

747
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,000
all

748
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:15,320
I'm sure he's listening uh no doubt at all Jaguar and and two of my all-time favorite films Lockstock

749
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:21,079
and Two Smoking Barrels and his latest one I I love uh Guy Ritchie that would be a great

750
00:54:21,079 --> 00:54:25,159
collaboration I I wasn't that you know I'm not I would have had any idea where you're going to go

751
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:32,199
but I know I know but the quirkiness the humor but then the depth you know I love I love that

752
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:38,179
that takes some brilliance and I think as a final note uh Jaguar Jones if we all had the courage

753
00:54:38,179 --> 00:54:40,139
of our convictions to stand up for what we've done we would have done it we would have done it

754
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:45,719
we would believe in the way that you have against all odds uh and an enormous amount of risk to your

755
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:51,380
own career it's an amazing story of leadership where we started uh I've been inspired by
