00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:10,890
Brilliant to have three-time Olympic gold medalist James Tompkins as this week's guest on the podcast leading into the Paris Olympic Games.

2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:20,230
You'll hear James talk about the ancient Olympic oath from a few thousand years ago and understanding life balance, academics for the brain, art for the soul.

3
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:26,870
All were about making the perfect athlete and how that wisdom still stands true today, many years later.

4
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:34,670
The incredible story of how he nearly stopped rowing an Olympic final through exhaustion despite being in front and on his way to Olympic gold

5
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:40,950
and how that gives him empathy for Sally Robbins who famously laid down in the boat in an Olympic final herself.

6
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:49,490
Fascinated by James' ability to break things down into small increments and keep refining and practising and refining until he masters them

7
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:56,409
and that's enabled him to be a near-scratch golfer, elite race car driver and virtually anything he turns his mind to.

8
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:59,869
It's people like James Tompkins who inspire the work we do at Alita.

14
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:16,609
Big thanks as always to the team at Temper Bedding, a mattress like no other.

15
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:19,989
We appreciate the NASA-approved bedding.

16
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,530
Good night's sleep is something that is common to great people who have great success.

17
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,269
So investing in a Temper mattress is something you won't regret.

18
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:38,180
James Tompkins OAN is a Sport Australia Hall of Fame legend for his contribution in the world of rowing.

19
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,140
James is one of only four people in the world to have rowed at six Olympic Games.

20
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:46,340
James competed at every Olympic Games from 1988 to 2008

21
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:52,719
and was fittingly Australia's flag bearer at the final Olympic Games he competed at in Beijing in 2008.

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,120
A seven-time World Championship gold medalist, a three-time Olympic gold medalist,

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,560
but perhaps known best as part of the awesome foursome that won world titles

24
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,599
in 90, 91, 98, and Olympic gold in 92 and 96.

25
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:11,199
James, it's always great to see, and it's an incredible lifetime of sporting achievement.

26
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,340
When you hear that back, read back to you, what are your initial thoughts?

27
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,819
Well, thanks, Luke, for the invitation to come on.

28
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,860
And yeah, it's quite, it's interesting.

29
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:27,300
I was actually just listening to that going, wow, that's quite a CV as far as the rowing is concerned.

30
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:30,860
Because, you know, life's busy and there's a whole bunch of things on

31
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,340
and you don't actually...

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,180
Well, rarely do I actually reflect on it.

33
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,860
But when you hear someone like you that's, you know, another sports person sort of read that through

34
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,360
and, yeah, well, it's a good career.

35
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,379
Better than good, I think.

36
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,840
Let's not be too humble about it.

37
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,719
I was going back through history and you're a Kerry Grammar boy

38
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:55,199
and you stroke the crew there at school in 83 and 84, or maybe 82 and 83.

39
00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:00,699
And I think two years later, you're in an Australian eight at World Championships in Belgium.

40
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:01,520
A year later, you win.

41
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,699
Your first World Championship goal.

42
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,759
That is a pretty serious trajectory to success.

43
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,020
I mean, clearly, you're an outstanding rower as a young man.

44
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,400
What set you apart, James?

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
What were the traits that served you well?

46
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,340
There's a couple of things there.

47
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,099
One, your physiology.

48
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:19,139
Yeah, you need, I mean, you would have been a great rower.

49
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,139
Tall, good physiology, good engine, good athleticism.

50
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,759
So that's part of it.

51
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,360
And then, so...

52
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,319
That's the physical side.

53
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,060
Then the mental side.

54
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,860
Like, I was always trying to perfect things.

55
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:41,259
Well, trying to do things really well, you know, drives me crazy now.

56
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,520
I've just come off the golf course, played terribly.

57
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:45,639
I'll tell you, I'll be on the range tonight trying to fix it.

58
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,219
Your playoff is about scratch, by the way, which I want to talk about at some stage.

59
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:52,680
So there's a physical aspect.

60
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,560
And then the mental thing is just trying to strive, keep striving, trying to do well.

61
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,219
But I also...

62
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,500
At school,

63
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,080
our coach was Noel Donaldson,

64
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:06,740
who was actually, ended up being our coach in the Awesome Foursome.

65
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,400
So, you know, while I was at school, I had fantastic, a fantastic coach.

66
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,840
And, yeah, and I remember one day at school,

67
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:17,560
it was in my final year in 83,

68
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,279
and, you know, one of my mates came up and said,

69
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:24,500
oh, Dono reckons if you're not running for Australia in five years, there's something wrong.

70
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,139
And it was like the first time I'd sort of realized,

71
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:27,879
I knew I was half decent,

72
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,439
but that was the first time of thinking, oh, wow, you know,

73
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,139
maybe I can, you know, keep going.

74
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,360
And then you go down to Mercantile, down to the club system,

75
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,420
and then, you know, quickly progress through State Cruise.

76
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:44,759
And then, yeah, into that, um, that 85-8 wasn't so flash,

77
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,360
but then, then 86 is the one where we won.

78
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,079
And Koops was in that, Mike McKay was in that.

79
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,560
So three, so there you got myself, Mike, and Koops, three of the four.

80
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:55,980
Yeah.

81
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,480
And, you know, one of the Doyle brothers and yeah, it was a really good eight.

82
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,620
Clearly it was a really good eight.

83
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,259
Um.

84
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,779
So straight away, you're sort of with a core group of people that have,

85
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,240
that are also very good.

86
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,759
That you end up having this incredible success.

87
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,699
When you mentioned the physiology and you, you know, you're 6'6",

88
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,100
or thereabouts and naturally aerobic as a, as a, as an athlete,

89
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,360
but there's a technical side to the sport of rowing.

90
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,319
And I, I'm not going to pretend to know a lot about, but,

91
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,819
but that is something that you excelled at as well.

92
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:26,959
Was that again, come naturally to you or is that perfectionism of just,

93
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,560
I'm going to be able to put the blade in the water better?

94
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,300
I think, um, it's interesting, like rowing used to be,

95
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,180
before our time of that early or late eighties, I guess.

96
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah.

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,980
Through the eighties and nineties.

98
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,839
They used to get the biggest, buffiest guys and girls who couldn't play any

99
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:47,839
other sport and stick them in a boat and just pull that, but then it sort of

100
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,699
progressed and they got, you know, a lot of the footy players, uh, and, and

101
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:59,379
netballers and basketballers that had the sort of fine motor skills, because

102
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:00,980
it's, it's actually an, it's.

103
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,259
Yeah.

104
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:01,279
Yeah.

105
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:08,199
incredibly physical sport demanding on the physiology but it's also incredibly technical

106
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:14,100
like the water is such a heavy so much resistance that if you make an error the boat slows down a

107
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:22,879
lot and it takes so much energy to get that speed up again um so the skill is to keep that boat

108
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,959
speed not upset it and it's you know you've got an oar that's 13 feet out the side of the boat

109
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:32,540
and so any you know a one millimeter movement of your hands here is like six or seven mils out on

110
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,379
the end of the blade and so all that sort of stuff and then the combination with other people

111
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:43,160
so yeah it's incredibly physical as far as physiology is concerned yeah the last stroke

112
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,360
of the race should be the last one you can possibly take so you have to exhaust yourself

113
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,120
and then whilst you're smashed you've got to keep your skills up so it's it's it's a tough sport

114
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,939
it's a really tough sport and almost the ultimate team sport uh which my daughter

115
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:02,920
i just see that you rely on each other so much don't you one person puts a blade wrong once

116
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,920
over the course of that you almost guarantee the race is over for you and so to have that synergy

117
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,600
and and oh well you'll move on to the to the awesome foursome part and you know the historically

118
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:20,819
olympic athletes even gold medalists have struggled to to get sponsorship and and and you guys you

119
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:25,959
captured the sort of hearts of the nation uh nick green and yourself and mike mckay andrew

120
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:26,939
mentioned and

121
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:33,100
came into the to the boat um you can't talk to you with that all of us know that jingle in our

122
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,839
head the golden valley fruit it was just so iconic um for those that have it i'm going to play it

123
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,579
back to you now have a listen to this

124
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:41,800
golden valley

125
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,300
luscious fruits now exotic

126
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:54,759
golden valley gold the taste will drive you wild just taste those

127
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,029
peaches and apricots and

128
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:58,670
oranges

129
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:13,350
tell us about that time for for you guys to just have such a place in australian sporting culture

130
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:17,930
what did that mean to you well it was fantastic it was great i mean yeah you're right we were

131
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,410
lily white amateurs never made a cent out of it like we're paying to go and represent the country

132
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:28,430
essentially and no one knew about rowing unless you went to a school that rode but there's a there

133
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,009
were a couple of things one we actually didn't know about rowing but there was a couple of things

134
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:29,850
one we actually didn't know about rowing but there was a couple of things one we actually didn't know

135
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:37,669
win that many events back then so we're coming off 72 or 76 montreal 76 montreal where we got

136
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:43,389
like three bronze medals at the game so then the ais was built and then we started to ratchet up as

137
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:47,929
far as performance so i think we only won five events in barcelona so limited number of gold

138
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:55,769
medals our race was six or in australian time 6 20 sunday night and so they broke into the news

139
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,889
and peter landy did a fantastic call

140
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,289
so you know pretty much everyone in australia was watching channel 7 news and saw the race

141
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:09,669
because they broke into the life's about timing isn't it i remember it but i don't remember that

142
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:14,789
detail and so that that's prime time everyone watched the sunday night yeah exactly you

143
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:19,509
couldn't get bigger prime was that just pure luck given the overseas times yeah yeah it was 10 20

144
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:25,429
credible sunday morning over in barcelona and we'd you know we'd won the preceding two world

145
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:28,809
championships so we're expected to win so there was you know people sort of knew that we were a

146
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:35,610
and so yeah we got the job done which uh was very stressful and then i think just our

147
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:41,590
our you know this sounds sort of egotistic but our sort of knockabout personalities came out we were

148
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:47,149
all good guys and like to train hard and race hard and you know and celebrate hard as well so i think

149
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:53,889
that sort of fits in with that you know that old australian ethos of sports people of you know

150
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:59,450
trying hard and then celebrating well and um and then dressed in lycra of course you know that

151
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:05,529
australia if you look back and watch that it's a joyful time actually in australian sport in lots

152
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:09,730
of ways you guys thriving and everything like cricket and rugby and you name it and then you

153
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,929
guys pop up and it's got it's fruit you know you're selling tin fruit you're not and you're

154
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:18,110
singing along and it just makes you smile when you go back and look at it and the fact that we

155
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,570
still remember that time so fondly is incredible my mind went immediately you know you win the

156
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:28,049
world championships you've trained so hard you get to barcelona you got six minutes really

157
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,330
training to sit on that starting block that must have before in the boat that must have

158
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:38,710
how do you deal with that sort of performance pressure at the time can you remember it oh yeah

159
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:44,470
100 i can remember it i was a basket case seriously yeah i was used to get so nervous

160
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:49,429
and wound up like almost to the point where i didn't want to race it that's i find that you

161
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:55,830
strike me as the most relaxed calm even person well that's on the outside but the nerves would

162
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,690
get you that oh that battle and you know as i said we'd won the preceding two world

163
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:05,990
championships so there's no upside like if we win that's what we're supposed to do if we lose

164
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,929
it's another four years like we're supposed to win everyone like our opposition expected us to win

165
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:16,129
anyone that knew about rowing expected us to win but as you know you've still got you've actually

166
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:21,070
got to go out there and do it and everyone's trying as hard as they possibly can and you know

167
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:26,850
the lead in the last months leading into that race you know you're going to make the final

168
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,690
and you know it's just this

169
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:35,870
build up because how many chances do you get yeah you know it's like um i dare i say it having just

170
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:43,129
watched the u.s open rory with a three-foot putt or a couple of three-foot putts and all of a sudden

171
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:47,129
what is normally very easy all of a sudden becomes very hard because you're thinking about

172
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:51,649
do i get this chance again when's the next chance i'm going to be sitting on the start line of

173
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:55,850
olympic final with some of the best mates and the best rowers in the world all in one crew

174
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,289
ready to roll when's that going to happen again

175
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:05,950
your teammates calm you down well we're all we're all pretty similar i remember we um yeah the night

176
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:11,129
before you're trying to get to sleep and so you turn the light back on and pick up a book and

177
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:17,009
yes honestly if you could read one sentence without thinking about the race like it's on

178
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:21,850
your mind the whole time and then you know wake up the next morning it's not this you beauty here

179
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:28,629
we go it's just this sense of dread that at 10 20 the executioner is going to drop the axe

180
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:37,190
and uh you know at 10 25 and a half someone's going to be olympic champion and you're supposed

181
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:43,149
to be it but you got and then we got on the water i do remember distinctly we got on the water and

182
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:49,169
we hadn't had a bad row for three and a half years and the warm-up was atrocious and mike had the

183
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:53,549
presence of mind to say listen let's just calm down and just stop and gather our thoughts a little

184
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:59,070
bit it didn't work the rain was still atrocious we're going oh my god we're gonna blow it at the

185
00:12:59,070 --> 00:12:59,549
last minute

186
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:05,110
yeah but as soon as the starter says go all of that just goes out of your mind and you're just

187
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:10,710
into automatic mode and all the hours and hours of preparation just switch in and as opposed to

188
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:16,269
the warm-up the race was phenomenal absolutely phenomenal i love burnout to share that because

189
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:21,529
you know most people like me i assume you know having spent some time you go you turn up you're

190
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:26,049
so calm you knew what you're going to do and away you went and you win gold because we experience

191
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:29,669
that in life in everything don't everyone has a bit of imposter syndrome everyone has

192
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,090
soft out even with all the hours and winning world championships it's it's a natural thing

193
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,610
but you can overcome it and have you have you seen that in other areas of your life as you've

194
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,049
got on that you've been able to in that extreme pressure has it served you well yeah oh yeah

195
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:46,629
absolutely yeah i mean you do it once you do it a couple of times and then okay well

196
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:51,350
and then you try and convince yourself you only get nervous when you've got a chance to win

197
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:57,730
and that it's just an indication of the body getting ready for a massive effort

198
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,850
and try and convince yourself that you've got a chance to win and that you've got a chance to win

199
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,549
to embrace that but it's like as soon as you understand that it's like okay well this is

200
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:10,309
normal and it's good that i'm nervous that means we've got a chance it's good that my body's getting

201
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:16,429
ready for one massive effort and then it's just a case of um yeah and then you try and

202
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:23,850
sidetrack your mind and you know we had this mantra process equals outcome just concentrate

203
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,929
on what we had to do when we had to do it and let the outcome take care of itself as said because

204
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:36,549
the outcome rory three foot putt the outcome as opposed to take the putter back hit the ball

205
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:42,850
square you know it's um process process process yeah goal kicking in afl football is not improved

206
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:48,210
because you get fixated on this is my moment yeah you start thinking differently if i miss this you

207
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:54,450
know the little man jumps on your shoulder and it happens to to everyone in sport again my mind was

208
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:59,850
going there james to i consider this a sporting tragedy what happened to sally robbins in in

209
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:06,450
2004 for those that don't remember to be an olympic final in the ultimate team sport hits exhaustion

210
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,350
and has to lay down in the boat and you can just see the devastation of her teammates their four

211
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:16,070
years of preparation and and can you sort of relate can you understand that and how did you

212
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:20,570
feel in the rowing community for her because your heart broke through it really yeah look it was

213
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:26,990
tough because drew and i had actually so that was athens 2004 yeah and drew and i'd actually we'd

214
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:39,330
with wives and parents watching those finals and it happens yeah maybe not people stopping but

215
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:44,970
actually in our in our semi-final uh or the semi-final for the pair the canadians the one of

216
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:50,129
the one of the guys in the canadian pair was absolutely smashed and he didn't lie down but

217
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:55,909
he essentially stopped like he wasn't putting any effort in the the boat came out of the lane

218
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:59,850
hit another boat automatic disqualification so it does happen and

219
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:05,070
sally she was physically one of the best girls technically one of the best girls in the crew

220
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:11,250
but there was just something that she couldn't manage her effort all the way down the track

221
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:16,149
like it's a six as you said it's a six minute race so you can't go flat out for six minutes

222
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:21,649
so you're sort of 97 98 but you have to manage that yeah and for whatever reason she couldn't

223
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:29,690
do it you know there was a so the girls were then and the guys were the next race and the guys had

224
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:29,850
a

225
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,590
really good the girls not so much of a chance of getting a medal but the guys had a really good

226
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:38,450
chance of you know they ended up getting a silver medal i think from memory silver or bronze but

227
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:43,389
definitely had a really good chance so everyone sort of got that's a shame with the girls switched

228
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:48,730
on to the guys and the girls were left to their own devices and came into the pontoon and then

229
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:55,769
the media scrum just got a hold of it and it's brutal the poor girl yeah it's brutal and as

230
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:59,590
you're saying it's a it's a percentage here a percentage there and everyone's

231
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:05,690
as a kid run a 400 and literally hit the wall with you the i used to say the grilla jumps on

232
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,390
your back and you cannot run no matter what your mind's trying to tell you to do so you're managing

233
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:16,250
even at the elite of the elite it's possible that an olympic final it's it's you have to just get

234
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:21,150
that right or it could go horribly wrong even for someone like you is that possible absolutely in

235
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:27,670
fact you've just reminded me so in our race so the day before we're in front in the olympic final

236
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:35,109
and in a pair in the pair and drew is calling the race plan and i got a bit angry with him because

237
00:17:35,109 --> 00:17:39,490
he kept on calling to push and we'd push a little bit and we could move away and i thought

238
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,130
we've got this like we can do this anytime and then he's going no no no let's keep going so i

239
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:49,809
thought right okay you're in trouble now i'm going for it and sort of really locked in like this is

240
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:55,130
um in olympic final this is yeah are you giving him feedback at the time or is it just you listen

241
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,789
to his call when you go listen to his call yeah and i thought okay you want to go we're going

242
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:05,269
and i sort of nailed we nailed it was fantastic rowing for about 500 meters in the middle of the

243
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:10,369
race you know pushed out ahead of everyone else and then i sort of like like fully in the zone

244
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:17,470
and then just snapped out of it with 600 meters to go and i was absolutely exhausted i thought i

245
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:24,009
was going to stop seriously like i was completely out and then drew realized and he just talked me

246
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:25,109
through it he goes breathe relax

247
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,670
breathe and all that training of the skills came into it and was able to get through another 300

248
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:35,130
meters which takes you to 300 to go and then you sort of know you can hang on so he picked he

249
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,950
picked it did he yeah yeah and i i was we're leading the olympic final and i thought i was

250
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,869
going to stop i thought i wasn't going to be able to finish the race because it's such as he said

251
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:49,230
it's such a fine line and that's the beauty of sport yeah you're right on that knife's edge and

252
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:54,789
it can go one of that one of two ways that puts it into into some serious context yeah post your

253
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:55,109
you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're

254
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:59,809
athletic uh career which was extraordinary you've been international olympic delegate which

255
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:04,049
is incredibly prestigious role and i know you're a great historian in olympics and the modern

256
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:08,809
olympics started in 1896 but if you look at history the ancient greeks were doing this for

257
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:15,710
1300 plus years prior to that and do you look now we're heading into the paris olympics in 2024 and

258
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:20,329
we've got wars going on in ukraine and horrific stuff happening in the middle do you still feel

259
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:25,029
that the olympics in bringing the world together has a special role to play yes yeah i do

260
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:31,809
i do on a couple of fronts one yeah the the olympic village is the example to the rest of

261
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:38,109
the world of what is possible you've got every race color creed religion in there and because

262
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:44,609
of something and in this case it's sport just bringing everyone together and it doesn't matter

263
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:49,829
christian muslim black white you know whatever ukraine well maybe the ukraine russian thing

264
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:54,910
might be a bit of tension but um uh you know because of something it brings that whole world

265
00:19:55,109 --> 00:20:03,069
together and it's it's a fantastic example and i do think that there is a lot to learn from the

266
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:10,450
history of the games um if ever you get the chance luke the olympic charter is fantastic

267
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:19,230
and there's a notion of olympism and it's the joy of sport that everyone should be able to

268
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:24,930
participate in but it's also striving and

269
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:31,869
leading a balanced life of mind body and soul so academics for the mind athletics for the body

270
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:37,789
and arts for the soul and this all came out from the games in antiquity you know

271
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:45,789
what is it two and a half thousand years ago 776 bc was the first games and long-winded answer but

272
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:54,650
back then when you died the only way you would ascend to the gods was if you'd led a balanced

273
00:20:55,109 --> 00:21:02,809
life a little bit of those three components and you look at the way we live now and we're so

274
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:07,690
fixated on one aspect and it might be sport like i'm a footy player i'm around that's all i do and

275
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:12,150
i don't do you know i don't have any context or anything else in my life and so i think there's a

276
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:17,450
lot to learn in all of us trying to lead a balanced life and it's not a third a third a third

277
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:22,490
and it'll float around but i think it's really important to have other things in your life if

278
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,990
you're working learn a language

279
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:30,410
or an instrument or do an event where you actually need to train for it not like a 2k

280
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,869
fun run but something where you've actually got to put some time into it and i think having other

281
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:40,250
things in your life and having having that balance is really really important so and that was a

282
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:45,650
couple thousand years ago the greek philosophers were onto this i find that i you know i have

283
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:50,569
heard the olympic charter but not quite described the way that you did and and look i find that

284
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:55,069
isn't that amazing that that thousands of years ago understood balance and yeah i look

285
00:21:55,109 --> 00:22:00,029
at you as a sort of perfect example of that but you won olympic gold but you worked all the way

286
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:05,410
through you did a commerce degree yeah you train family and yeah you train when you needed to train

287
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:09,190
but you always seem to live a balanced life and you do other stuff you'd see you out riding the

288
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:14,509
bike and doing so we've crossed over at junior sport a few times and as you said that has become

289
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:20,769
this arms race around at all other costs don't get me started well you get we're going to do

290
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:25,089
another two hours on this too and i and i just see kids stressed out kids

291
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:32,670
not getting balance in life because parents have decided sport is the path for family success now

292
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:37,349
and does it does it blow you away how crazy that's got yeah yeah yeah absolutely i mean the you know

293
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:45,029
you you play sport and the important word is play you know for kids it is playing yeah you don't do

294
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:50,730
sport to be really good you do sport to fuck around with your friends yeah kick a footy around

295
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:55,089
or row a boat or play basketball you do it to be with your friends and have

296
00:22:55,109 --> 00:23:00,930
fun doing it and if you end up being good great byproduct but that's not why you actually do it

297
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,769
it's just it's like the olympic village sport brings everyone together you know sport brings

298
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:09,509
people together and go and play footy with you know 20 other guys or girls and and have a great

299
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:17,130
time yeah it does my head in school sport like it's so serious now and it is like an arms race

300
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:22,690
in some of the sports whilst trying to do vce whilst going through puberty working out there

301
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,089
a lot in life and their friend group friendship groups

302
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:30,450
and and then you're training like an olympic athlete you know same sort of training volumes

303
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:35,049
whilst doing all of that other stuff it's it's there's all i reckon

304
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:43,250
without going over the top i reckon the schools have almost um you know they're negligent in

305
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:49,529
their duty of care to the kids in some instances where they are so stressed out when selection

306
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:55,089
trials are on yeah you know trying to make a crew or trying to make a footy team or a netball team

307
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:59,950
you know they're stressed because of it it's supposed it's supposed to be the panacea it's

308
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:04,970
not trying to create stress it's trying sports should be taking stress away and that that joy

309
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,910
of you know my favorite day of the week was sunday because you're going to go and play with

310
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:14,029
your mates and yeah you know there was never parents hanging over the sidelines and screaming

311
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:17,890
out or i think they were too busy doing other things they dropped you off when certainly my

312
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:23,289
instance i can't remember dad ever coming to and he played the game but it was like going to fun

313
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:24,609
you know like i'm not

314
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:30,990
counting your stats or oh no worried about well the trip home in the car well it's you know the

315
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:36,230
full debrief well there's a great study jame i i called the conversation in the car in america

316
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:41,490
though and i'll get this slightly wrong but they did the study a guy around 16 year old and the

317
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:46,049
drop off in sport in the u.s is catastrophic and the effect for particularly young girls at that

318
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:50,930
age who drop out of sport three quarters of them don't ever play team sport again and young males

319
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:54,910
are dropping out of sport at a high rate and he puts it down to what he calls a conversation the

320
00:24:55,109 --> 00:24:59,410
fact is that kids just love playing if you leave them to their devices yeah they like to win but

321
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:04,029
they don't really care you know like afterwards they'll get over it a second and oh yeah and you

322
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:08,750
know move on and grab a hot dog or whatever they they want post uh post game but they get in the

323
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:14,309
car and dad often mom sometimes just starts to analyze why don't you play more like james

324
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:19,650
tonkins why don't you go harder there yeah and the joy of sport evaporates immediately because

325
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:24,230
they feel this judgment and pressure from their parents and so the guy's exactly he just says all

326
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,089
you need to say to kids i'm going to play a game i'm going to play a game i'm going to play a game

327
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:29,730
i love watching you play nothing else i've heard i've heard nothing and i used to i used to be a

328
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:34,710
little bit you know maybe you should have rebounded more and then i i actually heard that and now it's

329
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:41,069
just hey i love watching you play sport and you just see the faces oh wow yeah and now you know

330
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:47,529
my eldest she's or they're all all the girls are playing basketball but um you know jess is she's

331
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:53,230
at a college over in the states she's home at the moment but she plays over there and and for her to

332
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,829
know that we're watching online

333
00:25:55,109 --> 00:25:58,690
she's going i love it that you guys are watching you know and so it's just that

334
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:04,250
if you're a parent just watch your kids play sport tell me that you love watching them play sport and

335
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:08,930
they'll just absolutely thrive from someone who's won three olympic golds it's uh it's the message

336
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:13,029
isn't it you just they don't want to hear anything else and and i love it now i did so i'm going to

337
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:16,109
come back to you because you're one of those annoying people james let's be honest with you

338
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:21,690
that you take up golf and you play it close to scratch you're driving the celebrity car race

339
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:25,089
and you blow everyone away twice twice because they don't because they don't know what they're

340
00:26:25,109 --> 00:26:29,450
they wouldn't allow you back a third time because you dominated so much you go and ride

341
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:36,529
canoe boats from one hawaiian island to another uh you you nearly played afl football with the

342
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:40,329
melbourne footy club but you went down the rowing path so what is it in you when you take something

343
00:26:40,329 --> 00:26:45,490
up you seem to get a hold of it and do it an elite level what's what's the skill to that

344
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:53,990
um well i well i love sport for starters i love playing sport and i i

345
00:26:55,109 --> 00:27:02,869
i know i just like doing it well i think i i think i find it easy to copy so golf or tennis like you

346
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:09,009
know you you can rogers forehand i don't know i just seem to be able to look at it yeah i so that's

347
00:27:09,009 --> 00:27:14,710
the way you do it like it always it does it does my head in on the golf course you see these people

348
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:21,730
got these weird funky swings have they ever seen a guy or a girl on the lpga or pga do that

349
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,769
like just copy what tiger does for goodness sake

350
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:32,369
be half decent if you do that i need some counseling mate on on on my golf uh whole

351
00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:37,809
performance because i i lose my mind but i don't play it but i expect to play well which is which

352
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:42,829
is probably half the problems no no my no on a serious note i remember my parents were saying

353
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:48,150
when and this is a long time ago when jimmy connors was playing tennis and you're sort of one of the

354
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:54,690
first ones to sort of really hit with top spin and mum we were living in country victoria and mum and

355
00:27:55,109 --> 00:28:02,109
saying that um i think they've said enough now that i seem to remember but um that i having

356
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:07,190
watched him play like i was i don't know five or six or something you know i got my tennis racket

357
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:12,549
and went out against the garage door and spent two hours until i could hit a top spin and just

358
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:16,970
sort of worked it out for myself so i think that was sort of an inkling of down the track okay if

359
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:21,769
i'm going to do this i want to do it well and what are the best people do and okay they're

360
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:24,910
probably doing something right and i'll try and and you can break it down in your mind

361
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:28,089
Oh, golf's a complex game that unravels a lot of people.

362
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:30,569
Yeah, well, I got unraveled this morning, let me tell you.

363
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:32,609
You told me that the first thing you said when you came in.

364
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,849
But you'll go out in the range then and work it out.

365
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,430
So you'll put the time in because you're not going to settle

366
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,569
for not being good at it.

367
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:40,349
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

368
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:42,430
And we used to do that in the boat.

369
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,490
So there's four of us in the boat and we'd have a team meeting

370
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,509
after each session and it would be, you know,

371
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:51,869
it would only be a five-minute meeting because I hate meetings.

372
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,069
Five-minute meeting.

373
00:28:53,069 --> 00:28:56,630
And everyone, so I would, we'd go around individually

374
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:59,349
what we're working on and where we are along that.

375
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:02,630
So James, here you're going, oh, my back turn's still not quite right,

376
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,690
but I'm trying to do this.

377
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,250
That's why it's probably a little uncomfortable for everyone else.

378
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:07,990
And everyone goes, oh, that makes sense, okay.

379
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,170
And then what are we working on as a team?

380
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,130
So the crew goals and crew improvement and then individual improvement

381
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:16,630
within that.

382
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:22,529
So everyone knows what I'm working on and understand

383
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:23,049
why it might.

384
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:26,130
It might not be quite 100%, but, you know,

385
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,670
they trust that I'm going to work through it.

386
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,589
And you do that with, and the other guys are doing the same.

387
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:34,269
And so it's just that mentality of just constant improvement

388
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:36,029
and constant evolution, I guess.

389
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,210
I love how pragmatic you are, James.

390
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:42,410
You retired on your 45th birthday and in a gruelling sport like that,

391
00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:47,069
you can see why I'm watching teenage girls burn out because of training

392
00:29:47,069 --> 00:29:48,230
at 16 or 17.

393
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:52,529
But you had that perfect build-up and Olympic cycle was four years.

394
00:29:53,069 --> 00:29:55,670
And you just seemed, you know, the Olympic ethos, wasn't it?

395
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,710
You'd take your time off.

396
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,950
Yeah, we'd take a year off after every Olympics.

397
00:29:59,089 --> 00:29:59,769
Full year off.

398
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:00,349
Full year.

399
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:01,930
Not jump in a boat.

400
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:03,549
Not jump in a boat.

401
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,690
Go and do, you know, we're staying active.

402
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:06,670
We're doing, playing footy.

403
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:08,250
Ride your bike.

404
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:10,730
Ride your bike, go surfing, you know, running and stuff.

405
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,150
But then you're fresh.

406
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:14,730
Fresh to go again.

407
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,450
You're keen to get back on the border and re-engage with it again.

408
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,829
And, you know, we talked to the swimmers and they were so scared of missing a

409
00:30:22,829 --> 00:30:23,049
session.

410
00:30:23,069 --> 00:30:24,869
Because they'd say, oh, we'd lose the feel of the water.

411
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,829
It's like, you're bloody world's best swimmer.

412
00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:29,190
You're not going to lose that skill overnight.

413
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:30,990
Like just take a break.

414
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:39,349
And, uh, but I think that, and that's being brave to back yourself and, um,

415
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:44,490
again, balance, you know, if I wouldn't have gone six Olympiads, if I'd gone all

416
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,450
the way through, no way.

417
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:46,109
Yeah.

418
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:52,170
So taking those breaks along the way and resetting and refreshing, ready to go

419
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:52,529
again.

420
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:53,049
It's great.

421
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,710
Lesson in, uh, longevity and, and life balance.

422
00:30:55,829 --> 00:30:57,470
And I love hearing about it.

423
00:30:57,569 --> 00:31:01,250
We have the term that someone said in this podcast to me, James, success leaves

424
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:01,670
clues.

425
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:05,309
And we've seen these different dimensions of leadership that show up in different

426
00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:05,690
people.

427
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,950
And I fascinated to hear your thoughts on this.

428
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:09,509
We hard to lead anyone else.

429
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:13,109
We feel without this idea of self-leadership and leading yourself.

430
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,829
What does self-leadership mean to you?

431
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:24,500
My motivation was purely individual in that I was challenging myself to get

432
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,160
better and then in the crew environment, you know, if everyone's doing similar,

433
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,740
then that's, that's a good result, but I think self-leadership, well, I've never

434
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:38,900
actually heard of the term before, but I'm guessing it's, uh, yeah, that I love

435
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,220
that, that Buddhist approach of constant improvement, constant evolution, like

436
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,839
every day, just get a little bit better.

437
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:45,920
That's something.

438
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:49,160
And I think that's, that's my self-leadership.

439
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,500
I think it's, yeah, that's a great answer.

440
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,460
And I, and I'm not surprised that.

441
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,359
That for you.

442
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:58,500
And is that, is that still this chapter of your life?

443
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,240
Is there still that constant never ending self-improvement?

444
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,259
Do you, yeah, I mean, obviously, uh, you know, and I think a good thing is once

445
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:08,079
you hit 40 or 45, you reset your PBS to zero.

446
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:14,279
So that's important because what you're doing at 25 on a bike, for example, is

447
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:19,519
not the same as 45 or 55, so just reset your PBS every year, back to zero.

448
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,339
Um, but yeah, just trying to, yeah, still just trying to.

449
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,559
This is that didn't play well this morning.

450
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,799
I'd love to get on the range of Sava or just not out there.

451
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,680
And that's the genius, isn't it?

452
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,920
But, uh, but then, yes, but then, uh, yeah.

453
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,259
And, but then I think broad or you'll probably get onto more broadly leadership,

454
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:47,559
but I think, yeah, you know, um, why did Kelly Slater surf for as long as he did

455
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:52,400
or Rafa and Roger and Novak, you know, it's not, it's not the money for those guys.

456
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,559
It's just.

457
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:55,240
Constant improvement.

458
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,059
I mean, know that he was, when he started, he was pretty ordinary.

459
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:02,980
Roger certainly didn't rate him, but then he worked and worked and worked and he

460
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,819
worked on his, on his demeanor around court and he stopped giving up during matches.

461
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:11,140
And now he's just, you know, he's a great example of evolution and he understood

462
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,440
his weaknesses and worked on them and he's still, he doesn't need the money.

463
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,700
Um, and he's just trying to be as good as he possibly can.

464
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:21,640
And if he does that, he keeps on racking up the majors.

465
00:33:21,819 --> 00:33:23,259
So it's the, the majors.

466
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:25,500
Prize money are a byproduct.

467
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,880
Of personal improvement.

468
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,980
Wanting to be the best you can.

469
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:35,180
No matter what, you forget that history, don't you know that literally would almost quit mid

470
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:41,079
tournament and had a horrible reputation and then became impenetrable didn't he with self

471
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:42,380
improvement and self leadership.

472
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,539
And then we see people really conscious in every environment they're in how they positively

473
00:33:46,539 --> 00:33:48,440
impact others in their environment.

474
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:52,619
You, as I said, the ultimate team sport, were you conscious of that.

475
00:33:52,619 --> 00:33:53,460
Have you been conscious of that?

476
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:53,480
In the last.

477
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:53,539
Year.

478
00:33:53,539 --> 00:34:00,460
life of your impact on others yes uh well not all the way through but um yeah i'm a pretty positive

479
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:09,199
person i think uh you know rowing is the ultimate team sport i mean in footy or netball you can have

480
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,860
people out on the wings that aren't having a great game and the team can still win but that

481
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:20,820
that can't happen in the boat um and we got to the point i guess you know over such a long career

482
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,260
you we were probably doing things or i was probably doing things that didn't realize what

483
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,039
we were what it was but then toward the back end of your career you realize oh wow that's actually

484
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:37,260
really good behaviors and you're luckily doing the right thing and i think i can describe it

485
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:47,400
uh by saying that you know when we finished up my so rowing with drew in athens

486
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,800
my goal in in rowing

487
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:56,420
with him was to row in such a way that allowed him to perform at his best

488
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:03,800
so zero self-interest like i could sit in the boat and row as hard as i possibly could and

489
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,019
you know tear the side of the boat off and make it so uncomfortable for him that he couldn't

490
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:12,559
perform his best but if i go how can i run such a way that allows him to absolutely nail it and

491
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:18,840
if he reciprocates yeah i mean that is the ultimate team and that is the ultimate in selflessness

492
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,800
i think that's the ultimate

493
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:26,179
in leadership take the ego away take the self-interest away of your next promotion

494
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:33,539
what can i do to help my team absolutely thrive yeah and if they thrive you know again

495
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:39,940
the byproduct is i'll probably get that promotion instead of worrying about the promotion you go

496
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:45,320
get your team absolutely up and thriving and did you enjoy that as much as any time in sport where

497
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,400
the two of you are genuinely yeah yeah focused on each other's best interest yeah and i guess

498
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:58,579
it goes back to i was describing our team meetings in the four where um you know everyone is open and

499
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:04,800
honest and saying i'm really struggling with my front turn for example and then one of the

500
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,840
eyes goes oh if i did this does that make it any better yeah that's fantastic so all of a sudden

501
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,500
you got people working with other people to help them with their deficiencies or enhance their

502
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:20,500
strengths and once you get that dynamic then you're up and up you would

503
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,699
you know in the footy clubs it's instead of drilling someone with the ball just put it

504
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:29,000
softly out in front of them make it easy for them to catch the thing yeah you know they'll give a

505
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,880
little block here and there help the midfielders get through um it's just what can you do to help

506
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,099
your teammates thrive you don't win you know multiple world championships and olympic gold

507
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:45,400
medals for fun like you did without having a really clear vision of what you want to achieve

508
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,039
how did you go about you know as you said as an individual in a boat of four or eight or in a

509
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:56,019
as you ended up with drew how did you go about sharing that vision or creating that vision

510
00:36:56,019 --> 00:37:03,400
together um well i think it's a taken it's a sorry it's a given that yeah you're trying to

511
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:12,539
go as well as you possibly can and and we did move away from winning or a time or a number of

512
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:20,719
strokes into yeah 96 it really clicked where we because we we got we all get so

513
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,880
wound up concentrating on the bloody end result that we thought no no get the processes right

514
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:33,980
and if we do that nine times out of ten the outcome takes care of itself but also

515
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:44,480
it was trying to win um but doing it with your best possible performance in the final

516
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,719
and as soon as you move away so you got sort of two goals there one to to win but one best

517
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:57,960
performance and as soon as you get away from performance i'm sorry the end goal of winning

518
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:04,300
and start concentrating on your best performance that changes the um the dynamic a lot and changes

519
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:09,559
the time frame one is 12 months away and 2 000 meters down the track and the other one is what

520
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:15,460
am i doing today that's going to allow that to happen yeah exactly yeah and so winning but

521
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:20,780
winning well yeah and so that became um and that focus the anxiety

522
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,179
of then you know olympic gold or bust becomes not such a big thing because you

523
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:29,900
hey if we row our absolute best yeah we're going to be around the mark yeah and that's what we can

524
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,500
do anyway exactly if we get beaten well yeah it must be phenomenal someone's done something better

525
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:40,059
yeah um makes a lot of sense we see people who have success like you and lead others are really

526
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:46,820
curious and curiosity shows up through that constant self-improvement are you curious i am

527
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,800
to a certain extent what do you mean by that

528
00:38:50,820 --> 00:39:01,760
uh well i i i like to um i like to yeah i'm curious yeah because i get into the nitty-gritty

529
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:12,320
of it but i also like um i like a plan so a training plan this is what we've got to do

530
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,420
and so okay i'll go and do that as well as i can and there'll be a lot of discussion around what

531
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:20,340
that plan that training program is and a lot of questioning

532
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:26,699
of the coaches why are we doing it uh which i think is really healthy because if they don't

533
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:32,039
know they go and research it and work out oh that's right or wrong so yeah i guess curious

534
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:37,579
questioning you know i'll always question but when i'm when i know that it's 100 right then

535
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:43,579
i mean then all in yeah fascinating answer communicating with with clarity is another

536
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:49,159
dimension we see regularly that people are really consistent in how they in team environments or to

537
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,800
have success how they communicate was that something that you were talking about

538
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:58,699
you gave thought to or uh well not again not really not really because it was just i mean

539
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:09,079
you've got to remember like through yeah and it is different to the workplace so in at that level

540
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:13,920
like everyone is fully committed whereas some people you know at work they're just you know

541
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,039
going to get along or you know and catch up with friends and get paid for it and do some work

542
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,800
and there's a i want to be the ceo and you know

543
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:26,739
within five years so there's different mental different motivations and and and application

544
00:40:26,739 --> 00:40:35,260
at work whereas at that level in sport like pretty much everyone's similar mindset of all

545
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:41,880
trying to strive and and do you know super super well so you've got that already and then it's just

546
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,820
a matter of yeah a lot of it is people management you know and certainly the four of us we had some

547
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,139
pretty strong all of us strong personalities and all quite different

548
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:57,360
so there has to be a level of trust that you know the way you prepare for an event is probably

549
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,260
different to the way i do but the way you do it that's what works for you and the way i do it's

550
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:07,760
what so we've got to trust one another in that regard and and sometimes you know there's it was

551
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:15,039
not plain sailing the whole time definitely and but in that environment you've got the right to

552
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:20,800
call someone out because it's shared success or shared failure and so what you do is you've got to

553
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:27,780
do affects how i go so i've got the right to call that out just as as much as as you do so it's that

554
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:34,539
just that honesty as long as it's done in a really respectful way as long as it's done with the view

555
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:39,880
of getting that result of having your best performance in the final did you ever get that

556
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:48,159
wrong uh yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely and it's hard like you know it's such a

557
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:50,800
pressure situation and especially when you're in a situation like this where you've got to

558
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:56,860
when you're overseas and you're you know european hotels you're rooming with your crewmate three

559
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:06,260
feet away and you're training together you're sleeping in the same room breakfast lunch and

560
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:11,480
dinner like 24 hours a day you're with this person or with your crewmates for a couple of months

561
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:19,940
yeah pushing hard yeah that's and as it builds up you know um yeah i mean yeah

562
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:27,519
before the 96 final i think it was drew and mike nearly came to blows over because drew was set on

563
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:31,119
the was on the massage table for five minutes too long or something rather yeah and this is the night

564
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,039
before the final it's sort of like you know everyone's on tenderhooks like knife's edge

565
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:41,500
sort of stuff i can relate to that how important was collaboration for you in in your success

566
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:49,780
oh huge i yeah i i i love being involved in teams and being around people

567
00:42:50,820 --> 00:43:01,059
and uh and yeah that's shared and i i i do really feel very lucky to have had success in a team

568
00:43:01,059 --> 00:43:08,679
so i can ring up drew or greeny and or mike and when we get together and we've got that shared

569
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:14,880
experience whereas an individual athlete yeah obviously you know if they're successful it's

570
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,800
phenomenal but they're the only ones that knows what they've been through and what it was really

571
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:27,699
like and so you know they don't have you go down to pas and have a few beers with your crew

572
00:43:27,699 --> 00:43:33,380
to talk about the good old days the swim up they only talk to themselves about the good old days

573
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,539
and they're the only ones that actually know what they've been through so i feel really lucky to

574
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:43,000
you know and they're some of the best mates now beautiful uh lifelong history isn't it that team

575
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,179
success and um what a magic thing when you guys get together who's been the greatest leader in

576
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:50,260
your life oh uh

577
00:43:50,820 --> 00:44:00,760
well i mean the easy one is my parents only through example which and you would know um

578
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:06,679
you put you know you find that you end up doing very similar things to what your parents did when

579
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:11,179
you're a child with the stuff that works so i guess that is a form of leadership of taking

580
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:17,159
from the past and what worked and what didn't work and and applying it in the sporting sense

581
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:20,699
i think dono was uh our coach noel donaldson was

582
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:26,639
phenomenal leader in that he understood the personalities of the four of us

583
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:33,860
really well and knew what worked for each individual what didn't and how to get us up and

584
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:41,719
going and yeah technically very good training program very good but you know using um outside

585
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:48,599
resources to help but then that people management and you know him being so like

586
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:50,800
yeah it was almost like a little bit of a thing but i think that's the thing that i think is

587
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:55,659
like our mother like he was doing everything for us basically which was great but he was yeah he was

588
00:44:55,659 --> 00:45:02,900
giving up him of himself to allow us to absolutely thrive and create an environment where we could

589
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:08,179
and i think that's that's true leadership and so to have him involved when i was at school and then

590
00:45:08,179 --> 00:45:19,900
through that period in the fours you know from 90 from 1990 through to 2000 um yeah was uh was was

591
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:25,320
pretty special that someone to literally dedicate their life to the success you know not many people

592
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:31,159
talk about noel donaldson and the awesome foursome do they but no it's uh it's your success yeah

593
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:36,380
absolutely you know that he helped create it so i love uh celebrating that and calling that out

594
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:40,579
we're a bit obsessed with collaboration in the space we are the leader and bringing together

595
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:44,780
people from different backgrounds and different thought processes there's been someone you've

596
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:49,559
got a range of different passions clearly your olympic success is is a standout but we just heard

597
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:54,480
your life because there's been someone you thought god i'd love to spend some time and

598
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,940
collaborate with that on any one of your passions whether it be rowing or otherwise

599
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:04,920
oh lots of people fortunately i've actually met a lot of people that are really probably got to do

600
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,659
it yeah is there one that springs to mind is there one yeah well i got to know mark weber really well

601
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:16,940
and yeah i do love my motorsport as well and and we both met before we he was still racing

602
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,699
formula fords over in europe and i was hadn't won

603
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:25,960
an olympic medal yet and so we met quite early on but we hit it off straight away and so

604
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:33,219
you know to see how he operates and in fact learned from him as well uh there was one

605
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:40,639
after or one of the years 2003 i think it was um where he actually said to us he goes like you guys

606
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:45,300
get yourselves as fit as you possibly can but you know when they go away for a testing weekend when

607
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:50,039
he was driving they would look for three or four areas of the car to improve and it might mean a

608
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:58,059
like but that's a big margin for them yeah and yeah that just saying that hit home that yeah we'd

609
00:46:58,059 --> 00:47:02,800
been using the same wars same style of wars for the last 10 years and just assumed that it was

610
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,539
right and so we went in and tested absolutely everything to make sure that and there were some

611
00:47:07,539 --> 00:47:10,900
things we changed most of the things we were on the right path but there were some that we were

612
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:17,199
actually tweaked so learning from other people from different backgrounds but everyone's trying

613
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:20,500
to do the same thing yeah what can i do

614
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:28,460
both individually and my equipment to get the best performance when the flag drops i'm sitting

615
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:34,260
alongside a six-time olympian who won three olympic gold medals and had extraordinary olympic

616
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:41,400
careers there a favorite olympic moment well uh fortunately there's been a few but um i'm not

617
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:49,239
any real favorite i mean obviously the success that we had with your best mates was was really

618
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:55,099
incredible i came with a rowing team that was really strong guys and girls and then involved

619
00:47:55,099 --> 00:47:59,840
in the broader australian team which was you know on the rise and sort of peaked in sydney

620
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:06,559
that was fantastic but actually one of the highlights luke was in 1988 when the rowing

621
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,159
finished the rowing finishes in the first week so you got the second week to go and watch the

622
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:17,440
sports and um well you used to be able to uh and we went to the track and field and we're sitting

623
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,559
in front of the pole vault gym

624
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:29,400
jump or the pole vault area and sergey bubka was the number one pole vaulter and he'd broken the

625
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,980
i think he got like you know cash bonuses every time he broke the world record so he used to only

626
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:37,980
break it by a second he'd clear it by 20 centimeters but he'd only break it by one

627
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:43,780
centimeter by one centimeter and get my bonus get my bonus anyway he uh in the pole vault final his

628
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:49,179
favorite you know you you can pass you don't have to jump so he passed and passed and passed

629
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:54,920
until there was only three jumpers left he still hadn't jumped the two other guys

630
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:01,719
jump jump jumped and missed and so he's still in the competition having not taken a jump having

631
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:08,820
not taken a jump and he missed his first two so everyone else is out wow and it came down

632
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:15,980
current world record holder legendary legendary okay and it came down to that last jump

633
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:19,039
and we were sitting there before we were in an

634
00:49:19,179 --> 00:49:23,539
event then but a whole bunch of us there laurie lawrence was there as well and we're all just

635
00:49:23,539 --> 00:49:31,079
going oh my like this is coming down to the moment you can't get more pressure and he nailed it and

636
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:36,380
jumped it and i've subsequently met him but he's an isc member as well and i've met him and i've

637
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:41,719
talked to him about it and just to hear his side of things you know he's standing at the top of the

638
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:47,400
runways he's going come on the the real sergey hasn't turned up yet we we need him now he's

639
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,159

640
00:49:49,179 --> 00:49:54,780
it's time to do it and he goes i've absolutely nailed it and uh to see that and then to have

641
