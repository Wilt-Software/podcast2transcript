1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:13,130
How do you learn to trust yourself to make the right calls and know that the path you are taking

2
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:22,370
is the right one? G'day, it's Luke Darson. The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on

3
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,969
and off the field has been a lifelong passion of mine. With one of my oldest friends, we created

4
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:31,469
a leader collective. I've had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders in education,

5
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,170
sport, industry, and the arts that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style

6
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:43,289
of leadership where everyone has a voice. In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic

7
00:00:43,289 --> 00:01:04,530
leaders. I was joined by a person who always seems to be ahead of the curve, founder of Smiling

8
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,549
Minds, Janie Martino. We talk about how she connected meditation and technology, how to

9
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:14,409
navigate through the tough times in business and fostering a great culture at work and at home.

10
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:22,450
Well, this feels like the impossible task to do justice to Janie Martino's life's

11
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,430
story. I'm going to give it a try off the top, but I might start, and I'm happy to be fact-checked

12
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,730
here, but I believe at 14 years and 18 months, Janie Martino was wandering around Chadston

13
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:36,549
Shopping Centre here in Melbourne with her CV looking to land her first job, which she duly did.

14
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:41,109
By the time she was in year 12, a few years later, she was holding down two jobs, but was academically

15
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:46,569
good enough to effectively have any course available to her. She ended up going to RMI

16
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:51,590
to university here in Melbourne, studying a Bachelor of Public Relations, majoring in psychology.

17
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:58,250
Aged 25, founded Undertow Media. She was the CEO and ended up with a staff of over 30, which she

18
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:04,689
sold to Bastion Group. She went on to co-found the Smiling Mind app as a social venture, which is just

19
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:10,490
one of the most extraordinary stories. To have 600,000 monthly users with Smiling Mind is simply

20
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,810
staggering. And in the process of learning how to raise funds in the not-for-profit space, Janie

21
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:20,349
created the Shout app, which she then went on to sell to the ANZ Bank. She's been an angel investor

22
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,430
in many startups, including in the incredible story of Unlocked.

23
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:27,990
She went on to become the CEO, which I'm keen to discuss in a moment's time. On top of that, Janie

24
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,250
is a mother to three teenage boys and is also working on her latest venture, which I believe

25
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,389
is in the wellness media space. Janie Martino, great to meet you. Thanks for joining me today.

26
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:39,270
Thanks, Luke. So good to be here.

27
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,430
Incredible drive from such a young age. If I've got my facts right,

28
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,490
where did that drive come from at 14 years of age?

29
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,150
Yeah, no, your facts were spot on. I had my top 10 list.

30
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:58,650
And I think, yeah, where I landed was in the top five. I just was born that way. I

31
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,229
come from a family. My dad's an academic. My mom's a librarian.

32
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:11,830
Had a really simple, lovely upbringing. There wasn't huge expectations. I just think

33
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:20,310
I have a naturally curious mind and I am inherently pretty fearless. And so the

34
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,349
combination of the two just...

35
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:27,669
That just means that I'll give most things a go. And that's from a very early age. It's always

36
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:33,810
been part of me and who I am. And also I've been pretty disruptive all along as well. So I think

37
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:41,129
that's the other piece. Every school report, literally from prep right through senior school,

38
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:50,409
I was disruptive in class, talking, answering back. So yeah, I think it's a deadly combo.

39
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,930
Well, the fearless...

40
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:56,069
Certainly rings true. And in doing my research for this conversation with you, there were

41
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,729
a lot of themes that came up regularly in what you've done in your life and taking a leap and

42
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:06,030
the courage to jump into something. And I have these words attributed to, which again, I hope

43
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,449
are correct. And you say that a large amount of the shift in your mental state, energy and

44
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:15,349
opportunity will never come while you're getting ready for the leap. The whole point of the leap

45
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:19,949
is actually having no safety net. And is that accurate? And it seems as though you've just

46
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:22,370
had incredible courage to just jump in.

47
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:24,509
Go after something with everything you've got.

48
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:33,189
Yeah, I think that's very accurate. I think also it's easier to do when the reason you're doing it

49
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:40,490
is because it feels like the right path for you and it feels purposeful. And I always find that

50
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:47,889
when I do things for those reasons, then it feels natural. It feels like the right thing to do.

51
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,370
I also make sure that...

52
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:59,029
I don't overthink things and I don't have a lot in my mind. And if I do, I feel like I can process

53
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:07,750
and tell the difference between fear and reality. And so that's been super helpful

54
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,029
as well. And to have in my kit bag, that's definitely helped with the leaps.

55
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,170
Well, it certainly is unique in some ways, Jane. And I relate to that, but I also see lots of

56
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:22,430
people who spend their life in industries or jobs that they don't have purpose because it's a mean

57
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:28,389
to an end. And that fear of once you start a family or you get the financial security of what

58
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:32,889
a job offers you and seeing people trapped in that space, but clearly from a young age,

59
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:38,110
sense of purpose and then the courage to follow it. It feels like that is the new currency. People

60
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,170
talk about purpose now, purpose-driven organizations, but you're definitely ahead of the

61
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:42,750
curve on that one.

62
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:51,670
Yeah. And I think it's also just following what you love and what feels good. And I think for me,

63
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:59,370
and sometimes that's been a really hard decision to make as well, because I'm not living up to

64
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:06,750
social constructs or my friends and family's expectations or things that even inherently,

65
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:12,750
I feel I probably should do, or I owe it to someone to do this or see it through. But

66
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:20,209
I think the most important thing and how we can really thrive and feel purposeful is actually

67
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:22,430
doing what feels right.

68
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:29,790
And I believe you always have a choice. And sometimes that means doing hard things. Sometimes

69
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:35,170
that means renting instead of buying a house and having a mortgage because yeah, you really

70
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:41,350
don't like the job you're doing. And so I think we do always have a choice, but we build these

71
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:48,470
constructs around us that create the reasons why not and the reasons to be fearful. And so

72
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,269
it's whether or not we're willing to knock a few of those things down.

73
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:59,930
Yeah. It's a great thought. And you had the courage at 25 years of age, having some PR experience

74
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:05,170
and studied PR to go, I'm ready to take the leap and start your own business, which was a great

75
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:10,750
success, Undertow Media, that you went on to sell to the Bastion Group. Success was, as I said in

76
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,949
the intro, you're looking back at yourself as a 25-year-old leader. What type of leader were you?

77
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:21,250
I don't think I was a particularly good leader. I think there were things I was good at. I was

78
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,790
really good at selling a vision, leading a team, getting everyone to pull together. But I feel

79
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:35,170
like I was a terrible micromanager. I didn't understand how I could help someone else feel

80
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:40,829
way more purposeful if I didn't give them the level of direction I felt they needed.

81
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:49,389
And I actually understood that the people that work with and for me are probably very different

82
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:51,230
to me. And so therefore, I need to adapt. And I think that's a really good point.

83
00:07:51,250 --> 00:08:00,910
My leadership style, I look back on that and cringe at times for sure. But in saying that,

84
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:07,110
I also had the person that took over as CEO was with me from pretty much day one of that agency.

85
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:13,769
So I know that I built something really special from a cultural perspective. But as an individual

86
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:20,889
leader, I feel like I am so different now. And like you'd want to be, right?

87
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:28,089
And it's literally decades down the line. But you would hope there would be an enormous amount

88
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:34,730
of personal growth and leadership growth. But I still believe that so much of how we lead comes

89
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:41,769
down to our personalities and our strengths and also our weaknesses. And so I think the other

90
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:48,210
thing about me at that time is I always knew best. I felt like that was part of being a leader,

91
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,210
to be strong, to be always having this...

92
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:57,610
Rather than now, I realize I actually just share that I don't know all the answers. And the older

93
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:03,549
I get and the more experienced I get, the less I feel like I know. And the more I want people's

94
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:09,789
contribution and for them to lead and do what they're good at and for me to celebrate and just

95
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:18,309
sit back and enjoy that. So I think it was an amazing honor to start a business at that age.

96
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:21,190
But it was also something that I probably...

97
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,610
I probably hadn't been out in the world enough to realize that to be a really good leader,

98
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:29,429
I didn't have to have the answer to everything.

99
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:33,730
Most people haven't got the self-reflection that you've got there, Janie, to actually

100
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,649
understand that and understand their development. But did you look back and think, did that affect

101
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:43,889
some of the relationships that you worked in within the business? Was that something that

102
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:49,070
you'd like to have had your time again differently? Or was it just you at 25 doing the best you could?

103
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,230
Yeah, I think for sure.

104
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:57,889
Would I lead differently now? Yes, I absolutely would. Would I probably get more and contribute

105
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:06,970
more to my team? Definitely. But I don't think about it often. I feel like I've also worked

106
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:13,210
with leaders along the way that I've loved them warts and all. I mean, I don't... And we are

107
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:19,889
completely imperfect. And so I really think that what I built in the team I work with,

108
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,090
many of whom sort of have...

109
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:27,549
Followed me around and I do still have contact with today, would feel that and they would know

110
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:32,870
and probably have seen in other ways that the shift and change in me and probably in themselves.

111
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:39,590
I think one thing I love is that now I've been kicking around for a while, I've also had the

112
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:43,769
opportunity that people that have worked for me have gone out on their own and run their own

113
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:49,210
business or been a leader. And often their reflection is, wow, this is really hard.

114
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,490
I didn't realize...

115
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:56,929
Probably gave you a hard time or I was critical. And I think when we then sit in the leader's

116
00:10:56,929 --> 00:11:03,429
chair, we actually have a lot more empathy as well. So I think that that plays into it also.

117
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:10,210
Yeah, it's a great perspective. And as you said, at 25, you would clearly think over time,

118
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:15,389
you are going to evolve and develop and not many had the courage first and foremost to do what you

119
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:20,429
did at that age. Now you have, as I said in the intro, and there's so much more to what you've

120
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,049
done. But...

121
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:21,110
Yeah.

122
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,169
Yeah.

123
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:21,210
Yeah.

124
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:21,230
Yeah.

125
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,450
And what are you like now as a leader, Janie, when you look back and compare,

126
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,889
what are the things that you've added to the way that you lead the groups that you work with now?

127
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:35,570
Well, I definitely am still a really decisive and visionary leader. I think people really

128
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:43,610
need that and respect that. But I'm much better at including everyone in that process and also

129
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:50,909
I'm really making sure that actually it's much more about we,

130
00:11:50,909 --> 00:12:01,149
and what we have done, and not at all I. And I think, so the level of humility that I bring to the things I do,

131
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:08,470
I definitely think as well, I've always been a really positive and empowering person. But I really,

132
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,070
what I think I bring to the table, and whether it's my own business or someone I'm working with,

133
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:20,870
is really positivity and perspective. So I think...

134
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:27,990
I probably didn't have... I was much more tunnel vision. So I've got a lot better at standing back

135
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:34,809
and actually taking a breath and whether it's my own business or helping those I'm sort of working

136
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:41,529
with to see things from different perspectives. And look, I have to say meditation and mindfulness

137
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:49,070
has been key in building all of this, in my opinion. It's been the foundation. I've done

138
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,710
a lot of work on myself as well.

139
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:56,570
And have a black book of all kinds of professionals. But I also think, my goodness,

140
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:05,009
the ability to have more empathy, to regulate my emotions far better, to see and not take

141
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:11,149
things personally, all of those beautiful gifts that it's given me has definitely enhanced my

142
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:16,110
leadership so much. Yeah, so much to talk about on the back of what you said, Dan. And it's probably

143
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,409
one of the misunderstood things sometimes, isn't it? About the practice of meditation,

144
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:24,850
sort of mindfulness, is that it has that flow and effect and you lower your nervous system and

145
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:29,690
you recover better and you make better decisions and you can lead as you just described in ways

146
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:33,509
that you hadn't before. I definitely want to get to Smiley Mind, but you're picking up a language

147
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:38,590
that we're talking about a lot in the leadership spaces, that shift now from the old hierarchy

148
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:44,190
corner office of a boss that was command and control to more collaborative and more

149
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:49,990
inclusive in the way. Are you seeing leaders that you're working with that are that way now? And

150
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,389
you're saying, yeah, I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good

151
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:53,649
thing. Are you seeing it as a much more effective way, the 21st century style of leadership?

152
00:13:54,110 --> 00:14:02,149
Oh, definitely. I think they're everywhere. And I think that the next generation of people

153
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:08,470
working alongside leaders demand that. And I know it's the same with parenting and it's the same on

154
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:14,149
the footy field, in my opinion. It's sort of, you see the coaches that actually sit alongside

155
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:18,990
and genuinely coach. And that's the definition of what that is.

156
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:26,570
Um, rather than the ones that just stand there and say, do this, do that. Uh, so yeah, I think

157
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:33,149
it's a combination of general higher levels of consciousness and enlightenment around what

158
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:40,149
actually helps people flourish and be their best at work and as, as people and how to build culture,

159
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:47,549
but also an uprising and a demand from people to, uh, and probably also the courage to articulate

160
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:48,929
their needs.

161
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:57,049
As well as a team, you know, I think, um, and, and having, you know, platforms like culture amp and,

162
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:02,230
and, and things that force the conversation around whether it's anonymous or not, like,

163
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:06,789
you know, what's working for you, what's not. And so leaders have no choice, but to,

164
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:10,289
to take that on board pretty much on a month to month, quarter to quarter basis.

165
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:14,889
Yeah. It's, uh, absolutely how we're seeing it, certainly in the sporting context, we're just

166
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:18,470
seeing, you know, the next generation, if they haven't got a voice in their environment and in

167
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:24,149
the past environment that I played in and grew up in was, you just didn't get a say and it wasn't

168
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:29,049
an option. And no matter how much experience you weren't even thought about, uh, you know,

169
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:32,909
questioning the coach or trying to add something really in that time. And so, as you said, there's

170
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:35,950
a generation that just won't tolerate that. If they're not in an environment where they don't

171
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,690
feel like they've got a voice and they can collaborate, then they'll move environments

172
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,350
or they'll get out and they'll do something different, which again, is a credit in some

173
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:48,230
ways to the next generation of, uh, of what they value and how they see it. There's so much, uh,

174
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:53,549
there, Janie, that I want to chat to you about, but we jumped into the meditation and, uh, I have

175
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:58,629
to go to Smiling Mind, which is just an incredible achievement, an incredible story, uh, that you and

176
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:03,029
James Tutton, who started Moonlight Cinema, to have that vision ahead of its time. I've, uh,

177
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:06,649
been fortunate enough at a young age to have found, uh, meditation. I've been passionate about

178
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:12,090
it for, for a long, long while, but, you know, I look back and think you bringing meditation to an

179
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:17,730
app, you bringing it was, you know, there's a fair bit of, um, hierarchy in the meditation space too.

180
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:22,970
Get their nose out of joint. You can't put, uh, meditation, you know, into, into the app space,

181
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:27,909
but you broke a lot of rules, but the impact you've had having 600,000 users monthly is a

182
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:32,129
great achievement. You must, you must look back with a lot of pride of, of, uh, creating Smiling

183
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:37,690
Mind and bringing meditation mainstream. I definitely do. I, it's the most joyful

184
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:42,070
thing I've done in my whole career, you know, and I think it's so funny because

185
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:50,409
you would look at a person's CV or, you know, their net worth or whatever. However, externally

186
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:56,429
people may view success. And obviously I've never earned a dime. It's a not-for-profit organization

187
00:16:56,429 --> 00:17:03,110
and it's by far the best thing I've done in my entire career, you know? And so to me, yeah,

188
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:12,049
it's a really strong reminder of what success means to me. Um, and I get the joy every,

189
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:18,509
you know, uh, of, of hearing people say, I use that, that's helped my child be able to go to

190
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:25,990
school. I, now my kids can sleep well, you know, all those types of things. So I'm definitely proud,

191
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:32,670
but I also use it as, you know, to touch on what we talked about at the outset as an example of

192
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:39,130
how to be courageous and how important it is to be courageous because James and I started that 10

193
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,569
years ago. And we went,

194
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:45,130
even though it was a not-for-profit, we went about it and did a business plan

195
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:52,269
and went around and spoke to an extraordinary amount of people at the time. And like I'm

196
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:57,569
talking, you know, probably sub a hundred people, um, and thought we just had the best idea, you

197
00:17:57,569 --> 00:18:03,569
know, how to build the, you know, a preventative mental health tool and embedded in the curriculum

198
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:08,710
and, uh, let's do it through technology. It can all be free and fully accessible. And literally

199
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,549
less than a handful of people told us it was a good idea.

200
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:18,809
And that they would support it. Like I've never had so many no's with anything I've done. You

201
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:23,670
know, um, you shouldn't combine technology and meditation. Kids will never do it. They never

202
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:30,809
sit still, you know, this doesn't belong in the classroom, all kinds of objections. And now it's

203
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:37,289
on 6 million devices around the country. And so we have been part of introducing, you know, as you,

204
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:41,190
and there's that many monthly actives, as you say, it's in a third of classrooms. So

205
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:48,609
we've been part of introducing people to a tool and especially over the last few years that

206
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:56,910
can potentially help transform their lives. And, you know, that to me is why whenever you feel

207
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:01,190
strongly about your purpose or something you should be doing, you should take the leap.

208
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,950
And what a gift isn't, as you said, the preventative mental health space and arming

209
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:11,089
kids, you know, at school age with something that they can self-regulate with and can control

210
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:11,549
their own mental health.

211
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:16,549
And, and have that quiet time opportunity. And I, I can't help, but in the same context,

212
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:21,029
Janie, you and I are sitting in a city called Melbourne in Australia that, uh, unfortunately

213
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:25,769
has the record now for the most locked down city in the world. And if you read any of the data out

214
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:30,609
there, uh, that can unfortunately be hard to find. We feel like there's a tsunami of mental health

215
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:34,450
issues coming our way, not only here in Melbourne, but around the world with kids having been

216
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,369
denied access to school for, for, for whatever reasons without having any political commentary

217
00:19:39,369 --> 00:19:41,250
around it. But I think everyone can agree.

218
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:46,150
That social experiment is going to cause a strain mental health-wise on the next generation.

219
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,970
You know, Smiling Mind has been a great contributor, an extraordinary story.

220
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:56,109
Is it need more funding? What else do we need to do to try and, I suppose, counteract what I think

221
00:19:56,109 --> 00:20:00,349
all of us are seeing coming as being a real wave of mental health dramas like we've never seen

222
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:03,930
before in kids? Yeah, well, we actually just this week have

223
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:10,849
released our state of mind report and there's some pretty damning statistics in that, in that

224
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:16,910
I think it was 41% of parents believe the pandemic has had negative, negative impacts on the mental

225
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:23,289
wellbeing of their kids. And that, yeah, 78% of Aussies actually have experienced poor mental

226
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:29,950
health over the course of the last 12 months. So that is, I don't, I, I've never heard statistics

227
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:35,309
like it. And we have done this report for a number of years. Um, so we're certainly using

228
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:41,549
that as a platform to talk, not just about additional funding and all of the things,

229
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:45,809
but I think actually most of the community and the government understand and know,

230
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:51,630
but actually about prevention, you know, because we sit in the preventative space and that doesn't

231
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:56,789
mean that, um, we don't move into the critical space and lots of clinicians and headspace clinics

232
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:03,890
and GPs recommend, uh, Smiling Mind, which we're so grateful for. Um, but actually the importance

233
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:10,049
of the funding and support being directed towards prevention, because at the moment it's, it's a

234
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:11,170
tiny, tiny.

235
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:16,730
Sliver. And that if we don't start actually focusing more on, on that, then we're going

236
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:22,910
to get, continue to get the blockage that we have at the critical care end. Um, so that's really

237
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:28,309
what I, you know, what we're going to, and I would love to talk to anyone who'll listen about

238
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:34,410
is, um, yeah, how to build, how to build resilience and how to build that into people's everyday

239
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:34,990
lives.

240
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,490
Yeah, absolutely. The, the numbers that are tattooed in my brain at the moment,

241
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,490
which you may or may not have read as well, is just, you know, the, the,

242
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:45,890
in particular here in Melbourne, about 830 in the teenage girl bracket are diagnosed with an eating

243
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:50,869
disorder every week. We've got self-harming at record levels. We've got, uh, admissions to

244
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:55,309
emergency with parents so concerned about suicidal ideation in Melbourne, as you said, that's

245
00:21:55,309 --> 00:22:00,269
catching at an end where that system's already overwhelmed and to get an appointment now in our

246
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:05,549
city for psychologists, from what I understand is almost, uh, impossible for about 18 months. But

247
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:10,470
she said to put some resources back into the preventative space makes a lot of sense, doesn't

248
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,470
it? And, and, and that was,

249
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:15,910
10 years ago that you and James were running around having a thought that very few people

250
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:21,569
wanted to support. It's, uh, it seems like that is the story of you, Janie, that you, you seem to be

251
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:25,710
a few years ahead of everyone else. Is that been something that you've had a bit of intuition on,

252
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,529
and not only in the meditation and smiling mind space, but in the other areas you've gone into?

253
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:38,009
I think so. I, well, I think I've just followed my intuition wherever I've gone. And I guess

254
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:39,430
that's where it's taken me.

255
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:41,529
I think sometimes with things,

256
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:47,950
you can be too early as well. Like I think, you know, and so with smiling mind, we were just so

257
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:53,230
lucky that we did have enough people who believed, even though it was a very small group. And we

258
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,910
actually had a beautiful call with them on Friday, um, to say, thank you, you know, and mark the 10

259
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:04,450
years and say, if you hadn't actually said yes. And, and, um, you know, thought we were a bit

260
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:09,569
crazy, but backed us anyway, then smiling mind wouldn't exist. So, you know, I think, yeah,

261
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:11,509
but I, I definitely feel like I,

262
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:20,009
I have done things that seem unusual to many people at the time. Um, and I like doing new

263
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:26,890
things. I love, I love doing new things personally and trying new things. So I think it's also that

264
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:32,910
sense of curiosity, as I touched on before, um, that feels satiated by doing something that perhaps

265
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,190
people haven't done before.

266
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:37,829
Janie, what advice would you give to someone listening to this who may be, you know,

267
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:41,490
is in the middle of a startup phase or thinking about starting a business,

268
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:46,549
this is someone who's jumped in and, and done it with great courage. What, what advice would you

269
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:53,650
give? Well, I think there's a couple of things. One is look out for, um, the trough of sorrow,

270
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:58,150
which is just a normal, I think they call it, if you Google it, I'm pretty sure it's called that,

271
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:04,509
um, a normal phase. Like everyone you read in the paper about all of these startups getting

272
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:10,529
funded and you see all the great bits, but actually behind that newsprint, uh, some pretty

273
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:11,490
grueling experiences. Um, and I think that's, I think that's, I think that's, I think that's

274
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:17,269
experiences from all businesses and all founders. So I think, you know, understanding and knowing

275
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:22,210
that everyone has experienced those and you're not alone is really important. And to that point,

276
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:29,529
absolutely making sure that you have two things. One is that you have a professional

277
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:35,809
network around you who might've done it before, be good or strong at things that you're not so

278
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:41,410
good at and that you can really lean on. So, you know, when things aren't going as well as planned,

279
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:46,890
and when they are, um, but also then on the personal front, like I've seen so many founders

280
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:53,410
and I've definitely been one myself that has put a lot of other things before their wellbeing

281
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:59,349
and thinks that they're doing it for the benefit of the business and the benefit of the shareholders.

282
00:24:59,349 --> 00:25:07,609
And that is never the case. And I have to catch myself constantly to be balanced. And so it's a

283
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:11,430
lifelong journey when you're, you know, naturally entrepreneurial,

284
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:19,269
I think, but I have learned that when I'm good, the business is so much better and the team feels

285
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:25,190
better and I can give more and I'm still there in one piece at the end of the day, you know,

286
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:32,569
for my family. So, and the boys. So I think, yeah, that, that's the, the two support have like a,

287
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:38,970
you know, a squad around you on both sides. To change gear and delve into the story of,

288
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,490
of Unlocked, which was another of the businesses that you ended up becoming,

289
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:48,450
CEO of, it was initially founded by a guy called Matt Berryman. It was an extraordinary app. It had,

290
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:54,289
you know, over 330, 30,000 active users at the time. It was geared towards Android,

291
00:25:54,390 --> 00:26:00,490
Android phones, I understand, and advertising and getting rewards for, for advertising views.

292
00:26:00,569 --> 00:26:05,569
And it was a pioneering in a sense. And just before you were about to IPO, and I think you're

293
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:09,849
the CEO at the time, Janie, Google took it off the Google Play store. And we understand there's

294
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:11,490
been some injunctions that, again, it's been a bit of a, it's been a bit of a, it's been a bit of a

295
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:16,269
Google for it, but that must've been an extraordinary time to be CEO of a company

296
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:23,170
about to go into an IPO listing and to have all that turmoil. How were you as a leader in that

297
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:30,390
challenging time? Yeah, this is the thing I like talking about the most. A, because, well,

298
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:35,650
not because it was so traumatic, because that, that's exactly what it was. But because I think

299
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:41,190
it's the best example I have of what happens when you create a really special culture.

300
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:51,569
Of, in particular, transparency, trust and transparency. So that business had 60 employees

301
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:56,930
across the world. It was what everyone would class as absolutely flying. It had a capital

302
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:04,410
register to die for, you know, with the who's who. I took over as, as CEO, as you said, and

303
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:11,150
yeah, we were literally a couple of months from IPO. And what, during the time,

304
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:17,309
when we got notification from Google, we were communicating with the team and kept them up to

305
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:22,470
speed the whole time. And that was because we'd always, since the business started, had

306
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:28,509
just such a trust with them. We shared all the numbers, we shared everything that happened in

307
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:35,950
the business and we decided that this was no different. And so right before things were not

308
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:41,269
looking so good, we were looking, it looked like we had to put the business into administration.

309
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:46,549
And we actually said to the team, we want you to look after yourselves. We want you to

310
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:52,269
go and find, find work. So many of them had families, commitments, mortgages,

311
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:55,569
and they'd just given everything to the business. They're just the most wonderful team.

312
00:27:55,849 --> 00:28:03,589
And not one of them did that. And I still, to this day, and I still obviously speak and have

313
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:10,089
friendships with many of them. It was the most humbling, incredible experience as, you know,

314
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:15,769
Maddie created a lot of that as the founder, but just, they were so committed that even

315
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:21,089
sacrificing, you know, their own personal situations, they weren't going to leave us

316
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:28,589
standing there alone. And I, I just think that is, it was just the most amazing return on

317
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:36,130
investment, allowing them the safe space to be trusted. You know, we, we would have very honest

318
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:40,069
conversations as teams. We knew what wasn't working. We'd be frank about it. We'd be honest

319
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:45,029
about that. And, and we were very clear if this trust is ever broken or anything leaks,

320
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:50,829
then it's disappearing. But until then we trust you implicitly. And, and what that created

321
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:55,690
meant that we, we were standing there with solidarity till the very end. And that was

322
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:01,529
pretty special. Yeah. Amazing to think back at that and see it as the, as a great story,

323
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:05,829
isn't it? Through that challenging time. And, you know, Matt, your co-founder had some really

324
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:09,690
public issues with his own mental health at that stage and had to step away from the role. And,

325
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:14,369
and suddenly it's you in the chair and you mentioned, you know, you had the who's who list

326
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:18,769
of, of, of capital investors as well, but that is brilliant. But I'm assuming that comes with

327
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:23,170
the level of pressure as well. I don't think you could think of a more, I suppose, pressure

328
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:28,309
filled environment for, for a CEO was, was, were they supportive as well? Did you have moments

329
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:32,930
where you felt like it was getting on top of you or was it all just transparency and you got through

330
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:39,910
it, you know, smoothly? Oh, I look back now and I think, you know, I mean,

331
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:46,150
I went through in that period, um, a marriage separation and that happening in the business.

332
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:54,009
And I look back now and think, well, wow, I'm obviously pretty strong, but also one thing I do

333
00:29:54,009 --> 00:30:01,470
reflect on is I did manage to keep a really level head. I had a broken heart by the end of it for

334
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:06,470
sure, because of what happened and seeing, you know, what an amazing business end up where it

335
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:10,029
did, but I really owed so much.

336
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:18,829
Of that to meditation and the practice that I had to keep my mind clear and strong, um, and keep my,

337
00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:25,549
my body grounded. Um, I still remember like there's things that have happened probably since

338
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:31,970
then that are not even close to as stressful and I might feel more overwhelmed. So I can't

339
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:38,750
really explain why that is, whether it's because I felt like as the leader, that's what my job was.

340
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,049
My job was to be,

341
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:46,450
the one that was steadfast and, and strong, um, in saying that, you know, telling the staff,

342
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:52,890
I, I expressed emotion and they could tell how devastated and sad I was. And I was completely

343
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:59,589
comfortable with that as well. So I think, yeah, the shareholders though were, were fantastic.

344
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:04,170
Um, but again, we communicated with them really well. So I think the key is always

345
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:09,529
communication and being yourself as a leader.

346
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:11,470
I think I just was myself.

347
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:17,049
Incredible. And that, uh, you know, it's amazing to, to stand you in that sort of good stand under

348
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:21,390
that sort of pressure you mentioned. And I wanted to touch on this as well. Um, you know, three

349
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:27,309
teenage boys, you had three boys here back to back to back. That is an extraordinary while you're

350
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:31,190
running businesses. And then you mentioned, you know, separating as well through, through that

351
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:36,349
time. And I mean, it's, how did you manage that? How did you manage the parenting part and, and

352
00:31:36,349 --> 00:31:38,710
the entrepreneur, entrepreneurial part at the same time?

353
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:40,029
Yeah, well,

354
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:48,250
I think I was so lucky because Matt, um, stayed at home with the boys and back then that was still

355
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:54,170
very different, a different sort of choice to make. And he was incredible. Um, and still he is

356
00:31:54,170 --> 00:32:02,349
such a great dad. And I think the thing that made it easier is like every minute of, of the,

357
00:32:02,349 --> 00:32:09,289
you know, the time we were together to now, um, we've been great friends and we've co-parented

358
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:09,970
in a really,

359
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:14,869
really positive, healthy way. Um, and so I'm very grateful for that. And we literally,

360
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:21,089
you know, we always maintain weekly family dinners and things like that. So when you're in

361
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:27,650
that stressful environment of work, but even though you're going through something,

362
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:33,329
you have the consistency of your family. It just looks, the composition of it is just a little bit

363
00:32:33,329 --> 00:32:39,250
different. That helps a lot. Um, because I didn't have to deal with a lot of the other challenges

364
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,049
that can come with it. Um, and so I think that's, I think that's, I think that's a really,

365
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:40,109
I think that's, I think that's, I think that's, I think that's, I think that's, I think that's a really,

366
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:47,069
that process. So I'm very grateful. And I feel like, um, what I would say to people that,

367
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:53,069
you know, and everyone does, right? Like no matter whether you're running your own business or in

368
00:32:53,069 --> 00:33:00,450
someone else's business or working part-time, you are juggling. Um, and so what I would say to that

369
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:09,170
is do everything you can to make sure you can have the healthiest possible relationships. And that

370
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,029
will support you. And I think that's, I think that's, I think that's, I think that's a really,

371
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:17,089
at work because you're, you know, between work and home, that's where you spend all your time.

372
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:24,250
So if you can foster a great culture at work and the best possible relationships you can have,

373
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:30,329
even if they're not conventional at home, then that, that really is a strong foundation to

374
00:33:30,329 --> 00:33:44,829
weather the storms that inevitably come. I think 50% of relationships end up in

375
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:46,789
separation. And so, you know, you're talking to,

376
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:51,750
half of people here, but not many do the separation part. Well, from what I can see,

377
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:56,450
a lot of it ends in the person that you had kids with, you really become, you know,

378
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:02,269
arch enemies or dysfunctional in the end. It's, you know, certain leadership to be able to get

379
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:06,630
that right. If you've got, you know, it's maybe a too personal question, but the advice, clearly

380
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:11,070
you've done that well for the three boys and managed to keep that balance. Well, is it something

381
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:16,329
that you really thought about and applied a lot of your leadership to? Definitely. I think,

382
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:16,989
and Matt often,

383
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:24,250
jokes that I wrote an email and we sent it out to our nearest and dearest. And he's like,

384
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:30,670
it was like a press release. So I definitely use some of my skills apparently, but no,

385
00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:37,289
but I think we, again, about communication, what we wanted that to say to everybody at the same

386
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:45,050
time was we are okay with this and yes, it's really hard, but we are still a family and

387
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,750
there's no sides to be taken.

388
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:52,610
We want you to treat us exactly the same way. And so we wanted to set the tone for that.

389
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:59,489
And then we just decided to commit to live to that. And, and that literally our boys were

390
00:34:59,489 --> 00:35:05,309
number one. And even when it gets tough and you feel frustrated or that you just anchor back to

391
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:14,210
that. And so we really did work hard. And I think the other thing was we, we probably went through

392
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:17,030
the process when we still had a great relationship and a,

393
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,130
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

394
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:22,610
a very strong friendship. And so that, that definitely helped. And that's almost like, I,

395
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:28,230
I couldn't think of a better person or someone I would want to have a family with. So in that

396
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:36,070
sense, there's no, it's just also the acceptance of like with your career relationships are no

397
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:41,309
different. Families are no different. There's, you know, all different phases and all different

398
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:46,690
ways that things can look and that's okay. Like we don't have to live up to these constructs and,

399
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:50,449
and have things turn out a certain way. Like we can decide that.

400
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:56,250
Yeah. Thanks, Janie, for sharing that. It's a common path clearly, but as you said,

401
00:35:56,289 --> 00:36:00,030
they don't have to look conventional. You can still have success and happiness. And

402
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:04,369
if you approach it the way you do, I like the idea of a press release too. That sounds

403
00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:10,449
as though you had that sorted as well. We've been talking to a whole range of different leaders

404
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:15,429
and identifying, Janie, what we feel are the dimensions of what makes great leaders in the

405
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:16,570
21st century. And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

406
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,909
Clearly a lot of that language is your language and the way that you approach your life, but

407
00:36:20,909 --> 00:36:25,449
keen for you to be as expansive as you like on these different dimensions of leadership. So

408
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:30,429
feel free to take as little or as a longer time as you like, but self-leadership is one of the

409
00:36:30,429 --> 00:36:35,010
dimensions we feel really passionate about. When I ask you about self-leadership, what does that

410
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:42,590
mean to you? I think, well, for me, it's making decisions that are really good for me and that

411
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:46,349
will bring out the best in me. Like if I'm leading a team,

412
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:53,250
like I, that, that's my responsibility when I'm leading a team is to make decisions that are

413
00:36:53,250 --> 00:37:00,570
really good for them as individuals and as a group. And so to me, that's what self-leadership

414
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:09,909
means is, is I'm steering my course and keeping in mind when I do that, my needs and what is

415
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:16,409
going to help me flourish and succeed. So, yeah, I guess that's my responsibility as

416
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:23,750
my self-leader and I've gotten a lot better at that. Like I, I think I used to focus a lot more

417
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:33,489
on shoulds than I do. And I think being a better self-leader, I've, I've over time got rid of that.

418
00:37:33,929 --> 00:37:40,849
So yeah, I think that that would be a big one for sure. Yeah. Great. Positively impacting others

419
00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:45,449
in your environment is something we're seeing as a, as a common dimension or trait for different

420
00:37:45,449 --> 00:37:46,389
leaders. How do you think that's going to impact others in your environment?

421
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:54,210
Think about positively impacting others, Janie. Well, I think, yeah, my favourite, one of my

422
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:58,849
favourite TED Talks is the lollipop moment. I don't know whether you've caught that one, but

423
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:07,489
it's the best. And I talk about this a lot and I try and really live it. It's about,

424
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:13,869
you can have a moment where you do something really simple and it could just be greeting

425
00:38:13,869 --> 00:38:16,309
someone or complimenting someone, or...

426
00:38:16,409 --> 00:38:22,809
Doing something kind for someone. And it has an incredible impact on them that you don't even

427
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:32,170
know or understand. And so, yeah, so that for me is making sure that I'm someone that people enjoy

428
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:38,789
being around and that I actually care about those people and I ask them about themselves and,

429
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:45,190
and I know about them and I remember things that are important to them, I think is how you can have

430
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,389
positive impact. And I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point.

431
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:52,789
We often feel like we have to be a certain someone or in a certain position to do that. And I think

432
00:38:52,789 --> 00:39:00,110
if you watch this TED Talk, what you see is you, you can be anyone, anytime and make a positive

433
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:05,130
impact on your environment. The lollipop moment. I'll check it out. And I love your philosophy

434
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:10,670
there, Janie. It's such a link to so many others. You don't have to be, you know, have a leadership

435
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:15,250
title to have a positive impact. It's, as you said, it's just, it's the greeting, it's the smile,

436
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:15,650
it's the...

437
00:39:16,409 --> 00:39:19,929
Remembering something about someone that they perhaps didn't think you would.

438
00:39:20,469 --> 00:39:23,789
The opportunity is there, isn't it? Every moment to have a positive impact. And

439
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:28,630
sounds like you think about that a lot of... You mentioned about creating a vision. It sounds like

440
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:32,929
this is going to be a sweet spot for you, Janie, looking at what you've done. Can you, can you tell

441
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:36,170
us about how you've gone about creating and sharing your visions?

442
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:46,289
Yeah, I always, things just come to me in really strange ways. Like I, I remember a few years

443
00:39:46,409 --> 00:39:54,489
before I started Undertow Media, I was looking at mum and dad's, this sounds so nerdy, but there's

444
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:59,849
this really big dictionary and it just happened to be open at a page and the word Undertow was there.

445
00:40:00,429 --> 00:40:05,030
And I thought, and the definition that something beneath the surface is stronger than what's above.

446
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:09,710
And I was like, wow, that's really powerful. That's, when I have my business, that's how I

447
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:16,269
want it to be. I just want it to be that whatever we do is so powerful, you know? And so I registered

448
00:40:16,269 --> 00:40:24,269
the business name like three years before I started it. You know, so I just, then when I

449
00:40:24,269 --> 00:40:33,190
have a vision and pull it together, I guess it's also about building visually around that,

450
00:40:33,409 --> 00:40:38,030
how it's going to be in the world. Like that's a really important part for me. I know everyone's

451
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:45,050
different, but for me, I need to see what the brand will look like. I need to see what would

452
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,250
it look like if it's up on a website? I need to see what the brand will look like. I need to see

453
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,570
what the brand will look like if it's up on a billboard, you know, like what does that,

454
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:57,369
yeah, how does it look and how does it feel? And then I can create the plan and the process and

455
00:40:57,369 --> 00:41:01,650
the structure. So it's almost like I need to get that creative bit out of my system.

456
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:07,630
And then I can get down to the things that are probably less exciting, but just as important.

457
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:12,530
So that's for me how I do it. And then I'll share it with people and get their opinion,

458
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,269
which I have to always brace myself for.

459
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:16,190
And you found it different.

460
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:23,170
Clearly from Smiling Mind to what you did with Undertone Media at a young age and what you've

461
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:29,130
done in so many different areas. Have you found that people can get that when you visually paint

462
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:33,269
that that's obviously clear to you? Does it take more explanation or have you found you've been

463
00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:38,489
able to get that across pretty well? I think when you create a visual of how

464
00:41:38,489 --> 00:41:42,949
something will be in the world, it's so much easier for other people to grasp as well and

465
00:41:42,949 --> 00:41:46,110
see your vision. And perhaps that's why I do it because that's probably the most important thing.

466
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:53,590
It's probably what I need as well. So I, you know, and it depends how you learn as well and

467
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:57,190
connect with things, doesn't it? And obviously that's the type of, I'm a visual learner,

468
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:03,230
obviously, but I think, yeah, for me, it helps me talk about it probably with a bit more conviction

469
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:08,090
as well. So hopefully that helps people connect with it also.

470
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:15,050
You mentioned curiosity a lot, and that's another dimension we see is really identifiable in leaders

471
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:16,090
in the 21st century.

472
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:20,670
Style of leadership and then curiosity probably through the lens of approaching learning and

473
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:25,050
development. Can you talk about what curiosity and how you then go about your learning and

474
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:33,369
development? Yeah. So I, my curiosity is my learning and development. I think I've always

475
00:42:33,369 --> 00:42:41,570
done by doing, I call it the school of life. Always people. Yeah. My boys will probably be

476
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:46,090
listening to this and quote it back to me, but I always say when people are thinking of

477
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:52,269
going on to do more study, which I think is, is so valid. And, and obviously my father's an academic.

478
00:42:52,269 --> 00:43:01,710
I respect it greatly, but I also think and say, don't do that at the expense of also what you

479
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:08,489
could learn and experience in the school of life. So I think for me, that's my learning and

480
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:13,869
development. I've done various sort of courses and things, but I love getting involved and doing

481
00:43:13,869 --> 00:43:16,070
things I've never done before. And for me, that's my learning and development. I've done various

482
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:16,090
courses and things, but I love getting involved and doing things I've never done before. And for

483
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:20,809
me, there is no better learning and development than that. Like you just go up the curve so

484
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:27,449
quickly because you're thrown in the deep end. And my curiosity has caused me to want to apply

485
00:43:27,449 --> 00:43:32,769
the skills that I have and what I'm good at to many different things. So whether that's being

486
00:43:32,769 --> 00:43:39,289
on the board of Melbourne football club, you know, and applying what I know about, about business

487
00:43:39,289 --> 00:43:45,570
and wellbeing and marketing and digital to a football club, um, or

488
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:52,949
whether that's, you know, getting involved in a startup in the property space, you know, it just,

489
00:43:53,449 --> 00:44:02,590
it's, I believe being able to apply what you have in your toolkit to something new, um, and also

490
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:07,449
learn a whole new industry and environment is just so valuable from a learning and development

491
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:13,190
point of view. So that's really what I've focused on. And probably to be honest, like I've really

492
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:16,050
focused on my personal development. And so I think that's, I think that's, I think that's

493
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:24,769
and I've probably prioritized that. And I feel like that has been just as powerful in my

494
00:44:24,769 --> 00:44:31,949
professional life, the work I've done on myself, um, and how I've evolved than it has been in my

495
00:44:31,949 --> 00:44:36,789
personal life. Yeah. Brilliant. I was going to get to the Melbourne footy club board, which you

496
00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:42,550
spent five years on and who just won their first premiership after 57 years. Uh, an amazing story.

497
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:46,050
Unfortunately, at the expense of the club that I, uh, was hoping was, uh, was going,

498
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:49,989
but they were amazing in a grand final and what a, what a transition it was after that amount of

499
00:44:49,989 --> 00:44:54,590
time. It's a, it's another great story for, for another time, but it's a diverse range of, uh,

500
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:59,690
of interest that you've had, uh, Janie and applied your skills to a long, uh, over a long period of

501
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:04,050
time. Um, communicating with clarity is something that we talk about a lot, Janie, given you founded

502
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:09,210
a communications business effectively at 25 years of age, how do you approach that?

503
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:15,849
Well, I've actually, it's funny. I started out in communications because it,

504
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:22,590
has been probably the most helpful thing in business because you're communicating with

505
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:30,650
stakeholders all the time. And I think what it taught me was to not only how to communicate

506
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:37,789
clearly and succinctly, but also to think about who I'm communicating to. Cause that's like PR

507
00:45:37,789 --> 00:45:42,849
101, right? It's like, who's the target audience, you know, do your background research. But so

508
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:45,849
often in business, we just kind of,

509
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:50,050
we're so busy and there's so much going on. We don't actually sit back and say,

510
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:57,630
Oh, actually, if I just communicate this message to my team in the same way I am communicating it

511
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:04,909
to my shareholders, that needs a very different approach. Definitely thinking about stakeholder

512
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:09,610
management and target audience and, and understanding that and, and taking the time

513
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:15,090
to really think about the messages that will resonate to different people and how to deliver

514
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:15,630
them better.

515
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:22,090
Um, is, is something that I've, I've been very grateful for my whole career because I've had it

516
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:23,989
in my, in my, um, backpack.

517
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:29,530
Um, collaboration, uh, how important is collaboration to you?

518
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:35,369
I think there's a time and place for collaboration. Like I think I love collaborating and I,

519
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:42,690
I particularly in the not-for-profit space, duplication is one thing that makes me feel

520
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:46,050
like we're just being ineffective with resources that are already there.

521
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:54,630
Quite, you know, well, they're sparing. Um, but I think there's also important to know

522
00:46:54,630 --> 00:47:00,610
what's more powerful to collaborate on and choose that really carefully because I think

523
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:06,050
collaboration is also complex and, you know, pulling multiple parties together,

524
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:11,170
getting them to move in the same direction, getting the results that collectively everyone

525
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:15,829
benefits. So I think it's about choosing where's the power in doing things as a group.

526
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:21,630
And where is there actually power sometimes in doing things more individually, uh, and being

527
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:28,369
quite selective about that? Cause otherwise you just get drawn into a vortex of group think and

528
00:47:28,369 --> 00:47:34,789
doing things by committee, which sometimes that can be the death of the very best ideas.

529
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:40,170
Interesting perspective, you know, because clearly, you know, to get some of the things

530
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:44,469
done you've had, you've had great collaborations and great success, but it clearly there's a part

531
00:47:44,469 --> 00:47:46,050
of you that at the end of the day, you're not going to be the same person. You're not going to

532
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:50,329
when the decision needs to be made as a leader, you're, you're comfortable in, in that, in your

533
00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:55,730
own skin enough to do that regularly. Is that, is that a fair reflection of what you, what you said?

534
00:47:55,929 --> 00:48:02,389
I think so. I think you have to, as a leader, you, and I, I will often, there are key people

535
00:48:02,389 --> 00:48:10,630
in my circle that I will pressure test things with before I make final decisions, especially

536
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:15,590
if they're big ones, but yeah, like I'm, I'm happy to back myself to make a decision. I'm

537
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:16,050
also happy to back myself to make a decision. I'm also happy to back myself to make a decision.

538
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:23,030
I'm also happy to say that was the wrong one and I'm sorry. And what do we do now? That's also the,

539
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:28,110
you know, you don't just get to make decisions and they all work out well. So as long as you

540
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:33,429
realise that and are comfortable with it and you feel like you're solution oriented enough to,

541
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:39,869
if it is the wrong one, work out what you're going to do, then yeah, I think, I think it's a good way

542
00:48:39,869 --> 00:48:45,650
to be and a clear way to lead. Jane, I've got a couple of final questions for you. I've been

543
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:45,829
asking you a lot about the, about the, about the, about the, about the, about the, about the, about

544
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:45,889
the, about the, about the, about the, about the, about the, about the, about the, about the,

545
00:48:46,889 --> 00:48:51,969
who is the greatest leader in your life? To be honest, my kids.

546
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:56,690
Yeah. The three boys. Yeah. What, why, why does that, you thought about it and then you,

547
00:48:56,849 --> 00:49:02,670
you went straight to the kids? Well, I just, because if I look over my life,

548
00:49:02,789 --> 00:49:09,650
the thing I've, I've learnt so many things from so many great people and I could sit here and

549
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:14,489
reel off names of very well-known people that have had a huge impact in my life. And,

550
00:49:15,329 --> 00:49:15,670
um,

551
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:22,090
I'm not taking away from that. But if I look at cumulatively the amount I grow and learn

552
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:31,650
and get, and what makes me better, it is absolutely my boys. And I think, I hope it's

553
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:37,849
also because I've brought them up to say what they think and they call me on stuff constantly.

554
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:45,070
And, you know, and they also give me the opportunity to know myself better and

555
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:52,650
realize that there can be someone who's been around the block way less times, but can actually

556
00:49:52,650 --> 00:50:01,050
be far more wise than I can. And I think that's a really important lesson to understand, especially,

557
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:07,829
you know, when I used to be a 25-year-old know-it-all. I think, you know, it's, it's

558
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:13,750
pretty transformative. So yeah, I, I think, and we underestimate our young people way too much.

559
00:50:13,909 --> 00:50:20,250
Yeah. Way too much. I mean, yeah, my, my boys have said and done some of the most powerful things,

560
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:27,409
you know, that I'm just blown away by, so proud of, but they're not, they're not, you know,

561
00:50:27,409 --> 00:50:32,190
winning best and fairest at footy. They're not getting certain grades. They're, you know,

562
00:50:32,789 --> 00:50:37,550
one of them breaking up with his girlfriend, not coping very well. And

563
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:37,809
same with me.

564
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:45,670
I think I need to see our psychologist. Like that for me was just an amazing leadership moment

565
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:54,750
because I, and I said to him, oh my God, it's taken me 40 years to get to the point where I say,

566
00:50:54,849 --> 00:51:03,789
I need help. And you are, it's just astounding. So, you know, I think if we look a little more to

567
00:51:06,789 --> 00:51:07,670
people that,

568
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:10,949
that are younger than us, I think we can learn so much.

569
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:15,170
What a brilliant story, Jane, isn't it? The mirror up from parenting is such a,

570
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:19,829
an intense thing, isn't it? And if we try and look away from it and, and as you said,

571
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:24,610
the lessons are there and how awesome to have young males in the next generation, as you said,

572
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:29,789
you know, my generation would have been nowhere near the capability of doing that and to understand

573
00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:34,769
that that is actually the strength of being able to work out that clearly we all need help and to

574
00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:37,750
get that at a young age. What a, what a brilliant moment for you to have,

575
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:43,550
in the spirit of, of collaboration, asking this question as well. And I loved your answer before

576
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:47,349
about your sense of self strong enough that you pick and choose your collaboration. But

577
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:51,489
if there was one person in the world you could collaborate with, who would it be?

578
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:55,389
Well, it depends. I mean, it depends whether we're thinking,

579
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:58,909
you know, thinking, I mean, music, it'd be Lady Gaga, obviously.

580
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:07,630
So, you know, I'd love to do a collab with her. I don't know that I bring much,

581
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:11,570
to the table though, Luke, so I don't think we can count that.

582
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,510
I think she would be very happy to get your phone call, Janie,

583
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:15,809
Lady Gaga, if she's listening.

584
00:52:18,389 --> 00:52:21,369
But I'd have to say Brene Brown.

585
00:52:21,949 --> 00:52:25,809
I do have Brene on my vision board and joke with my friends

586
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,670
that we will be besties one day.

587
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:31,650
She's taught me a lot.

588
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:35,789
I feel like, you know, what we could collaborate

589
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:41,610
on would be unbelievable for the world and we'd bring different

590
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:44,730
strengths to the table and I would just love to work with her.

591
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:49,710
I think the message that she has for the world

592
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:52,889
and what she's been able to do through her TED Talks

593
00:52:52,889 --> 00:52:56,650
and then the work since I think is powerful for people personally,

594
00:52:57,429 --> 00:53:00,750
powerful for people in business and the Dare to Lead sort

595
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:01,449
of program.

596
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:05,309
And, you know, for business I think is transformative.

597
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:08,090
So, yeah, she'd definitely be up there with Lady Gaga.

598
00:53:08,449 --> 00:53:09,309
Oh, what a great answer.

599
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:12,389
You know, the power of vulnerability and vulnerability

600
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:15,670
as a strength has had such an impact on so many people.

601
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:16,730
Her work is incredible.

602
00:53:16,869 --> 00:53:19,030
That would be a collaboration I'd like to be in the meeting on.

603
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,849
I understand you're working on something.

604
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:24,130
I'm not sure how much you can let us know, but what's the next venture?

605
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:25,469
Is it in the world as media space?

606
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:26,250
Did I read that correctly?

607
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:31,070
Yes, I've been chipping away at – I had a bolt

608
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:31,630
of inspiration.

609
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:36,150
I had a bolt of inspiration a year or so ago to really bring together –

610
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:39,090
well, one of my best friends describes it as a scalable genie.

611
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:44,750
It's basically an opportunity for people to diagnose

612
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:50,730
where they sit on a wellbeing scale in a science, you know,

613
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:56,369
from an evidence-based perspective, and then from that build basically

614
00:53:56,369 --> 00:54:00,110
a dynamic daily dose of wellbeing content.

615
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:05,650
It's delivered in a really unique way, and it's really – it's pulling content

616
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:08,690
from all around the world, video, audio, you know,

617
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:13,630
excerpts from podcasts, just – and it really is exactly what they need

618
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:17,809
and what we know they need and moves and evolves as they move

619
00:54:17,809 --> 00:54:20,170
up the wellbeing scale.

620
00:54:20,889 --> 00:54:24,329
So, yeah, it's – I'm just tinkering away, but I think, yeah,

621
00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:26,349
it should be in the world fairly soon, so.

622
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:29,769
Given what you have done, yeah, watch this space and watch it quickly

623
00:54:29,769 --> 00:54:31,630
because it seems as though the –

624
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:34,570
the delay between you having a thought and getting something done,

625
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:37,110
it seems very, very quick, and I love it.

626
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:40,269
It's an amazing inspiration to see how you attack things

627
00:54:40,269 --> 00:54:43,289
and your thought process, and I really enjoyed meeting you, Janie.

628
00:54:43,289 --> 00:54:44,929
I heard a lot about you over a long period of time,

629
00:54:44,989 --> 00:54:47,389
and it's been a great honour to have spent some time with you.

630
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,690
Thanks for sharing as openly as you have,

631
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:52,690
and hopefully we can catch up in person at some stage.

632
00:54:52,969 --> 00:54:53,610
Thanks for your time today.

633
00:54:53,889 --> 00:54:55,449
Sounds good. Thanks, Luke. Loved it.

634
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:55,949
Thanks, Janie.
