00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:12,349
How does a single mother at 27 who left high school at just 16

2
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:15,750
go on to create one of Australia's most successful businesses?

3
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:20,309
Why is taking full accountability for all of the decisions you make in your life,

4
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:22,949
both good and bad, set you up for success?

5
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:27,449
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

6
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:31,350
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,109
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

8
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,009
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

9
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:38,750
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,929
in education, sport, industry and the arts

11
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:45,890
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

12
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,369
where everyone has a voice.

13
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:51,929
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:01:10,560
In 2000, with no formal business experience, Janine Ellis opened a juice bar

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,540
along with her husband, Jeff, with a vision to make healthy living tasty and fun.

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,859
Boost has gone on to become one of the most popular and loved juice and smoothies

17
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:24,359
brands in the world with 580 stores and counting in 30, 13 different countries.

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,879
It is an extraordinary entrepreneurial success story.

19
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,180
Janine's expertise has seen her expand the portfolio as executive director

20
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:38,260
at Retail Zoo, which includes now Salsa French Mex, Chibo Espresso and Betty's Burgers.

21
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:44,000
Janine is also a bestselling author, keynote speaker, star of Network 10 Shark Tank,

22
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,980
competitor on Australian Survivor and a mother of four as well.

23
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,920
You've crammed a bit in, Janine.

24
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:54,079
In your lifetime, you'd almost suggest that's five times a lifetime's worth of achievement

25
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,140
in your one life.

26
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:59,980
When you look back and you hear that intro and reflect on your success, what are your thoughts?

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,159
I think it's just, look, I'm a believer that, you know, we've got, as far as we know at this point

28
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,020
and we all have different beliefs, but this is one life and I don't want to go at the end of it

29
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,060
and go, I wish I had of.

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,960
And yeah, and so I think I'm sort of one of these people that's addicted to busy

31
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,099
and I think my heart.

32
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,919
I'm definitely not an entrepreneur at heart, but I definitely am an adventurer at heart.

33
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,979
And, you know, I'm into my 50s now and never felt better and fitter and, you know,

34
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,860
expect to continue to do active, fun things until the day I can't.

35
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:35,699
Love life has been the boost juice motto.

36
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,419
I might come back to that because, you know, you can see the smile on your face.

37
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,539
It feels like you're living that every single day.

38
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,199
But going back to your history, you left school at 16.

39
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:48,379
You went to an old tech school, which for those listening that maybe don't understand,

40
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:51,979
designed really to send people into trades effectively, weren't they?

41
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,780
And they finished in year 11, which is why you were left at 16.

42
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,539
You're a girl from Baronia in the suburbs of Melbourne.

43
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:02,819
You know, it's not the private school, you know, flash uni degree background.

44
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:08,780
You know, to think about that and what are the traits that have set you apart, Janine, from others?

45
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,060
Look, I don't know.

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,520
You know, all I wanted to do when I was a kid was to win the grand final in netball.

47
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,020
You know, I was obsessed with netball and if I could, you know, I played it, you know,

48
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,800
four nights a week and played rep teams.

49
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:19,659
I did all sorts of stuff.

50
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,479
But I definitely wasn't that person that sold lemonade at the lemonade stand.

51
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,060
And to your point, I didn't know anyone who was anyone that was a manager.

52
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,699
We were workers in that area.

53
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,020
And the tech school, as you said, was designed to create trades and workers, not leaders.

54
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,780
There was never a discussion on leadership.

55
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,479
And my parents were definitely in that zone too.

56
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,860
So there was not even a space there that they'd go, right, Janine, you could be a lawyer

57
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,879
or you could run a business.

58
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,919
It was more like, gee, you know, let's make sure you don't go.

59
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:49,460
Go to a factory.

60
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,520
So it was sort of – but the thing is, though, I was one of – I was the last one of four

61
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,360
kids and I sort of just was one of those ones that sort of ducked and weaved with the other

62
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,699
kids and really all I wanted to do was travel.

63
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:07,139
I just wanted to, as soon as I possibly can, get out of Australia and see the big wide

64
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:08,979
world, which is what I did at 21.

65
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah, and you did that at 21 and, you know, incredible chapter of your life.

66
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,060
I think you went, from what I understand, Janine, with Camp Australia and you ended

67
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,920
up staying for six years.

68
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:23,459
And maybe fast-tracking that story slightly, but you arrived back in Melbourne then, 27

69
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:24,399
years of age.

70
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:25,620
You're a single mum.

71
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,360
You've got, you know, a two-year-old boy.

72
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:33,540
From there, you know, to really one of Australia's most successful businesswomen ever, that is

73
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,120
a long road it feels at 27.

74
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,360
You have to move back in to mum and dad's house in Baronia.

75
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:42,120
I mean, what advice would you give to someone who wants to have a go like you did?

76
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:48,459
I think the thing that kills people is their own thought process and how they think about

77
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:48,759
life.

78
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:52,699
And they limit themselves on what they think they're capable of.

79
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,060
Actually, one of the interesting things of doing Survivor is that's what I sort of discovered.

80
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,819
You know, here I am, I think I was 54 at the time, up against, you know, elite athletes

81
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:04,160
and footballers, like, you know, probably you know most of them.

82
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,339
And yet, I'd sit there and I'd be doing a challenge and they'd be dropping like flies.

83
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,980
I'm going, mate, guys, hey, I'm 54.

84
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,800
What are you doing?

85
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,459
And it wasn't that I was, my muscles were stronger or I was better.

86
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,879
It's just that in your head, you just kind of, I think the body gives up so much.

87
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,500
And I think that does that in life, too.

88
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,920
I think we are so, we can't because of, I'm not smart enough, I'm not educated enough,

89
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:29,180
I'm not good enough.

90
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,000
And I think that self-taught is probably our detriment.

91
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:40,600
I think the greatest skill I had growing up and not having any exposure to anyone with

92
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,240
business was I never had a barrier.

93
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,120
I was completely naive.

94
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:46,560
I didn't know what the hell I was doing, so I just did it.

95
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,399
And that was, and I think traveling.

96
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,439
I think you brushed over it, but traveling seven years on my own and eventually becoming

97
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,480
the single mom overseas, that's what happens when you travel, it's all sorts of trouble.

98
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,860
You had to just solve problems.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,519
And I think even in that situation where I can't speak another language and back then

100
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:09,939
half the countries I went to didn't speak English, you just work it out.

101
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,420
And I think that when I came back to Australia, it was just another, let's work it out.

102
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:18,779
And when I came back to Australia as a single mom, living back in,

103
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,480
after working for David Bowie and hanging out at the Cannes Film Festival and the Monaco

104
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,759
Grand Prix and all these exciting things, suddenly a single mom back in the burbs was a bit of

105
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,120
a, huh, here we go again.

106
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,839
And I think that's the other thing is quite often, as you said, I'd left school at 16.

107
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,519
I've never had a university degree.

108
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,379
The only thing I'm qualified for is a bit like your wife as a yoga instructor.

109
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,519
Not that I'm sure Beck's more qualified than me, but that's the only certificate I've ever

110
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:44,879
got.

111
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:48,420
So, so really, you know,

112
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:54,000
I think the meaning of life is learning and learning doesn't end when you're at school.

113
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,160
In actual fact, learning begins when you leave school because you've actually got to focus

114
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,019
on what you want to learn.

115
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:02,439
And, you know, that's why, you know, podcasts like this are great because people can go,

116
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,420
can actually hopefully inspire them to start to think differently.

117
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:10,220
You know, Luke, I have, I think there's two people in the world and I think that two types

118
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:10,819
of people in the world.

119
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,720
And I think we, every human can go into either categories.

120
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,339
I think you can either choose to be a verb or you can choose to soar.

121
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:20,079
Now, a verb is someone who's a victim.

122
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,680
They're entitled.

123
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,100
You know, I've been in this job 10 years.

124
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,819
I need a promotion.

125
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:26,379
They need to be rescued.

126
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,579
They always come to us for, you know, this has gone wrong.

127
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,060
Help me.

128
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:33,879
And they blame the world for their woes, which is pretty much every politician that's out

129
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,339
there at the moment.

130
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,300
And then the other people at the moment, and this is where we need to aim for, you know,

131
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,920
and this is what I think is the crust of leadership is soaring.

132
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,319
You know, you're solution based.

133
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,060
Your shit happens.

134
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,560
That's okay.

135
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:47,939
Right.

136
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:51,579
In actual fact, things are going, if things aren't going wrong, you're not trying hard

137
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:51,860
enough.

138
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,259
So really it's about solution base.

139
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,459
It's, you know, and that's what I learned traveling overseas because, you know, we haven't

140
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:02,839
got time to go through some of the stories, but I got myself as a young, naive girl into

141
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,560
all sorts of pickles.

142
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,199
And so, you know, so solution base, it's ownership.

143
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,060
You know, I think that as a leader, we love it when people come to us and say, I made

144
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,120
a mistake, right?

145
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,660
It was, it was me, right?

146
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,860
I'm going to take ownership for it and I'm accountable for the outcome.

147
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,360
So this is what we're going to do about it.

148
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:23,600
It's a solution based and I'm responsible for whatever comes from it.

149
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,259
So it's, and that's what leaders do.

150
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,879
Leaders go, Hey, it's me.

151
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,860
And this is what we're going to do about it.

152
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,759
And even in our communication, you know, quite often when we get an email, it's a negative

153
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,159
email.

154
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,519
The first thing we want to do is sort of approach it as a sore.

155
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,019
Like I'll be, I'm hurt.

156
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,419
You know, you've hurt my feelings.

157
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,960
I'm a victim, you know, instead of just going, okay, solution based, let's just attack it

158
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,399
that way.

159
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,820
And truly, I know it's simple.

160
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,840
But truly, if you can, whenever you have the verb thought, if you change it to the

161
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,700
sore thought, life changes.

162
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,059
It just does.

163
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:56,700
Yeah.

164
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,279
It's a great message.

165
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,399
Great life lesson, Janine, that you've articulated there.

166
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,100
And I have heard those words from you and in research for our chat today, that idea

167
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,700
of being accountable for everything in your life, good and bad is a common theme away.

168
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,860
It seems you've approached your life.

169
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:14,740
And, you know, we hear that with a lot of the great leaders we're speaking to, Janine.

170
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,580
And they, radical responsibility is a term that, you know,

171
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,700
we hear a lot and that idea that you put your hand up, you accept the good and bad

172
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,820
and that's how you learn it and you move on.

173
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:28,679
I mean, why has that been so important to you and where did it come from?

174
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,700
Has it always been part of you?

175
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,519
I think if you think that you know everything and that nothing goes wrong, it's always someone

176
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,600
else's fault, you actually can't go to the next level and learn.

177
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,539
I think one of the seven most deadly words in business is we've always done it that way.

178
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,519
And if you, I actually think that every single day,

179
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,559
if something goes wrong, it's always someone else's fault.

180
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,679
If there's something in my life I need to improve.

181
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,879
Now, is it my health?

182
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,320
In business, is it a process?

183
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,700
Is it, you know, whatever we do.

184
00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:01,419
So if every day there's something I do better, then it can only go in one way.

185
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,879
And, you know, of course, a life is not, you know, in one direction.

186
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:08,419
You know, you have, it's like a car ride, you know, particularly with me,

187
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,700
because I have a terrible sense of direction.

188
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:12,779
There's a few U-turns, there's a few wrong turns.

189
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,620
But as long as you have the destination, you can always get there.

190
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,460
And I think that,

191
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:20,139
particularly with solutions,

192
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,480
and I think, I don't know whether you get older

193
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,940
and you just become a little bit more,

194
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,480
the more knowledge you know, the more you know you don't know.

195
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,580
But I truly believe, as I said before,

196
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:31,039
it's the meaning of life is, you know, just learning.

197
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:33,799
And you can only learn by acknowledging you get things wrong.

198
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,019
And we often hear, you know, about that great leaders like you, Janine,

199
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,340
talking about constant, never-ending self-improvement

200
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,360
in every area of their life

201
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,820
and the love of wanting to keep learning and collaborating.

202
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:46,519
As you said, I want to go back to your two types of people you mentioned.

203
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,139
You know, the verbs,

204
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,940
who are the victim mentality

205
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,460
and those that choose to soar and solve problems.

206
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,519
I mean, you employ thousands of people now

207
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,539
across the businesses you're involved in.

208
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,360
How do you do?

209
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,059
I mean, clearly, you're going to have categories of people

210
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,279
that are in that victim mentality.

211
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,200
What do you do?

212
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,899
Do you avoid them?

213
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,220
Do you try not to employ them?

214
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,679
Do you try and coach them?

215
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:07,440
What's your model there?

216
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,919
I think at the end of the day,

217
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:13,360
you try and hire them, first and foremost.

218
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,580
It's a bit like, you know,

219
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,620
that, you know, get the right people on the right bus, you know.

220
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:22,019
So, and I deliberately ask questions at interviews

221
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,039
to try and see if they're a verb or a saw.

222
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,500
And I know my husband once,

223
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,940
he hired a recent accountant in another business, Jeff Scott.

224
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:33,299
And she was on the phone

225
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:37,399
and she immediately said all the things which a verb would say.

226
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:39,419
And him and I just looked at each other and went,

227
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,879
oh, whoops, got that one wrong.

228
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,200
And we thought, no, no, it'll be fine.

229
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,899
And sure enough, it always ends poorly.

230
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,960
Look, often, sometimes people can change.

231
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,259
Sometimes people can learn if they really have self-aware.

232
00:11:55,539 --> 00:12:00,080
But I think mostly it takes a long time for a verb to become a saw.

233
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,259
And look, and I can absolutely tell you

234
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:03,580
that I have been a verb in the past.

235
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,200
Absolutely.

236
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,360
We all have, you know.

237
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,980
But I think the good thing about it is because I'm aware of it,

238
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,159
I can actually hear it as it comes out of my mouth.

239
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,940
And sometimes, you know, Janine, interesting,

240
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,940
that perception versus reality.

241
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,000
People listen to this and,

242
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,460
and you see the end result

243
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,840
and you see the success of Boost Juice

244
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,480
and you see you loving life as the mantra goes.

245
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,820
But along the way, clearly there's all sorts of challenges.

246
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,019
I read that you woke up one morning,

247
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,759
you might've been a handful of years into Boost Juice

248
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,000
and you find yourself on the young BOW rich list

249
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,480
with a net worth of 30 million or something like that.

250
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:37,919
But in reality, you know,

251
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,379
Boost Juice is fighting for its cashflow

252
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:41,299
and fighting for its survival.

253
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,679
How have you dealt with those challenges along the way?

254
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:46,639
What's been the attitude that's got you through them?

255
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,139
Um, I think when you're in it,

256
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,659
like when you're in that moment,

257
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,279
like, you know, when we've had, you know,

258
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,100
say bad media for whatever reason,

259
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,139
or you, you know, there's, you know,

260
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,639
there's a cashflow issue or whatever happens in business

261
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,179
or, or God forbid a pandemic, a real pandemic

262
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:03,679
that means you have to shut all your doors.

263
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,940
You have little problems like that.

264
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:07,399
Um, I think you're just in it.

265
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,860
So you're not thinking about, um,

266
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,000
you're not thinking about, you know,

267
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,659
the future or the past.

268
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,419
At that moment, you just have to solve the problem.

269
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:17,840
And apparently what I do,

270
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,360
the first thing I do is I put my hair in a ponytail.

271
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,500
So it must be my wall, like, right,

272
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,879
hair's in a ponytail, it's out of my face.

273
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,159
Now let's solve this problem.

274
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,360
And, you know, I think that if, if you had told me,

275
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,220
you know, five years ago, Luke, and said,

276
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:32,019
um, okay, in three years time,

277
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,620
there's going to be a pandemic

278
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,379
and the whole world is going to shut down

279
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,200
and your, every single store that you have

280
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,059
will have to close.

281
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,720
You would have just gone,

282
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,059
oh my God, there's no way out of that.

283
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:43,740
Like there is, I can solve problems.

284
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,980
I can't solve this one.

285
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,379
And yet we've,

286
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,279
we've lived through the worst case scenario

287
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,639
of every business, you know,

288
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:50,700
and look, unfortunately,

289
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:52,159
some business haven't survived it.

290
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,100
But I think that end of the day though,

291
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:58,679
you just work through problems as they occur.

292
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,240
And we've never had problems

293
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,600
like we've had in the last two years

294
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,759
that we've actually worked through.

295
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:03,980
And, and I've got to say,

296
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,039
I've been so proud of the team that,

297
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:09,519
you know, I'm on board a number of boards

298
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,139
and the amount of people who've stepped up

299
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:14,320
in the last two years in leadership

300
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,279
and really, you know,

301
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:18,120
have gotten businesses through

302
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,700
has been actually quite extraordinary.

303
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,159
Can I delve into that a little,

304
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,159
a little bit deeper, Janine?

305
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,039
And clearly there'll be some of it that is,

306
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,460
you know, Retail Zoo and Boost Juice IP.

307
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,100
So not specifically going there,

308
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:31,500
but stores close,

309
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,000
the ponytail's up and you're on.

310
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:36,059
What are the first handful of things

311
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:37,740
that you do in that scenario?

312
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,340
You know, like everyone

313
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,519
who had their businesses closed,

314
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,500
no one really had a model for that

315
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,220
or had thought about that in the past.

316
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,080
What are the first few calls that you make?

317
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:47,480
Well, the only thing you can do,

318
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:49,580
obviously you get your key executives together, right?

319
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,820
So no one, and the reality is

320
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,340
no one person will have an answer.

321
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:56,779
So it really is getting your smart people

322
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:57,899
that you've hired and you trust.

323
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,779
You set them, everyone sits around

324
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:02,639
and they go, okay, how are we going to solve this?

325
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,759
And what are the solutions?

326
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,759
And you get all the key stakeholders,

327
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:06,620
the directors, everything.

328
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:09,360
And it's, and you have crisis meetings,

329
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,620
which has became a regular daily occurrence.

330
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,240
And you just, you just,

331
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,080
look at, you can only make decisions

332
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,480
on the information that you have at that moment.

333
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,679
So you get all the information you can,

334
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,940
you get as many experts as you can to talk to,

335
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,460
and you make the best possible decision

336
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,279
you can at the time.

337
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,879
And that's all anyone can do.

338
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:31,799
And then as day, and look,

339
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,720
as we've known these last two years,

340
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:34,860
things change rapidly.

341
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,659
I mean, we pick up the paper and it's two days old.

342
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,360
You go, well, I can't, can't even look at that

343
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,320
because it's the data's all, all, all, all old.

344
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,299
So that's all you're doing is,

345
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,600
and that's what anyone can do,

346
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,059
whether you're in a pandemic or not,

347
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:49,899
is you look at the information that you have

348
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:52,019
and you make the best possible decision

349
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,279
you can with the informational hand.

350
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,220
Information changes, decisions are wrong.

351
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,899
That's okay.

352
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,139
Just adjust, adapt, and keep going.

353
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,419
But the only thing is,

354
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,460
and I think you, you, you touched on it.

355
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,759
You have to have good people in the first place.

356
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,860
And quite often what you'd find,

357
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,559
and I don't know if you've been into in,

358
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:13,620
in life, life and death situations

359
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,179
or critical situations,

360
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,360
the people that you think are the strongest

361
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,700
and the ones that have it together often aren't.

362
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:22,879
And often it's a quiet person in the corner

363
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:24,419
that really comes to the forefront

364
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:25,919
and is, becomes a hero.

365
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:30,580
Yeah, it's a, it's a fascinating insight there as well, Janine.

366
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,299
And I think listening to you

367
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:33,860
and the ladies we're talking to,

368
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,139
when you're actually open to listening to,

369
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,120
you know, people, no matter, as you said,

370
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:39,659
it might be the quiet person in the corner,

371
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,000
but if they haven't got a voice

372
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,559
and don't feel like they can share it,

373
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,460
then you probably miss out on that, that opportunity.

374
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,220
And it sounds like you do a great job

375
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,100
in your environment of capturing that.

376
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,159
I wanted to talk about, you know,

377
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,240
going back to your story.

378
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,740
And to me, it is, it's an incredible story regardless,

379
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:59,120
but then I take it as a female entrepreneur

380
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,000
and, you know, the home you grew up in,

381
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,700
your mum was a proud housewife

382
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,480
and I've heard you talk about your grandma before.

383
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,140
And, you know, she would have, as you said,

384
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,660
you know, trying to keep you out of the factory,

385
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,099
but certainly never would have thought

386
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,680
that it was possible that you'd run your own business

387
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,619
or be a leader the way that you are.

388
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,559
Have you seen the influence that you've had

389
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:16,940
on particularly young females

390
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,559
who are following the path that you've cut?

391
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,380
I mean, can you share some stories of what that's meant

392
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,019
and the sort of people you've influenced?

393
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,339
Yeah, it's quite humbling actually,

394
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,079
because, you know, if I do a keynote

395
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,339
or I'm in the street and someone comes up to me

396
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:34,099
and sometimes it's quite, you know, quite surprising

397
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:36,500
that, oh, because of you, I did this

398
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,460
or thank you for the inspiration

399
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,480
and men and women actually, in fairness.

400
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,859
But so, and really when I started,

401
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,380
there wasn't many women, any women really,

402
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:46,619
or very few women

403
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:49,579
that were actually founders of businesses.

404
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:52,339
So you were kind of the first one

405
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:53,500
that sort of got it started.

406
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,799
So, and so, yeah, no, it is a hard one

407
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:01,299
because, you know, it depends on where they come from.

408
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,140
Sometimes it's from Survivor and they go,

409
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,799
oh my God, you can't believe that, you know,

410
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,960
a woman over 50 could do that stuff.

411
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:09,259
I mean, neither could I.

412
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,059
And then other times it's from Boost

413
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,480
or other times it's from Shark Tank.

414
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,539
So it's a really interesting mix.

415
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:19,099
Of people who sort of do sort of tap you on the shoulder

416
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,059
and go, gee, thanks.

417
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,819
But I think it's interesting because it's never set.

418
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:26,079
I'm never comfortable with it because I feel like saying,

419
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,220
oh, trust me, I seriously get things wrong.

420
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,660
I mean, one of the things, you know,

421
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,680
I made a great friendship of Pia Miranda on Survivor

422
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,539
and she'll always say one of the things she loves about me

423
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:40,640
is because I'm absolutely goofy and I make up words.

424
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,640
And so, and I'm making mistakes all the time.

425
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,539
So, you know, that you're not,

426
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:47,180
you're not perfect, you're completely flawed.

427
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,740
So it is, but I do just embrace life.

428
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,079
I want to live my best possible life.

429
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,680
And, you know, as we were talking a bit earlier

430
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,960
before we started, you know,

431
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,819
that included moving to New South Wales.

432
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:01,819
Yeah, and we were talking briefly before

433
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:03,900
about some of your daily routines

434
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,900
and I know you've had a great passion for yoga.

435
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,200
You've crossed over with my wife, Bec,

436
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,200
had a few yoga retreats in the past.

437
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:12,019
Can you share a little bit of that,

438
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,099
the daily routines and habits that have enabled you

439
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:18,059
at, you know, 54 years of age to go on Survivor

440
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,299
and knock over all the ex-athletes

441
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:22,119
who couldn't cope along the way?

442
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,299
What are some of those routines

443
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:24,839
that keep you strong and healthy?

444
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,519
Look, nothing crazy.

445
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,579
Like I look at these people that run kilometers

446
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:32,660
or literally appear to all these crazy fitness people.

447
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,880
But, you know, I think yoga and I think Bec would agree with me

448
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,039
is incredibly holistic, body, mind, spirit,

449
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,220
every muscle is you.

450
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:44,660
So it's an incredible sort of sport.

451
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:45,880
It's an activity.

452
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,059
I don't know what you would call it.

453
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,079
And I didn't take it up until I was 40.

454
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,799
And so I was pretty much insane from 30 to having babies,

455
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:55,660
doing the business from 30 to 40.

456
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:58,440
So I didn't take up anything until then

457
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,299
because I didn't have the time.

458
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,319
So it was really at 40 I took it up

459
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:03,079
and I took up a style called Ashtanga.

460
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:06,259
So I do yoga.

461
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,839
One of the things I wanted to do was

462
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,680
I wanted to get wet every day in the ocean.

463
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:13,099
I find the ocean is incredibly therapeutic.

464
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:13,400
It's therapeutic.

465
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,500
And so...

466
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:16,619
It was difficult to do that in Melbourne.

467
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:19,920
So my sister lives in New South Wales

468
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,799
in the Northern Beaches.

469
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,579
So we moved to the Northern Beaches

470
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:24,380
and every day I will either swim

471
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,579
or I will surf in the ocean.

472
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:27,799
And I'm a terrible surfer,

473
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,839
but I'm determined to get better at it.

474
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:32,619
And there is just joy that comes

475
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:33,779
from getting out of the ocean.

476
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:36,539
And, you know, there's a great documentary on grounding,

477
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,880
which is all about, you know, being close to the earth.

478
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:41,180
And I think as I get older, you know,

479
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,240
I definitely want the stimulation of business

480
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,619
and the mental stimulation,

481
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,480
but I really want to be strong and fit

482
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,799
and, you know, believe that, you know,

483
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:52,619
you know, one of the...

484
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,559
Aging is something you can control.

485
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,180
You know, one of the things I love is surfing in the ocean

486
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,940
and there's women that's 60 and 70 surfing with me.

487
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,539
It's awesome.

488
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,140
Sounds like an idyllic start to the day.

489
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,440
And I think you've just jumped out of the water,

490
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,880
you know, this morning before our chat.

491
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,220
And, you know, I love that you always seem to find a way

492
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,440
to make those things happen.

493
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,099
And I suppose just touching a little bit,

494
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,200
and we have briefly as well,

495
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,019
but a mother of four as well,

496
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:17,279
there'll be a lot of people listening to that

497
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:19,319
and saying, that's not possible.

498
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,319
I mean, how do you do that?

499
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:22,880
Does something have to give?

500
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,940
I mean, what was your process in managing,

501
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,660
you know, incredibly crazy, busy life

502
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,079
and having the success and the family life at the same time?

503
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,680
Often poorly.

504
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:36,579
You know, I was definitely the mother that, you know,

505
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,019
never knew what the kids were doing at school, right?

506
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,920
My kids always went to school in the wrong uniform.

507
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:43,480
You know, when you rock up to school and you get a car park,

508
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:43,839
you go, oh my God,

509
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,480
I've got a car park and the school wasn't on.

510
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:46,099
That was me.

511
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,319
You know, so, you know, I was, it was a shocker sometimes.

512
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,819
But, you know, and I remember once, you know,

513
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,740
because one thing everyone,

514
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,420
anyone who's listened to this and have adult children,

515
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,259
they know that there's a point where your children sit in front of you

516
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:02,220
and to say, let me tell you all the things you did wrong.

517
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,440
And I wanted my son to say,

518
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:07,319
because I went out with him and said, okay, give it to me.

519
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:08,579
And he said, you weren't present.

520
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:10,759
You were there in body, but you weren't in mind.

521
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:11,859
And he was probably fair enough.

522
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,819
And, you know, but I think the one,

523
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:16,519
the one thing that you can't do is, is guilt.

524
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,519
You know, I, I think that guilt is completely overrated.

525
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,740
For me, I am a happier mother, wife, person, if I'm working.

526
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,720
And I, so I don't feel guilty about it.

527
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,119
And did I do things, could I have done things better?

528
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:32,859
Absolutely.

529
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,339
I mean, I have the best bad parent stories.

530
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,579
But at the end of the day, I sit in front of my kids.

531
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,460
We play cards.

532
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:40,859
Everyone digs each other.

533
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,660
And, and that's probably the only time I feel truly,

534
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:46,259
truly successful is when my kids are all there

535
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:48,099
and everyone likes and wants to be there.

536
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:49,299
You know, you see here,

537
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:51,279
these horror stories of incredibly successful,

538
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,420
so-called successful people on paper in dollars terms.

539
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,160
And the family is dysfunctional

540
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,000
and they're suing each other for money.

541
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,180
It's revolting.

542
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,619
But I, but I truly say I have four great humans.

543
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,140
And, and they, and one's a full-on hippie.

544
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:09,460
I mean, that kills his own food to eat.

545
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,579
I mean, who, who knew Luke that roadkill was just roadkill?

546
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:13,779
Apparently that's a steak.

547
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,200
Who knew, right?

548
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,799
And then equally, I've got an entrepreneur

549
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:20,819
who is smashing it, killing it as a YouTuber.

550
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,539
So, you know, you just, and you know,

551
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:25,900
with your kids, how completely different they are.

552
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:28,900
And in some respects, you're just basically feeding them

553
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,200
and guiding them.

554
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:32,480
And really, you haven't really got much input

555
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,420
in how they turn out.

556
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,140
Yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a great thought.

557
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,759
Again, I've got the words of,

558
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,680
I interviewed Scotty Pape, the Barefoot Investor recently,

559
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,440
you know, as a, as a different leader.

560
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:43,819
His, his line is tread your own path.

561
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,359
And, and, you know, if you're trying to be someone else,

562
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,680
then you're going to fail at that, you know, clearly.

563
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,500
And clearly you knew what was going to make you happy.

564
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,000
And that, you know, that parenting guilt

565
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,720
is an interesting thing.

566
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,160
I think all of us at some point have that, isn't it?

567
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,220
You know, are you getting that?

568
00:23:57,619 --> 00:23:58,539
Am I working too much?

569
00:23:58,579 --> 00:23:59,519
Am I away too much?

570
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,940
But I think to me that, that you articulate it beautifully.

571
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,480
If you, if you're not filling yourself up properly first,

572
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,200
you're really never going to be the parent you want to be

573
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,619
at any stage, isn't it?

574
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,980
And I'm with you, isn't it?

575
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,680
Same DNA, same environment.

576
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:12,960
Yeah.

577
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,019
Yeah.

578
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:13,059
Yeah.

579
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:13,079
Yeah.

580
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:13,099
Yeah.

581
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:13,140
Yeah.

582
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,180
Yeah.

583
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,200
Yeah.

584
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,220
Yeah.

585
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,279
The, the, the, the, the quirky twists that come out

586
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,880
are sometimes hard to believe, aren't they?

587
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:17,660
Yeah.

588
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,160
Oh, totally.

589
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,700
The other thing I truly believe in,

590
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,759
this is what Jeff and I did, was if mum and dad are solid,

591
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,420
like if they're, if their relationship's really good,

592
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,319
then the family's good.

593
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,799
And so people sort of sometimes go,

594
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:29,079
I can't get away from my kids.

595
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:30,039
I can't leave them.

596
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,619
And I, and we never celebrated our anniversary,

597
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,420
but every year we made sure we went away

598
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,400
for at least four days.

599
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,660
And whether that was a health retreat or a holiday

600
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,359
or whatever, but we went away.

601
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,519
And we, so we never really did date nights,

602
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,140
but we made sure that at least,

603
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,960
once a year we would go away as a couple.

604
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:45,500
Yeah.

605
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:47,160
And I think we, we share that in common.

606
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,339
I was a big driver of that in the early days.

607
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,579
We'd be with four kids like you.

608
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,200
And I remember her, you know,

609
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,299
in tears all the way to the airport the first time we,

610
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,220
you know, we left them.

611
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,160
And now I think she cries on the way home.

612
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:57,740
Oh yeah.

613
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:58,839
We've got to come back.

614
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,079
So it's true, isn't it?

615
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:01,039
Oh, that's because you've got teenagers.

616
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,519
Yeah, exactly.

617
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,579
But you're making that time as you're right.

618
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:06,539
If, if, if you're solid on the home front,

619
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:08,839
I think maybe that is one of the pieces of the puzzle

620
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:11,559
that perhaps works better than others.

621
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,000
Hey, Jen, I want to do,

622
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,119
Just one more thing on that, Luke,

623
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:18,119
is that, you know, I know your wife,

624
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,819
she's gorgeous and nice and smart

625
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:20,640
and she's got all the bits.

626
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,759
The one thing you can't get wrong in life,

627
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,640
out of all the things you can get wrong,

628
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,079
don't get your partner wrong.

629
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,299
Yeah, because that, if you,

630
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,720
because, you know, there's times when,

631
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:34,819
you know, you're frantic and she's frantic

632
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:37,039
and you want someone to push you in the back,

633
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:37,740
pushing you forward,

634
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,380
not grabbing you, dragging you back.

635
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:42,940
And you can really get through anything

636
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,119
if you're a good partner.

637
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:43,819
If you've got the right partner.

638
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:46,579
And I think that's what I'm instilling in my kids is get,

639
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:47,920
I don't care what you get wrong,

640
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,500
do not get the partner wrong.

641
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:50,740
In actual fact, I'm at the point

642
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,299
where I believe in arranged marriages.

643
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:54,140
I think I should pick them.

644
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,700
They don't agree with me, but I think I should.

645
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,200
I love how you cut through, Janine,

646
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:02,559
and you go to places others ask.

647
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,079
And you know what, I completely agree with you.

648
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,279
And I feel lucky.

649
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,779
I feel lucky at one sense,

650
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,920
the randomness of meeting your partner

651
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,759
and then genuinely still being in love with them

652
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:14,140
and love hanging out with them.

653
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,599
And you know, I say to, you know,

654
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,500
but we could have fun.

655
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,480
We don't have to go far.

656
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:19,119
We could go up the road to Bacchus Marsh

657
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,279
or over to Bali, which doesn't matter.

658
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:22,720
We just like spending time together.

659
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:24,839
But I also know we put a lot of time

660
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,880
into making sure we do like spending time together.

661
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,039
And I've lots of friends who have got success

662
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,720
in other areas, but don't,

663
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:34,279
haven't ever put that same amount of time

664
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:34,960
into their partner.

665
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,559
And I'm with you.

666
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,099
It's the thing that, what would you regret the most?

667
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,519
Either finding the wrong partner

668
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:42,700
and you see the pain that that ends up causing people,

669
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,240
or having the right partner,

670
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:45,579
but not putting enough time into it.

671
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:47,599
It may be the greatest tragedy you could have, you know?

672
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,960
So I think it's good advice.

673
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,940
And you're right, isn't it?

674
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,400
Our oldest is 18.

675
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,599
The next chapter is them finding their own partners.

676
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,380
It's probably as big a call as you can make,

677
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,079
I think, as you said.

678
00:26:57,619 --> 00:26:57,940
Yeah.

679
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:00,140
I mean, it really dictates happiness, really.

680
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,359
Is that one decision will dictate, you know, pretty much.

681
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,599
And it's, hey, it's a quick way to lose half your wealth too.

682
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,799
That's right.

683
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,640
And all that comes with it, isn't it?

684
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,519
It's still a nuclear event, you know,

685
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:12,400
at that age we've seen,

686
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,920
great friends of ours separate.

687
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,039
It's nuclear, isn't it?

688
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,859
Even the ones that are separating.

689
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:18,319
On every level.

690
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:18,660
Yeah, it's huge.

691
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:19,500
On every level.

692
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:20,519
Great point.

693
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:23,000
Janine, we're talking to and really enjoying

694
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,819
a diverse range of leaders.

695
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:26,839
And I love your story in every sense

696
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,019
and how authentic you are.

697
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,420
But we're seeing there's similar traits that define leaders

698
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,859
and dimensions of great leadership.

699
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,759
And keen to ask you about it.

700
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,940
So please expand, Janine, as much as you like on these.

701
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,680
But self-leadership is the first trait.

702
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,359
When I ask you about self-leadership,

703
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,140
what do you think of?

704
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,839
What do you mean when you say self-leadership?

705
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,380
What do you mean?

706
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,960
It's a good, well, I mean, for me,

707
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:53,619
it means how you look after yourself

708
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:56,140
and your thought about how you improve yourself

709
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,380
and what you do as your own sense of self.

710
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,539
I think starting as a leader,

711
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:01,599
if you haven't got a sense of that,

712
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,339
it's hard to impact others.

713
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,619
So I think we see that as being the place to start.

714
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,680
Does that make sense?

715
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,319
You know, I leave collaborative.

716
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,960
I don't, people don't work for me.

717
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:15,940
They work with me.

718
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:18,740
And I'm very, and I'm very much,

719
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:21,059
and I'd like to think that I'm a big listener,

720
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,099
but ultimately they know that, you know,

721
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:25,319
you've got to at some point make this decision and move on.

722
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,599
But very collaboratively, I would say,

723
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,819
and I really hate the word, you work for me.

724
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,640
Because I just think that to achieve anything,

725
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:37,180
you need a team and collectively,

726
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:39,480
everyone contributes to that outcome.

727
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:42,059
You know, I've never really sort of thought

728
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:45,960
about you just at that stage, just doing, you know, pretty,

729
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:48,500
as I said, I was, you know, for the first 10 years,

730
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:51,180
it was just hanging on for the ride and working it out,

731
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,519
getting it wrong, picking myself up, dusting yourself off.

732
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:55,559
I mean, there was one point where I sat down and said,

733
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,599
when was the last time I ate?

734
00:28:58,099 --> 00:28:59,279
And I think it was four days.

735
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,019
Because you're just so, you know,

736
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,880
you're in that adrenaline stage of fight and flight all the time

737
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,019
because you're just cheating yourself, really.

738
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,640
Well, I think it comes out really naturally in you, Janine.

739
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:11,680
Yeah.

740
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:13,759
Whether you had a sense of self at the time,

741
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:15,099
even when you're starting out around,

742
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:18,180
I'm going to authentically lead the way that I am.

743
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:20,660
And if I did, and that's sort of a real community,

744
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,480
talking about collaboration, I'll ask you about that,

745
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,019
you know, in a moment.

746
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,859
But I think, you know, people get found out really quickly

747
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:28,420
when they're not being authentically themselves.

748
00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:30,920
And the people working with you, you know,

749
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:33,339
the sporting coaches that I speak to a lot, Janine,

750
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:35,579
you know, the players pick up in a nanosecond

751
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:37,480
if the leader in front of them is not authentic.

752
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,359
And clearly you knew that with your own sense of style.

753
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:40,420
Yeah.

754
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:41,119
Yeah.

755
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:41,140
Yeah.

756
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,160
Yeah.

757
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,180
Yeah.

758
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:41,200
Yeah.

759
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,240
Yeah.

760
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,259
Yeah.

761
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:41,279
Yeah.

762
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:41,299
Yeah.

763
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:41,359
Yeah.

764
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:41,380
Yeah.

765
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:41,400
Yeah.

766
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:43,160
Yeah.

767
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,180
Yeah.

768
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:43,299
Yeah.

769
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:45,559
Yeah.

770
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:45,920
Yeah.

771
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,440
Yeah.

772
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:46,539
Yeah.

773
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:46,759
Yeah.

774
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:46,880
Yeah.

775
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,599
You get the chance to impact thousands of people

776
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:51,220
with the success of Boost Juice

777
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,039
and your other ventures with retailers.

778
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,460
Do you consciously think about the impact you have

779
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,599
on others in the environment?

780
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,160
No.

781
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,680
No, honestly, don't consciously think about it.

782
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,019
Right.

783
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:03,019
You just do, really.

784
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,740
And, you know, it's a bit like even we started the business,

785
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,359
you know, we didn't sort of go, okay,

786
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,660
let's make it worth this much money.

787
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,700
we just figured that if we did the right thing today then the outcome would be the right outcome

788
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:23,420
so you know i you know i think just by you know gotta remember back at when we had boosts at the

789
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:27,339
start we had no money so the only way and i was a publicist so i knew how to you know understood

790
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:34,240
how media worked so it i put myself as the face of it because that was how we got people to know

791
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,559
about the brand and then that kind of just led one thing to another and it opened up opportunities

792
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:44,039
whether it was shark tank or survivor or you know a celebrity apprentice you know and i i'm a um

793
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:48,119
positively skewed person so i think in life that you should say yes before you say no

794
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:54,359
and uh and i think you say yes and then or even this way you say yes until it's a no so you say

795
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:59,460
yes investigate it think about it and then it's either a no or a yes once you know more information

796
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:07,480
um i think you can't go out to inspire people i think you either do or you don't i i just think

797
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,039
that anyone

798
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,640
who thinks that they're going to go out and be this person i think just be you and you either

799
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:20,480
will or won't yeah great answer and and um yeah it's it's it's feels as though that is is your

800
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,680
life story the next the next question i want to ask was about you know creating and sharing your

801
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,900
vision and how you've gone about and i want to ask that in the context of boost i mean you probably

802
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:34,319
answered it then in some ways you know if you did something you're passionate about and you just

803
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:38,000
kept doing that it was going to take care of it did you have i mean could you have dreamt you're

804
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,539
going to be in

805
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:44,000
13 countries and 580 stores was there that sort of big global world domination vision or is that

806
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,319
just the result of you doing what you do we um we do and i think every business should stop every

807
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:54,059
six months particularly in the early days and said all right what we're six months in what's

808
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:58,519
the next six months look for and we we then go back and go okay if we want 100 stores how many

809
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:02,099
staff do we need how much money do we need you know so we were very much always looked ahead

810
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:08,319
so it was one of those things that you know overseas was an accident we actually actively

811
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,759
went right okay we've got growth in australia where's our other arm and then it was like okay

812
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:17,160
well we've all been overseas and we know that there's brands we know that our brand is as good

813
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:22,500
as any um let's pursue that and then we had a lot of particularly if there's an australian open or

814
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,319
something international as soon as people came to australia we've got oh my god this great brand

815
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:32,779
and we have a lot of inquiries for international so it was a deliberate strategy um but i think

816
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:36,099
that you know when you're on a train it goes really fast but you're sitting on a train you

817
00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:38,539
don't realize what's happening around you i think it's a deliberate strategy and i think it's a deliberate

818
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,259
strategy and i think that that's pretty much how i sort of felt with boost is because every day

819
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:47,440
there's a problem to solve you didn't really and you didn't really think about you know getting

820
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,359
there and also i'm a firm believer that are you there yet never i'm never there so when people

821
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:58,579
say oh you've got a really successful business like yes but we're only in 13 countries so there's

822
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:02,519
a lot more countries and there's a lot more to do and there's a lot more business so as soon as you

823
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:08,319
think you're there i think you need to hang up your shackles because you're never there life

824
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,819
you're never there as a person you're never there as a business you always have to find growth and

825
00:33:12,819 --> 00:33:24,269
improvement i've heard you mention the word curiosity a lot janine it's a common word

826
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:29,069
we're seeing with these range of leaders that we're talking to regularly and a lot of leaders

827
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:33,470
then through curiosity that's how they think about learning and growth and development

828
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:39,390
when i when i ask you about that that term curiosity what does it mean to you i think that

829
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:43,450
the i said earlier that meaning of life is knowledge and i think that the way to get

830
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,849
knowledge is to have the curious mind

831
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:49,630
you know it's like and and you know the curious mind means that i can learn from

832
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:55,289
anyone you know i my 23 year old son who's on youtube who's smashing out of the park i'm going

833
00:33:55,289 --> 00:34:01,750
right let me understand how this works or you know i've got um i'm in a i've got a group of

834
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,170
gorgeous guys that i sort of catch up with a couple every couple of months who are in their

835
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:11,329
70s who are again have incredible insights that i can learn from so you know i think that having

836
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:14,909
that curious mind of how does it work how does it work how does it work how does it work how does it

837
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:20,269
work and how much i can learn i mean i'm actually listening to a lot of david sinclair at the moment

838
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:25,510
about longevity i don't know if you're across him or not and he's a professor at harvard and

839
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:31,289
you know it's really fascinating i go gee i'm 56 and this life of i'm living is pretty cool i want

840
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:35,449
to be as healthy as i possibly can and some of his insights are really interesting with regard

841
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:39,769
to some of the studies and again just having that curious mind to sort of go okay how does

842
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:44,050
that fit for me you know what what does that you know what is that so i think

843
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:49,489
having it's the people i feel sorry not sorry for but i think the people live a half life if

844
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:53,469
they think they're already there i've got i've got to follow up a couple of things on that firstly

845
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:59,690
i've got i've got to find out what's the 23 year old uh what's he doing on youtube so riley so he

846
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:06,750
has a um youtube channel called major kill and it's a um it is he he basically tells you the

847
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:14,110
backstory of uh this game called warhammer and he um and through that he has merchandise and he has

848
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,909
you know and it's very interesting and it's very interesting and it's very interesting and it's very

849
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:21,369
male like it's actually his target market is i think 70 percent american you know so and he has

850
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:27,010
he sell these minis and you know so he's actually doing a great job but you know like if anyone

851
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:32,389
listens to it it is he does swear it is crass it is very much a male dominated thing it's not for

852
00:35:32,389 --> 00:35:39,389
the like faint-hearted if you like ball rat you'd like this one i love our you know you find your

853
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:44,690
own path isn't your own passion and uh and and how extraordinary that world is and what it opens up

854
00:35:44,929 --> 00:35:49,690
i would have thought that you could connect with a 70 american audience i'll um you know i'll look

855
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:55,630
that up with interest and i've got a follow-up on uh david sinclair at harvard so what can you

856
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,570
give us a little snapshot you know talk about longevity and long health what what's the reader's

857
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:05,510
digest version of what you're taking out of that look i think the key thing is that um he is a

858
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:11,710
scientist and a passion for longevity and believes truly believes by doing certain activities and

859
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,889
taking certain supplements you can actually reverse the the thing

860
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:19,550
of aging and it's not it's not on it's not like crazy stuff it's literally stuff that we already

861
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:23,409
know it's you know how much exercise you do and if you do some high intensity exercise

862
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:28,989
it's actually um he's a big believer in intermittent fasting um and then supplements

863
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:35,289
and he talks about nmns and he talks about um uh i can't pronounce half of them but you know

864
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:40,670
there you look he's it's a podcast um i i think it's really interesting i think that it comes from

865
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:44,130
a great uh a great background of science

866
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:49,389
and i think it's really interesting to see what we can do but the philosophy is that

867
00:36:49,389 --> 00:36:56,769
obviously aging creates it has diseases and people don't die off old age they die off a disease it's

868
00:36:56,769 --> 00:37:03,210
related to aging and if you can do certain things and live a certain lifestyle then you can um you

869
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:07,250
know and look we know that you know you i see 80 year olds who look like they're 50 and 50 year

870
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:13,949
olds look like they're 80 i mean you know it's it's type of lifestyle you choose yeah that's a

871
00:37:14,929 --> 00:37:19,050
topic for almost another chat i'd love to have with you at some stage but you're right isn't that

872
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:24,690
idea that you can live a healthy and fulfilled life my father-in-law is is 84 and you've never

873
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:30,909
seen anyone as fitter runs swims in the ocean every day uh you know incredible daily routines

874
00:37:30,909 --> 00:37:35,170
that keep him so strong and you know still arm wrestles our kids and beats them all he's a

875
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:41,289
remarkable example of finding your own path of health and seeing him age uh as amazingly as he

876
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:44,909
is is incredible still runs his legal practice still works and he's a great guy and i think

877
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:50,630
six days a week the norms don't have to equate do they and as you're right 50 year olds who look

878
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:56,030
like they're 150 yeah through lifestyle choices and equally if that you did a biomarker on him

879
00:37:56,030 --> 00:38:02,730
he'd probably be probably 56 or 57 or maybe 60 because he's he's done all the things that keep

880
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:07,369
and you know it's what's fascinating about david and you know people should get onto it because i

881
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:13,630
think it's really fascinating is um he talks about the fact that because of exercise it triggers this

882
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:20,409
you know and so i just think it's fascinating and look at when you get to when you when you get

883
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:27,849
to 50 you're kind of at that how old are you i'm 47 in july um so right so getting not too far away

884
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:33,110
from there and i um i have i'm going to be bold enough here because beck's a couple years older

885
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:37,510
than me i'm saying i'm about to have a you know my partner's going to be 50 so we're at that that

886
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:43,130
stage and then we start thinking about uh about the aging process a bit more yeah well i think

887
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,909
50 you sort of feel like you're at the top of the age range and you're at the top of the age range

888
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:50,630
pyramid don't you sort of go oh hang on let's if i live if i can live to 100 i'm really smack in

889
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:57,989
the middle and but i'm gonna say you know i'm 56 you know i did survivor at 54 um that i feel as

890
00:38:57,989 --> 00:39:02,010
good as i did actually probably better i'm probably fitter stronger healthier than i probably ever

891
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:10,349
have in my life and so the biggest crime that we can do to ourselves is say we are old or feel old

892
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:14,889
i think that and i think one of the things i love about in the northern beaches is i literally hop

893
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:19,590
into the surf and i'm one of the young ones like it's and so you're surrounded by these people

894
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:25,590
that just go you know they're just a fit and strong and you know so i certainly think that

895
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:30,789
i think your father-in-law's got it right yeah that's a great a great message um getting back

896
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:34,829
to these dimensions of leadership we're passionate about uh janine a couple more to ask you about

897
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:40,030
you're an incredible communicator we see leaders really thoughtful about communicating with clarity

898
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:44,909
you what's your process i mean clearly that's been a great strength you getting the

899
00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:48,849
message of boost out to so many people how have you gone about it look i think it's really

900
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:53,170
important that every business has a communication strategy and it might sound like it's a strategy

901
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:58,409
so it must be very important but really it's it's like who speaks to who and when now we've got a

902
00:39:58,409 --> 00:40:03,889
franchise network and i can tell you now if you have poor poor communication skills then people

903
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:08,710
will make up what they don't know it'll be 10 times worse than the reality and so there's a and i

904
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:13,710
think one of the things that i thought um mishad who's our ceo and the team at retail zoo did

905
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,590
incredibly well

906
00:40:14,929 --> 00:40:20,650
through through the last couple of years was communicated you know and if you're not

907
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:26,170
communicating very effectively you're a poor leader you know leaders people want to be people

908
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:31,309
want to to know where the answer is and and where you they need to go and if you're not

909
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:38,889
clear simple uncomplicated then um then people just won't follow you people lose faith and i

910
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:42,269
think one of the scariest people you can come across and we've all come across in our business

911
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:44,809
and i'm sure people listening to this and go yep i know them

912
00:40:44,929 --> 00:40:48,670
the ones that talk the talk but don't walk the walk you know when you come across someone and

913
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:53,230
they sit there and they sound really intelligent they say words really clearly and but they say

914
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:57,590
a lot but you leave and go i have no idea what that person just said right i know they said a

915
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:02,909
lot and it sounded really good but god damn it i i couldn't tell you what the key message was or

916
00:41:02,909 --> 00:41:08,170
or anything like that so they're the dangerous ones because you believe them because they have

917
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:14,909
this confidence so it's um it's a really clear simple communication is is really what they're

918
00:41:14,929 --> 00:41:20,769
aiming for and communicate often you know and and when i say a strategy communication strategy

919
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:28,010
should be how do you communicate weekly bi-weekly annually biannually um how you're communicating on

920
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:34,130
social media on internal external like it's face to face like it really has everything on how the

921
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:39,949
people get together and speak and so i am also i'm also a believer that you know if i have someone

922
00:41:39,949 --> 00:41:44,170
reporting to me i never just have a meeting like the meeting has to have an agenda it has to have

923
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:44,909
an outcome it has to have an agenda it has to have an agenda it has to have an agenda it has to have

924
00:41:44,929 --> 00:41:49,670
minutes and those minutes then get recirculated for the next one because if not you're just

925
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:56,650
talking you're just catching up so you need to have a very clear outcome and keep people accountable

926
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:02,809
to to it you know if the person that that works for me says i will deliver it on tuesday that's

927
00:42:02,809 --> 00:42:08,710
not wednesday that's tuesday you know and you know i i will do what i say say what i do but i expect

928
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:13,750
that of others too yeah that accountability uh piece that uh you hear so much in uh in the way

929
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:14,909
that you run your life you run your life you run your life you run your life you run your life

930
00:42:14,929 --> 00:42:18,789
and you mentioned collaboration before when i asked you about self-leadership and that you

931
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:23,150
really try and set your world up around collaboration and not i'm the boss and i

932
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:29,449
employ people how important has that collaboration been to you um i think it's worked really well i

933
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:35,650
think i i have had some incredible executives over the years that an incredible team and the first

934
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:43,389
team that we had at boost were i was 32 um and i think everyone else was their 20s and we just did

935
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:44,070
things that

936
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:50,349
you know that you know no one was was doing at the time and you know even to this day you know

937
00:42:50,349 --> 00:42:56,690
those four women who are now growing up with kids and um have um you know we all think fondly of that

938
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:01,190
period because we were all learning it and sort of working it out and we acquired businesses and

939
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:08,110
we went overseas and you know we i remember being with um uh one of my executives jacinta sitting in

940
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:14,170
dubai doing a deal with you know these sheiks you know and it's just like this crazy world but

941
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:20,030
i never but i never ever because i looked at the um the financial controller and went right that's

942
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:26,090
your role but never thought she works for me yes i own the business and yes there was an understanding

943
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:32,710
but i don't think any of them had that feeling that you know ultimately you know they they didn't

944
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:37,530
run their own race and i didn't trust them and you've also collaborated you know janine with

945
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:42,510
some of your early you know investors have been some of the great successful you know business

946
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:44,849
you know men in australia jeff harris from

947
00:43:44,929 --> 00:43:48,550
flight center was it was an early investor in boost i understand that the beast and family

948
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:54,309
have been great investors and great support how about that you know influence and collaborating

949
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:59,150
at that level with your partners how did you go about that look again people will be listening

950
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:04,349
to this and having horror stories of partnerships and and um some great outcome and and equally i've

951
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:08,949
had some you know horror partnerships through throughout my times with you know in other

952
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:13,929
businesses and equally having someone like jeff harris who who to this day is still a friend

953
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:20,170
is you know and a really important part you know 20 years ago for a young girl who was just trying

954
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:25,570
to work it out and having someone like jeff come in and you know having that calm sort of it's okay

955
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:31,750
it's not i'm getting on again armageddon who's um that uh that you know it was was fantastic so

956
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:38,570
equally like a your partner and husband choose carefully because i actually think it's easy to

957
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:44,050
get rid of a husband than a business partner so you know um so you know you really need to get

958
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:44,550
that right

959
00:44:44,929 --> 00:44:49,389
and go into it with an exit strategy so if it goes pear-shaped how do you get out of this

960
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:53,289
mess yeah great advice i think anyone who's probably been down the path of

961
00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:58,889
on their business nature probably says you're going to come across you know partners that don't

962
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:04,190
work i mean how did you go i mean you've obviously it's happened to you and and i've certainly had

963
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:08,269
that experience before is it setting it up right at the first as you said if there's an exit strategy

964
00:45:08,269 --> 00:45:13,449
it's clearly documented and you know that you can get out of it is that the best thing you can do

965
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:19,909
is spend the time to get the right partnerships is that the best advice or look it is it is but you

966
00:45:19,909 --> 00:45:23,989
know quite often people get excited and they're in the honeymoon period and everyone trusts each

967
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:29,429
other and you know it's all happy days and then um you know money gets involved or someone works

968
00:45:29,429 --> 00:45:35,489
more than the other person and you know we we all know that the old stories um but yeah so i think

969
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:40,889
having that hard conversation it's only that prenup that you need to have with it with the

970
00:45:40,889 --> 00:45:44,769
if in the meeting going okay we think it's going to go well because we wouldn't be doing it in the

971
00:45:44,769 --> 00:45:44,909
first place but we're going to do it in the second place and we're going to do it in the third place

972
00:45:44,929 --> 00:45:50,429
but if it goes pear-shaped how do we get out of this what do we do what's the process of of

973
00:45:50,429 --> 00:45:55,650
unwinding this and you know and hopefully you know the people that you're in business with are good

974
00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:00,309
people and you can work it out maturely and get through and sometimes it works and sometimes it

975
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:05,449
doesn't and you know we've all heard the horror stories of of when it hasn't worked out so well

976
00:46:05,449 --> 00:46:09,949
and we'll live the horror stories yeah good uh good advice isn't it good people maybe with shared

977
00:46:09,949 --> 00:46:14,389
values maybe it's a good place to start uh with with partnerships some two final questions you

978
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:14,909
know but asking

979
00:46:14,929 --> 00:46:21,030
these of uh all the iconic leaders like yourself um who has been the greatest leader in your life

980
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:27,449
do you know it's really hard um when you say leader um because people have sort of helped

981
00:46:27,449 --> 00:46:34,849
in various ways and i think i don't necessarily see people as leaders not leaders sometimes the

982
00:46:34,849 --> 00:46:40,369
best leaders in my life are the ones that have really done bad things you know and i think we

983
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:44,909
always learn well i remember i was running a cinema in singapore and working six hours a day

984
00:46:44,929 --> 00:46:50,829
wearing my ass off turned it around you know from a negative to a positive and the leader the my boss

985
00:46:50,829 --> 00:46:55,389
came and sort of mentioned that i should wear sleeves that are a bit longer and i just went

986
00:46:55,389 --> 00:47:02,889
really that's all you got to say to me like hello you know and um so then i took that into my own

987
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:06,690
business and went i don't care what you wear like if you're a lawyer and you want to wear shorts

988
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:13,809
look yourself out wear what you like i don't care um so i think sometimes we take we take lessons

989
00:47:13,809 --> 00:47:14,329
from everything

990
00:47:14,929 --> 00:47:18,989
but people you know some of the people that have really assisted me you know the gillespie's from

991
00:47:18,989 --> 00:47:22,650
baker's delight you know they could not have been more helpful for me in the early days

992
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:25,570
particularly when it's this young girl just trying to work it out they were amazing

993
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:30,210
you know harris jeff harris was you're always there at the other end of the phone

994
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:36,630
you know um a guy that james who started muffin break he was happy to sit down and have a coffee

995
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:41,949
with me so it was sort of all those people you know even you know jerry harvey you know met with

996
00:47:41,949 --> 00:47:44,909
me and went okay this is something some things you can and can't do and i think it's really

997
00:47:44,909 --> 00:47:47,769
important to be able to sit down and have a coffee with people that you know are really

998
00:47:47,769 --> 00:47:50,150
helpful and that you can't do so um and katie and katie was they're a funny couple they're so nice

999
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:56,289
but um but i think people have um i think people have always been very generous to be able to sit

1000
00:47:56,289 --> 00:48:01,829
down and take a phone call and you know help me along the way um with leaders you know i think

1001
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:06,550
that the the b-hag league leaders the people that really are truly changing this planet like you

1002
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:14,449
know jobs and and musk and you know uh uh you know zuckenberg and all those people that

1003
00:48:14,909 --> 00:48:19,409
the people that are sort of go hey can one person change the world well do some people can

1004
00:48:19,409 --> 00:48:24,489
so you know those sort of people you go wow that's that's pretty pretty cool yeah pretty

1005
00:48:24,489 --> 00:48:28,730
interesting insight into you jen clearly you've you've picked up the phone and and and gone to

1006
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:33,849
people for knowledge and uh and it's brilliant to think you know clearly they've learned from

1007
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:38,650
you along the way as well but the opportunity is there isn't it sometimes you get a no but

1008
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:42,369
but clearly there's other success stories that have benefited you and you've benefited them

1009
00:48:42,369 --> 00:48:44,769
along the way in the spirit of collaboration because we're still in the middle of a pandemic

1010
00:48:44,909 --> 00:48:48,869
seeing great leaders really love collaboration asking this question is where if you could

1011
00:48:48,869 --> 00:48:53,349
collaborate with one person janet could be on anything um is there someone that springs to

1012
00:48:53,349 --> 00:49:00,090
mind you know i probably jeff bezos like you know i think that i love the way he thinks

1013
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:05,590
i mean i never met him probably met him and go oh my god no way but um yeah i don't know i think

1014
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:12,050
there's someone who is really just thinks outside the box you know i think um there is there is so

1015
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:14,889
many but i mean i'm sure i'll get off this this call and go oh my god

1016
00:49:14,909 --> 00:49:21,449
i've got 10 people i want to tell you about but look you know i don't know i think um people i

1017
00:49:21,449 --> 00:49:25,789
think that's interesting is that anyone that i know i don't really sort of pick on because you

1018
00:49:25,789 --> 00:49:30,690
know them and you you've already dragged all the information i need from them but but it's like

1019
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:36,809
when i worked for bowie as a young girl at 21 you know yes you always imagine them to be superhuman

1020
00:49:36,809 --> 00:49:41,909
and you know never be flawed and because they're rock stars and movie stars and then when you meet

1021
00:49:41,909 --> 00:49:44,889
them they've just got the same dreams and flaws and as a result they're not going to be the same

1022
00:49:44,909 --> 00:49:52,510
but um i think in business i think someone like an elon musk the way he um just has that again that

1023
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:56,289
classic curious mind it doesn't feel like that there's any barriers he can't cross

1024
00:49:56,289 --> 00:50:00,170
i mean those sort of brains are fascinating i probably wouldn't be able to understand half

1025
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:04,769
of what he said but um but i think someone yeah those sort of people you just go oh wow that'd

1026
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:10,309
be incredible well it's funny yeah janine you you say that uh lindsey boyd is a incredible

1027
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:14,530
entrepreneur in the uk that i spoke with a business called one earth and she's doing

1028
00:50:14,909 --> 00:50:21,369
things in that space and her mind went immediately you know to to the similar names and elon musk as

1029
00:50:21,369 --> 00:50:26,090
well it's like you know put my uh thoughts together with someone like that you know we

1030
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:30,269
could change the world so so clearly there's a big thinking part of of the way you operate and

1031
00:50:30,269 --> 00:50:35,730
it's been a great uh pleasure to need to sit down and hear from you firsthand and hear your story

1032
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:40,869
and it sounds like there's many more chapters to unfold that constant improvement uh is a big part

1033
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:44,869
of of who you are love life i love your your mantra at boost juice and it sounds like you're
