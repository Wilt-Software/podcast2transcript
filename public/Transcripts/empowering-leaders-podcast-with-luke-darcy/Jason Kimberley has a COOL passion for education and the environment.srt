00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:07,719
This week's episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast is with Jason Kimberley, the founder

2
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:13,380
of Cool.org, a remarkable organisation that has had a huge impact on teachers and education

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,480
in Australia and around the globe.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,359
Cool.org supports educators with teaching resources and the impact that it's had on

5
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,500
student engagement and understanding of critical issues is a really profound story.

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,940
Jason shares his eclectic lifestyle, his unique, Jason, the way that he approaches things,

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,579
including the incredible story of how he ended up having a picnic on the SCG mid-game

8
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,020
post the celebration of Buddy Franklin kicking his 1,000th goal in AFL football.

9
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:42,100
You need to hear that story.

10
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,859
Worth tuning in for that one alone.

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,719
I think the thing I take away mostly from Jason is that he has a real true sense of

12
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,299
self, not caring at all about what other people think and really taking responsibility for

13
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:54,979
his own actions.

14
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,039
I'm sure you're going to enjoy this conversation with Jason Kimberley.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,920
It's conversations like this.

16
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:03,320
This is to really form the basis for our passion of the work we do at Alita.

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,599
Head to alitacollective.com.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,680
Love you to check out our Alita Connect bespoke facilitated leadership groups.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,840
We are really passionate now about bringing together leaders from around the globe, from

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,299
sport, from industry, from social venture, from the arts.

21
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,680
We connect with people on a weekly basis and think this form of personal development is

22
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,439
really enhancing people's lives and the sharing of life hacks.

23
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,439
You don't have to be a legendary sportsperson.

24
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,780
Or someone who is a CEO of a company to be part of our community.

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,319
Love you to check it out, head to alitacollective.com and book a discovery call and we'll connect

26
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,319
with you today.

27
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:45,060
Big thanks as always to Jason Nicholas and his team at Tempur, Australia and New Zealand

28
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,120
for supporting conversations like this.

29
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:53,079
We feel like leaders who have success consistently understand the importance of great sleep and

30
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:56,439
there is no better way to get great sleep than to invest in a Tempur mattress.

31
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,099
It is a mattress like no other.

32
00:01:58,099 --> 00:01:59,099
NASA approved.

33
00:01:59,099 --> 00:01:59,579
World's best mattress.

34
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,459
World's best in bedding.

35
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:05,680
Check out Tempur today.

36
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,500
Jason Kimberley founded Kool Australia on the back of a life changing trip to Antarctica

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,620
in 2005.

38
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:18,580
Kool.org as it's now known through its online free platform has supported more than 175,000

39
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,240
educators around the globe with teaching resources in their classrooms that have created better

40
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,939
student engagement and a greater understanding of critical environmental and social issues.

41
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:29,939
355,000 students.

42
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:30,740
355,000 students.

43
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:42,919
32,000 lessons were downloaded from the website in 2022 alone.

44
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:47,879
alle.

45
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,319
It would go on to be one of Australia's great business success stories when it was

46
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,479
sold in 2001.

47
00:02:53,479 --> 00:03:00,319
Jason's eclectic life has seen him publish two books work in a diverse range of fields,

48
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,280
photography, stockbroking, roof repairs, cattle herding, restaurants, fruit picking and a number

49
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,659
of quite unique adventures around the globe. Jase, it's great to see you. I look at your 56

50
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:15,639
years. You've crammed a bit in, mate. Does it feel like you've led a full life?

51
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,659
It does. It has been busy. I was having a conversation with a friend of mine the other

52
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:24,560
day and I said, geez, you're busy. She said to me, no, I'm not busy. I've just got a full life.

53
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:30,180
So I think you can sort of tip over to be busy, busy for busyness sake and everything's

54
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,199
urgent. Nothing's important, but I do like to fill up the calendar. And if there's a spot for

55
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:39,360
myself, I'll take a little bit of a lie down. But generally, I like to put something in there

56
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,419
that's going to require a bit of energy and excitement. I like that, Jase, isn't it? I'm

57
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:47,659
not busy. I'm just leading a full life. I rail against that a bit too. And I find it a bit

58
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:51,560
confronting when someone says, geez, you're busy. And so I'm trying not to be, but there's

59
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,240
so many good things I love doing, mate. I just want to keep following. Is that how you sort of

60
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,159
live life? Yeah, I think, you know, look, you're a long time Ted Darson. Everyone has

61
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,259
their different beliefs, but I'm of the school of once the light's out, the light's out. So

62
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:09,840
let's dig in and make the most of it. And if I can squeeze three or four or five into one,

63
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,780
well, you know, that's good fun for me, but it's also good for, you know, the people around you,

64
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,660
you know, your kids and the other people in your life, your friends, your family,

65
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,220
your colleagues at work, when they see that you're up and about, and we'll get onto leadership a bit

66
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,620
later, I suppose. But when you're up and about, those that are around you are up and about,

67
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,980
not that you're the centre of their universe anyway, but all the people

68
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,660
someone's orbit, if more of them are up than down, well, those individuals are going to be

69
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,740
travelling better as well. So I like to try and be up, not just for myself, but for all those

70
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,199
in my life that I come across. And Jason, I think there's probably

71
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,199
to change tact, you know, quite dramatically, but we probably all have these crucible type

72
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:53,519
moments in our life that shape us. And brother Marcus was born with brain damage and passed

73
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:59,560
away at the age of eight. How did that shape your life from that moment on? So he was born with

74
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,519
brain damage and mum had said very on to doctors, something's not quite right here. And they said,

75
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,800
oh, you know, you're a worrying mum, you know, well, you know, go home and don't worry about it.

76
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,000
You know, it's a kid, you know, work it out. And, you know, something was wrong and they had all

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,879
the tests done and he was brain damaged, but they didn't work that out till I think he was maybe 18

78
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,540
months or two years old, slow developmentally. And it was a real challenge for the family,

79
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,839
you know, for everyone. But it also created a great opportunity for our family and for friends

80
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,139
of our family to get involved.

81
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,279
What was called Marcus's program. He, um, you know, he wore a crash helmet, he couldn't walk

82
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,540
properly, had calipers on. And, um, uh, we had 120 people. There's a big program on the wall

83
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,519
that said Marcus's program and 120 of mum and dad's friends would rotate through the house

84
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:49,939
every day of the week for anywhere between two and four hours, uh, doing different stints,

85
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,839
exercising him, you know, feeding him, help. It was just, it was too much for, um, the four of us

86
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,699
to manage. And, uh, mum and dad and Colin, I certainly didn't want to put Marcus in a home.

87
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,560
We kept him at home and, uh, he lived a, uh, as good a life as he could off with us. You know,

88
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:09,439
it was pretty rugged. Uh, you know, we'd have to have a tube put down his throat and have,

89
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,839
you know, mucus sucked out of his lungs cause he couldn't clear his lungs properly. Um, he had very

90
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,560
little speech, but you know, he could communicate and let us know how he was feeling. But it was,

91
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,579
I think, um, something that, uh, instilled in me was that, um, that battler, that underdog,

92
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:29,759
that person who hadn't had much of a, a chance in life and it had a different sort of, um, start to

93
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,199
you know, I would, uh, kids would mock him and, you know, pull faces at him and call him Marie or

94
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,920
whatever it was back in those days. And I'd cross the street and confront them. You know,

95
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:42,899
this little lippy seven year, eight year old kid to go, what are you staring at mate? And give him

96
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:46,180
a bit of a shove in the chest. And by that stage, their parent would be going, Oh, he's saying,

97
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,220
I'm back up mate. And I said, well, that kid's staring at my brother. And I think that really

98
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:58,540
instilled in me a, um, a real importance of giving those with less opportunity, uh, a chance to, uh,

99
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,100
to do the absolute best they can. And I think that's what sort of steered me ultimately in life

100
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,180
into this education, um, a caper and helping others be their best.

101
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,480
And knowing you over the years, Jase, that makes sense. I can see that, you know, maybe a chip on

102
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,800
your shoulder a little bit. I could imagine you sticking up for anyone. And I love the community

103
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,420
part of that story. And I, you know, it's a small city, Melbourne. I remember my, uh, Beck, my

104
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,699
mother-in-law, Beck's mum was part of that community in Brighton. It's, it's a great reflection on your

105
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,660
story. And I think that's, I think that's, I think that's, I think that's, I think that's, I think

106
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:29,939
that's, I think that's, I think that's, I think that's, I think that's, I think that's, I think

107
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:34,500
people plus jump in and just say, Hey, the Kimberleys need some support here. We're all on

108
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,079
the roster. That is a beautiful story, isn't it? Yeah. And it was, I mean, all those people were,

109
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:43,639
you know, part of our lives. They'd come through. Sometimes their kids be with them. Our home was a,

110
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,620
a real high, a hive of activity. There was always something, uh, you know, going on. It was, you

111
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,180
know, there was never a dull moment. Mum and dad, you mentioned that mum and dad started Just

112
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,819
Jeans. They started with my dad's brother, Roger and mum's sister, Chrissie. So there was four

113
00:07:55,819 --> 00:08:00,100
founders. The four of them started it together. And, um, when they were doing that, starting a

114
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,019
new business in the early seventies, dad was working two jobs and, you know, it was Marcus

115
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:11,199
at home and, uh, yeah, it was just a really full life, Dars. Well, you, you, you mentioned the

116
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,180
family, uh, business. It's an incredible Australian success story, really, in lots of ways. And,

117
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:20,540
but in, in some ways I imagine it's a pretty big legacy to carry, isn't it? Uh, the, the Just

118
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:26,379
Jeans, uh, story. And I, I read in preparation from this, a quote from your dad, Craig, he said,

119
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,639
and correct me if I'm wrong, he said, it wasn't until you turned 30 that he realised you weren't

120
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:37,639
him. Was that difficult? Um, I, well, I was sort of, you know, unaware of that. So it was a bit

121
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:42,940
of a revelation for me when he told me, and, uh, I, um, had a chat to him about it the other day.

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,259
He said, oh, gee, mate, I thought that might've been a bit private. I said, oh, maybe we'll know

123
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:50,259
with the open book here. Um, uh, and I said, I think it speaks volumes to,

124
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:54,159
our relationship, we've got a fantastic relationship, but I think lots of dads,

125
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,179
you know, who have, uh, particularly the, um, the, the so-called sort of self-made, um, people,

126
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:03,840
they, they have a bit of a different approach to life, you know, that they've done it their way.

127
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,840
And I only know my way, cause that's, you know, all I've ever experienced and all I've ever known,

128
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,299
but it was a great conversation starter for dad and I. And I said, oh, dad, you know, what,

129
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:16,220
what was it that made you realise what made that? He said, oh, you just weren't the same,

130
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,000
mate. You just said, I said, yeah, but you might've picked that up a bit earlier. And he goes,

131
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,120
but I was just, I just didn't want to see it. You know, I just, I just thought you might've been

132
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,759
me. And I said, well, now that I'm not, are we okay? He said, oh, we're better than okay. We're

133
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,679
great. You know, but, um, it was just, you know, I suppose I hadn't realised it was probably just

134
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,620
that last little step. And he said, you know what, I've, I've tried my hardest, but it's,

135
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,320
I, it's, he's not me. And, uh, he's got to run his own race, which, which I'd done largely,

136
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,919
but it was just a moment of revelation for dad really. And, uh, uh, and it was great.

137
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,980
We had a bit of a chuckle about it and, uh, I said, well, that explains a lot. And on we moved.

138
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,259
Well, it's the parenting puzzle, isn't it? Uh, Jase, when you, you know, and I, uh, without

139
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:58,460
knowing your dad, you can see this, trying your best, aren't you? You, you, you doing what you

140
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,100
know. And, you know, I, last time I saw you, I think was at a barbecue over the summer and,

141
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:06,940
you know, your dad's in his eighties and, and he was locked in to pick you up at midnight. And,

142
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:12,639
and I go, not many, not many eight year old dads are still doing that for their sons. So clearly

143
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,059
there's a connection there that's special, but perhaps it took him a while to work out that

144
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:19,679
he had to let you be you. Yeah, no, but definitely always had a great

145
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:19,980
connection.

146
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,399
But, you know, there's certainly a divergent paths and that was quite entertaining on you.

147
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,500
How are you getting home, Jase? Oh, the old man's picking me up. I've got a midnight curfew.

148
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:28,899
Me and the kids.

149
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:31,059
When I was 18 again, mate, I couldn't.

150
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
I felt like I was. It wasn't a bad night, Daz.

151
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:39,799
Um, you, I mentioned in the, in the preview there about you going fruit picking and cattle

152
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:43,179
herding and a range of different stuff. You owned a brilliant restaurant called Roludo

153
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:44,360
for a number of years.

154
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:44,740
Thank you.

155
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,600
We had some, everyone had a good time. There over the journey, a famous place in Melbourne,

156
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:49,980
was that?

157
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,879
You try to find the, the path of passion.

158
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,639
Um, yeah, I think, uh, when I look back on, you know, um, my, since I've left school,

159
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,279
I've, I've tended to do things for maybe two or three or four year bursts at the most.

160
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:08,179
And, um, I, I looked at people when they left school and looked at guys who went into certain

161
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:12,740
careers and they just did that thing, the same thing for 30, 30 years.

162
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,980
And I go, God, well, after 30 years, you'd want to be bloody good at it, wouldn't you?

163
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:19,759
And I thought, you know, I reckon, not, not seriously, I'd mastered him.

164
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,279
But I had a good enough handle on things after three or four years to say, well, I've got

165
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,419
a good enough handle on this.

166
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,980
It's not really exciting me.

167
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,500
I could stick at it for another 20 years and become that expert, but that's not interesting

168
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,019
for me.

169
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:36,100
I'd rather keep having challenges and do difficult things and have that for life.

170
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:40,860
I think when you're on top of your job and you're coasting, um, we're not really adding

171
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,879
to yourself.

172
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:43,419
You're not really adding to society.

173
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,960
And, uh, I don't think you're being as productive as you can.

174
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,580
So I think if you've got the wherewithal and the go in you.

175
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,559
I think it's sort of impingent on you to make the most of it and, and have a red hot

176
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:53,879
crack.

177
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,559
So yeah, I got halfway through my first year of uni and, uh, announced to mum and dad,

178
00:11:58,659 --> 00:11:59,759
I was, I was off.

179
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,460
I was done.

180
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,779
I loved school, did well at school, but I failed my first subject, you know, in my life

181
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:05,220
in uni.

182
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,659
And I thought, okay, this is no good.

183
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,220
I'm clearly not paying attention.

184
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,759
So I packed up my bags and went off to the Northern Territory with a mate of mine and

185
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,179
spent two months on a cattle station and then went over to Northern Queensland and pick

186
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:16,039
fruit for a couple of months.

187
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,960
And it was just, just a wonderful liberating experience.

188
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,659
And that education of that sort of four months was as good as I reckon I could have

189
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,299
gotten another two and a half years at uni.

190
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,639
People would debate that, but I'm a big believer in the, you know, the JK MBA of life

191
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,879
just as it comes, absorb it, do as much as you can, learn as much as you can from it,

192
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,240
be curious and just, you know, keep on learning and keep on improving.

193
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,840
It reminds me, as you're speaking of one of my great friends in life, I interviewed

194
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,100
on this Craig Ellis.

195
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:48,440
I played with it, the Bulldogs for a hundred games and founded a business called Triangle,

196
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:48,940
which has been.

197
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,419
It's been a great success, but he, one of those people that the gap between him thinking

198
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:56,779
he wants to do something and actually doing is about three seconds and you sit with him

199
00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:01,419
and he go, I always thought about flying a plane and two hours later he's soaring, you

200
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:04,960
know, and then he'd go and do that for 18 months as quick as you can get a commercial

201
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,379
pilot, get to the end, spend his life savings and go, yeah, not for me.

202
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,659
And we're going, wow, mate, did you need to do all that?

203
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,440
But that was him.

204
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,200
And then he'd go and chase something else and all in on everything.

205
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,940
But the curiosity of, of, and then when he found it, he was like, oh, I'm going to

206
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,240
do this thing.

207
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:23,039
And I suppose it probably led to, to Cool.org, didn't it?

208
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,019
Cool Australia, Cool.org as it is now.

209
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:27,720
So it's an incredible contribution you've made.

210
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,659
You must be really proud of what it's achieved.

211
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:30,740
Where did that come from?

212
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:35,340
Well, there's sort of a level of pride, but there's also a level of understanding that

213
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,000
you're never finished.

214
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,000
You know, it's always ongoing.

215
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,980
It can always be better.

216
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,279
So, you know, it is important to stop and celebrate along the way.

217
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:47,360
And we do that pretty well at the office and get a few back to the air bar, the nightclub

218
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,919
I've got at the back of my place.

219
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,480
It's a little speakeasy, which is good fun.

220
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:58,679
But yeah, it's, I think it's, it's about just the sort of continual renewal, I think, of

221
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:04,379
yourself and finding sort of more reasons to, to go and get in and encourage those around

222
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:04,519
you.

223
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,860
I think that's a really important part of leadership.

224
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,860
You need to be flexible.

225
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:09,240
Some days it's setting the example.

226
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:14,259
Sometimes it's, you know, I don't think you can underestimate the importance of being

227
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:18,679
a dickhead as a leader, you know, be that, do the stupid thing, be that guy who's just

228
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:24,620
so authentic, but also human and can make, make blues and make silly blues and, you know,

229
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,059
be happy to embarrass yourself in front of your team, you know, so, and I've done that

230
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:29,720
plenty of times, I can assure you.

231
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,179
Yeah.

232
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:33,559
So look, I can't remember your question, Darce, but.

233
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,120
I was talking about the passion for Cool Org and, you know, to me, look at your life and,

234
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,580
you know, there's a range of things you could have done.

235
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:39,860
Yes.

236
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,879
An online teaching platform that is, you know, I said in the intro, 175,000 educators around

237
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:45,779
the globe use it.

238
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,659
We've got a crisis, I think, in teaching.

239
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,799
Here in Australia, where teachers are just piling out of their profession into other

240
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:57,559
areas, they're probably underpaid, they're seriously overstressed, and you've given this

241
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:01,919
free hit to them of a resource that's, it's had a massive impact.

242
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,159
Yeah.

243
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,039
Where did that come from in you?

244
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,519
Why did you see that as being important?

245
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,899
Well, I think it was a flow on from school.

246
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:08,840
I just love school.

247
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,440
You know, my sister would say I was the teacher's pet, you know, always sitting up the front

248
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,820
and, you know, greasing up to the teachers to get a good mark or, you know, putting in

249
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,059
hard.

250
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,500
So I just love school.

251
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:18,480
And I think it's an extension.

252
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:20,460
And that, I think it's natural curiosity.

253
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,240
I don't, I don't know if you can teach it, but I'm just naturally curious.

254
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,519
I'll see something.

255
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,340
I want to know why it's happening.

256
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:31,220
You know, everything from a road work going on to why is that sign saying that?

257
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:32,580
And my brain just doesn't stop.

258
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,559
So there's that.

259
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,360
And so to me, it's been a really great channel.

260
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,980
And when we came back from Antarctica and asked teachers, you know, what are you learning

261
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,580
about, you know, climate and the world around us, water, waste, energy, biodiversity, and

262
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,299
the message from teacher mates of mine was, oh, don't do this, don't do that.

263
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:50,159
By the way, 10 easy tips to save the planet.

264
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,299
I thought, God, if I was a kid at school, nothing could be more demoralizing.

265
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,059
And I, but it's all over, is it?

266
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,720
Um, you know, uh, or, or there's 10 easy tips out of it.

267
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,620
I thought that doesn't sound right.

268
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,919
So I did a lot of research and, you know, asked some mates who were, you know, um, uh,

269
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,899
lecturers and scientists and that sort of stuff.

270
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:09,399
And they said, look, we're, we're, we've got a lot of, um, uh, things we need to be better

271
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,080
at looking after our, our life support system, our planet, you know, the planet's going to

272
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,539
be fine.

273
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,539
It's, you know, humanity that's, that's in trouble.

274
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,539
We get that sort of the wrong way around often.

275
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:21,559
So, uh, I just thought, and then I said, what's been taught in schools and it was very

276
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:24,519
negative, um, and, uh, not very positive messaging.

277
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:27,000
So I thought there's an opportunity to speak in plain English.

278
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,500
I don't care what anthropogenic means that needs to be, that needs to be say human caused

279
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,960
and no one knows, you know, don't use any words that no one made, even a kilowatt people

280
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,539
struggle with, get out all the words that no one understands, make it simple, talk with

281
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:43,080
a smile on our face, engage it, have a special wow factor and make it everybody's business.

282
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,580
You know, all the, the math teachers, English teachers go, what's this got to do with me?

283
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,519
And then it moved.

284
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,860
On to the social and economic issues does.

285
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,100
So all the big social economic and, um, environmental, uh, challenge of our time of which there are

286
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,919
many, um, I don't think we can solve them if we don't have an informed, um, populace

287
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,159
and we know what's going on.

288
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:04,900
And when we do our research and ask teachers, you know, how are the kids going with it?

289
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:10,200
And as expected, sort of, you know, 90% improved outcomes, 90% greater awareness, more likely

290
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,140
to work in teams.

291
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,299
But when we ask teachers, how has it impacted you?

292
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,779
85% said I've changed my view on the issue.

293
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,539
I mean, that's a, that's a fair.

294
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:18,200
Turn around.

295
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,400
And I, I, that was really one bit of research.

296
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,920
We've been doing research for 15 years.

297
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,539
It really gobsmacked me was we'd actually, um, teachers have changed their mind on issues.

298
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:29,400
So that says to me, where were they getting their information from?

299
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,599
Um, was it just the loudest noises in the media?

300
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,539
Were they, were they reading old textbooks?

301
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:34,700
Were they just not informed?

302
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,259
So that to me was a result of that.

303
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:42,180
We've got a huge opportunity and also a responsibility to get know the right information out there.

304
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,920
When I say the right information, the science, the accepted knowledge of the time on what

305
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,339
are things, and that's always evolving.

306
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:54,079
And as the science change a pit views can change, but no pin opinions aren't worth equal

307
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,079
amount.

308
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:58,420
You know, there's, there's a dark, there's an opinion or a viewpoint with key data points

309
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,420
to back it up.

310
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,180
And there's someone just saying something because it backs up their ideology.

311
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,180
They're very different things.

312
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,160
So you've got to separate that out and give the, let the kids decide, give them the data,

313
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,380
give them the information and they can tap away on a data set on the, say, for example,

314
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,240
the tuna catch in the Pacific ocean, the legal, the illegal and the quota.

315
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Now.

316
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:19,500
When they tap around the data, they put up their hand and go, I miss we're catching too

317
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
many fish.

318
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,940
And that's really powerful learning when the kids come to their own determination.

319
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,539
So that's what, um, as the band, I suppose, the real Genesis of, of call and what it's

320
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:34,359
based upon that sense of humor, kids come to their own determinations, talk with a smile

321
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:37,079
on our face and talk in plain English, you know?

322
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,079
Yeah.

323
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,000
And what a great, as I said, contribution that you've made and you hear people that

324
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,079
have done a lot of things in their life, but actually some go back to teaching late in

325
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,079
their life.

326
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:51,500
That's the greatest thing that they've ever done about a pass on wisdom to the next generation.

327
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,160
And I think we all got a bit of a look into teaching through the COVID period because

328
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,160
all our kids were online.

329
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,599
I had four at home, homeschooling.

330
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:01,980
And so you couldn't help, but walk past the door and you'd listen in on a lesson.

331
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,339
And I got this incredible respect for teachers at another level again, going what they're

332
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:09,839
able to do to change gear in that time and run their class.

333
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,880
But also this incredible thought of just how stressful a profession it is.

334
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,240
And, and, and I think what you're doing is what you'd hope.

335
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,380
And also listening, going, God, that's the same textbook from 1990 and it sounds eerily

336
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,380
similar.

337
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,559
And it didn't make a lot of sense in 1990.

338
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:30,640
Can we get world experts back into the classroom to share, as you said, what is, you know,

339
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,859
great knowledge and great storytelling around because the world's shifting in it as it always

340
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:35,859
has done.

341
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:41,019
So I think, you know, now your, um, you know, your platform has provided these free resources

342
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:43,480
that have helped teachers in a, in a profound way.

343
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,240
Cool plus is the extension of that.

344
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,240
Yeah.

345
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,380
I mean, you've got to be able to, uh, you know, take it to another level.

346
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,380
Tell us about what you're doing with that.

347
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,380
Yeah.

348
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,599
Well, cool plus has been in response to a couple of things.

349
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,859
So, um, when we first started, you know, we, our turnover in the first year for cool was,

350
00:19:57,859 --> 00:20:03,059
uh, was 200 grand and, um, we relied largely on philanthropic support and, um, I was tipping

351
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:07,140
some money and certainly in the first few years and Bendigo bank jumped on and support

352
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,920
us for five years with a great John Billington there did a great job looking after the sale.

353
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,380
I think it was about one and a half million over five years.

354
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,380
And as we sort of moved on, we thought, how are we going to keep this?

355
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:20,500
As a, you know, to, to run a charity, um, not for profit, you need to have some serious

356
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
revenue stream.

357
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
So what are we really good at?

358
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,220
We really great at creating content.

359
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,119
So what we started doing, um, sort of five years in 10 years ago, I was partnering with

360
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:32,839
industry experts to take their content that might be documentary filmmakers.

361
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:33,839
It might be Visi.

362
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:38,740
It might be the Australian human rights commission, AFLW, and telling great stories about what

363
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,680
these organizations are doing and how they're making a contribution to a, uh, a better way

364
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,359
of life for, uh, and a better society.

365
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,920
So that was, um, a fee for service job.

366
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,359
So that got up to 50, 50 of our revenue.

367
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:54,339
And last year we turned over a tick under 3 million and they both half each half philanthropy

368
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:56,119
half the fee for service business.

369
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:58,240
The only challenge with that is it's tied to projects.

370
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,640
So there's a lot of stuff that teachers want and we want to deliver, but we haven't got

371
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,680
the unallocated funds to do it.

372
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,440
So the last two years we've been trying to work out what it might be.

373
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,059
And, um, when we asked our teachers, since we started, what, why don't you come to the

374
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:11,059
website more often?

375
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:14,480
And the answer was, um, uh, you don't have everything I want fair enough.

376
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,319
And then in the middle.

377
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,680
Two years later, it drifted to, um, uh, remind me more often.

378
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,140
I love what you guys do.

379
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,759
And now it's, um, I've subscribed to one or two other things.

380
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,980
I think that, um, uh, if you can make me pay, I'm more likely to use it.

381
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,799
I've been told to exclude everything else by my school.

382
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,319
So I go, okay, I want to get this subscription caper.

383
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,359
How can we do that?

384
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,000
What's the greatest need for teachers?

385
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,519
So I show up at Cove, we did a whole heap of focus groups, several hundred teachers

386
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:43,980
and say, what is it that where's the system letting you down and how can we best help?

387
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,980
We can't do everything.

388
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,980
Even what we do.

389
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,980
How can we help you?

390
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:51,640
So the big thing to come out of it was I need to be taught all the things that I don't get

391
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,480
taught at university and things like, you know, building self-confidence in the classroom,

392
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,460
um, strategies to support talented and gifted students, understanding impact of trauma and

393
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,859
learning all these different things, how to manage, um, challenging parents, finding your

394
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:09,200
voice in the staff room, what to wear to an interview, how to prepare your resume.

395
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,480
So no one was telling teachers any of those things.

396
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,859
Then they leave uni and gets thrown into the school.

397
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:14,859
Where's all my stuff.

398
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:16,099
You, you've got it.

399
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:17,140
You work it out.

400
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,619
So we've, uh, gone about addressing that with this premium content.

401
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:25,099
So we've created about 300 slide shows, which, um, uh, teach can present up the front of

402
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:31,319
the class, great talking points of, uh, engagement with their kids, um, all those, um, uh, skills.

403
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:35,839
We've got about 80 of those 45 minute, um, um, professional learning courses to help

404
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:40,700
upskill the teachers to be the best they can be and handle all those challenges that come

405
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,859
at them that they are not taught about at uni, which I find astounding.

406
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:44,859
Yeah.

407
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:47,240
Um, and not, and not much help in the classroom.

408
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,240
So we've launched that.

409
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,480
Um, we're launching that, I think today, tomorrow, and I think already 50 people have found it

410
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
and signed up to us.

411
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,420
So that's a, uh, uh, you know, 14, uh, 14 bucks a month for a monthly and 12 bucks if

412
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,420
you do it by the year.

413
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,400
So it's sort of $3 a week to get all your support, sort of unlimited professional development

414
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
and content.

415
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,900
We're adding new content every month and that's a subscription service.

416
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,099
So we're hoping that can be a third revenue stream for the charity and support it in perpetuity.

417
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,099
And, uh, we, we feel as though it's just what the, uh, the teachers need.

418
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:18,859
And it's, it's a bit sad that they do need it, but someone's got to provide it and we're

419
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:19,859
there.

420
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:20,859
And that's the evolving world, isn't it?

421
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:21,859
Jase?

422
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,500
You know, you having, you see it at the front, a lot of kids are turning up now with a lot

423
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,480
more anxiety issues, a lot more social issues than perhaps ever before.

424
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,519
And you know, we're asking teachers to not only educate, but to be counselors and social

425
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:36,180
workers before they even get to the classroom.

426
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,259
So I'm not surprised that they're the things that teachers need themselves, don't they?

427
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:44,079
That how you manage challenging parents and, you know, everyone turns up, uh, at some point,

428
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,519
some of the private schools with their family lawyer these days, Jason wants a certain outcome

429
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:49,519
for their kids.

430
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,519
So I think I grew up where it was.

431
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:51,519
Only one lawyer does.

432
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:52,519
Only one.

433
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:53,519
Yeah.

434
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,839
If you're struggling, I went to boarding school and remember ringing home and it was like,

435
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:57,839
well, it's your fault.

436
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,039
You need to, uh, you need to sort it out and the world's changed, hasn't it?

437
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,920
And what we're doing now, I think is putting these pressure points on teachers like we've

438
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
never done before.

439
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,079
So what you're doing and we don't celebrate our teachers anywhere near enough.

440
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:12,839
You know, I often tell the story, I was in Switzerland with, uh, my brother-in-law and

441
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:13,839
his girlfriend.

442
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,140
At the time, who was one of the most intelligent people I'd ever met.

443
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,339
You could just tell she had a PhD in everything and could have chosen anything in the world.

444
00:24:21,339 --> 00:24:25,900
And, and she chose to be a teacher and the family celebration for the fact they had a

445
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:31,720
teacher in the family was this, I was like, wow, that is the way educators are revered

446
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,279
in other parts of the world.

447
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,559
I think we've got a long way to go and I think you're doing a great job of, uh, of supporting

448
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,559
that.

449
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,559
Jason talk about passion.

450
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:42,680
I've met a lot of people who love Australian rules football.

451
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,680
And then there's you.

452
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:48,920
So the, your passion for the Sydney Swans, I was, uh, listening to you, you did a great

453
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:54,640
speech in recent times, a love letter to football, which is a great, uh, occasion Ross Stevenson

454
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,359
has, uh, has brought to the table and I, and your speech was, I didn't realize that you

455
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,559
were seven generations of South Melbourne, Sydney Swans going back to the 1870s, the

456
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:04,559
Kimberley family.

457
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,680
Your dad, Craig was president at 34 years of age and went on to be an AFL commissioner.

458
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,980
Fair to say you're invested in the Swans, isn't it?

459
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,359
It is fair to say.

460
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:17,640
Um, and you know, certainly the early South Melbourne days was probably, you know, dad

461
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,799
was, uh, got voted in, um, actually, but the old board voted themselves and go back a step.

462
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,839
Um, Peter Bedford wanted to leave the club, go to Footscray and, um, uh, the club was

463
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:28,839
in disarray.

464
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:30,960
The captain wanted to go and dad sensed an opportunity.

465
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:37,799
He went and met Bedford and said, listen, if you stay, um, uh, we can make an announcement

466
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:42,200
that you're going to stay only if Craig Kimberley ticket gets elected to the board and Bedford

467
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
goes.

468
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:44,359
And he said, I'll be back in a minute.

469
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,359
He was a little frowny, not sure about that.

470
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:48,359
And dad just slipped a little, um, little envelope under the table to him.

471
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,359
And he said, I'll be back in a minute.

472
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,359
Not a little envelope I would have thought.

473
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,359
It was, it was, it was a largeish envelope.

474
00:25:51,359 --> 00:26:00,299
And it was at the rainbow room at the Southern Cross and Bedford nipped off to the loo and

475
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:03,059
came back and had the frown and turned into a smile.

476
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:05,799
And, um, they shook hands and said, right, what do we do?

477
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:09,259
So dad briefed Alf Brown, who was the chief writer at the Herald at the time.

478
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:12,200
And the headline two days later was Bedford stays.

479
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Kimberley president.

480
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,440
Board votes themselves out nine nil.

481
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,900
So that's how it started.

482
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,819
So I felt like I was Charlie and I had the golden ticket.

483
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:22,819
Dad was Willy Wonka.

484
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:24,559
He had the key to the chocolate factory.

485
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,759
And I spent six years of my life with dad at the footy club going every week in the

486
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:33,400
room to know before the game, after the game, um, great mates with Jim Gull on the door

487
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,819
who always used to look after me and give me the Forex mints, which was so strong.

488
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:38,640
I couldn't have them, but I never had to tell him.

489
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,200
So I'd quietly slip it into my pocket after a minute.

490
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
And, um, you know, my father, he was like, you know what?

491
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,319
My favourite player was Stewie Gull, Jim's son.

492
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:47,200
And one day Stewie gave me a pair of his socks.

493
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,839
I was just standing next to him in the rooms for five minutes after the game.

494
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:50,839
He's exhausted.

495
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:51,839
We just won.

496
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:52,839
He could barely speak.

497
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:53,839
He took up his socks and gave them to me.

498
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:54,839
He goes, there you go, son.

499
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:55,839
Have them.

500
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:57,700
And I saw him 20 years later in surface paradise.

501
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,700
The first thing he says to me, have you still got the socks?

502
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,140
I said, of course I've still got the socks for the stupid question.

503
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,940
It's the brilliance of sport, isn't it, Jase?

504
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,700
I've still got Stewie Gull socks from 1976.

505
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,200
You have to tell the story of you because, uh, Buddy Franklin kicks his thousandth goal.

506
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
It's one of the great moments in life.

507
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Yeah.

508
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,900
It's one of the greatest moments in the last 25 years for me.

509
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,900
Great moment of footy.

510
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,640
And brilliant that, uh, we let it unfold naturally or we let it unfold, the AFL community did

511
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,279
and everyone charged onto the ground.

512
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:28,079
And then I remember doing the game and looking down, I'm going, that's not, is it?

513
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,640
That's not Jason Kimberley, who's taken the opportunity to bring a picnic blanket onto

514
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,460
the SCG and Dane Ramphy, who's a captain of the Swans and a mate of yours, you managed

515
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,700
to convince him to eat a pie mid-game on the SCG.

516
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,200
Mate, only you could do that.

517
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
What was the inspiration?

518
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
What was the inspiration for that one?

519
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,740
Well, the inspiration, I went to Pluggers 1300th when he passed, uh, Gordon Coventry's

520
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:53,440
1299 to break the all-time record and was up in Sydney for that and, um, ran out on the

521
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,200
ground and sort of got it a bit wrong.

522
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,819
There's a big crowd, couldn't get near it.

523
00:27:56,819 --> 00:27:58,000
I thought, how am I going to get close to him?

524
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,859
So then on the, they took him off the ground and he came back out the race and I had a

525
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:05,599
video camera down there and got the high five of him coming back out.

526
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,559
And I thought, okay, how can we improve this next time if there's ever a big ground invasion

527
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:11,059
or something happens at the SCG?

528
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:12,900
And I thought a bloody picnic would be magnificent.

529
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:18,079
Just in front of the ladies' stand and I'd have to wait 23 short years until I got my

530
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,079
chance again.

531
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:21,579
Buddy was, uh, lining up for hopefully his thousands.

532
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:25,099
I took my daughter, eldest daughter, Florence, her boyfriend, Ryan.

533
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:26,099
We flew up to Sydney.

534
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:27,099
Everything went wrong on the flight.

535
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:28,099
It was delightful.

536
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:29,740
We got to the ground at quarter time.

537
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:34,680
We flew in the gates listing on the radio and, um, uh, we, we got in there and all I

538
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,759
had in my little overnight bag was no toothbrush, no toothpaste, no fresh undies or socks.

539
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,660
All I had was a picnic blanket.

540
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,900
One thing I wasn't going to forget.

541
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,200
So he kicked the goal and he goes, oh, let's run out.

542
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,079
I said, no, no, we just got, we'll just watch it.

543
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,079
What?

544
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:49,079
Just watch this happen.

545
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:51,000
The whole joint's going to, um, fill out onto the, onto the ground.

546
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And sure enough, it did.

547
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,680
We watched the, uh, the crush for about five minutes.

548
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,059
And then I said, right, we're on.

549
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:57,059
So I grabbed them.

550
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:58,059
They said, what do you mean we're on?

551
00:28:58,059 --> 00:28:59,059
I said, we're going to have a picnic.

552
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:00,059
And everyone's looked at me.

553
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:01,059
And I said, yeah, picnic.

554
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:02,059
Great.

555
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:03,059
What an idea.

556
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:07,039
So blanket over the shoulder, my sister grabbed a bottle of champagne from a nearby fridge.

557
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,319
I grabbed a box of pies.

558
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:11,480
We filled our pockets with beers and we went out in the ground and, and said, I went to

559
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,920
a picnic out there for about half an hour.

560
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,539
And of course we got invaded by the, the selfie set.

561
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,539
They're all jumping all over us, photos.

562
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:19,180
So it was all a bit of pandemonium.

563
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:23,160
And then I sort of stood up for a bit of a stretch and was just a sea of people.

564
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,799
And Dane Rampey came out of the crowd and just was walking away.

565
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:26,799
So I go, g'day Ramps.

566
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,240
He goes, Jase, what the hell's going on?

567
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,240
You're speaking.

568
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,240
I said, um, beer, champagne, or pie.

569
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,359
He said, horse will kill me if I have a grog.

570
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,359
He'll smell it in my breath.

571
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,619
He can probably smell me now with you here.

572
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:39,200
Those cockroaches, they're all the same.

573
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,960
And, um, he, uh, I said, what about a pie?

574
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,460
He said, I love a pie.

575
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:47,339
So there's some great photos of me and Rampey having a pie on the picnic blanket, um, uh,

576
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:48,759
with all the crowd going around us.

577
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:52,119
It was just, uh, we look around the stands, I said, have a look at this, Ramps.

578
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:53,740
And the stands had emptied.

579
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,240
And we're just looking around the way and said, this is an incredible moment.

580
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,740
It's one of footy's greatest moments.

581
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,579
I think the swans breaking through, the bulldogs breaking through, although it was against

582
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:06,740
the swans, uh, and that creative invasion, I can't think of three better moments in footy.

583
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,019
I think it's in the top three in the last, since I've been watching footy.

584
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:11,440
And, uh, Jase, there was an image of you.

585
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,799
That I would have in my mind for the rest of my life.

586
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:17,519
It would be that you were the picnic blanket in the middle of the SCG mid, mid game.

587
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:20,400
And I think it's, it's such a fascinating life that you live to me.

588
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,680
It's got a decent share of mischief about it.

589
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:28,119
Uh, Jase, like no one else is going to think of doing that incredible contribution that

590
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:34,500
you've made with cool dog org, uh, an incredible, uh, community that you've built around you,

591
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,759
but not to go again the other way, but I, I didn't quite understand until preparing

592
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:39,759
for this.

593
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:40,759
Cause you, you bump into you.

594
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:41,259
But then.

595
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:44,559
I think you had a decent serious, you know, share of tragedy along the way as well.

596
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,759
And I, I did want to ask you about, I didn't understand until reading in preparation for

597
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:54,079
this, that, you know, one of your best friends in life, tragically took his life in 1991,

598
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,200
uh, Michael Fox and his son, he's 23 years of age.

599
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,380
I mean, that must have been an incredibly hard moment.

600
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,579
How did you cope with that?

601
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:07,460
Well, yeah, Tert and Hipskeny were great mates.

602
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,579
And, um, uh, I think, you know, as, as, um, uh, you know, as, I was just a kid, I was

603
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:15,099
uh you know lindsey says you know he died of a broken heart you know he had a bust up with his

604
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:20,920
missus and um it was sort of you know all um it obviously had a bad moment it was all you know

605
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:27,339
too much for him and he he took his own life and um it was uh it was such a real you know shock

606
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:31,980
you know i don't think you expect in your early 20s although he said that i sat down with a mate

607
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,859
of the day and we counted about 35 people we knew were suicided over the journey so

608
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:41,259
um i think it it was just such a shock and i remember going around to um you know the house

609
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:45,460
was just because mum mum's great mates with um with paul and dad's great we're great family

610
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:50,819
friends and we'd sat around on their on their lawn and talking to them and sharing memories of michael

611
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:55,819
and it was just you know so um sort of i think overwhelming and sad and tragic and certainly

612
00:31:55,819 --> 00:32:00,880
during covid and well i i go to st kilda cemetery you know at least once a month it's a beautiful

613
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,059
place particularly in the late afternoon the sun going down have a wander around and that's where

614
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:05,779
skinny's buried

615
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:10,559
oliphine i take a couple of cans and have a beer with him or i sometimes meet a couple of mates

616
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:16,680
and we'll have a a beer and a yarn with him there and um i don't think it's a i don't know it feels

617
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,680
like a nice thing to do and i think you know funerals are for the living and graveyards

618
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,660
although the dead are in there they're also for the living to have a place to

619
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:28,619
uh consider and reflect and i suppose just appreciate how bloody lucky you are you know

620
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:35,619
that uh uh that you know it wasn't you and um but not that it should be someone else but i think

621
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:35,839
you know i think it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a

622
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:39,359
you know we all deal with things in different ways you just don't know what's going through

623
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:44,279
someone's mind at a particular time if they're having a bad moment and you know could anyone

624
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:49,859
have been there or done anything you know probably not and uh you know i've also you know different

625
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:52,480
mates have different challenges at different times i think it's just important to you know

626
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,779
be there and be their friend and um if it uh helps uh if it helps sort of you in your grieving

627
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:03,299
process well that's you know great as well but you know i didn't go to marcus's grave for probably

628
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:05,599
about 20 years and i've just started going in the last you know i've just started going in the last

629
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:10,119
you know 10 years and there's no real sort of rhyme or reason to it i think it just sort of

630
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:15,140
feels right or it doesn't um i think that's probably something i'm going to say deeply

631
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,960
personal but if it was deeply personal about it to you about it but it's sort of something that's

632
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,240
inside of you that is sometimes difficult to explain i think that you you carry with you and

633
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,440
you do sort of move on through life but i think it's also important to take the moment to pause

634
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,619
and reflect on help and all those people have made you the person you are because i really

635
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:35,359
understand that you are who you are because of where

636
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:39,660
you were when and of course there's nature and nurture but all the things that impact on your

637
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:46,299
life every knockback every joyous moment every you know um thing you've ever done has an impact

638
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:51,900
on you and it forms you in some way and you know that was one of those things yeah we lost a great

639
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:56,799
friend in year in year 10 uh who took his own life and he was the guy that everyone loved everyone

640
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:04,359
wanted to be um and our other great mate had spent the weekend with him before and uh um and it was

641
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,339
the impact on him

642
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:10,500
him having spent that weekend i think was just such a significant life-changing moment as well

643
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:16,900
uh jace that we all probably live with but i think more so for him and i you know gus wallen's been

644
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:21,239
on this podcast a great friend of mine he's founded gotcha for life and you know he still

645
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,739
talks about it's number one killer for males in this country people taking their own life and i

646
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:31,300
you know as you said you you know he counted 35 people that you know it's what's the leadership

647
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:35,239
required to change that conversation you know talk about australia being the lucky country

648
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,239
i still fight i can't get my head around that still i can't for all the things in life that

649
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:45,280
that is still what it is i it's a deep question mate but i i don't know where to go with it

650
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,219
yeah well when mr horn horn sorry coined the phrase a lucky country the next line after that

651
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:58,139
was run by mediocre um people so yes lucky but not fulfilling its potential i think and i think

652
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:02,360
in my view i think australia getting a bit sort of broader here but i think australia is sort of

653
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,880
relied on a lot of things that are a bit easier whether it's some

654
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:09,679
you know mining dig a hole shove it in the barrel wheel it away sell it you know it's not a genius

655
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:14,699
sort of uh operation i just don't think we're as creative as we could be and as a innovative as we

656
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:18,380
could be there's so many great minds that leave australia it's you know when you when you travel

657
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:23,579
overseas if the world was australia australia'd be wogger you know a couple of good sportsmen

658
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,800
have come from there but no one really knows about it no one gives a shit about australia until

659
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,599
there's a a big fire or some drama goes on but when you're overseas australia doesn't exist

660
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,480
and we're quite myopic i think and uh

661
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:41,260
if you have got it so good because we um got it so good i think that lulls us into a false sense

662
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:46,500
security and we you know we carry on and whinge about the tiniest things that you know um others

663
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,019
other countries don't even discuss because it's not important you know i think we've often we've

664
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:56,079
got it so good we don't stop to appreciate how good it is how much better we could be if we um

665
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,840
worked worked you know worked as a team to us and i think you know there's too much time spent

666
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:05,000
wondering who's going to get the credit for stuff rather than just doing stuff you get so much more

667
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,360
we don't care who gets the credit you know just do it and tell someone else it was their idea

668
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,860
they'll puff their chest up and go and make it happen i love that idea you had last week

669
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:17,059
like oh god i thought that might have been your yep right off i go you know so i think it's about

670
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:22,880
you know giving people the um the confidence to go out and you know and be their best and um

671
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,780
i just think yeah just generally in australia we just take it a bit for granted and we we really

672
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,440
wouldn't know it's a fair perspective uh jose when you think about it is as the the problems here

673
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,340
when you consider world problems just aren't significant and you know it's a it's a it's a

674
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,460
perhaps then you know we create them in our mind don't we and we build them into things that they

675
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:45,340
don't need to be someone said to me jason i like uh referencing it success leaves clues and and

676
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:50,599
your life has been full as i said of uh incredible stories and we see these dimensions of different

677
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:55,280
leadership that we're fascinated about in our space at a leader and connecting great leadership

678
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,199
stories and yours is as i said incredibly interesting to me but we think it's hard to

679
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:03,900
lead other people jace without a sense of self-leadership yours is unique mate you're

680
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,340
authentically yourself what it

681
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:10,420
what does that mean to you well i don't know anything else you know i i don't have um gears

682
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:14,440
i once heard mick malloy commented on his acting and said it's five percent either way of mick

683
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,519
malloy you know so i think whatever i do is five percent either way of jason kimberley you know i

684
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:27,219
i think um i i don't have um uh you know different gears necessarily and i think um you know i i

685
00:37:27,219 --> 00:37:32,619
think a few mates a few mates of mine have got fairly high profile public lives and i mean they

686
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:35,340
said to me early on when they were sort of diving into it you know you've got a lot of

687
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:41,039
things i said just be yourself i said the sooner you can be yourself in your job you don't be what

688
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:46,400
anyone what you think anyone wants you to be be yourself and the sooner you can be yourself in

689
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,360
life some people die without being themselves they're always trying to please other people

690
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,619
or whatever it is but i think i worked it out in the early 20s that the quicker you can be yourself

691
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:59,820
and i mean legitimately yourself not holding back not putting on something false that's not you

692
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:04,840
and i sometimes you get into trouble it can be a bit tricky let's be clear but if you're not your

693
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,659
who the hell are you you know you're poncing around trying to impress people that you don't

694
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:15,679
like uh you know to care about you um you know so i i just think my my advice on leadership is

695
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:21,559
absolutely be you um and whatever that is and it's difficult to to be yourself i have lots of

696
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:27,659
tests people oh but i couldn't say that i couldn't do that like i'm like it's just a pg show um yeah

697
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:34,440
so i think that that to me is um um critical in leadership and the sooner you can do that it's um

698
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,519
i'd say that is um not caring what other people think i know that's a trite thing to say but

699
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:44,219
it's none of my business what people think of me you know i get the odd secondhand story and

700
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:50,039
they're usually wildly inaccurate my my reputation exceeds me does but if you can legitimately not

701
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:55,699
care about what other people think coupled with being yourself i think that to me is the secret

702
00:38:55,699 --> 00:39:00,940
to success yeah beautifully said mate and and authentically you is uh is what you are in every

703
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,840
situation that i've ever seen you in and yeah you've had an amazing impact as i said

704
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:09,119
on thousands with what you've created with cool but how do you think about we see the ladies are

705
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,920
really conscious now jace on a daily basis they really care about how they impact people positively

706
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,800
on a daily basis how have you thought about that i think the thing is i probably don't maybe i should

707
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:25,400
more i sort of i'm this sort of i tend to visualize things i see myself just drifting down the river

708
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,599
of life and whatever i come across i come across i speak to someone that i go i said well they say

709
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,019
oh no i've got my plan for now then i've got this plan i go jesus mate yeah you know i think you're

710
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,920
what if your plan doesn't work out will you be disappointed so i tend to have sort of zero

711
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,980
expectations so nothing goes bad so if you're going to something go oh how was it or you know

712
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,960
people go to a movie and watch it oh i've heard it since it's too long i don't want to hear it i

713
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,960
just need to go in cold i i really try and remove any expectations from anything i do

714
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,340
um there'll always be something there you don't want to be a total disaster

715
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:04,599
um but i just think if if you have expectations it just leads to disappointment so i could get

716
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:10,559
them out scratch them and whatever happens is going to be good yeah and again mate that's you

717
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:15,840
being authentic to you steve hooker on this podcast the olympic pole molding gold medalist just he

718
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:22,400
could picture himself going over six meters to the most minute detail many many years before so when

719
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,880
it came to that moment he'd seen it a hundred and you know thousands of times in his head and his

720
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,360
life plays out that way and the work that he's doing now but that's him being him isn't it and

721
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,239
i think as you said coming back if you're trying to be a version of yourself that's

722
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,539
you you're in real trouble uh i think you've articulated that beautifully creating and

723
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:43,739
sharing your vision i mean you say you're drifting down the river of life and you're

724
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:48,800
taking what comes but you clearly don't create something to the level that you have and you've

725
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,079
done that in you know dozens of areas without having a vision and been able to create and

726
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:57,699
share it so how do you do that with your version yeah i suppose i got a nod off a bit when on the

727
00:40:57,699 --> 00:41:01,139
strategy day when they have what's the vision was i go for christ's sake we all know what we're

728
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:05,340
doing that's you know and you sort of spend six hours there and you know whatever

729
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:10,860
your coffee's and wake up every day and make a contribution but um i i what's the second i think

730
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:15,699
it just does tie back to that sort of positivity and that i think it's also the communication piece

731
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:20,340
and being really clear to people what you want and you know don't don't tell me show me you know

732
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:24,880
show me what you're wearing up to what have you done and i think if you can get yourself into

733
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,019
trouble in a leadership role if you um don't have a tight enough control on what's going on i'm not

734
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:35,340
saying could but where where i find i've come down or knocked on the ground and i've come down

735
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:41,440
so well is i've put too much trust in others or i haven't briefed them and trained them well enough

736
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:47,280
so then i look at that and that comes back to me so i look anyone in my organizations um who have

737
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:54,179
had a fail i look at that and say okay that's that's on me what what didn't i or those uh around

738
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:58,860
me what didn't we give that person did we give them the best chance to succeed or did we sort

739
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:02,739
of go off them a bit after six months and they sort of fizzled out on the on the vine and we

740
00:42:02,739 --> 00:42:05,340
didn't give them a go so um i think being a

741
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:10,780
of that and and being responsible i think you know responsibility i mean everyone shirks

742
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:15,400
responsibility these days look at our politicians our business leaders wasn't me it was him it was

743
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,800
like that when i found it you know uh you know and i just that just really bothers me and irks

744
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,599
me i think the world will be a better place i mean look what's going on in america take

745
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:28,619
responsibility for your actions you know the things we're taught as a kid you know don't lie

746
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:32,739
don't steal be responsible be on all these things as soon as you become an adult that's all out the

747
00:42:32,739 --> 00:42:35,199
window and that's you know don't cheat at your tests

748
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:40,239
and in the business world that's called um you know good corporate uh uh investigation or

749
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:44,500
something so i don't know i think there's there's sort of a a big change in what we're taught as

750
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:49,139
kids and what we do as adults and i think that gap is too big and i think you know younger

751
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:55,260
generations are looking at at adults and um and say i just don't don't believe you you're feeding

752
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:59,320
me the bollocks here i've got to you know either work it out for myself or what you're telling me

753
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:04,460
is demonstrably untrue and how can i you know be passionate about following all your leadership

754
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,340
yeah i love your point

755
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,119
unaccountability is and it feels like a lost art doesn't it and this sort of what even is

756
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,300
truth now and people are literally stand there and and and gaslight someone in front of them and

757
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,639
and you know you're not even sitting here jason you know apparently that's where the world's got

758
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:23,300
stop hitting me luke yeah that's right the old you know there's such a brilliant thing is that

759
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:28,099
when someone puts their hand up and says you know what i completely balls that up that was a hundred

760
00:43:28,099 --> 00:43:33,920
percent mate there's nowhere else to go and you know i know you uh you're the great shane warren

761
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,340
and i always feel such a privilege to be a part of that and i think that's a great thing to do

762
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,159
to have uh been in his company a number of times but that was his superpower for me warning just

763
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:45,260
yet that was my mistake completely own it and everyone he loved him even more because you know

764
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:50,000
he was superhuman but then he showed you how human he could be from time to time your curiosity comes

765
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,360
up with you a lot uh jason you mentioned that around this curious brain and through that we see

766
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,539
those really approach their learning development through curiosity does that ring true for you

767
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:03,360
it does and i i think to also you've got to be able to develop and that's come naturally to me

768
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,340
and i know it doesn't come naturally to everyone you know you've got to be able to develop it and

769
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,599
talk to them i go you know why would i be interested in that so it's sort of there it's

770
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:14,239
not but how you how you can engender a love of learning how can you get kids who don't necessarily

771
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:20,119
have that curiosity how can you you know spark that uh that fire in them and and i think it

772
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:26,139
comes back to that engaging element having the real world in the uh in the lessons having something

773
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:30,340
that's uh a bit of a special source so we want a template for our lessons and there's certain

774
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:34,440
things that need to be achieved in each one and one what's the special source what's the wow factor

775
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,340
when someone goes shit i don't know what to do with that and i think that's a really good thing

776
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:41,179
i had no idea wow you know literally wow when does the kid say wow in the lesson so that to me

777
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:45,539
says the kids engaged they want to learn and they want to go on and the same thing you know for the

778
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:51,079
educator you know now my kids uh look at me and going wow we had a letter from a teacher up in

779
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:57,159
ipswich a bloke year nine math student is disengaged no interest whatsoever and he took

780
00:44:57,159 --> 00:45:01,059
them outside and we've got some for this purpose some outdoor math lessons all about areas

781
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:05,159
measurements etc etc and he's uh taking the boys back in the class and he said

782
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:10,539
oh sir that was the best lesson you've ever taught us he said just as i was puffing my chest out with

783
00:45:10,539 --> 00:45:15,079
pride they said it wasn't one of yours was it and he said no it wasn't actually it was uh one from

784
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:18,940
cool they said more of those that was that was the best math lesson we've ever done so you know

785
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:23,780
when you get feedback like that from there's there's now a group or a year ago of you know

786
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:30,360
20 boys in ipswich who couldn't give a shit about maths who are now into it because of a lesson that

787
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,420
got into the hands of this teacher and he took them outside for 45 minutes and he said they've

788
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,340
never been more focused and they've never been more focused and they've never been more focused

789
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:40,639
and they loved it and uh you know it's uh those sort of stories that happen and we also had a

790
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:45,940
child care center early learning center out in the west of sydney that was a a bit rough and there's

791
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:50,000
a lot of issues at home and people are not getting fed and sort of coming to school fairly sort of

792
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,659
disheveled and lots of yelling and screaming in the car park and the um early learning center

793
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:58,480
leader had been doing some of our mindfulness um just you know two or three minutes not

794
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,340
do that with the kids and then the kids took it home to the parents and this lady wrote us this

795
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,139
beautiful letter about how the whole

796
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:09,219
school a whole early learning center the whole vibe had changed there was no more yelling

797
00:46:09,219 --> 00:46:14,420
no more shouting the kids had taken it home the parents had absorbed it and everyone's having a

798
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,500
bit of quiet time not no just a couple of minutes to have a little think just gather our thoughts

799
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:23,420
and uh she said thank you you've changed the whole dynamic of my center so it's just you know all

800
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:27,719
those little things just you know add up and add up and you've got all these great stories and uh

801
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:32,460
i think it's important to storytell and have a great narrative in the lessons and the work we do

802
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,340
and how brilliant to have teachers curious to actually go and find your

803
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:40,300
resource and want to implement it and then share those stories is is profound so it's what aren't

804
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:44,840
amazing as i said the contribution that you made on that front communicating with clarity

805
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:51,239
uh something we see everyone who really gets this right consistently have a real sense of how they

806
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:56,500
communicate jace how have you gone about that um i think you know just to touch back on i think it's

807
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:01,840
important to really set expectations clearly and follow up follow up is critical an expectation

808
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,280
on someone else's this is your own expectation

809
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:10,659
but now you're going to do this um but the follow-up if there's no follow-up or the show

810
00:47:10,659 --> 00:47:14,840
me don't tell me show me i think that that's just good for everyone to know that you know i think

811
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,900
it's human nature if you're not being if you think no one's watching well you can drift off

812
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:23,300
we all do right but if you know someone's uh you're gonna something has to be done by four

813
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,400
o'clock wednesday well guess what you're gonna do it but if it's i'll get it to me when you can

814
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:32,139
it's a different conversation so so um there's that and also i think those sort of it's like

815
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:35,280
a guardrail you know when you go to the bowling alley and you know the kids and they

816
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:39,699
pop it up so you can't go in the gutter you've got to sort of install guardrails on something

817
00:47:39,699 --> 00:47:44,400
sometimes so we just don't make a daft error you know and why do we make that because we

818
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,440
weren't experienced and we didn't know so you know have some sort of guardrails going there

819
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:53,260
and i think something you know that uh i think it was harry truman that first uh said this or

820
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:59,260
where i got it from is never kick a fresh turd on a hot day let things settle down das let it

821
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:05,139
settle down there's no point when things are when there's high anxiety and the red mists in the air

822
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:11,400
just let it settle give it 24 hours and uh and come back and address it then um so i think that's

823
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:17,940
something that's never never kick a fresh turd on a hot day there's a life lesson i'm writing that

824
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:22,099
one down i think i pinched it from harry truman well done harry might have been a derivative of

825
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:27,219
something he said but uh it's very true though isn't it when you're fired up and you're gonna

826
00:48:27,219 --> 00:48:32,119
fire up an email pick up a call that you're gonna probably regret i've done a few of those done a

827
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:35,260
few of those recently don't do it when you're angry and don't do it after a couple of years

828
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:41,099
hey jace how important's collaboration been for you you know it's mission critical collaboration

829
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:46,719
particularly when you're a small organization with uh no cloud and um what's his name uh see

830
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:51,099
the the art of war um you know when you're small look big and when you're big look small so we've

831
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:56,800
been small trying to look big for for a long time and um now we're a little bit bigger we sometimes

832
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,659
try and look a bit smaller or you know but there's still huge competitors out there that we're working

833
00:49:00,659 --> 00:49:05,340
against so i think it's really uh appreciating where you know you are and you know you're

834
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:10,539
and then i think with your business but also i think you need to project something a little bit

835
00:49:10,539 --> 00:49:14,659
different because only you know what's going on behind the scenes and how horrible it can be at

836
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:20,219
times and uh you know we've been six weeks away from going bust a couple of times over the last

837
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:26,199
15 years and that really you know brings a bit of reality and pressure to the situation so i think

838
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:30,840
it's important to have something at work that is really clear you know to the start because all the

839
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:34,699
all the all your team don't want to know about you know the financial ins and outs you know

840
00:49:34,699 --> 00:49:35,340
they'd be you know

841
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:39,960
everyone would freeze and there'd be sort of you know panic at the at the place it's sort of been

842
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,480
my experience so i think it's part of that is being showing that leadership of you know everything's

843
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:51,380
okay even when it's not and um and sticking to that and being really strong on on that message

844
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:57,199
so i think it's uh i'd say a brave front but i think you need to be a show some strength of

845
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:00,599
character when things are going orderly because when it's good you know it's good and it's great

846
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:05,239
and you know the the biggest challenge when it's going good is you know you can um

847
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:10,380
get a bit lazy and and think it's all your genius but the reality is there's a lot of luck involved

848
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:15,039
a lot of timing involved and like they say in the footy it's never as bad or as good as it seems and

849
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:21,340
i think it's important to uh to remember that and um the uh yeah and i think this the clarity of

850
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:26,340
direction is is also important to us if you're if you're not clear about what you're doing um

851
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:31,440
i think you just go around in circles so as much as i'm not a fan of sitting down for a day and

852
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,340
working out the vision the strategy every two years or what's changed um i think it's important to

853
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:40,960
do appreciate that it has got its role and is important but uh um i think yeah being being

854
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,940
staying true to yourself and sticking to your guns is critical no doubt you're staying true to

855
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,619
yourself is uh is something that you've got from uh from the youngest possible age uh who's been

856
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:55,699
the greatest leader in your life um well gosh it'd be hard to go past dad um i think you know for

857
00:50:55,699 --> 00:51:01,239
that you know real close um uh face to face and just you know seeing him get through all the stuff

858
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:05,179
he's done you know everything from uh you know when he was 35

859
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:11,139
just gene stores in uh victoria that no one had really sort of heard of that much um in the 1977

860
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:16,599
grand final the first time it was broadcast live he somehow wangled just genes on as the co-sponsor

861
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:23,860
with cub of the grand final a retailer with 35 stores only victoria and i reckon he reckons he

862
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:29,480
got over 1500 letters from people all around the the country because i went to wa and south australia

863
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,840
and maybe i'm sure if we went to new south wales and queensland anyway people in hospital said i'd

864
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,039
never thought i'd see a grand final thank you so much

865
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:40,960
and i threw it in the ensuing months sales went through the roof um they expanded in new south

866
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,460
wales and the business took off like a rocket so just pulling that lever and you know just grabbing

867
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:51,159
that and making that happen i think that was one of his greatest moves he he ever uh ever did so um

868
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:57,380
yeah so that was that was awesome i uh i really used to uh enjoy bob hawk um you know a bit of a

869
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:04,119
consensus uh um a man and uh wanting to you know get all the people sort of buy into what he was

870
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:05,340
doing i uh i

871
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,880
admired that in uh in him he had some uh he was connected to to the family bob when he would have

872
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:15,059
bob he was the number one ticket holder at the swans and uh he was um had a bit of a penchant

873
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:20,460
for uh for the for the ladies and i i do recall mum mum having to drive him home several times

874
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:27,599
from swans functions um back to his house down in by morris um uh yeah so bob did enjoy a a party

875
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:33,159
and a cold beer on a warm day bob was partial to uh along the journey um if you could collaborate

876
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:35,340
with anyone on on anything and i'm you know i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm

877
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:35,559

We were, you know, an absolute pimple on an ass back then.

899
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:12,699
And she didn't know this, so we'd meet twice a year

900
00:53:12,699 --> 00:53:14,559
and have a beer or wine after work.

901
00:53:14,739 --> 00:53:18,059
And then a couple of years, oh, I think she'd been on for two years now.

902
00:53:18,139 --> 00:53:21,179
And then four years ago, I said, I think it'd be a great move for you

903
00:53:21,179 --> 00:53:22,699
to come on as chair as a call.

904
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,980
Oh, I'm too busy with that.

905
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:25,119
And so she went off and came away.

906
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,840
She said, call me in November, 1st of November, Jan.

907
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,219
I think it'd be really great for you to come on as our chair.

908
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,679
And she said, you're going to wear me down, aren't you?

909
00:53:32,699 --> 00:53:34,059
I said, I haven't even started yet.

910
00:53:34,059 --> 00:53:37,599
So she came on, and she's great, and she's got a fantastic background.

911
00:53:37,739 --> 00:53:39,679
She's originally from Queensland, and she's,

912
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:43,400
or her family's always been amazing sort of on the social scene

913
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,440
and helping others.

914
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:48,739
She ran the foundation for Australians and all about helping kids

915
00:53:48,739 --> 00:53:51,360
engage in their learning, you know, the $20 BOSS program,

916
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,719
the Worlds of Work program, which we also supported through CORE.

917
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:56,880
So she's an absolute jet.

918
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,800
So she's our chair.

919
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,159
And the other one is Thea Stenier,

920
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,639
who I met at a science teacher's conference.

921
00:54:03,099 --> 00:54:03,639
I was wearing.

922
00:54:04,059 --> 00:54:06,679
I was wearing these strides, and I had.

923
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:12,340
Chase is just, well, could only be described as maybe Happy Gilmore's pants,

924
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,579
or Chase has got a unique style of dress.

925
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,059
We'll capture that.

926
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:18,119
You know, you actually, if you walked in the studio,

927
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,699
you bought them from an op shop, but you had to get them tailored to fit you.

928
00:54:21,699 --> 00:54:22,820
Tailored to fit, exactly.

929
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:25,840
They're sort of the, how would you describe them, Chase?

930
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,920
They're like a golfer's pants.

931
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,780
Oh, you call, you know, pajama pants, golfer's pants, all that.

932
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,639
Where's your golf sticks?

933
00:54:30,699 --> 00:54:31,239
That's all right.

934
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:34,039
And just bring your light and color to your world, you boys.

935
00:54:34,059 --> 00:54:34,579
Boring bastard.

936
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:36,760
That's not you, Darcy.

937
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,639
That's anyone who inquires.

938
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:38,380
But also, Thea.

939
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:41,719
So I met at the science teacher's conference, and I had the book, you know,

940
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,960
Antarctica, A Different Adventure, with my mate, Jase Veal,

941
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,539
sort of nude on the front cover, thankfully pointing the other way.

942
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:48,500
I always thought that was you nude on the cover, Jase.

943
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,960
No, I'm a little shorter through the thighs.

944
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:51,219
You need to pick that up.

945
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,619
And Thea came over and said, this looks like a bit of a different cat.

946
00:54:54,679 --> 00:54:55,639
I wonder what he's up to.

947
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,360
So she came over and said, oh, you come and talk to my school.

948
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:58,920
And I spoke.

949
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:00,000
I went one afternoon.

950
00:55:00,099 --> 00:55:00,800
She tells the story.

951
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,639
Friday afternoon, she gave me the death slot.

952
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:03,579
2 p.m.

953
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:04,039
on a Friday.

954
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,039
I had two, a group of science kids.

955
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:08,940
And she said, oh, you just brought them to life.

956
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:11,659
She said, at that moment, I knew I wanted to come and work for you.

957
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:13,960
And I thought, at that moment, I knew I wanted you to come and work.

958
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,860
So I rang her up after a couple more talks at school and said,

959
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,760
why don't you, instead of teaching at Brentwood,

960
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:21,139
why don't you come to Corland and teach the country?

961
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,780
She said, jeez, you had me at that.

962
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,519
And so she came along.

963
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,719
So we've been working together for over a decade.

964
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,460
And I've known Jan for over 12 years.

965
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:33,019
So I am so happy with the gun team that we've got.

966
00:55:33,579 --> 00:55:36,239
I couldn't imagine anyone else that I want to work with.

967
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,460
There might be, you know, someone who might sound good in that,

968
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,460
but I haven't got the 10 years history with them.

969
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:42,400
So it would be a risk.

970
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,719
So I would say, Darce, I'm happy with the crew I've got.

971
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,099
And I'm wrapped with who's there.

972
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,900
And they've both been a long haul to get in.

973
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:51,280
And they've both been amazing.

974
00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:53,099
What a great position to be in, isn't it,

975
00:55:53,139 --> 00:55:55,380
to have the people around you that you want to take it forward.

976
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:59,500
And as you said, it's the never-ending story, isn't it,

977
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,219
to try and impact teachers around the globe.

978
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,300
It's a great mission.

979
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,219
And you've stopped and paused, as you should do today,

980
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,039
to celebrate, as I said.

981
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:09,380
It's an amazing achievement from nothing,

982
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,519
from a trip to Antarctica to do what you've done, Jase.

983
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,679
It's an incredible effort.

984
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:14,880
Congratulations again.

985
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,239
I love, mate, catching up with you.

986
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,599
And the message that rings true is be uniquely yourself, mate.

987
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:22,159
No one's ever going to accuse you of anything apart from that.

988
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,139
And it's a really inspiring story, mate.

989
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:24,920
Thanks for sharing it today.

990
00:56:25,099 --> 00:56:25,599
Thanks, Darce.

991
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:27,440
I've just got something for you I wanted to ask,

992
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,179
I meant to ask earlier.

993
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:28,980
Now, wellness.

994
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:30,420
You're into wellness.

995
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,000
Can you be too well?

996
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,179
It seems like a lot of hard work, Darce, is wellness.

997
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,000
Can you be too well?

998
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,340
Do you know what's funny, isn't it?

999
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:42,019
My great mate, Bob Murphy, from the Western Bulldogs,

1000
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:44,119
who you will love, and I know you do,

1001
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,860
because he's got some similarities to you,

1002
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:47,820
one of the most articulate.

1003
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:52,400
The worst thing I've ever done in my life was belt Robert Murphy

1004
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,820
in a practice game at training.

1005
00:56:54,099 --> 00:56:55,400
And as I often say to people,

1006
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,340
I had known that he was going to go on and be one of the all-time greats.

1007
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:00,780
I might have thought twice about it.

1008
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,280
There's a back story to that.

1009
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,519
The coach asked me to start a fight.

1010
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:05,980
But anyway, I'm not going to make an excuse for myself.

1011
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:07,659
It was a very poor thing to do,

1012
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:11,199
to knock Robert Murphy out like one of our all-time greats.

1013
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,860
And he sees me now and he says,

1014
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,559
mate, from the guy who punched me in a practice game,

1015
00:57:16,659 --> 00:57:17,300
I think you've overmeditated.

1016
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:23,119
I think you've turned the needle too far the other way.

1017
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,360
It can be too well.

1018
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:26,079
We need you back in the middle somewhere.

1019
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,619
So I think you're right, Jase.

1020
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:31,579
As the 80, 20-year-old, you still want to, for me,

1021
00:57:31,579 --> 00:57:32,280
have as much fun.

1022
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,440
And plenty of mischief with you is always something I'm up for.

1023
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:38,320
But there's a balance somewhere in the middle there.

1024
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,119
Of course there is.

1025
00:57:39,219 --> 00:57:39,719
Fair question.

1026
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:40,380
Thanks, mate.

1027
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,019
Good to see you, Jase.

1028
00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:41,739
Thanks for having me, Daz.

1029
00:57:42,179 --> 00:57:44,639
