00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:08,470
This week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast is a truly remarkable thought leader,

2
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:14,830
Geoffrey Cole, recording from Los Angeles today and his incredible insight into the

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:20,030
world of digital media, the internet, and the future of all things digital communication.

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:27,329
You'll hear Geoff talk about chat GBT as the biggest disruptor and change to society since

5
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:32,229
the printing press and personal computer, which in itself is an amazing conversation.

6
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:38,369
Geoff shares the secrets to Elon Musk, the four key pillars to Musk as he describes them.

7
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:43,969
He says you can never count him out, describes him as the Thomas Edison of the 21st century

8
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:49,030
and a quintuple disruptor given the breadth of work that Elon Musk is doing.

9
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:50,229
You want to hear that conversation.

10
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:55,990
His thoughts on microchip manufacturing being the most important and indestructible sector

11
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:01,590
in the global business world, as well as a deep dive into TikTok, Chinese government's

12
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,969
influence.

13
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,430
And where social media is heading for future generations.

14
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:10,650
It's conversations like this with Geoffrey Cole that inspire the work we do at Alita.

15
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:15,730
Head to alitacollective.com to check out our work, in particular, our signature program,

16
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,349
Alita Connect.

17
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,810
Thought leaders like Geoff Cole, we love sharing information on how to learn and how to share

18
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,310
and how to collaborate with different people.

19
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,650
And that's what we do with Alita Connect.

20
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,569
We bring together groups of five or six thought leaders from around the globe.

21
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,049
You don't have to be an internationally recognized expert.

22
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,409
Like Geoffrey Cole to be part of that community.

23
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:40,629
We love sharing that with people from entrepreneurial backgrounds or the arts or sport or social

24
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:41,010
venture.

25
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,450
So I'd love you to check it out.

26
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:43,810
Head to alitacollective.com.

27
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,969
Huge thanks as always to Jason Nicholas and his team from Timper for supporting conversations

28
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:50,409
like this one with Geoffrey Cole.

29
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:55,890
We know great leaders and successful people really value sleep and getting a good night's

30
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,129
sleep is the key to success for many great leaders.

31
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:00,030
Investing in the best mattress in the world.

32
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:02,129
Timper is a mattress like no other.

33
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:02,189
Timper is a mattress like no other.

34
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:02,430
Timper is a mattress like no other.

35
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,849
Timper is something that you will not regret.

36
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:07,209
I encourage you to check out and have a look at a Timper mattress today.

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:19,180
Geoffrey Cole was described in 1999 by then American Vice President Al Gore as a true

38
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,599
visionary, providing the public with information on how to understand the impact of media.

39
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,099
For over three decades, Geoff has been at the forefront of media and communication technology

40
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:32,699
and served as advisor to governments around the world, as well as some of the most influential

41
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:35,960
businesses like Ericsson, Telstra here in Australia.

42
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:43,139
They're Wes Farmers, AT&T, Coca-Cola, NBC, CBC, ABC, and countless others on how to navigate

43
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:44,240
their digital future.

44
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,979
Geoffrey Cole is the founder and directs the World Internet Project, a long-term longitudinal

45
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:55,280
study looking at the effects of computer and internet technology conducted in over 35 countries.

46
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,020
Geoff, it's always fascinating to chat with you.

47
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,419
I really appreciate you taking the time today.

48
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:02,479
Luke, it's been a while since we were on the radio.

49
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:03,840
It's great to be back.

50
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
Really, it's nice to be talking to you.

51
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,060
And to reach some of Australia.

52
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,780
I know I'm going to learn a lot, as I always do, whenever I get the chance to sit down with you.

53
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,800
I'm a father of four, Geoff, and I think if you were able to survey parents in the developed

54
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,439
world, my thoughts are the number one concern and topic of conversation would be the addictive

55
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,080
algorithms of social media that are really making it hard for our kids to focus.

56
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:30,060
And you've got a great ability to look into the future.

57
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,099
Where does this obsession with being on our phones end up for future generations, in your view?

58
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:35,740
Well, I think it's really important to look into the future.

59
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:35,819
I think it's really important to look into the future.

60
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,280
Well, first, and it's really important, when we talk about the impact of phones and technology,

61
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,159
the positive impact has been extraordinary.

62
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:51,340
The reach it gives us around the world, what Mark Zuckerberg says he intended with Facebook,

63
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:58,460
I'm not sure I believe him, the ability to connect, the ability to really be part of

64
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,740
something is phenomenal.

65
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,159
Unfortunately, it hasn't worked out that way.

66
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,740
What we're really finding is...

67
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,259
We're sort of insulating on these phones.

68
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:13,340
We're not interacting as much with the world.

69
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:18,040
We're comparing ourselves unrealistically to people on Instagram.

70
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:26,160
We know that Gen Z, the first generation that has had digital technology their entire life,

71
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:33,579
even before COVID, is the loneliest generation filled with the most anxiety and depression.

72
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:35,779
So clearly, these things have...

73
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,639
They have not worked out the way they're intended or intended to work out.

74
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,639
And when you have four kids, you have to be an activist parent.

75
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,620
Sometimes you'll pay a pretty serious price for that.

76
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,959
But you really have to know how much they're on, which things they're doing.

77
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,980
But it's changed.

78
00:04:54,259 --> 00:05:00,500
When I grew up, the rules of parenting, parents all said the same three or four things.

79
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,120
Look both ways before crossing.

80
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,500
Don't ever get into a car or...

81
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,459
Take candy from a stranger.

82
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:09,639
And one or two other things.

83
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,740
Now there's a whole new set of rules about digital technology.

84
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:18,019
Don't ever tell anybody where you are.

85
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:20,459
Give out information you don't have to.

86
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,699
Don't ever meet anybody who you don't know.

87
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,899
Digital technology has transformed childhood.

88
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:31,899
And frankly, not to sound like an old guy critic, not a whole lot for the better.

89
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,879
I feel the same myself.

90
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,699
Is that you're trying to stay in touch.

91
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,800
With your kids, it's almost the impossible task.

92
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:43,100
I was talking in this format with an expert on cyber safety who's done remarkable work

93
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,139
around the world in trying to enlighten parents on the problems of your kids having access

94
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,060
to that in the privacy of their own bedroom.

95
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:55,680
And she said to me, I would much rather my teenage child at midnight walked around the

96
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,779
block in her pajamas.

97
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:01,779
I'd feel more safe than actually allowing her in her own room with her own phone because

98
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,259
of I know what's out there.

99
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:04,980
I know the possibilities of people who can...

100
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,019
And reach your kids in your bedroom.

101
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,600
Do you think we've grasped when I get the positive part, I get the connection part,

102
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,939
but has that been superseded by the negative part in your mind?

103
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:14,819
Yes.

104
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:16,860
I think the negative is dominating.

105
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:22,100
That's quite a statement that you'd rather your kids were out walking the street at midnight,

106
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,680
but I understand it.

107
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,160
But think about it in simple ways.

108
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,899
Once again, to play on the old guy part, I grew up and when I was in high school and

109
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:34,019
I wanted to call my friends.

110
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,199
I would call.

111
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,540
One line in a house, more often than not, their parents would answer.

112
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,800
They would know I was calling.

113
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,220
They would grill me a little bit and we'd chat.

114
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,519
Then they'd let me talk to my friend Dave.

115
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,920
Well, the first thing these phones have done, one of the first complaints we've heard for

116
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,180
15 years now is parents say, we don't know who our kid's friends are.

117
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,680
They communicate with...

118
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,620
And incidentally, that's the first step to knowing your kid may be headed in a bad direction.

119
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,120
So yeah, I don't want to...

120
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,639
I don't want to sound like a complainer.

121
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:11,860
I mean, part of being a generation or two ahead of them, we're not supposed to like

122
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,620
their music.

123
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:16,399
We're not supposed to like the way they talk.

124
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,480
That's the way it's supposed to be.

125
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:19,699
And that's normal.

126
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,980
I've been going on since every generation since the Greeks.

127
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:29,740
But something really special, really powerful is happening with digital technology.

128
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,319
Yeah, I explained that to my kids.

129
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,079
I went to boarding school and we had the one pay phone and you got a slot.

130
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,000
Once every two weeks to either call home or if you're lucky enough that you had a girl

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,439
you thought you might be able to get access to.

132
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,220
And you had your 15 friends in the queue behind you listening to every word that you were

133
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,620
saying.

134
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,300
Yeah, but your kids' eyes roll over when you...

135
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,519
Correct.

136
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,660
They roll their eyes when you tell those stories.

137
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,519
And they should.

138
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:57,500
When I was a kid, I walked seven miles through the snow to go to school.

139
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,920
That's what they expect.

140
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:04,399
And on that note, Jeff, I had the first experience of TikTok with my teenage daughter not too

141
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,019
long ago.

142
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,319
And she said something to me along the lines of, are you on Team Johnny Depp or Team Amber

143
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:10,660
Heard?

144
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,639
And I said, what are you talking about?

145
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,720
And then she showed me her TikTok account, which I'd never seen before.

146
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,420
And that had been disseminated, that court case that went on for months and months into

147
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,319
these 30-second soundbites.

148
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,259
And I looked at it and I thought I'd been watching for five minutes.

149
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:29,160
It was 45 minutes later.

150
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,659
It was so good to get you into the next clip.

151
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,240
How big is TikTok?

152
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,100
Is that...

153
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,360
Becoming a big presence?

154
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,440
Well, first of all, that was a pretty amazing case.

155
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:47,159
An A-plus movie star, a girlfriend who was making allegations about things left in the

156
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,980
bed that are best on set on this podcast.

157
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:51,440
It was pretty...

158
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:55,519
Really, you couldn't have scripted better drama.

159
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,740
But incidentally, just to digress for a second, that's not kids.

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,179
I'm following this trial right now of Sam Bankman.

161
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,419
Sam Bankman freed the guy from FTX who was worth $32 billion before it collapsed and

162
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:14,940
all the incredible fraud and drama of crypto.

163
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:17,700
But TikTok, the goal of...

164
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,159
And this isn't said with any disrespect.

165
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:30,440
The goal of all these digital services, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snap, the goal is to keep

166
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:30,940
you there.

167
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,700
Because as they keep you there, they can serve you advertising.

168
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,360
And that's how they make their money.

169
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,000
And there's nothing inherently in evil about that.

170
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,320
You know, since we were kids, broadcast television made their money by putting on content we

171
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,220
wanted to watch and selling advertising around it.

172
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:55,580
The problem is the things that TikTok and Facebook and Instagram have to do to keep

173
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,259
our attention.

174
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,620
Some of it is really interesting stuff.

175
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,639
And that TikTok's filled with that.

176
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:04,639
But some of it, Facebook learned earlier.

177
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:13,299
The best way to keep you on the site was not to throw you and make you excited and

178
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:13,960
informed.

179
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:17,539
It was to get you angry and riled up.

180
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:22,500
And that anger was what kept you watching or appealing to your puritan interest.

181
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,100
And TikTok is this amazing combination.

182
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:33,840
People I take very seriously really do believe that information is going back to the Chinese.

183
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,659
I have...

184
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:34,679
I have...

185
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,220
I have no evidence of that.

186
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:42,039
I'm not sure what the Chinese would do with the fact that you spent 45 minutes looking

187
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:44,840
at the Amber Heard Johnny Depp case.

188
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,679
But people, you know, people I really respect do think the Chinese are monitoring.

189
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,940
But it is truly, it is every technique of addictiveness that you will find with almost

190
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,899
any other stimulant.

191
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:04,179
It is really giving you a constant hit, whether it's likes.

192
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,460
Whether it's fast cutting.

193
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,059
It is really to keep you there and get you to watch.

194
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:12,879
And it sounds like it worked for you with Johnny Depp.

195
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,659
It got me, Jeff, in a way that I couldn't believe.

196
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:20,039
I would have thought that I was, you know, that sounds egotistical.

197
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:22,019
I didn't have an interest in it until I did.

198
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:26,179
And then the way it was so smart that you wanted to see the next clip.

199
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:27,960
But I was just fascinated by it.

200
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,740
I'm in the sandbank.

201
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,059
How are the Kardashians in their 10th season?

202
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,559
People who have never done a thing in their life.

203
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,419
And yet fans can't stop watching.

204
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:41,759
You also feel like you're intruding into something you shouldn't be part of.

205
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:44,799
I think that's part of the Depp Heard case.

206
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,799
All those celebrities.

207
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:49,759
We learned all that with OJ 25, 30 years ago.

208
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,000
And you mentioned the Chinese government.

209
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,100
I mean, part of governments around the world are banning government employees from having

210
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,519
access to TikTok.

211
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,539
As you said, people you respect and you're connected into serious levels of business

212
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:03,539
around that.

213
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:04,539
Eavesdropping people.

214
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:05,539
I mean, that's a huge potential.

215
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:09,679
Is that obviously something you've heard before, but you're not sure about?

216
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,200
It goes back a ways.

217
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,519
The Australian government was one of the first to ban the government itself from using Huawei

218
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:24,500
equipment with the belief that Huawei phones and Huawei servers were implanted with listening

219
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,620
devices.

220
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,500
And this is not watching the Johnny Depp trial.

221
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,779
This is business and sending those messages back to Beijing.

222
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:33,779
I once again.

223
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:38,899
I don't have the expertise to know if that was true, but governments, including the American

224
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:41,820
government, ended up banning Huawei.

225
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,720
TikTok is alleged to have done that.

226
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:52,539
The Chinese seem to really use these things as stalking horses, as a way to build beachheads

227
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:55,019
and to really gain information.

228
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:00,720
And it's at one time, Trump, I don't even like to think of Trump as president, but one

229
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,860
of the things he was threatening to do was to make TikTok.

230
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,539
He was trying to make TikTok illegal, something that's still being talked about.

231
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:12,700
I mean, our greatest hope is it's already been three, four years for TikTok.

232
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,379
It's time for a new obsession.

233
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:20,240
And Jeff, you're big on and understand disruption, perhaps better than anyone I've ever met.

234
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
And you go to Google.

235
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,100
It was the ultimate disruptor in lots of ways, wasn't it?

236
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,740
It redistributed so much wealth and money, did it immediately.

237
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,740
Google transformed the advertising business.

238
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,740
The phone business.

239
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,740
The advertising business.

240
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,279
The button book business.

241
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,779
The encyclopedia business.

242
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,279
And I could go on.

243
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,279
Just made them all irrelevant.

244
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,279
So yeah, Google.

245
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,279
But, well, let me let you finish.

246
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:47,860
Well, I was going to ask, has Google itself been disrupted now by chat GBT?

247
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,860
Is that a real thing?

248
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,000
Yes.

249
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,779
One of the signs of leadership, not that I should be telling leaders how to think,

250
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:02,419
but one of the things I tell them they need to do is to be prepared and expect to be disrupted.

251
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:06,080
Well, Google didn't need me to tell them that.

252
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,080
When Google came on the scene, having been invented in a garage in the Silicon Valley

253
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,179
in 1999, when Google came on the scene, it didn't invent search.

254
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:20,879
There already was Yahoo, Ask Jeeves, Alta Vista.

255
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:28,360
They just did search so much better than anybody by letting you know how many people linked

256
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,419
to what you were searching for rather than how often it was mentioned.

257
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:33,559
It just worked.

258
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:37,899
First time you used Google, you could see it was vastly superior.

259
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:44,460
So Google turned this into one of the three biggest companies in the world, but they knew

260
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,779
that they could be disrupted.

261
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:54,279
It's taken 20 years, but they expected this disruption as soon as 2002 or three.

262
00:14:54,279 --> 00:15:01,360
I used to, I call this the Schmoogle case, and what Google expected was five or six of

263
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
us.

264
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,600
If we were friends, we might get together and we could create a new search engine that

265
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,919
we'd call Schmoogle.

266
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:16,200
And if Schmoogle were better than Google, that's a big if.

267
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,460
Google was pouring billions of dollars.

268
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,100
It was hard to be better than Schmoogle.

269
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,480
Microsoft spent billions trying and creating Bing.

270
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,679
Bing turned out to be a little better than Google in a couple of ways and not as good

271
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,679
in others.

272
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,440
Nobody bothered because it wasn't much better.

273
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,179
But if we could create a much better search engine, a big if, we'd send it to all our

274
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:43,159
friends and we'd say, try Schmoogle.

275
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,740
It's better than Google.

276
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:50,100
And they would because they're our friends, and if they instantly saw it was better, they'd

277
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,240
take Google down and put Schmoogle up.

278
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,059
Google expected this.

279
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:58,580
Well in 2023, Schmoogle came along.

280
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,440
It just wasn't called Schmoogle.

281
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,519
It was called Chat.

282
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,919
It did something better than Google.

283
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,399
Google expected to get disrupted.

284
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,399
They issued a code red across the company.

285
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,139
They brought the founders back, Larry Page and Sergey Brin.

286
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:23,019
But the problem was Larry and Sergey were 25 when they invented Google.

287
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:25,000
It's been 25 years.

288
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,240
They're both 50 this year.

289
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,279
They're two of the richest men in the world.

290
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:36,240
In the last 25 years, they've been leading not the good life, the greatest life with

291
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,200
airplanes and islands.

292
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:46,519
And it also turned out that Sergey, for example, hadn't read source code since 2004.

293
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,220
But they are back.

294
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:53,500
I don't think Google is going to be disrupted to the point that it disappears.

295
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:59,159
We can talk about big companies that have disappeared, but Google and every country

296
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,159
in the world.

297
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,700
Except three has 90% or greater market share.

298
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:12,279
Because of Chat, they may end up ultimately at 35, 40% market share.

299
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:18,660
You can build a great business on 35 or 40%, but it also hurts when it comes down from

300
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,660
90.

301
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,640
There's no way they hang on to 90%.

302
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,339
But the disruptor has been disrupted, is being disrupted.

303
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,119
That happens in a lot of places.

304
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,119
Blockbuster, which just didn't exist.

305
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,119
Blockbuster, which just didn't exist.

306
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:34,259
Blockbuster, which disrupted the movie theaters, disrupted by Netflix.

307
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:41,839
The iPod, not Pad, but the iPod, the music device, which disrupted music sales, got disrupted

308
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,859
by Apple's own device, the iPhone and the iPad.

309
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:48,380
The disruptor being disrupted is common.

310
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:55,619
And Jeff, Microsoft jumped in and they bought 49% of ChatGPT pretty quickly for $10 billion.

311
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:59,660
They're obviously waiting for their moment to fight back.

312
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:04,160
Is it that good, ChatGPT, that it will ... I mean, that's significant, isn't it?

313
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,539
If you halve Google's market share around the globe, it's a big win for the new disruptor.

314
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:13,940
Well, first of all, Microsoft had a score to settle, which I mentioned earlier.

315
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,839
The score of pouring billions into Bing and it not going anywhere.

316
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:25,519
Some people, myself included, call ChatGPT the ultimate revenge of Bing, because Chat's

317
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:27,339
going to be built into Bing.

318
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,799
And they are going to end up at 30% or 40%.

319
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,720
These are the early players.

320
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,380
Just as I mentioned, Google came along when there was AltaVista and Ask Jeeves and Yahoo.

321
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,619
These may just be the early ones and they may get disrupted.

322
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:49,980
But yes, Microsoft does not want to be left out of the search world this time around.

323
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,240
And they're going to do everything in their power.

324
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,039
And Jeff, ChatGPT, to me, is the first AI tool that most of us can really understand

325
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,039
because it's brilliant.

326
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:58,539
And it works.

327
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,720
And you can't believe the pieces it writes when you give it a couple of bits of information.

328
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,420
Elon Musk has described artificial intelligence as something that if we don't build an off

329
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,839
switch, could reduce humans to the level of a domestic cat.

330
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,319
Where do you sit on AI in the future?

331
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:22,259
Well, first, he says it's the greatest threat to humankind, more so than nuclear war.

332
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:27,920
Musk incidentally, is an early investor in ChatGPT, or OpenAI.

333
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,400
The company that developed Chat.

334
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,480
Everywhere you look, you see Musk.

335
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,839
Incidentally, we'll talk about him later.

336
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:42,519
Musk is this towering presence.

337
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:46,759
And I think the secret to understanding him, then we'll get right into AI.

338
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:54,180
I think the secret to Elon Musk is to understand that he's a genius, he's a visionary, he's

339
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,839
an asshole, and he's an immature brat.

340
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:57,839
Yeah.

341
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,839
Incidentally.

342
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:05,599
I don't like using words publicly like asshole, but there's no comparable word.

343
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:12,559
And those four things, if you took the asshole away, it would all collapse.

344
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,220
That's fundamental to his personality.

345
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:20,980
The immature brat, anyone who was a Tesla knows, if anyone who doesn't know this, go

346
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:27,319
to Google and you can hear this, Teslas, thanks to Musk, all have a farting function.

347
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,640
He built in the car.

348
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,400
You can choose from the type of farts and you could press it on demand.

349
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:41,299
And farting is the quintessential definition of an immature teenage boy.

350
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:44,819
Having been an immature teenage boy, I know that.

351
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:45,819
Okay.

352
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:48,319
So that's Musk and Chat.

353
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:55,319
AI, the amazing thing about AI, and it's almost hard to believe this.

354
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,319
This is now October 21st.

355
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,319
Yeah.

356
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,319
2023.

357
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:03,160
11 months ago, AI wasn't even on our radar.

358
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:09,779
It had existed, we knew it as a concept, but everything we're thinking and worrying about

359
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:13,700
in AI has been for the last 10 months.

360
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,940
We've never seen anything like that.

361
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:23,640
Within two months, it reached 100 million users, which is remarkable, although after

362
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,640
that, Mark Zuckerberg's alternative to Twitter, Threads.

363
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:26,680
Yeah.

364
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:26,700
Threads.

365
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:26,759
Threads.

366
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:26,839
Threads.

367
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:26,940
Threads.

368
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,019
Threads.

369
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:27,079
Threads.

370
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:27,140
Threads.

371
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,200
Threads.

372
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,259
Threads.

373
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:27,279
Threads.

374
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:27,299
Threads.

375
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:34,099
Threads got to 100 million users in five days, but a week later, Zuckerberg admitted

376
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:37,579
reluctantly that almost nobody was using it, and it's disappeared.

377
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,019
Chat has stayed and grown.

378
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:46,559
But within two months, people were saying, this is the most important innovation since

379
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,279
the iPhone.

380
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,799
I thought that understated it.

381
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:55,720
I thought within three months, it was the most important innovation since the personal

382
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,380
computer.

383
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:56,440
I thought it was the most important innovation since the personal computer.

384
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:57,299
I thought within three months, it was the most important innovation since the personal

385
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:57,420
computer.

386
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:57,799
I thought within three months, it was the most important innovation since the personal

387
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:57,880
computer.

388
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:08,700
And I really believe it's probably going to be the most important technological innovation

389
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,539
of all time.

390
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:16,880
Everything we're afraid of, with one possible exception, everything we're excited about,

391
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:18,500
all is real.

392
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:27,220
The fear of unemployment, the fear of losing our creative process, the one fear I still

393
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:35,019
don't quite see is the existential threat of humankind uh the skynet or the how the computer

394
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:42,180
there i can't quite see that connection but even if it's a remote possibility we ought to be careful

395
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:49,579
but ai this is the year of ai you know in hollywood the actors and writers are on strong

396
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:56,839
they settled the writers guild but the actors are still on strike over ai it terrifies everybody

397
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:04,759
because we know something really important has happened but we're not sure how it's going to

398
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:10,460
affect us and and jeff you've your history of understanding this as well as anyone going right

399
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,220
back to the uh the world internet project that's a big statement that you know the most significant

400
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:21,119
change since the printing press or the personal computer is is you can you put that into context

401
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:26,819
for people well clearly the writers in hollywood saw the threat and wanted to change their

402
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:33,819
constitution accordingly around how significant chat gbt what what sort of areas do you see it

403
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:39,740
hurting employees or where does it benefit have you got some thoughts on how it's going to come

404
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:47,619
to life well the unemployment i mean even before ai i've been writing about what automation is

405
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:54,700
going to do to unemployment we know that every driver job is on a slow path to oblivion every

406
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:06,359
path to elimination today machines can read x-rays better than doctors or technicians so we're not

407
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:13,599
just talking about manual or i don't want to call them low level but mid-level jobs machines have

408
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:21,660
already put many paralegals out of work because their job is to search legal cases which now can

409
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,819
be done a thousand times faster and more complete so we know unemployment

410
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:34,960
ai just accelerates it the fear for the actors is they've made films which the studios own the

411
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:42,660
studios have hour two hour long hour if you're looking at uh martin scorsese's film that opens

412
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:51,619
this weekend three hour and 37 minutes of leonardo dicaprio and robert de niro they only need a

413
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:56,819
minute and they can make a movie they can have machines take their images

414
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:04,200
and their voices and that's their fear that they're going to be used for commercials for movies

415
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:10,279
some of that's exciting you know dead actors can be making movies for the next 200 years

416
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:17,059
but there's the concept of ownership uh writers are terrified you can go to chat right now and

417
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:23,819
say write me a script for a robin williams like movie and in this case robin williams is gone

418
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:26,819
uh with this plot and it's still it's not

419
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:32,539
going to be uh ready to shoot in front of a camera but it can be pretty darn good and may

420
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:39,480
need a tweak so the fear is they're going to be made irrelevant the other fears are you know just

421
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:47,740
as calculators which came around in the 1970s have made only older people still able in most

422
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:54,819
cases to do multiplication tables where all these skills that we've developed in our brains

423
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,819
younger generations are not going to be able to do that so we're not going to be able to do that

424
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:02,079
we're not going to develop we know that's true of cursive writing because machines will be right

425
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:08,640
there to do it for us so we will lose the ability to do some things without the machines but on the

426
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:15,220
other hand those machines are always there and then there are the big uh the big issues of will

427
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:21,839
it take control of our nuclear weapons and there i'm still a little skeptical jeff i want to come

428
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,720
back uh fascinating uh to think about how quickly that's evolving but uh

429
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:34,200
got to go back to elon musk on your uh summation there he's bought twitter it's converted to a new

430
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:41,220
brand x how's that going to play out for elon if walter isaacson has a new book out that goes into

431
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:49,599
great detail it's part of the asshole in musk and as i said that's an essential part that made him

432
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:56,640
want to own the town square that made him want to buy he realized pretty quickly after

433
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:02,940
he made a bid that he overpaid and tried to get out of it then he got stuck with it and he's been

434
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:10,259
pillared because the value has gone close to zero but one thing you're not hearing i think he's

435
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:16,420
building a really interesting new platform and it may take a year or two it may have made sense

436
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:22,480
that you had to get rid of the twitter name incidentally for the first five months oh it

437
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,799
was like prince formally or the singer formerly known as prince

438
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:33,299
now you don't see people saying x parentheses twitter you're seeing the twitter sort of

439
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:41,740
disappear he may be on to something you can never count him out i mean he is the thomas edison of

440
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:49,359
the 21st century steve jobs was extraordinary and i don't you can't minimize anything steve jobs did

441
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:56,279
but all his innovations were within one area that doesn't make them less wonderful but musk

442
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:56,819
first

443
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:04,039
musk is a quadruple actually you could say a quintuple disruptor first you know his first

444
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:11,460
company it wasn't him by himself was paypal which changed payment systems completely and

445
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:18,839
which really reached its height during covid as cash is now really rapidly disappearing tesla

446
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:26,700
is a triple disruptor the obvious disruption is the electric battery disrupts the

447
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:33,980
internal combustion engine but it's also a disruptor because tesla has no automobile dealers

448
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:41,720
it completely disrupted the dealer network you buy it directly from tesla dealers who frequently

449
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:48,480
are powerful people in their communities dealers hate this in america they've gone to eight states

450
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,880
and made it illegal to buy a car directly that's going to end and then the other disruption of

451
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,579
tesla

452
00:28:55,579 --> 00:29:02,279
automobile advertising is one of the biggest advertisers in the world in america if you buy

453
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:09,960
an average price thirty two thousand dollar general motors car over two thousand dollars of that thirty

454
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:17,079
two thousand goes to advertising mostly television tesla has become the biggest automobile company in

455
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:24,000
the world bigger than all the others combined and has never spent a penny on advertising and to go

456
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,339
one step further

457
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:33,480
and once again i don't want to disrespect brilliant people but space x richard branson and i love

458
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,200
richard branson but richard branson took an airplane and went up really high it was a great

459
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:46,839
accomplishment jeff bezos with his penis rocket which is exactly what it looked like bezos with

460
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:54,740
an amazing i can't launch a rocket but it went up for nine minutes and came down musk space x is

461
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,559
already deleted and i'm not going to talk about it in the next episode but i'm going to talk about it in the next episode

462
00:29:55,579 --> 00:30:07,859
the guy is remarkable but he is a jerk and an asshole and a genius and a visionary and we're not

463
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:13,440
going to fix the two bad parts so i understand i'm that some of this has become apocryphal stories

464
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,339
that he's got 11 kids none of which live at home which maybe leans into the asshole part as well

465
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:25,200
i don't think he's been a good father although a couple of the kids were test tubes will you i mean i

466
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:31,839
to be gossipy but one of his one of his wives not grimes he was married to divorce married again

467
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:39,799
divorced and then got engaged again but they only married twice he's a jerk but you know these so

468
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:48,279
keep so keep the jerk part don't marry him try not to be his kid maybe you shouldn't even work for

469
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:55,579
him but we're all benefiting from uh what he does hey jeff i talked to you about driverless cars

470
00:30:55,579 --> 00:31:01,799
before the race to have them on the road has that slowed down at all or is that going to be a big

471
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:08,859
part it has slowed down i'm a little disappointed some of that was covet also this is one area

472
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:15,240
where musk has not been the best turns out in my opinion there are a couple of competing

473
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,259
driverless car systems i don't think

474
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:24,720
the tesla is the better one and eventually tesla may have to admit that there's the waymo

475
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:32,299
attached to google but it has slowed down people have been much more resistant there have been a

476
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:40,400
number of accidents not a high number they've been very high profile and the one thing we don't know

477
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:47,900
we know how many lives driverless cars have taken we don't know how many lives driverless

478
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,259
cars have taken we don't know how many lives driverless cars have taken we don't know how many

479
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:54,700
have saved at this point but people are being much more resistant to driverless cars than we

480
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:01,299
expected the problem is not the technology we just authorized driverless taxis this week in los

481
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:10,059
angeles the issue is infrastructure government regulations and public acceptance i thought it

482
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:18,019
would be by 2023 or four we're looking now probably the end of the decade jeff curious to get your

483
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:23,259
on this one i'm coming to you today from melbourne australia and you're a regular visitor here in

484
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:27,480
australia over many many years and been to melbourne a lot and done a lot of work with

485
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:32,920
australian business but you will know that this was a city that was locked down as much as any

486
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,640
city in the world through the covid period and i think more than any city in the world

487
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:42,579
our kids missed two years of school in this city effectively it feels like the biggest social

488
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:48,200
experiment at scale in uh in human history in recent times and when we look back in

489
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:53,140
20 years or so from now jeff what are we going to have learned about that particular time

490
00:32:53,140 --> 00:33:00,200
we're going to learn that we overreacted we didn't understand we could have done much better

491
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:07,200
much of what we did was not necessary but i think we're also going to have to add we didn't know

492
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:14,220
all this we played it safe i think dr fauci who really was the best known spokesperson on this

493
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,259
in the world much of what he advocated for later on in his life was not necessary but i think

494
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:28,480
it was better than underestimating and seeing we had a million die in the u.s

495
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,759
to seeing 10 million die so i think you know ron desantis is running for president from

496
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:42,200
governor of florida is running on the platform that he was the sane one uh we he only saw that

497
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:48,259
at the end he could have also been the reckless one so but in retrospect kids should have been

498
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:55,640
in school the social toll was far greater than they were really not very much at risk for covet

499
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:01,059
what we probably should have done but i was not saying this because i didn't know this until

500
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:06,759
afterwards and other what we should have done is we should have really protected the most vulnerable

501
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:12,500
the oldest the people with chronic conditions and should have let the rest of the world get on

502
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,059
and you know i was i i couldn't get to australia for two years

503
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:25,380
finally could get there everybody i would have lunch with i mean with few exceptions would write

504
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:32,239
me the next day and say i got covet but it wasn't a lethal covet since since almost nobody in

505
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:39,539
australia got covet once you did end the lockdown it just spread like wildfire but not you know

506
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:45,340
being in spending part of my life in new york where it spread like wildfire and killed people

507
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,119
australia did save lives but at a

508
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,280
huge toll yeah and it feels like unless we actually have this uh important conversation

509
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,719
still we actually learn for whatever comes uh in the future so always fascinated to hear your

510
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:04,500
thoughts on that the danger is in the future we'll probably take it not seriously enough

511
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:10,619
and if it's a more serious virus that will be deadly i know you you study business you study

512
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:15,679
disruption and you advise big business on where it's heading and i always like asking you this

513
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:18,260
what's the business that looks to be the most

514
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:24,599
indestructible to you at the moment heading into the future that's pretty easy the most the most

515
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:31,699
valuable most important business on earth right now may get us into another war is microchip

516
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:40,400
manufacturing we uh you know during covid a lot of chips supplies shrank automobiles couldn't be

517
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:48,099
made people couldn't get home appliances uh we're so far past the stage where chips were

518
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:56,440
computers or just electronic devices they are literally every almost everything in our lives

519
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:04,800
has chips chips have become geopolitical the most important chip manufacturer in the world is tsmc

520
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:14,199
which is based in taiwan part of the reason the chinese want to get into taiwan tsmc is in a race

521
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:17,440
by building factories in japan and arizona

522
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:25,260
not be as vulnerable but chips if you could slot slow down or control the supply of chips and

523
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:32,900
they're only a handful of companies intel samsung tsmc a couple of others you can really destroy an

524
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:40,599
economy if you look at nvidia the growth of nvidia just in 2023 i would say that's the most

525
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:48,260
strategically important most lucrative industry of the current year

526
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:54,000
and why is it so tightly held jeff is it a technology it's hard to replicate and hard to

527
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:01,659
imitate in some sense it's it's very i mean chip manufacturing requires very stringent conditions

528
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:12,579
mass massive investment and when you talk about the tiny tiny size chips even the chinese with

529
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:18,039
all of their incredible resources have not been able to replicate what

530
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:25,619
tsmc makes uh it's why there's you know it's not just the chinese who engage in industrial espionage

531
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:32,539
but it's at a very high level it's a very tightly controlled technology fascinating jeff we have

532
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:37,679
been asking these questions around leadership and and yours is such a fascinating story being

533
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:43,619
ahead of the curve in terms of where the digital world is going for for more than three decades as

534
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:48,039
i said in the intro and we see leadership showing up in different forms and curious

535
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,840
about yours and the idea around these different dimensions of leadership are the patterns we see

536
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,840
regularly in different people whether it be someone from your world or someone from sport or

537
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:01,840
from the arts and want to ask you a series of questions here uh to finish starting with self

538
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,079
leadership jeff we feel like it's hard to have an influence on someone else unless you understand

539
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,780
yourself well how does that shine up for you in in the work that you do uh but the most i think

540
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:18,039
effective leaders i mean leadership is more than just raw ability it's the ability to communicate

541
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:23,380
to inspire those are the best leaders we've talked about a couple of leaders you know

542
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:31,059
mark zuckerberg jeff bezos musk are not necessarily that but the ones who can do it the best

543
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:40,440
really can excite and inspire but leader leadership is really being able to assess the

544
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:48,019
the opportunities and the threats you face being able to turn things around and incidentally

545
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:54,380
just to give you one example uh not always possible i came to the conclusion about seven

546
00:38:54,380 --> 00:39:00,360
eight years ago that banks were in serious trouble that banks didn't understand their

547
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:08,119
customers very well and didn't provide very good service and banks in the 70s by giving their

548
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:15,539
customers automatic teller machines or cash machines in the 21st century by giving their

549
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:17,320
customers online banking

550
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:25,139
banks eradicated any personal relationship with the bank all of a sudden uh if you're in america

551
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:31,659
there's no difference between wells fargo and chase or in australia there's no difference

552
00:39:31,659 --> 00:39:40,599
between anz and um you pick and then that yeah and now i put together i did a lot of study of

553
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:47,260
banks i'm fortunate i got a lot a number of the biggest banks in the world to pay attention and

554
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,019
say when you're running a bank you're going to have a lot of money and you're going to have a lot of

555
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:51,579
money and when you're finished i don't take anybody's money to do that but they said when

556
00:39:51,579 --> 00:39:56,780
you're finished come and share with us what you found and i went to some of the biggest banks in

557
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:05,260
the world and i said here's your problem and this is what you need to do and almost to a ceo they

558
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:12,840
said to me we agree we agree this is what's wrong and we agree this is exactly what we should do

559
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:18,019
there's just one problem if i do the things you tell me to do i'm going to have a lot of money and

560
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:23,460
i'm going to have a lot of money to do our profits will disappear for the next two to four years

561
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:31,820
and they said keep in mind the average tenure of a bank ceo is three years i'll be long gone

562
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:41,619
i have absolutely no ability to look 10 years into the future and to do what's best for my

563
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:47,099
company the only ones who can really do that are the tech companies

564
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:54,320
jeff bezos right now he's handed over the ceo because he wants to have the world's

565
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:02,559
most public midlife crisis but as soon as bezos finishes that uh he probably may well come back

566
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:09,900
he'll be running amazon for the next 35 years zuckerberg will be running facebook or meta or

567
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:16,199
whatever he calls it so that we don't use the word facebook for the next 40 years larry and

568
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:18,019
sergey will be running google for the next 30 years and i'm going to have a lot of money and

569
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:25,820
alphabet for the next 30 and but for his horrible illness steve jobs would still be running apple

570
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:33,599
those guys can do what's in the best interest of their company most ceos who don't own most

571
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:40,159
of the company can't so even when you know what you need to do you can't always do it

572
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:44,000
yeah extraordinary when you think about it at that level isn't it the know the problem the

573
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,019
iceberg's coming but you can't avoid it for self-interest really is it i'm not going to

574
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:54,440
be here to be able to see that and the most famous australian just you know rupert murdoch

575
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:03,780
we think retired you never can be sure at 92 uh although we know his mother lived to be 103 but

576
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:10,980
rupert says he's retired but we'll see my favorite quote of the year jeff was um rupert had a very

577
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:16,940
brief uh recent engagement uh with a part didn't last more than a week and uh released a statement

578
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,960
saying we're looking forward to

579
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:23,460
spending the second half of our life together at 92 years of age that is someone who's planning

580
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:29,639
to live for uh a lot longer and not going anywhere anytime uh anytime so i did want to diverge for a

581
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:34,840
moment with the banking story i know you know that's that space world where does cryptocurrency

582
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:41,699
fit for you in in our world is that got a big future or not i think i really believe it does

583
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:47,900
uh it may not be bitcoin bitcoin may be too associated associated with

584
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:57,659
drug dealers and money launderers and terrorists crypto really does make sense it needs regulation

585
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:04,460
the problem with crypto when you know how you'll be able to tell that crypto is real

586
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:11,179
is when it stops being about a way to make massive amounts of money and it starts really

587
00:43:11,179 --> 00:43:17,880
becoming a currency where you can buy things with it the ability to not have to

588
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:24,940
exchange money between australia or asia and the u.s where it's impossible not to get screwed

589
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:32,519
where you can compare prices where uh it's extraordinary i think crypto is real i think

590
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:38,179
it will prevail but you're going to have to get a lot of the early charlatans like sam bankman

591
00:43:38,179 --> 00:43:44,300
freed and ftx out of the system and that's going to take a while one of the examples of that jeff

592
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,340
that was you know look at the emerging um

593
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:53,019
population in a place like india for example where a couple hundred million people recently

594
00:43:53,019 --> 00:43:59,219
just got access to the internet and they have a lot of high skills we know in the finance world

595
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:04,400
and accounting and and the ability to be able to transact potentially directly with you know

596
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,920
someone for 30 or 40 to do some work that really is of great value and great importance do you see

597
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:16,920
that as being without how impossible it would be to try and do that with someone in a town in mumbai

598
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:24,659
can play a role if it becomes a secure trusted currency very much the case within india and then

599
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:33,320
also there are i think india has more citizens outside the country than any other country in the

600
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:41,340
world uh working and sending money home and that will change that and you know these poor poor

601
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:48,019
workers who are working as domestics or and send money home big chunks of it get

602
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:53,820
taken out in currency exchange it will allow india is now the biggest country in the world

603
00:44:53,820 --> 00:45:00,300
that happened last year most international business has given up or largely given up on

604
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:07,380
china mostly for political reasons uh india fundamentally is an english-speaking country

605
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:15,739
with lots of other so i think this is this is going to be the indian the next 25 years are

606
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:18,019
going to be the real massive growth

607
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:22,960
of india hopefully not the population but the economy jeff we see ladies are really conscious

608
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,059
now in the environments we work in about the positive impact they have on others on a daily

609
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:32,860
basis in their environment and they are more conscious of that than ever does that make sense

610
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:38,800
to you the the idea that people are conscious of that more than ever now especially with gen z

611
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:47,239
this is a generation that is interestingly personally very conservative just just the

612
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:53,239
examples they drink less than any teenage generation they have less sex they're not

613
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:58,440
very interested in driving which was the most important thing in my life when i was 16

614
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:05,639
they don't take on lots of credit that's the personally conservative but politically very

615
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:12,340
much about saving the world changing the world they really every generation thinks they've gotten

616
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:17,500
somewhat shafted by the one that came before but in the case of gen z

617
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:25,059
not even factoring in covet they really have gotten somewhat shafted by debt by climate change

618
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:32,719
they have been handed one of the most difficult scenarios to live in and jeff you've had some big

619
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:39,079
visions the world internet uh project that has been a formation of a huge part of your working

620
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:44,000
life how have you gone about when creating a vision like that and sharing it and and so

621
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,019
successfully getting presidents and vice presidents to to take that with you how have you gone about

622
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:53,159
work on board and companies around the globe have have you gone about that briefly i was a television

623
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:59,000
guy and i thought television was the most important thing ever to happen to the world as far as

624
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:06,280
creating international culture and sharing some of the same values and i was always taught that

625
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:12,820
we blew it with television that television was the only mass medium we knew ahead of time was

626
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:18,019
going to be a mass medium there was no question in the 40s that radio listeners

627
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:24,659
were going to embrace radio with pictures so what i was taught was we should attract people before

628
00:47:24,659 --> 00:47:30,159
they had television gone back to them every year to see how television changed their lives

629
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:37,000
cut to the late 90s i think it was pretty easy to see the internet was going to be a lot more

630
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,539
important than television it's going to change everything i even but even believing that i

631
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:47,960
underestimated massively because you know keep in mind when we

632
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:54,340
started everybody connected to the internet through a hard wire and a pc on the desk we

633
00:47:54,340 --> 00:48:02,159
never anticipated social media and a phone in our pocket that would connect us uh but so we

634
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:08,360
start just believing that it was going to be really important we started tracking and we were

635
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:13,539
i think smart enough to know was going to be important lucky enough to have caught that it

636
00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:17,940
was a lot more important than we expected and people always

637
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:24,820
want good information and got started getting invited sharing our work and insights and it's

638
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:30,699
been a lot of fun jeff we see uh ladies very uh curious and through curiosity that's how they're

639
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:36,380
constantly learning and developing themselves is curiosity something that's shown up a lot in

640
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:42,059
in your life and your thinking yes i mean just tell you too much is to imply that i figured life

641
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:47,800
out and everybody should listen to me but i can just tell you i i think i have a pretty

642
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:55,179
short attention span and my goal is to just as always you know always be learning always finding

643
00:48:55,179 --> 00:49:01,719
new things and uh but i think that's that's not i have the secret to i think most people

644
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:10,000
do want to reinvent themselves i i i'm on what i call jeff 6.0 and hopefully there's another

645
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:17,480
two points ahead of me hey jeff communicating with clarity is something we also talk about as

646
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:17,980
a dimension

647
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:23,300
of leadership and you've got a great way of storytelling and you uh you make the complex

648
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,480
seem really simple it's it's a gift of yours is that something you've communicated with

649
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,619
intentionally have you really given thought to that or is that just you i was hired as a professor

650
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:40,920
at ucla and i taught very large classes and i found that i had to amuse myself more than the

651
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:47,559
students i had to keep myself interested or i'd get bored and happily it seemed to work so i've

652
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:48,019
always been a part of that and i've always been a part of that and i've always been a part of that

653
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:48,039
and i've always been a part of that and i've always been a part of that and i've always been

654
00:49:48,039 --> 00:49:53,960
very grateful that people seem to like listening and how important has collaboration been for you

655
00:49:53,960 --> 00:50:01,739
along the way in your work jeff no i mean to really compare to have people verify to share

656
00:50:01,739 --> 00:50:08,780
ideas absolutely indispensable nobody does it alone man final two questions for you and

657
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:13,659
incredibly appreciative of your time as always who's been the greatest leader in your life

658
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:17,039
that's you know i don't think i've ever been asked that

659
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:17,900
not

660
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:24,360
somebody who was a leader while i was alive but as i you know being an american and believing in

661
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:30,840
american history we're being challenged unlike any time before but will prevail abraham lincoln

662
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:39,019
was the guy who i thought faced the most impossible odds never compromised what he believed in and

663
00:50:39,019 --> 00:50:44,179
true inspiration really remarkable also one of the most eloquent human beings

664
00:50:44,179 --> 00:50:47,840
who ever walked the face of the earth also pretty

665
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:55,139
darned impressed and take immense inspiration from nelson mandela a couple of amazing answers

666
00:50:55,139 --> 00:51:01,320
there historical uh legacy of uh of epic proportion isn't it when you think about

667
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:06,679
both of those figures in in you know american life and world life isn't it now at nelson mandela it's

668
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:12,599
um remarkable um legacy that's been created uh we're a bit obsessed with collaboration the final

669
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:16,880
question is and you've collaborated i only started half the list i could have spent another half an

670
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,000
hour of all the organizations and i'm not going to be able to do that because i'm not going to be able to do that

671
00:51:18,019 --> 00:51:24,639
that you've worked with and you work around the globe is profound is there been someone you thought

672
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:29,480
i'd love to collaborate with them on one of your particular areas of passion is there a name that

673
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:35,679
springs to mind or you've perhaps already done it there are you know believing there were fortunately

674
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:42,679
i've been lucky enough to collaborate with most of the really successful companies i would have

675
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:47,559
liked to have collaborated with one or two companies that

676
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:54,260
were failed that might have survived but failed the company i would have loved to have gotten my

677
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:59,579
hands on although i don't know what i would have done was kodak one of the greatest you know 25

678
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:07,760
years ago one of the three best known brand names on planet earth the average person in a developed

679
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:16,559
country 25 years ago spent 50 000 in their lifetime on photography it's now you talk to

680
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:17,900
teenagers today

681
00:52:18,019 --> 00:52:25,519
they will take 10 000 times more pictures than i did and their total expenditure will be 50 in

682
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:31,139
their lifetime i would have liked to have worked with the music companies as the internet came

683
00:52:31,139 --> 00:52:38,539
along i i really like i i really like saving things fixing things repairing things even more

684
00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:45,039
than building so did kodak just missed digital they didn't believe that invented digital but

685
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:47,880
they were making so much money on

686
00:52:48,019 --> 00:52:54,599
film they just couldn't stop and unfortunately they brought nothing special to the digital world

687
00:52:54,599 --> 00:53:01,920
and i mean a lot of those companies that just went by the wayside and kodak still still makes

688
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:09,519
some money doing medical imaging but they were a fundamental part of billions of people's lives

689
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:15,659
amazing story jeff i'm always uh taking notes always fascinated to chat to you and uh with

690
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:18,000
the world changing at a rapid rate that probably always happens to me but i'm always taking notes

691
00:53:18,019 --> 00:53:24,619
but it feels with ai and the way i did it a little faster these days even even by your

692
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:30,260
yeah i don't think it's just uh i don't think every generation thought things changed quite
