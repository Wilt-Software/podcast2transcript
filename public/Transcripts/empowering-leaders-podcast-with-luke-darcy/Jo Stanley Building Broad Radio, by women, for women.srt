00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,620
I know you're going to enjoy this week's guest on the Empowering Leaders podcast,

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:14,839
the founder and CEO of Broad Radio, Jo Stanley, Australia's first radio network for women by women.

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,699
And you hear Jo talk about not naturally being a risk taker,

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,519
but the idea and the passion behind Broad Radio allowed her to take that risk.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,960
Look, there's great risk involved.

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,379
I'm not actually a normally risk, I'm a very risk averse person.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,260
I'm a very fearful person.

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,200
But I also just believe passionately if there's something that needs to be changed,

9
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:35,579
you should be the one to change it.

10
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,520
Jo also talks about what she misses most about her 12-year career and success in Breakfast Radio.

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,100
That core team on air and that really sort of supportive team off air,

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,039
I miss that sense of belonging.

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,840
It always felt like a family and that I had somewhere to go every day where I mattered.

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,460
In a lot of ways, one of the reasons I'm building Broad Radio is for to create that environment again.

15
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,100
And you might have known that Jo Stanley comes from,

16
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:01,880
four generations of missionaries.

17
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,760
And you hear her talk about the impact of that on her life growing up.

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,120
My parents were missionaries and my grandparents were missionaries.

19
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,299
And my great-grandparents were missionaries actually.

20
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,760
And so that...

21
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,400
Along comes Jo Stanley.

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,379
I thought I'd be a stand-up comedian.

23
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:22,140
It's people like Jo Stanley who inspire the work we do at Alita.

24
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,319
We are super passionate about bringing together groups of five to six people

25
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,099
from around the globe, from different backgrounds to come together to connect

26
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:31,939
and to learn and to collaborate.

27
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:33,439
Love you to book a discovery call.

28
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,359
Head to alitacollective.com today.

29
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,340
Big thanks to Jason Nicholas and his team from Temper Bedding.

30
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,959
We know successful people really understand the importance of sleep

31
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,319
and value a good night's sleep.

32
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:46,560
Sleeping on NASA approved, the world's best in bedding,

33
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,319
is a decision that will change your life.

34
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,859
Jo Stanley is the founder and CEO of Broad Radio,

35
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,500
Australia's first radio network for women by women.

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,159
Jo's vision is a global community of women who are happy, healthy and fearless,

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,439
connected by the sun.

38
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,840
The transformative power of radio that truly reflects who they are.

39
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:09,139
Jo spent 12 years herself in breakfast radio,

40
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,460
during which time she took two shows on two different networks to number one,

41
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,759
the only woman in Australia to ever do this.

42
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,360
Jo was the co-host of the House of Wellness TV show on radio for seven years,

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,159
producer and host of numerous podcasts,

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,900
writes a regular column for Sunday Life magazine,

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,939
or at least previously did.

46
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:25,599
No, I still do.

47
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:25,939
Still do.

48
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,340
Yes.

49
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,960
And is the creator of Play Like a Girl,

50
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,719
the kids book series, stand-up comedian,

51
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,780
much sought after MC and speaker.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,639
You've done a lot, Jo, when I read this out.

53
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,400
Passionate about women's and girls' health, gender equality, social justice.

54
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:43,020
And in support of these issues, Jo is the patron for the Lighthouse Foundation,

55
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,560
for Wellsprings for Women, and is an ambassador for Left Right Hook.

56
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,360
Got a beautiful daughter, Willow, married to Daz,

57
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,319
and just an all-round legend in general there, Jo.

58
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:52,780
Oh, Daz.

59
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,259
It's so nice that finally the two of us.

60
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,939
We've been working towards this, Jo, for a number of years,

61
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:00,719
and I've had the great pleasure of spending a fair bit of time with you

62
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,699
in the last six months.

63
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,379
Six years.

64
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:03,180
Been a lot of fun.

65
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,259
You generally make me laugh every time I'm around you,

66
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,219
but I find you one of the most open and honest people I think I've ever met.

67
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,659
Is that always you?

68
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:13,139
Has that been you from a young age, or is that something you've grown into?

69
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:15,379
Well, that's an interesting question.

70
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,479
So I come from a very religious family,

71
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,620
and I think traditionally religion doesn't, in my experience,

72
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,000
accept all parts of you.

73
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:31,000
And so I would say that there were, I guess,

74
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,979
there were pressures in my broader family

75
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:39,039
and in just the sort of the religious culture that I was in

76
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,340
to hide parts of self.

77
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,199
You know, like that's a world where, you know,

78
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,860
it's got this sin tradition, I suppose, that awful word, sin, and shame, right?

79
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:54,080
So in a lot of ways, and for many years,

80
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:57,259
I don't think I was that honest with myself or other people

81
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:01,699
because it wasn't okay to be who you were in that context.

82
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:05,060
So your sister's a pastor, is that correct?

83
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,400
She is a minister, yes.

84
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,639
A minister, yeah.

85
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,020
And she's an amazing woman.

86
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:08,379
Yeah.

87
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,539
And I gain a great deal.

88
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,400
You know, I'm not actually anti-the church, and I'm not anti-religion.

89
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:14,879
What denomination?

90
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:15,639
Anglican.

91
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,360
Anglican, yeah.

92
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:16,560
Yeah.

93
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:19,279
But mom and the family's quite strict Anglican.

94
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
My parents were missionaries, and my grandparents were missionaries.

95
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,000
That's right.

96
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,560
Forget this part of your story.

97
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,860
Yes, and my great-grandparents were missionaries, actually.

98
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,959
And so that-

99
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,980
Along comes Joe Stanley.

100
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:33,959
I thought I'd be a stand-up comedian.

101
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,500
How did that go down with four generations of missionary families?

102
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,379
That must have caused a bit of drama.

103
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,980
No, not at all.

104
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,199
I mean, you know, I have always been very loved and accepted in my family.

105
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,720
I wouldn't suggest that that's not been the case.

106
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,860
But there is a sense when you go and you hear the doctrine in a church

107
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,860
that is related to what's, you know, appropriate behavior and what's not,

108
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,899
and your belief system.

109
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:03,560
And as you go through your teens and into your 20s,

110
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,040
and you're kind of working out who you are,

111
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,699
if you are doing what I consider to be age-appropriate exploration of self,

112
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,259
sometimes that can make you feel as though you are, you know,

113
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,360
you carry shame around that.

114
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,519
But let me tell you that I am extremely loved in my family,

115
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,779
and I don't actually have any problem with religion or Christianity,

116
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,079
and I'm very inspired by my sister particularly,

117
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,480
who has a real sense of service.

118
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:34,579
You know, she works as a school chaplain,

119
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,680
and she's incredible and devoted to the students at that school

120
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,660
and is very â€“ I'm quite guided by her, actually.

121
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:45,920
And similarly to you, I have a spiritual side to me.

122
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,420
It's just not necessarily in that Christian faith traditionally now.

123
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,639
You mentioned age-appropriate exploration of self.

124
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,660
I saw your eyes light up there, Daz.

125
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,100
Do you think you want to scoop here?

126
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,300
Can you delve in a little bit?

127
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,939
What were you like as a teenager?

128
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:05,560
I mean, we all caused our parents some grief in those teenage years.

129
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,379
I certainly did.

130
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,720
Should we compare scorecards?

131
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,180
I reckon you might win, I think.

132
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,019
Did you push the envelope out pretty hard?

133
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,939
I actually don't think so, but I suppose being in a Christian family,

134
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,800
your usual kind of smoking behind the shelter sheds or on the train station

135
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,120
or, you know, the cheeky little underage drink that you might have done

136
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,279
at a 16-year-old party, that kind of thing was pretty extreme.

137
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:30,899
I mean, our family.

138
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,959
So now I look back and go, that's pretty tame, really.

139
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:39,480
It is for someone who's the founder of Broad Radio,

140
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,500
which is an incredible achievement, Jo, and it's a great passion.

141
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,279
You've just successfully raised some funds,

142
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,379
and I think in the last 24 hours, 48 hours, you've launched the Breakfast Show.

143
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:50,879
I just had a look at your app.

144
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:51,699
It's sensational.

145
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,420
You can text in and ring in.

146
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,000
I'd encourage anyone to check it out.

147
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,360
First ever Australian radio network for women by women.

148
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,860
It's a huge undertaking.

149
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,759
Can you tell us about your passion for that project?

150
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:05,459
Well, do you love radio still?

151
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,160
You know what?

152
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:07,980
That's a good question.

153
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:10,480
I love this format.

154
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,579
I love talking to people.

155
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,800
I think I fell out of love with doing radio after 11 years.

156
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,040
The soundbite part of it lost me a bit in the end.

157
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,180
Because it's too short.

158
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:21,839
Too short.

159
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:22,160
Yeah.

160
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,879
And I felt like you never could necessarily, if you had someone on,

161
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,379
I found that a bit frustrating.

162
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:29,060
Like you get.

163
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,620
This chat with you would be, you did this for years, four minutes,

164
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,579
and you go, really didn't fill my cup up in the end.

165
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,439
No, you'd be stopped at Christianity.

166
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,180
I'd be out.

167
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:38,540
Exactly.

168
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,920
Thanks for coming, Jo.

169
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:41,300
We'll see you soon.

170
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,920
So I'm maybe not a radio lover like you, potentially.

171
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,160
Well, for me, I agree with you.

172
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,899
And I think that podcasting is on the rise enormously

173
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:52,500
because people crave a deeper conversation

174
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,399
and they want to learn more about life and the people in it.

175
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,399
But I also miss in podcasting,

176
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,000
the immediacy of it, and I miss that spontaneity,

177
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,519
the interaction that you can have.

178
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,319
And the live part of it you can't replace.

179
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,279
The live part, right?

180
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,420
And actually, if you look at podcasts now,

181
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,819
so many people are doing live podcasts

182
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:17,800
or they're doing live event podcasts or they're doing calls now.

183
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,079
So essentially trying to emulate radio as best they can.

184
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,680
Which is a great point.

185
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,439
The live part is the, that's the fun, isn't it?

186
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,819
Where anything could happen.

187
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:27,120
Yeah.

188
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,019
And also I think learning,

189
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,019
about your audience, I'm sure you are the same on Triple M.

190
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,759
Like on the, in the radio that I did,

191
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,919
we had such a beautiful relationship with our audience.

192
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,740
And I've, I just could see how transformative it is for people,

193
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,340
individuals and communities.

194
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,139
I mean, basically radio reflects and shapes society, right?

195
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:47,299
And so when I finished Breakfast Radio

196
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:50,100
and was looking around to listen to something myself

197
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,960
that reflected my life, I was in my mid forties at the time

198
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,000
and I couldn't find it.

199
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,440
There was nothing that really kind of connected with me.

200
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,639
And I was like, well, I don't think it's,

201
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,940
I don't think it's the,

202
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,120
the medium that's the problem.

203
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,440
There's just nothing that actually is doing the kind

204
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,759
of content that I want to listen to.

205
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,980
And then I realized, oh, that's interesting.

206
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,860
There's a market, you know, there's a problem that needs

207
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,179
to be solved, which is essentially what a startup is.

208
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,960
And looked into, well, not only, only 27% of the voices

209
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,240
that we hear on radio are female, which is, I think a problem

210
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,960
because in Australia, yeah, it's a problem because how does that

211
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,919
impact on how we speak?

212
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,059
How do we see society and how society is shaped?

213
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,600
It's like, okay, if we're getting a version of society

214
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,539
that is skewed in that way, it's not accurate, right?

215
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,899
So that's a problem for me.

216
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:43,120
And then I went, okay, so, but there's a huge audience

217
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,779
of women, women control 80% of the household spending.

218
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,679
I was like, oh, that sounds like a great opportunity.

219
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:55,720
So it became a passion around increasing voices

220
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,240
and diversity of voices.

221
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,320
I'd always found.

222
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,659
And I think you've done the same.

223
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,519
I think you, similarly to me, Dars, have used the power

224
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:07,919
of this microphone and having a voice to speak about things

225
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,320
that are really important to you and also represent people

226
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,620
who perhaps don't have a voice, right?

227
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,860
And I've always done that and largely tried to be a voice

228
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,940
for women, but I realised I shouldn't be speaking

229
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,620
on behalf of so many different women who never have a voice,

230
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,919
like First Nations women, women of colour, women with disabilities,

231
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,759
women of a certain age, which now I am.

232
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,460
And I thought, well, the best way of doing that then

233
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,740
is to make my one microphone a hundred microphones,

234
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:38,360
which essentially means, well, I'd better just build

235
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,399
a radio network then.

236
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,700
Which is, again, it sounds, you know, when you say it like that,

237
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,320
it's like, let's just do it.

238
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:48,179
But it takes an amazing amount of courage to do it.

239
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,159
And you mentioned the start-up journey,

240
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,620
which has got so many hurdles to jump, you know,

241
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,100
to get to day one and to raise funds is an amazing success.

242
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,120
Like to me, it's just already.

243
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,159
Yeah.

244
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:58,200
Yeah.

245
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,259
Yeah.

246
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:58,279
Yeah.

247
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:58,299
Yeah.

248
00:10:58,299 --> 00:10:58,320
Yeah.

249
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,840
It's already, whatever happens from here, congratulations.

250
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,659
Oh, that's nice to hear.

251
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,700
And I think that's, I think you've got to celebrate along the way

252
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,480
because so many people get, the idea gets into the brain

253
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,919
and never gets activated.

254
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,120
But if someone's listening to this and they're thinking

255
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,919
of a start-up, what advice would you have for them?

256
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,840
Well, you want to just start and don't think about it.

257
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:22,600
I think most start-ups, people who are start-up founders

258
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,440
usually say, if I knew how hard it was, I wouldn't have done it.

259
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,679
And I agree in a lot of ways.

260
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,299
I just thought.

261
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:30,899
I thought, oh, well, I was in lockdown.

262
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,539
I had spoken to other large media companies.

263
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:36,419
They were quite interested.

264
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,980
And then COVID came along.

265
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,840
They went, no, not so interested now because revenue is different.

266
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,279
And I was like, oh, God.

267
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:43,620
All right.

268
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,159
Well, fuck it.

269
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,080
I'll do it myself then.

270
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,679
Which tends to be my attitude to pretty much everything.

271
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,620
Oh, fuck it.

272
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,419
I'll just do it myself.

273
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,879
And I think that you need to know your why before you press start.

274
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,159
And if you have the why.

275
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,200
And you have an understanding of your audience, your market.

276
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,899
I mean, you have to do the research around that.

277
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,259
Then the question should and answer should always be, well, why not?

278
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:08,419
Why not?

279
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,700
Just do it.

280
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:13,259
Like, look, there's great risk involved.

281
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,159
I'm not actually a normally risk.

282
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,700
I'm a very risk averse person.

283
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:18,580
I'm a very fearful person.

284
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,480
But I also just believe passionately if there's something that needs to be changed,

285
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:23,879
you should be the one to change it.

286
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:28,100
And I also think every problem.

287
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,299
can be solved if you just spend a little bit of time thinking about the problem

288
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:34,039
and just trying different ways of solving it.

289
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:37,960
So along the way, when you're building a startup, every single day,

290
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,860
there's something where you go, oh, geez, that seems insurmountable.

291
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:46,519
And then you just find a way because if you want it enough, you can.

292
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,340
And you're eminently qualified to do what you're doing.

293
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,240
You had a great.

294
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:51,840
Not really.

295
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:52,899
Well, you are.

296
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
I have not.

297
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,179
I haven't got an MBA.

298
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:57,639
I haven't done a business degree.

299
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,580
You know, the medium inside out and upside down.

300
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,659
And you've been in this space for such a long period of time.

301
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,700
And I think that to me makes perfect sense.

302
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,759
And you look back at your history.

303
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:09,740
It was great, successful time.

304
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,440
And all the shows that you're on were a great success.

305
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,419
You're brilliant at it.

306
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:17,080
Did you look back fondly at your time in mainstream radio, doing breakfast radio?

307
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:18,320
Oh, loved it.

308
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:19,539
I don't know.

309
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,419
Do you love, do you look back fondly at your time?

310
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,340
I thought I was asking the questions today.

311
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:25,679
Yeah, I do.

312
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,019
I do.

313
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,860
I found a bit like what you said.

314
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,580
More articulate than I would, but I always thought it was just great privilege.

315
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,720
It's an unbelievably lucky job.

316
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,240
You get a voice.

317
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,759
I enjoyed the fun part of it, of the live and being around different people.

318
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:44,120
We, we took the show to places we had no right to be regularly, which, uh, Eddie

319
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,539
and Mick and I bonded over being at the Superbowls or being Olympic games or

320
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:48,320
world cups of soccer.

321
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,580
So I love travel.

322
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,080
I love those things or Anzac day, dawn service back at that time and think that

323
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,659
was, that was pretty lucky, Joe.

324
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:57,240
So yeah, no, it's, I do have fond memories.

325
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,080
Would never do it again.

326
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,200
But it was, it was a good time for me.

327
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,159
I, um, we didn't have a budget quite like that.

328
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,720
So we didn't go.

329
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,779
I don't think we did either.

330
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:07,519
I'm not sure how we got there.

331
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,980
We didn't go to the Superbowl.

332
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,980
I know how you got there too, we didn't have that.

333
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:19,240
No, I, for me, it was, um, a sense of belonging that I miss enormously, uh,

334
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:22,919
particularly on the Matt and Joe show, but also with Joe and Lima on gold, but

335
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:27,879
on Fox, just that family on the, on air and off air, our beautiful family.

336
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,820
It was a wonderful, tight little team, which changed, you know, different people

337
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,940
came and went over the 10 years off air, but that core team on air and that you

338
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,659
really sort of supportive team off air.

339
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:40,659
I miss that sense of belonging.

340
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:45,500
It always felt like a family and that I had somewhere to go every day where I mattered.

341
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:50,820
And I think in a lot of ways, one of the reasons I'm building broad radio is for,

342
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:56,419
to create that environment again, for people who perhaps have had not great

343
00:14:56,419 --> 00:14:57,620
experiences in the media.

344
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,000
Or are new to the media.

345
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,940
I've got a couple of young women who are sort of starting out in their careers.

346
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:05,000
I, so I miss that belonging and that beautiful family.

347
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:08,360
And I really miss the conversation with the audience.

348
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:12,620
And I, every day still have people stop me and say, I loved that show.

349
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,360
And I loved what you did and I miss you.

350
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,519
And I'm like, wow, tune into broad radio.

351
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:18,860
I've got a home for you now.

352
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:25,580
You mentioned the people that have had a bad time in media and anyone who's worked

353
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,440
in this space, I found that.

354
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,299
I'm coming out of sport for a living.

355
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:30,740
And I've said this many times before.

356
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,539
I found some of the behavior of executives and media downright bizarre, to be honest

357
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:36,000
with you.

358
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,759
And I was confronted by it.

359
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,860
And, and you know, when you're a male who's played sport, there's not really too many

360
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:47,120
things that are going to worry you personally, but I just saw it as being strange and then

361
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,840
really questionable.

362
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,820
And I felt for the women in that environment, sometimes I feel like a really hard place

363
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,200
for women.

364
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,759
People get unceremoniously sacked.

365
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:53,940
They get treated badly.

366
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,419
There's a horrible pattern of behavior that's been in this industry.

367
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:00,179
How did you navigate your way through that?

368
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:08,340
Ah, and you're right that the culture in many media organizations, and if we're talking

369
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:13,419
about radio, yes, that's radio included, is in many ways toxic at times.

370
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:19,419
And, you know, bad behavior was celebrated at times where you'd think that's what message

371
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:23,159
is that sending for the, you know, what are the values of this organization?

372
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,240
Have you got a thought, sorry to interrupt, but have you got a thought why, why, you know,

373
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,940
culturally that's been the case?

374
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:30,419
Is there, have you ever thought about that?

375
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,700
I, I would say that's for other people to answer.

376
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,019
That's diplomatic of you.

377
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,720
When did you become diplomatic?

378
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:48,240
You're not, uh, you're not going to go back to that and just, cause I mean, my answer

379
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,700
would be as exactly as you described.

380
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:57,200
I think when behavior is accepted and rewarded and you put people in roles and they put the

381
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,559
people that are like them in role.

382
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,740
That, that's the fascinating thing in culture to me that, that can permeate a building for

383
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,400
30 years.

384
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:04,940
It does.

385
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:05,759
And it has.

386
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:10,039
There was an exec that used to go around and, and whack a samurai sword on the desk famously

387
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:15,000
in Triple M and quote the art of war and all that sort of stuff like that, that stays in

388
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,079
organizations and people, that's what they grow up with and they become a version of

389
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,339
that.

390
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:19,680
Yeah.

391
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,000
As bizarre as that sounds.

392
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,539
But your question is why, why is it accepted?

393
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:26,039
And I don't know the answer to that.

394
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:26,819
That part's harder to answer.

395
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:27,039
Right.

396
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,279
Yeah.

397
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:27,940
I don't know the answer.

398
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:28,339
Yeah.

399
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:33,160
I feel like when I say I'll leave that for other people to answer, what I mean is I'm

400
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,240
not a part of that club.

401
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,579
I'm not, it's a very patriarchal system, right?

402
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:39,200
I don't understand men like that.

403
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:43,279
Never have understood those sorts of leaders, if you want to call them that.

404
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,339
I think they're terrible leaders.

405
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:48,279
If this is a podcast about leadership, that is a what not to do right there.

406
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,660
I guess I can't answer it because I don't know why that behavior is accepted.

407
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,940
I don't know why a culture is actually built on that.

408
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,319
Like, is it because fear?

409
00:17:58,339 --> 00:18:02,440
Is it because fear is believed to be the best way to control a workforce?

410
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,960
You know, like that, that's just horrific if that's why they actually, you know, encourage

411
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,839
that sort of behavior.

412
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,339
But I honestly don't know, but you would know better than me.

413
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,660
Well, the reality is I don't either.

414
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:16,420
I don't understand that type of male who behaves that way.

415
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,180
I just have no commonality at all with, with that.

416
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,180
And I, you know, found that very challenging and pushed back hard against that.

417
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,920
I know you did.

418
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,940
It was often amusing to see.

419
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,079
Yeah.

420
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:26,900
You like that, don't you?

421
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:26,980
Yeah.

422
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,019
Yeah.

423
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:27,039
Yeah.

424
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:27,099
Yeah.

425
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:27,200
Yeah.

426
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,220
Yeah.

427
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:27,500
Yeah.

428
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:27,519
Yeah.

429
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:27,579
Yeah.

430
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:27,640
Yeah.

431
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:27,680
Yeah.

432
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:27,700
Yeah.

433
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:27,720
Yeah.

434
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:27,740
Yeah.

435
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:27,759
Yeah.

436
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:27,799
Yeah.

437
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:32,740
Part of my problem, I can't help myself with, and part of my passion for sports changed

438
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:38,380
completely the way that people lead and males lead, every other industry, it's happening

439
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,619
in media and it's very slow.

440
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:46,660
Maybe the last part that's going to get that change because people, you know, it's dinosaur

441
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,559
like behavior.

442
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:52,920
And I think, I mean, I would like to acknowledge how important it is that we have men like

443
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,500
you pushing back and being role models and being, I think.

444
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:02,140
You know, refusing to be bystanders to it, that's really, really critical for the whole

445
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:08,980
of society because if we are going to say, hey, we actually need and expect evolved contemporary

446
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:13,900
leadership, it has to come very much from the men in the room, not just the women.

447
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,759
And that's an interesting conversation to have, Jo, because I think a lot of men are

448
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:23,279
fearful now around, we love our partners and our wives and our sisters and the females

449
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,740
in our life, but we get nervous now around stepping into.

450
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,359
Territory that you're not welcome or the right.

451
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:35,480
I speak to a lot of males who are great people who just find now it's more complicated and

452
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,839
confusing in that space.

453
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,420
Is that something that someone is really passionate about, always has been about equality issues?

454
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,759
Is that something we've got to encourage men more to say, you know what, just do the right

455
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:52,160
things, probably a good place to start and then, and stand up for behavior that you don't

456
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,039
see as appropriate, but it does feel more confusing than ever.

457
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:56,279
Can you, can you understand that?

458
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,720
I, I, it's not the first.

459
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:02,240
The first time I've heard people say that, and it, you know, the first thing I would

460
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,799
say to that is better to do something clumsily than not do anything at all.

461
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:14,500
I think I can't speak to exactly what it feels like to be fearful, to speak in that way in

462
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,539
an environment where you think you're going to get, I don't know.

463
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,400
Canceled.

464
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:23,079
Well, I mean, I, again, I can't understand, I can't speak to the different ways in which

465
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,579
people are canceled and how that can happen.

466
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:27,720
But what, what I would say is that.

467
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,900
This is my belief.

468
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,980
And we've, I think we spoke about this when you just maybe before or after you saw the

469
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:38,460
Barbie movie, which I loved that you went and saw the Barbie movie.

470
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,400
On your recommendation.

471
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,119
And I, and I loved it by the way.

472
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:41,839
Yes, I know.

473
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,700
I know you did.

474
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:50,200
My belief is that nobody, male or female benefits from gender inequality, right?

475
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:56,299
And gender based stereotypes or rigid roles, you know, like gendered roles.

476
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,099
Yeah.

477
00:20:57,099 --> 00:20:57,160
Yeah.

478
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,180
Yeah.

479
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:57,200
Yeah.

480
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,220
Yeah.

481
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:57,240
Yeah.

482
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,259
Yeah.

483
00:20:57,259 --> 00:20:57,279
Yeah.

484
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:57,339
Yeah.

485
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:57,359
Yeah.

486
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:57,380
Yeah.

487
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:57,440
Yeah.

488
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:57,460
Yeah.

489
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:57,480
Yeah.

490
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:02,400
You know, women are restricted by a notion that they're not able to be scientists or

491
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,140
work in finance or, you know, be great CEOs.

492
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:09,319
I think men are restricted in the same way that they're not allowed to take time off

493
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:13,440
to be with their kids and take paid parental leave, or that they're not allowed to express

494
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,000
their feelings, or you're supposed to buck up and be really, you know, tough guy or whatever.

495
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,980
It's the same prism.

496
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:22,700
Like it's the same continuum that restricts our true selves.

497
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:27,359
And so every time a man steps up and says, Hey, you know,

498
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:32,079
let's not talk that way about that person, male or female, then you're contributing to

499
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,039
each of us feeling safe to be who we are.

500
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:36,140
That's all it is.

501
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:37,380
Beautifully said.

502
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:43,240
I was searching for a quote from the Barbie movie, which didn't come into my mind as you

503
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,579
were talking.

504
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,339
I'm just Ken.

505
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,259
Is that it?

506
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:48,160
I could sing the song for you if you like.

507
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,539
Changing tack, you went back and as you said, you grew up in this, you know, four generations

508
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:56,900
of missionary families and you go into standup comedy, which to me is almost like a kind of

509
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,779
almost the bravest thing anyone can do to stand up there, microphone only.

510
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,940
And a room full of people saying, make me laugh.

511
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:07,019
That may be the most terrifying thing I think anyone could do.

512
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,119
How did you find that?

513
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:12,079
Well, I don't do it anymore for a reason.

514
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,299
That chapter's closed.

515
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:17,259
Oh, look, I still perform comedy.

516
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:23,140
I certainly, when I do, you know, keynote speaking and all that kind of corporate work,

517
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,759
I weave comedy into what I do.

518
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:26,740
But, um,

519
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:32,799
I wouldn't go back to stand up comedy in a pub never again, partly because I just couldn't

520
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,539
handle the anxiety.

521
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,339
It's just, it was too much for me and I had enough things in my life to make me anxious.

522
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,779
I didn't need that as well.

523
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:43,420
It was a pretty easy thing to drop given I was doing breakfast radio sort of by then.

524
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:49,039
And I have done festival shows since like in the last four years, but they were not

525
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,140
standup shows.

526
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,140
But, but equally it was the greatest.

527
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:56,700
I mean, what a fantastic classroom.

528
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,400
For learning about yourself and about other people and about writing and performance and

529
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,440
storytelling and how to hold space in a room.

530
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,920
But equally, it never really felt like me.

531
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:17,960
I would say that doing broad radio and stepping into this sort of space where I'm really following

532
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:24,180
my life's purpose is one of the first times I felt truly me and doing standup.

533
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,440
It was just,

534
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:26,839
there was,

535
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:31,259
there were so many inner voices that I was battling, not just on stage, but in the green

536
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:31,480
room.

537
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,599
That was fucking horrific.

538
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:36,220
In fact, the green room was worse than being on stage.

539
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,779
I hear that from comedians that other comedians are talking about.

540
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:44,200
I just feel I'm having a physical reaction to it right now, to be honest.

541
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,359
It's got a bit of post-traumatic stress going back there.

542
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:54,200
It is so difficult being in that space when you are consumed with your own, what was I

543
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,779
consumed with?

544
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,839
Self-doubt, I suppose.

545
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,700
Not self-loathing.

546
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:01,140
I never got that far, but just, just being convinced you didn't belong there.

547
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:06,079
You, you just did not belong there and you were, um, and everybody didn't want you there.

548
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:09,000
Just so convinced that no one wanted you there.

549
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,140
That's brutal, isn't it?

550
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:10,339
Yeah.

551
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,619
But to then go out and do it successfully.

552
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:13,839
But the stage was easy.

553
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:14,519
And the audience were nice.

554
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,900
Just to bat the green room was the problem.

555
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,440
Get away from the other comedians quickly.

556
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,359
I mentioned a beautiful daughter, Willow, married to Daz, who's a gun TV producer in

557
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:24,000
his own right.

558
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:25,559
What do you, what do you like on the home front?

559
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:26,740
What am I?

560
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,920
I like, I'm a model wife, of course.

561
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,920
That's the answer I was, I was hoping for.

562
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:37,019
You think about it?

563
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,559
Do you think about the parent that you are?

564
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,839
Oh, most definitely.

565
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:45,220
I mean, I would say being a parent, would you agree with this?

566
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:51,880
As soon as you become a parent, you learn about yourself in a way that is so pure.

567
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,059
And if you really center.

568
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,599
That little person and as best you can, of course, you have to work and do all those

569
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,240
other things as well.

570
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,339
But if you're able to center your relationship and your, and when you're with them, you're

571
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:07,420
completely present.

572
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:15,240
And for me, it was about letting Willow show me who she was and is, and not imposing my

573
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,700
own views on her and just allowing that to kind of evolve as she learned that about herself.

574
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:26,720
You, I think you step into a version of yourself that is so powerful and so real and true.

575
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,259
Like, that was just the greatest gift for me.

576
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:32,059
Confronting it's I'm still, is it?

577
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:34,720
Um, I don't know.

578
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,779
I'm a very good mother.

579
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:36,319
Yeah.

580
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:36,619
Yeah.

581
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:37,119
I love it.

582
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,819
And I, it's, I have to say that I, I feel like when people always say, oh, it's the

583
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:42,019
hardest thing we've ever done.

584
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:43,220
It's the hardest job in the world.

585
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,960
I can see how it can be for that.

586
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:48,259
Like, I do not judge that at all.

587
00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:52,460
Of course it is extremely hard, but for me, it's just always felt easy.

588
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:55,099
Even in the hardest moments, it's felt easy.

589
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,559
What a gift that is.

590
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,180
Um, I mean, she's, I've only got one, you've got four, I don't, I'm not juggling three

591
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,380
kids under four or, you know, the way people are really in the trenches with that.

592
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:07,519
I've never had that.

593
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:13,099
It was just me and Willow and Daz, who is, you know, a unique person in himself.

594
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:19,220
That's a evil laugh at the end of, uh, at the end of the day.

595
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,400
No, he's amazing.

596
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,039
He's the greatest.

597
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:21,579
He's a legend.

598
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:22,500
He's a legend.

599
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,000
Yeah.

600
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:26,059
I have this saying that success leaves clues, Jo.

601
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:26,559
And I love.

602
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,039
You know, speaking to you or someone from a sporting background or social venture, and

603
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:31,380
this.

604
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,380
What does that mean?

605
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,380
Success leaves clues?

606
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,380
Someone said it to me on this podcast, this idea that there's patterns of why people are

607
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,220
successful and whether they're, you know, a conductor of an orchestra or a coach of

608
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:47,480
a sporting team or a standup comedian who's launched a all female radio station in incredible

609
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:47,960
style.

610
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,240
There's reasons to that success.

611
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,099
So there's some dimensions of those sort of patterns that I wanted to ask you about.

612
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:56,599
This idea that we talk about self-leadership, but how, how do you make sure you're

613
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:59,359
feeling your best so that you can lead others in your life?

614
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:05,259
Well, I think it's really important you do a lot of therapy and, uh, I've done a lot

615
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:12,839
of therapy and I read a lot of self-help books and I've taught myself very, uh, clear non-negotiables

616
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:17,019
in my tool belt that I always turn to every day to ensure that I'm the best version of

617
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:18,019
me.

618
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:22,099
So firstly, I've worked on my demons and the things that I know are triggers for me to

619
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,259
react in really not pleasant ways for people around me.

620
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:26,259
Yeah.

621
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:29,240
Particularly in high pressure environments.

622
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,000
And I've learned, you know, I journal every day, I meditate every day.

623
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,480
Mindfulness is my daily practice, breath work, all of those things, exercise, eating well,

624
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,799
probably not so much.

625
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:45,940
But I just think it's, it's, it's your responsibility to be the best version of you.

626
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:51,299
And I believe, I believe every single person in the world is doing their best, but often

627
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,720
people's best isn't enough for us.

628
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,400
So I think, well, let me not be the person in that day.

629
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,160
That causes someone to think, do better.

630
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,160
Yeah.

631
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,079
I'm like, I'm doing my best, but my best will be the best for you as well.

632
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,079
Yeah.

633
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:05,640
It's a great way to think about other people, isn't it?

634
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,480
And have, uh, that, and I see that in you, I see that when you're around people, you're

635
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,880
generally letting people, uh, have their day, have their moment.

636
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,319
You're not going to add to it in any way.

637
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,559
Is there one piece of leadership advice that you would pass on or you pass on to others

638
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,559
the most?

639
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:24,319
I think there's real power in vulnerability.

640
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,400
And I don't mean sharing.

641
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Yeah.

642
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,740
You know, inappropriately personal things that are going to make people uncomfortable

643
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:37,319
or, um, that, uh, perhaps breaching boundaries that are needed for certain relationships,

644
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,740
I guess.

645
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:45,440
But I think, um, there's great power in saying to someone, you know, this is important because

646
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,740
of all of the goals that we're trying to reach in this particular part of the business or

647
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:55,400
like really sharing the background to decisions and to whatever is on the table at that time.

648
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:01,299
And sometimes that involves also saying, I'm sorry today, I'm really tired because I've

649
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:03,460
been working really hard on this one area of the business.

650
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,720
So please be patient with me and it's going to take me a little while to work through

651
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,779
this problem or just really, I think, opening the door for other people to be vulnerable

652
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:11,920
as well in that space.

653
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:17,700
Broad radio is a, is a, is a big vision and it's something that is, as you said, your

654
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,200
purpose in life and it's you being the truest version of yourself.

655
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,180
You've then got to share that with others and bring a team on board now.

656
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:29,059
And you've got hosts of the show and salespeople and a full team.

657
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,599
How have you gone about sharing that vision with others in your team?

658
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,480
Um, lots of talking, lots of talking.

659
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:40,640
And I have got an amazing team who I just love dearly.

660
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,859
Every single one of them, some who have been with me from the very first moment I picked

661
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:48,299
up the phone and said, hi, you don't know me, but I'm building a radio network.

662
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,259
Are you interested in working with me on this?

663
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:54,220
Um, through to some people that we've hired only in the last three months.

664
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,160
But what?

665
00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:00,180
What has been really key is being able to share with them what the vision is every step

666
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:04,579
of the way so that they, it becomes their vision and it becomes their passion as well.

667
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,079
We've been bootstrapping mostly.

668
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,660
Uh, so can't afford to pay very well.

669
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,440
Don't have anyone on long term, on, on full-time contracts.

670
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,980
Everyone's either casual or freelance or contract, even though we probably need them all to be

671
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,259
full-time for the workload.

672
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:25,099
But, you know, it's not, it's not the easiest place.

673
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:29,519
The work it's very intense, but everyone's so passionate about it because they see the

674
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,220
vision as clearly as I do and are really excited to be there.

675
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,619
And that's all because every step of the way we, I don't own it.

676
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,920
Like I consider myself to be the custodian of this.

677
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:44,819
I feel very lucky that it came to me as an idea, could have gone to anyone else, but

678
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:49,380
somehow the universe gave me this idea and I'm like, okay, well I better, you know, in

679
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,079
service of the idea and the audience that needs it and the women that need it, then

680
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:55,160
I will do my best to make it happen.

681
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,680
But I need all these people to come with me on this.

682
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,160
So as soon as I share it with them, I see it in them.

683
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:06,480
I see how it becomes their vision as well and how they then own, own the idea as well.

684
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,079
That was the same for our crowdsource funding raise.

685
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:14,119
It's the same for our supporters and our listeners and our followers on social media.

686
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:18,779
Like it all becomes sort of a part of their, what they want for the world as well.

687
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,759
Which is brilliant.

688
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:23,180
And no one deserves it more than you and the passion that you've, you've put in.

689
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,980
And I love, you know, the community.

690
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,819
That's building around you.

691
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,759
Curiosity is a word that we see a lot when I sit down.

692
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,759
And is there a particular rabbit hole, curiosity has taken you down in recent times that you

693
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:34,420
could share with us?

694
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,079
Curiosity is my superpower.

695
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:37,500
Really?

696
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:37,900
Yeah.

697
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:44,140
In that I consider it the answer for all, all of your great anxieties in life.

698
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,839
Every time I say to myself, and trust me, there have been many, many times in the last

699
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:54,920
sort of year and a half where I've gone, you know, you're in.

700
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,680
You're in.

701
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:55,980
You're in.

702
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,019
You're in.

703
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:56,079
You're in.

704
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:56,099
You're in.

705
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:56,119
You're in.

706
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:56,180
You're in.

707
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,259
You're in.

708
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:56,319
You're in.

709
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:56,339
You're in.

710
00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:57,920
Oh my God, what's going to happen?

711
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,240
Right?

712
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:05,059
You know, I'm, I'm dramatizing it, but you know, internally you're going, oh shit, shit.

713
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:06,299
What's going to happen now?

714
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:06,900
We're in trouble here.

715
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:07,339
Yeah.

716
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:07,680
Yeah.

717
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:11,339
But if you flip that to not a question, oh my God, what's going to happen?

718
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,279
But more of a wonder, like what is going to happen?

719
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,660
This is, well, that's interesting.

720
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,440
That's an interesting turn of events.

721
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,660
And I wonder exactly how that's going to be solved.

722
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,940
To me, that just strips anxiety.

723
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:30,519
From that churning in your head to going, I just can't wait for the universe to solve

724
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:33,400
this problem because it will be amazing when it happens.

725
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,940
So wonder and curiosity is something that I love.

726
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,140
Love it.

727
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:40,420
Well, I love the way just in tone.

728
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,160
I wonder what, you know, as opposed to, oh shit.

729
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:44,680
Yeah.

730
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,240
That is interesting to me.

731
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,819
So even in a really stressful situation and, you know, something's happening with the family

732
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:54,539
or something, can you use it then?

733
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:54,900
Is that?

734
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,440
It has.

735
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:01,460
Well, I mean, we, um, we've had absolutely, you know, along the road, every startup will

736
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,279
tell you that there are times when your backs are against the wall and you're like, I don't

737
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:05,279
know how this is going to be solved.

738
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,960
And you, and you're really kind of digging deep and looking at all your resources.

739
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:15,900
A large part of that for me is being open to how the solutions will appear before you.

740
00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:17,660
You haven't thought of it.

741
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:23,039
Often the universe decides what the solution is and it might not be the one that you had

742
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:23,759
hoped for.

743
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:24,420
Right.

744
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:31,319
But, um, I mean, our equity crowdsource funding race was an example of that, where I had spent

745
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:38,859
a year really exploring, um, VC world because we needed investment to scale and had had

746
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:39,859
some great conversations.

747
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:45,579
And every time I walked away from the VC conversation, it just felt, I don't know, I was having to

748
00:33:45,579 --> 00:33:47,380
justify what we were doing too much.

749
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,119
And that's totally fair.

750
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:52,900
So for people listening, maybe, you know, venture capitalists investing in your business,

751
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,380
putting a big chunk of money in.

752
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,299
But obviously with a fair bit of control attached to that.

753
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,779
A fair bit of control, but also those venture capital, you know, organizations, they have

754
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:06,579
a very clear remit because of course they have investors they're looking after.

755
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,380
Completely fair enough.

756
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:08,699
Yeah.

757
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:15,980
But that then means that, you know, you're having to sort of, again, fit yourself into

758
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,019
a differently shaped hole to what you are perhaps.

759
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,800
And yes, a fair bit of control.

760
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,920
It was really curiosity that sort of made us go, well, what is it?

761
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,760
It's our greatest strength.

762
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,599
It's our community.

763
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:31,800
And what is a different way and everything along the way.

764
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:32,480
Actually.

765
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:32,719
Yeah.

766
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,559
So what is a different way to raising money?

767
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,619
And that led us down the path of crowdsource funding, which is where you go to your community

768
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:45,860
and it's equity, but we have 290 investors and we raised 385,000 with those investors.

769
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,900
Um, so that's been really amazing because you do, you do retain quite a lot of control that way.

770
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,760
But the other thing is that notion of curiosity around, well, what is a

771
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,539
different way of building a team, an on-air team, which we, you know, you and I would

772
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:06,500
know that in radio, everything is based around that core duo so that the audience can, you

773
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:13,860
know, get really attached to Dars and Ed and Joe and Matt or Joe and Limo, right?

774
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,360
But we, it's not possible for us to do that because the women I wanted to work with, they've

775
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:24,079
got parenting duties or they're touring all the time, or they have a like really active,

776
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:24,739
amazing career.

777
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:30,340
So again, it's the curiosity of going, well, what is a different way of building a team?

778
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,360
That means you can work with all those people.

779
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:35,340
And why wouldn't you explore job sharing?

780
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,039
Why it's never been done before in Breakfast Radio that you would have a team of actually

781
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:44,000
in total, we have a team of eight people that are sharing two chairs.

782
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,159
Why not?

783
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,719
Why can't you do it that way?

784
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,139
Let's be curious about what that's going to sound like for the sound of the show.

785
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:51,960
And what's that going to be for the audience?

786
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,119
Every time you have a,

787
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,219
a problem, the only way you can respond to it is with curiosity and just to go, okay,

788
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,659
what else?

789
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,219
Why not?

790
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,239
Why can't you do that?

791
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:06,639
Again, comedy taught me that, that you just have to think around a problem and come up

792
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:09,559
with five, six, seven different ideas and see which one works.

793
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:11,340
Brilliant answer.

794
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,960
We love, I love this, this quote, the cost of leadership is time.

795
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:21,840
How do you find juggling the workloads and demands and challenges that you've got in

796
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,440
every other area, but still trying to foster this sort of collaborative

797
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:24,719
environment?

798
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:26,760
That you're creating it at Broad Radio?

799
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:34,260
Well, and that is tough, the collaborative side of things, because you do sometimes just

800
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:40,840
things move so quickly and you do struggle to bring people into, you know, the decision

801
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,079
making or, I mean, sometimes it's not appropriate.

802
00:36:43,179 --> 00:36:44,559
You just got to go with it and do it.

803
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,380
The cost of leadership is time.

804
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,739
I mean, largely, I think my daughter suffers mostly from that, not the business.

805
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,559
She actually texted me this morning.

806
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:54,699
I was on air and Daz was at the,

807
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:55,139
the studio.

808
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,860
She was getting herself ready for school and then he was going to go back and take her

809
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,179
to school.

810
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:05,019
And she texted while I was on air saying, what can I have for breakfast?

811
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:06,519
The milk has turned sour.

812
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,719
There's no bread, crumpets or, or muffins.

813
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:16,719
This house is empty of food, like absolute drama.

814
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,559
And she had a point.

815
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:24,559
It was, I had, I had not provided any kind of food for my 15th.

816
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:30,860
So I'd not had the time to do the shopping and I'd not had the time to make sure that

817
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,539
she had breakfast.

818
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:36,280
So the cost, the cost of leadership in that instance was my daughter's breakfast.

819
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:37,260
Sorry, Willow.

820
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:37,579
Yeah.

821
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,280
Terrible.

822
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:41,159
I mean, a lot of, a lot of guilt there, but oh well.

823
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:44,699
It's all part of, part of growing up, Jo, is how I'd describe it.

824
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,519
You spent your life as a great communicator and we're fascinated by that.

825
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:54,159
Have you got a mantra about how you go about your communication and all the areas that

826
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:54,579
you work in?

827
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,320
I have plenty of mantras.

828
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,659
Are they around communication?

829
00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:09,860
I suppose for me, I think listening is the absolute key to good communication and active

830
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,480
listening, I suppose.

831
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:16,380
So, which is funny because I keep forgetting what you're saying to me.

832
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:22,619
Could be a reflection on the quality of my questions here too, Jo.

833
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,619
I get, I get going off on time.

834
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,639
In my mind and then forget where we started.

835
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:34,920
But good communication starts with hearing what the person is saying and really understanding

836
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:40,300
it and looking for the signs, you know, the unspoken communication in between the words.

837
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:47,440
And that takes time and it takes, I think, mindfulness is really, really important to

838
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,440
that, where you're actually present with someone and you're taking the time to just breathe

839
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,639
and hear and be still.

840
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:55,699
And listen to them.

841
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:00,380
To me, that's the best way to communicate is to start by listening.

842
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:08,800
And in sharing your ideas, I guess, being willing to sit with the discomfort of them

843
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,780
disagreeing.

844
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:14,780
That's, I kind of, I'm curious about that too.

845
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,219
Isn't that interesting when people disagree with you and you're like, oh, okay, let's

846
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:19,880
talk about that.

847
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,920
What, where does that lead us?

848
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,599
Because sometimes it can lead us to whole new ideas that you didn't even know.

849
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:26,019
We're sitting there to be had.

850
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:30,860
I feel like that art's been lost a little bit, actually, that idea and, you know, standing

851
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:35,099
on the set of House of Wellness with you, we occasionally have a different opinion,

852
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:39,539
Jo, and I love that because exactly as you said, but it feels that's harder to come.

853
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:44,000
People are so buried in their side now, they don't even want to have that curiosity to

854
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,320
find out what someone else thinks.

855
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:47,000
So it makes me sad.

856
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:49,320
And I think you're right.

857
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:54,659
There's a loss of nuance in understanding people and a willingness to sit with the discomfort,

858
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,519
of how it feels when someone disagrees with you.

859
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:03,079
I wonder if sometimes when people can't handle that discomfort, it's because they are lacking

860
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,579
in their own sense of self.

861
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:10,599
And so as soon as someone questions them, there's a defensiveness because they themselves

862
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:11,400
doubt themselves.

863
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,159
Does that make sense?

864
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:13,420
It does.

865
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,559
Yeah, absolutely.

866
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,119
Absolutely.

867
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:15,800
That makes me sad.

868
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,480
Who's the greatest leader in your life, Jo?

869
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,260
I would say Daz.

870
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,639
My husband, Daz.

871
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:23,900
Yeah.

872
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:24,360
Yeah.

873
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:24,639
Yeah.

874
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:25,400
He's amazing.

875
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:29,500
I've seen him like back in the day when he was producing dance parties.

876
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,340
There's a career.

877
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,860
He's a PhD in engineering, isn't he, by the way?

878
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:39,860
He has got a PhD in chemical engineering, but he did for a while produce dance parties.

879
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:48,679
And I saw him convince, persuade, ask the young kids around the scene, you know, to

880
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:52,599
spend all night postering and doing all this volunteer work for him.

881
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:54,599
And that was the first time I saw him.

882
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:56,659
And that was the first time I saw him.

883
00:40:56,659 --> 00:41:02,000
And since then, I see him every single, every single thing he does when he interacts with

884
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,340
people, he makes them feel like they're the only person in the world.

885
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:09,820
And he listens to them.

886
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,360
He validates them.

887
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,699
He cares about them.

888
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:19,619
And it doesn't matter, you know, because he produces really complicated, very big budget

889
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:20,360
commercials.

890
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,079
It doesn't matter if you're the runner on the set or if you're the star, he treats them

891
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:24,639
exactly the same.

892
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:27,820
He talks to them so beautifully with great respect.

893
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:35,340
And he's just, he's kind, you know, and I, I really, I love, yeah, I love watching and

894
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,619
hearing him do what he does.

895
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:40,199
Cause I think it's really, uh, it's very special.

896
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:45,239
It's a great gift as, and I love being around people like that, that don't, uh, differentiate

897
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:47,599
no matter what the status of someone is.

898
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:50,500
And yeah, that's, uh, that's pretty special summation.

899
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:52,019
Surely he'll appreciate that.

900
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,079
Also, he's very funny, which helps.

901
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:59,199
So I think if you can bring humor to what you're doing, particularly in high pressure

902
00:41:59,199 --> 00:41:59,960
situations.

903
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,019
That works.

904
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:01,679
Yeah, for sure.

905
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:05,699
We're a bit obsessed with this idea of collaboration and felt like Joe, people had got into their

906
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:10,019
silos in the last 30 or 40 years and bringing people out and bringing people together from

907
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:10,880
different backgrounds.

908
00:42:11,539 --> 00:42:16,239
If you collaborate with anyone on anything, and I'm, I'm sure the Broad Radio Project's

909
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:18,639
front of mine, but it might be, you've got many passions.

910
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:23,280
Have you thought that's the person I'd love to collaborate with in any area of your life?

911
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,199
Hmm.

912
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:26,280
Um, I mean, you're right.

913
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,440
Like there's no way Broad Radio would be where it is without collaboration and, um, partnerships

914
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:37,280
are key to our success, both commercial, but content partnerships, audience partnerships.

915
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:42,059
Um, and I am attracted to people who have the same values.

916
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,519
You can feel that in someone, right?

917
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:48,659
So that's, I think that's how I built my life effectively.

918
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,420
Uh, so I would collaborate with, I mean, I'm really keen to get in, get a,

919
00:42:54,659 --> 00:43:01,760
a conversation with Hello Sunshine, who are, uh, Reese Witherspoon and Sarah Harden is the,

920
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,800
uh, co-founder of Hello Sunshine.

921
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:12,280
They just make incredible content for women, women-led stories and have changed Hollywood

922
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:18,119
and changed what we know of, you know, there was this, this, uh, belief that women didn't

923
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:22,179
want women's stories and that women audiences were not powerful at all.

924
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:24,440
And they've proven that wrong.

925
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:29,380
Time and time and time and time and time again, that's on my whiteboard of collaborating with

926
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,659
them at some, at some point.

927
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,059
Yes.

928
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:32,719
That would be, uh, worthwhile.

929
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,900
And I wouldn't doubt you, Jo, the universe, as you often say, might sort that one out

930
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,940
for you in time.

931
00:43:38,059 --> 00:43:42,860
Congratulations on everything that you've done, particularly the most recent project,

932
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:43,280
Broad Radio.

933
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,019
It's an incredible achievement already.

934
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,239
I'll keep, uh, referencing that.

935
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,619
It's been great fun to spend some time with you over the past handful of years.

936
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:51,400
And thanks for joining me.

937
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,039
I really appreciate it.

938
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:52,940
Thanks, Darce.

939
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,420
I'm looking forward to us doing our breakfast.

940
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,539
So when's that going to happen?

941
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,780
How's that going to work?

942
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:00,500
I don't fit in Broad Radio, I don't think.

943
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:03,719
No, but I mean, I got my fingers in many pies.

944
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,260
You know that.

945
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,579
That might bring me back out of retirement, potentially.

946
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:08,360
Thanks, Jo.

947
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:11,780
