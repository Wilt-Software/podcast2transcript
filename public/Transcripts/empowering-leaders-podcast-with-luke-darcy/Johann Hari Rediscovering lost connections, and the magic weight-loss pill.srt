00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:08,839
I have no doubt you are going to love this conversation with international bestselling

2
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:15,060
author Johan Hari that includes a discussion about the fact that Ozempic is being used as

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,160
the wonder weight loss drug and the potential impacts it has here in Australia. So precisely

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,260
because these drugs haven't arrived in huge numbers in Australia yet, except the

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,300
diabetes, I really urge Australia can get this right in a way that Britain and the US have not

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:34,320
so far. These drugs absolutely should be prescribed, but they should be prescribed

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,280
very tightly. When it comes to Australia considering itself the lucky country

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,140
that we live in down under, statistically Johan Hari says our nation is at the top end for anxiety

9
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,340
and loneliness. Already in the Western world, we're the loneliest society there's ever been.

10
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:54,079
How many close friends do you have who you could turn to in a crisis? And when they started doing

11
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,780
it years ago, the most common answer is five. Today, the most common answer

12
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,280
is five.

13
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:02,060
None. And Australia is just off the scale on loneliness.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,159
Johan Hari has had an extraordinary journey of his own in recent times,

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,019
has led him to strike up a friendship with the one and only Oprah Winfrey.

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,459
I was profoundly shaped by watching the Oprah Winfrey show every day for years and years and

17
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:19,359
years, right? But at the end of this message, she says, well, because your answer machine

18
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,599
doesn't have your voice, I'm not sure this is actually your number. So I don't want to leave

19
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:26,379
my number on a random answer machine. So I'll call you back, right? And then she phoned me one

20
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:27,739
day. We are friends.

21
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:30,000
We're going to see her in Montecito in a few weeks.

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,560

00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:58,260
Johan Hari is an internationally bestselling author whose books have

29
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,319
appeared in 38 languages. His first book, Chasing the Scream, was made into an Academy

30
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,659
Award nominated film and an eight-part TV series presented by Samuel L. Jackson.

31
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:11,280
His second book, Lost Connections, was a Sunday Times and New York Times bestseller.

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,400
His TED Talk on addiction and depression have been viewed more than 93 million times,

33
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:22,300
and his two latest books are absolute must-reads. Hillary Clinton says this about style and focus.

34
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:27,680
Johan Hari tackles the profound dangers facing humanity from information technology and rings

35
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,080
the alarm bell for what all of us must do to protect ourselves, our children, and our democracies.

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,280
His latest book, Magic Pill, gives an incredible insight and deep dive into the weight loss drug

37
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,840
ozempic and others like it, literally sweeping the globe to the extent that ozempic's manufacturer,

38
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,740
Nova Nordic, is a Danish pharmaceutical company and now the most valuable business in Europe

39
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,900
with a valuation of around 700 billion Australian dollars. It's a great pleasure to speak to you

40
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,520
this morning. Thanks for joining me. Well, chuffed to talk to you. I'm always happy to talk to people

41
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,840
who are in Melbourne because I had the closest thing I've ever had to a religious experience

42
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,960
in Melbourne, which was, it must have been, I don't know, eight years ago. I went to, came to

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,759
Melbourne for the first time and I went to the set of Neighbours. I went to Ramsey Street, it's

44
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:17,780
Pinnock Court, and because me and my grandmother every day religiously watched Neighbours when I

45
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,719
was a little kid, and my grandmother sadly is no longer around to do this, but I went there and I

46
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,240
thought to her that would have been like the most insane thing, the idea that I could have gone to

47
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,919
this side of the world and gone to Ramsey Street. She would have been so fucking happy. That's my

48
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,280
equivalent of like a Muslim going to Mecca or something. It's the closest I'll ever get.

49
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:40,699
So that is just brilliant. We forget in Australia that we export these things out sometimes to the

50
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:46,659
UK and we assume that no one remembers them, but clearly that's had an impact on you and your

51
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:50,719
upbringing. You've literally become one of the voices of our time and it feels to me as though

52
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,520
you've picked the number of the biggest issues facing the world and you've got a unique way of

53
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,460
explaining them the way very few people can.

54
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,819
Can you share with me what led you to wanting to write the way that you do?

55
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,159
That's very nice of you to say that. Thank you. Cheers, Luke. For me, every book I ever write,

56
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:10,919
I always start with a mystery that I want to understand for myself. So I'm not an expert,

57
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,099
right? I'm a journalist. I was trained in social sciences at Cambridge University,

58
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:17,639
so I've got pretty good training in that stuff, but I'm not an expert, right?

59
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:22,399
So I started with my first book, Chasing the Scream. It's about addiction. We had a lot of

60
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,839
addiction in my family. Nothing I was doing was helping. I was really concerned.

61
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,519
I wanted to figure out, well, what causes addiction? What can you actually do about it?

62
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,399
What actually solves this problem? So I ended up going on this big journey all over the world for

63
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,939
my book, Chasing the Scream, trying to figure that out. I think I found some really interesting

64
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:45,180
and important answers on that. My second book, Lost Connections, is about depression and anxiety,

65
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:51,199
right? At the time that I started writing it, I was about to turn 40 and every single year that

66
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,480
I've been alive, depression and anxiety had massively increased in Britain, in the US,

67
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,279
across the world.

68
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,500
Actually, particularly badly in Australia, for reasons we could talk about, if you like.

69
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,579
I wanted to figure out what's going on, how do we reverse that trend? So I ended up going on this

70
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:08,199
big journey for that. And the book I think we're going to talk about today, Stolen Focus, was really

71
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:13,579
a very basic problem. I could feel that my own attention was getting worse and worse,

72
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,920
and I could see this happening to loads of the people around me.

73
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:20,759
In fact, the figures on it are pretty shocking about the level of crisis we're in.

74
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,759
The average office worker now focuses on any one task for less than a minute,

75
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,339
and that's what we're talking about today. So it's a very basic problem, but it's a very big problem.

76
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:34,740
I was seven years old. There's now a hundred children who've been identified with that

77
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,519
problem. And I could feel it happening to me. I was quite ashamed and embarrassed. I thought there

78
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,199
must be something wrong with me. And that's when I kind of started realizing, okay, I need to

79
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:49,680
investigate this. I need to figure out what's actually happening here.

80
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,420
Yeah. And you just said depression, anxiety, particularly challenging in Australia,

81
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,480
and the evidence is there to suggest it. What's your...

82
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,839
What's your theory as to why, in what we often call the lucky country down here,

83
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,399
we have such an epidemic as we do in the rest of the world, but why particularly in Australia?

84
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,939
It's really interesting. I spent a lot of time in Australia, and I've interviewed a lot of experts

85
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:15,040
in Australia, and I absolutely love Australia. It's why I'm so excited to come back in October

86
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,660
for this speaking tour. I think the answer is complicated and we don't totally know,

87
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,120
but I think we've got a few hints. So what I learned from my book, Lost Connections, is that

88
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,399
there's scientific evidence for

89
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:32,980
brain factors that can make depression and anxiety, can cause it or make it much worse.

90
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:38,079
And some of them are in our biology. You know, there are real brain changes that happen when

91
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,939
you become depressed that can make it harder to get out, and your genes can make you more sensitive

92
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:48,040
to these problems. But most of the factors that cause depression and anxiety aren't factors in

93
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,259
our biology, they're factors in the way we live. And there's one in particular in Australia that's

94
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:57,459
shockingly high, which is loneliness. Already in the Western world,

95
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,540
we're the loneliest society there's ever been. There's a study that asked Americans,

96
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,579
how many close friends do you have who you could turn to in a crisis? And when they started doing

97
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:11,980
it years ago, the most common answer is five. Today, the most common answer is none, right?

98
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,740
I think the figure before the pandemic was 42% of Americans agreed with the statement,

99
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,579
no one knows me well. Like what is life like when no one knows you well,

100
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:27,160
you have no friends to share your joy or your pain with. And Australia is just off the scale

101
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,680
on loneliness for kind of complicated reasons. A lot of the other factors are going on as well,

102
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,420
the other factors that I wrote about. So yeah, I think that's a big thing that's going on there.

103
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:41,680
It's a real tragedy when you think, isn't it, that most people have got not one person in a crisis

104
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,439
they can call to support them or someone to turn to. And those numbers are, as you said, alarming,

105
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,360
particularly here in Australia. So much of what you write resonates, and you wrote this in Style

106
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,800
and Focus. At the moment, we think we are prosperous. If we are working ourselves ragged

107
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,500
to buy things, we're not going to be able to do that. We're not going to be able to do that.

108
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,800
We're not going to be able to do things, most of which don't even make us happy. We could

109
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,300
redefine prosperity to mean having time to spend with our children or to be in nature or to sleep

110
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,259
or to dream. Do you think we need to have a look at what success actually means?

111
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:15,980
Totally. And I feel that conflict in me. The way I began to think about this, Luke, is that,

112
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:21,319
so we all know that junk food has taken over our diets and made us physically sick, right? As you

113
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:27,139
can see from my chins, I'm not immune to that, right? I once got a Christmas card from KFC as

114
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:27,439
their best customer. I'm not immune to that, right? I once got a Christmas card from KFC as their best

115
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:27,480
customer. I'm not immune to that, right? I once got a Christmas card from KFC as their best customer.

116
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,279
It's not even a joke. And that wasn't even the fried chicken shop I went to the most.

117
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,039
But just like junk food has taken over our diets and made us physically sick,

118
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,919
there's this really interesting scientific evidence that a kind of junk values have taken

119
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:46,759
over our minds and made us mentally sick. But for thousands of years, philosophers have said,

120
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:53,240
if you think life is about money and status and showing off, you're going to feel like shit,

121
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,559
right? It's not an exact quote from Confucius or Schopenhauer, but that's basically what they said,

122
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,419
right? But weirdly,

123
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:01,899
nobody had actually scientifically investigated this until an incredible man who I got to

124
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:06,700
interview a lot named Professor Tim Kasser, who's at Knox College in Illinois, began to really dig

125
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:12,100
into this. And he discovered loads of things. But for the purposes of your question, I think the

126
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,340
most important thing he discovered is that the philosophers are right. The more you think life

127
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:21,440
is about money and status and showing off the kind of values that are just stimulated in you by

128
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,279
Instagram and advertising and so much of how we live, the more likely you are to become depressed

129
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,360
and anxious by it.

130
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,179
Quite a significant amount. And there's lots of reasons why, but one of them,

131
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,519
the way I began to think of it is we've been fed a kind of KFC for the soul.

132
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:41,279
We've been trained to look for happiness in all the wrong places. So at one level,

133
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,139
this is totally obvious and banal. Everyone listening knows none of you are going to lie

134
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:49,679
on your deathbed and think about all the likes you got on Instagram and all the shoes you bought

135
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,620
and all the money in the bank. You're not going to think about that. You're going to think about

136
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,360
moments of love and meaning and connection in your life.

137
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,240
But as Professor Kasa put it to me, we live in a machine that is designed to get us to neglect what

138
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,059
is most important about life. More three-year-old children know what the McDonald's M means than

139
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:12,059
know their own last name. For the moment we're born, we're pumped with these images. You don't

140
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:16,200
feel good. There's an answer to that. Go shopping. Display it on Instagram to make people say,

141
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:20,159
OMG, so jealous. Then when you don't feel good, work even harder to buy even more shit you don't

142
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:25,360
need to display even that on Instagram, right? So we're in this kind of ratchet. The fancy way of

143
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,340
putting it is we're in a value of value. We're in a value of value. We're in a value of value. We're in a value of value.

144
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,700
We're in a crisis of values. And it's really a kind of spiritual crisis. I'm not a religious

145
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:37,580
person, so I don't mean that as a kind of like God-bothering way. But it's a crisis of values.

146
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,500
We are taught to value the wrong things. I learned really interestingly there are interesting

147
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,419
techniques you can use to profoundly change your values and regain this, your inner conflict.

148
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:52,159
One of the ways Professor Kasa puts it as well is everyone is a mixture of two kinds of values.

149
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,080
The fancy term for them is intrinsic values and extrinsic values.

150
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,419
So imagine you play the piano. If you play the piano in the morning because you love it and it

151
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:06,139
gives you joy, that's what's called an intrinsic reason to play the piano. You're not doing it to

152
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:09,240
get anything out of it. You're just doing it because that's a thing you love to do, right?

153
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,679
Okay, now imagine you play the piano, not because you love it, but I don't know, because your parents

154
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:20,179
dream was to be a piano maestro and they're massively pressuring you. Or to post the clips

155
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,879
on Instagram to get likes and impress a woman. I don't know, maybe there's some woman out there

156
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,779
who's a piano fetishist, right? Loves a pianist.

157
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,659
Or you play the piano in a dive bar that you hate to pay the rent. Those would be what are called

158
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:36,139
extrinsic reasons to play the piano. You're not doing the thing because you love it. You're doing

159
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:40,100
it to get something out of it further down the line. And we're all a mixture of intrinsic and

160
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,379
extrinsic values. And you should be, right? You have to be to get through the day and it's healthy

161
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:48,720
to have both. But what's happened is our lives have become hugely dominated by extrinsic values.

162
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:54,259
They're hugely crowded out, intrinsic values. Think about how many times you'll be on a beautiful

163
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:56,340
beach and no one's looking at you. You're not looking at them. You're looking at them. You're

164
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,980
looking at the beach. They're just fucking taking pictures of it and posting them on Instagram and

165
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,919
then sitting there scrolling to see who commented and liked. That'd be a really good example of

166
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,860
people being jolted out of intrinsic experience. It's an amazing thing to be on a beach and watch

167
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:14,360
the sunset and into an extrinsic experience. But that's happening to us the whole time.

168
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,039
A kind of ego itching powder is being poured over us the whole time that's jolting us out

169
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:25,059
of these intrinsic experiences. That's just one of obviously many aspects of this, but I think that

170
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:26,000
is the case.

171
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,279
It's such a profound thing you're saying. I laugh and smile at times, but it's tragic really when

172
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,340
you think about it because we can all relate to that, can't you? You do sit on a beach now

173
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:40,460
somewhere beautiful in Hawaii and you look all around you and all it is is people taking photos

174
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,940
of themselves and not enjoying the moment for a second. I think your terminology again,

175
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,940
so that junk food for the soul is that our ultra processed foods killing us at one level, but

176
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,200
the same values that you just described are also poisoning.

177
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,919
People in horrific ways. We've got this anxious generation you talk about. Our kids are growing

178
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:05,600
up with more anxiety than we've ever seen before. Are you optimistic at all, Johan? Do you think that

179
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,519
there is a way to retrain ourselves? Because do you think we're taking the problem seriously enough?

180
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:17,059
I am optimistic. Well, I'm optimistic for lots of reasons, but one is it's like all the smoke

181
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:23,019
alarms are going off when depression and anxiety and addiction and attention problems are so

182
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:25,120
widespread in society. Obviously that's awful. It's

183
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,080
a distress signal. But as long as we learn to understand that these aren't signals,

184
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:37,460
that something deeper is going wrong, not just like purely biological malfunctions, like a

185
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:42,740
malfunction in a computer program or something, that they mean something, that your pain means

186
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:49,279
something, that it's connected to deeper problems and deeper unmet needs. Once we begin to understand

187
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,360
that, these problems can become fuel for actually changing and sorting out these problems.

188
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,000
And one of the reasons I'm optimistic, because

189
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,159
all my books, all the problems I write about, I don't write my books because I think of this as

190
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:05,120
like always an interesting intellectual problem, right? I mean, you know, I'm interested in

191
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,940
understanding the problem, but the reason I'm interested in understanding the problem is because

192
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,879
if you understand the problem differently, you get to different solutions, right?

193
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:15,620
There's a moment that's really fell into place for me. I'll never forget it. I was interviewing

194
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,120
this South African psychiatrist called Dr. Derek Summerfield, a great guy. And he told me this

195
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:26,120
story. So he happened to be in Cambodia in Southeast Asia in 2001, I think it was, when they

196
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,080
introduced chemical antidepressants for people in that country, they'd never had them in Cambodia

197
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:37,759
before. And he was like, he was with the doctors and they said to him, what are antidepressants?

198
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:43,460
And he explained. And they said to him, oh, we don't need them. We've already got antidepressants.

199
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,759
And he was like, what do you mean? He thought they were going to talk about some kind of herbal

200
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:53,720
remedy like St. John's wort or ginkgo biloba. Instead, they told him a story. There was a farmer

201
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,639
in their community who worked in the rice fields.

202
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,220
And one day he got his leg blown off by a landmine that was left over from the war with the U.S.

203
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:06,159
So they gave him an artificial leg. They're good at that in Cambodia. And a few months later,

204
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,799
he went back to work in the rice fields. But apparently it's very painful to work underwater

205
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,440
when you've got an artificial limb. And I'm obviously guessing it was pretty traumatic to

206
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:20,059
go back and work in the field where he got blown up. The guy started to cry all day. After a while,

207
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:26,100
he refused to get out of bed. He developed what we would call classic depression. The Cambodians said,

208
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,759
that's when we gave him an antidepressant. And Dr. Sommerfeld said, what was it?

209
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:38,340
They explained that they sat with him. They listened to him. You only had to listen to him

210
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:43,720
for five minutes to see why he was so distressed. One of the doctors thought, if we bought this guy

211
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,740
a cow, he could become a dairy farmer. He wouldn't be in this position that was screwing him up so

212
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,620
much. So they bought him a cow. Within a couple of weeks, his crying stopped. Within a month,

213
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,200
his depression was gone. It never came back. They said to Dr. Sommerfeld,

214
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,899
so you see, doctor, that cow, that was an antidepressant. That's what you mean, right?

215
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,879
Now, if you've been raised to think about depression the way we have, that sounds like

216
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:08,759
a weird joke. I went to my doctor for an antidepressant. She gave me a cow. But what

217
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:14,200
those Cambodian doctors knew intuitively from this kind of individual unscientific anecdote

218
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,360
is what the leading medical body in the whole world, the World Health Organization, has been

219
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,539
trying to tell us for years. If you're depressed, if you're anxious, you're not weak, you're not

220
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,240
crazy, you're not in the main.

221
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,840
You're a machine with broken parts. You're a human being with unmet needs. And what you need

222
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,200
is love and practical help to get those deeper needs met. So it's a very different way of thinking

223
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,220
about this. Of course, there are biological contributions. Of course, chemical antidepressants

224
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,740
can give some relief to some people. Anyone listening, if you're taking them and they're

225
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,440
helping you, carry on. But precisely because this problem goes deeper than our biology,

226
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:52,019
our understanding of it and the solutions to it need to go deeper. So of course, what I began to

227
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:56,059
ask is, well, what's the cow for the things that are screwing us up, right? And also go through a

228
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,100
lot of things in Lost Connections. But yeah, once you reframe with all these questions, addiction,

229
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:06,220
depression, attention problems, our weight problems, the subjects in my books, when you

230
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:11,859
understand what's causing these problems, it opens up a completely different set of solutions,

231
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:16,720
ones that actually work. And you do a brilliant job of that, Johan. You lift the lid for people

232
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,880
and you show them, yeah, our focus didn't just disappear. The fact that it's stolen focus is the

233
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,279
title of one of your books, meaning it's not the fault of the individual.

234
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:33,339
You give some great stats that people touch their phone 2,167 times a day. It's an actual stat that

235
00:17:33,339 --> 00:17:38,819
you give us. You mentioned earlier, the average office worker can now focus on a task for maybe

236
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:45,160
one minute at a time. Our kids' attention spans have been obliterated, really. Do you think that

237
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,000
helps people understanding that a lot of these things are actually factors out of their control?

238
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,180
I would put it slightly differently. I think you phrased that really well.

239
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,339
It's not that they're out of your control. It's that when we're in a situation where we're in a

240
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:02,140
we reframe them, we have to understand where our control lies. So to be honest, I'd felt my

241
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,819
attention was getting worse for a long time. I was really worried about some of the young people that

242
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:09,460
I love and have particularly disturbing experience with one of them that I can tell you about in

243
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:16,460
Graceland. To be honest, I put off investigating this for a long time, this subject, because I

244
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,640
thought the reason my attention was getting worse was obvious. I thought, well, you're just not

245
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,660
strong enough. You're lacking willpower. You're weak. You should have the strength to resist

246
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,339
these temptations. You should have the strength to resist these temptations. You should have the

247
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:30,400
So I thought maybe I'm just getting older. Maybe it's just that someone invented the smartphone

248
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,460
that fucked me over. I was very self-critical, self-blaming. Actually, for Stolen Focus, which

249
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:41,640
as you know, I'm coming to loads of Australian cities to talk about, I went on this big journey

250
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,119
all over the world from Moscow to Miami to Melbourne, your hometown, not just to cities

251
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:50,599
that begin with letter M. And I interviewed over 200 of the leading experts on attention and focus.

252
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,859
And what I learned is, in fact, there's scientific evidence for 12 factors that can make your

253
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:56,259
attention better or can make it worse.

254
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:00,420
And loads of the factors that can make your attention worse have been hugely rising in

255
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,900
recent years. So if you're struggling to focus and pay attention, if your kids are struggling

256
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,140
to focus and pay attention, there's nothing wrong with you and there's nothing wrong with them,

257
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,920
but there is something wrong with the way we're living. And once you understand what these 12

258
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,740
factors are, you actually begin to regain your power. There's sort of two levels at which you

259
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,119
can regain your power. There are individual change. The way I think of it is defense and

260
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,839
offense. There are loads of things that you can do immediately to defend yourself and your children.

261
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:29,920
Against these factors that are harming our attention, I go through loads of them in the book. I'm sure

262
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:35,460
we can talk about them. And then there's also offense. Because the truth is, and I want to

263
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,160
really level with people because I don't feel most people communicating about attention are

264
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,740
leveling with people. I'm passionately in favor of these individual changes. I'm sure we can talk

265
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,779
about them. I love them. I do them myself. They've massively improved my life. They'll massively

266
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:55,259
improve yours. On their own, they won't fully solve this problem. Because the truth is, this

267
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:56,339
didn't happen because you and me didn't do it. It didn't happen because you and me didn't do it.

268
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:59,519
It didn't happen because you and me had bad habits or our kids have bad habits. This happened

269
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:08,940
because some really big forces fucked with us for very clear reasons. And at some level and at some

270
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:14,140
point, we have to take on those forces that are doing this to us. I went to places that have begun

271
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:20,839
to do that, from France to New Zealand, and I saw how it's begun. So I think when you understand the

272
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:25,200
problem, it's not a problem located in you. I mean, you can have failings as well, like we all do.

273
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,960
That's not why this crisis suddenly blew up in our lifetimes, right? Because we suddenly all got

274
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,779
bad habits. Once you understand what's causing the problem, you can begin to actually locate

275
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:40,500
where your power really lies, which to some degrees in defensive measures as individuals

276
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,019
and families, and to some degrees as banding together as societies and taking on these

277
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:49,279
bigger forces. Yeah. And I speak to a lot of people in this format who have really,

278
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,960
really powerful habits and they can articulate them and identify them really clearly. And often

279
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,779
patterns in them. Most of them have a really clear exercise routine. Most of them have some

280
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:06,299
form of mindfulness practice, whatever that shows up like for them. They've got organisational

281
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:11,660
skills. They have a great understanding of sleep. For parents listening, I think for most of us as

282
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:16,339
parents, I think that's where the emotion kicks in. We're fighting with our kids on a daily basis,

283
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:20,059
trying to get them off their smartphones, trying to get them to live a healthier life.

284
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,980
What would you say to parents listening to this? What are the places where you would start to try

285
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,240
and support our kids to live a healthier and more focused life?

286
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,000
It's such an important question. It's something I think about a lot about the young people that I

287
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,799
love. I would start by saying why it matters, because I think we can see it more easily in

288
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,200
our kids than we can see in ourselves. I'll just say to anyone listening, think about anything

289
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,339
you've ever achieved in your life that you're proud of, whether it's starting a business,

290
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:50,220
being a good parent, learning to play the guitar, whatever it is. That thing that you're proud of

291
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,680
required a huge amount of sustained focus and attention. And the evidence is clear that when

292
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,059
the focus and pay attention breaks down, your ability to achieve your goals diminishes. Your

293
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:03,980
ability to solve your problems diminishes. You feel worse about yourself because you actually

294
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:09,039
are significantly less competent when you can't pay attention. Attention is our superpower as a

295
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,859
species. At the moment, we're surrounded by kryptonite, to extend this analogy probably too

296
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:20,000
far. But when you get your attention back, it's a feeling of regaining your competence. And we

297
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,539
can particularly worry about this with our kids, because we can see if your kids can't pay

298
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:25,119
attention, they're going to die. They'll be okay.

299
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,160
But they're never going to be what they could have been if they could have paid attention.

300
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:33,779
Think about in every domain, like we're speaking just after the Olympics, it's during the

301
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:38,940
Paralympics, I was just watching them before we spoke with my god sons. Think about the incredible

302
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,880
amount of achievement that goes in. That achievement comes from unbelievably hard and

303
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:50,480
sustained focus over really long periods of time. That's true of all achievement. You can't pay

304
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,059
attention, you're going to achieve much less in your life. So in terms of how we have that

305
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,819
conversation, obviously it's a conversation I have all the time with my nephews, my god

306
00:22:57,819 --> 00:23:04,220
sons, my niece. What absolutely does not work, and I understand the temptation to do it, and I've made

307
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,059
this mistake myself, so I'm not judging anyone who's done it, is standing over them saying,

308
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:12,240
there's something wrong with you. Because there's nothing wrong with them. There's something wrong

309
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,200
with the environment we've allowed to be built for them. I never approach them in a spirit of,

310
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:22,559
hey, listen, Sonny, I've got to tell you what's wrong with you. I always frame it as we're in a

311
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,519
shared struggle here. I've got this problem.

312
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,859
You've got this problem. And we all have that conflict where we're drawn to massive amounts

313
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:32,740
of distraction. And by the way, we want some of these distractions in our lives. I'm not saying

314
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,160
we should all go and live in a monastery, right? I want this to be part of our lives. We just don't

315
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,799
want it to dominate our lives in the way that it currently does. So you start from a position of,

316
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,720
we've got a shared problem here. What do you like about this stuff? What don't you like about this

317
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,759
stuff? How can we keep some of the stuff you like without all this stuff you don't like?

318
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,680
And then how can we build from there? In terms of advice I would give to parents, I would start,

319
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,180
there's loads of things, and we can go through.

320
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,339
There's many layers to this, but I would just start with one personal thing, and then we can go

321
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:04,420
to bigger stuff if you want. So this is something, I'm holding up something called a K-safe. As you

322
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:09,460
can see, it's a plastic safe. Go online, it's about a hundred bucks in Australian money. You take off

323
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:14,880
the lid, you put in your phone, you put on the lid, you turn this dial at the top, and it'll lock

324
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,599
your phone away for however long you tell it to, between five minutes and a whole day. You push

325
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:23,980
that button, it locks. You can't get your phone out, right? I use that for three hours a day to

326
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,859
do my writing.

327
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,819
I would have finished none of my books. I would recommend if you've got kids, get a K-safe and

328
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:36,819
just start with 15 minutes a day where you all put your phones in the K-safe and have to look

329
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:42,700
into each other's eyes, like in ye olden times. And it'll be really hard at first, right? But

330
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:50,720
the thing about attention is having someone actually listen to you and you actually listening

331
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,180
to them is so much more rewarding than whatever shitty update.

332
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,099
On Instagram, you're going to have to wait 15 minutes for, right? But you start small, you build

333
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:03,400
up those muscles. Now I can talk about lots of other, that's just one of dozens of things I would

334
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,140
say to parents, but I would start with that. I would say install on your phone and your kid's

335
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,339
phone, an app called Freedom. Do this with them. Don't impose it on them. Freedom can block you

336
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:17,400
either from specific websites. Let's say you're addicted to Instagram or eBay or TikTok or Porn

337
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,880
Hub, whatever it might be. You can say, don't let me go on that specific website for the next five

338
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,420
minutes, the next whole day. In fact, you should actually block porn sites,

339
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,140
even if your kids want them, but with the other stuff, negotiate with them. You can say for five

340
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:33,400
minutes for a whole day, you can say, give me an hour's window once a day. And then if you try to

341
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,400
go on it, it just says you have been set free and you can't get on it, right? So I have social media

342
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,119
permanently blocked on all my devices because I just don't want people to say at my funeral,

343
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:48,579
yeah, Johan spent a lot of time on Twitter. I just do not want that to be the life I had, right?

344
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,400
Your life is the sum total of the habits you had in that life, right? And there's no use saying I'm

345
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,740
the kind of person who reads books and runs on the beach. If hour by hour, you're spending your

346
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,920
life scrolling through TikTok. If you're the guy who spends your life scrolling through TikTok,

347
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,119
how you spend your hours is how you spend your life, right? I could say many, many more things,

348
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,619
but that's where I would begin the conversation. And then there's lots of other things I would

349
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:12,880
talk about. Yeah. And you've touched on that a few times. The regret of the dying is,

350
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,380
and I wish I loved and connected more and worked and strive less, or as it turns out,

351
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,420
maybe scrolled through my phone less. And I love some of the practical things you described there.

352
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,200
I did want to move on to your

353
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,059
book, Magic Pill, because it's such an important conversation to have. And I thought I'd just give

354
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:33,279
a little scene setter for those that maybe haven't had a chance to read. I'd encourage you to do it

355
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,500
because this is going to be the conversation of our times. In January, 2023, you started to inject

356
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,880
yourself once a week with Ozempic, one of the new drugs that produces significant weight loss.

357
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,660
And you're far from alone. There's some predictions that you talk about where potentially one in four

358
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:52,619
in the UK and the global population going forward will be taking a version of one of these Ozempic

359
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,740
80% of diets fail, but someone taking one of these new weight loss drugs can expect to lose a quarter

360
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,740
of their body weight in six months time. The drugs defenders will say this is a moment of liberation

361
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:10,059
from a condition that massively increases your chance of diabetes and cancer and early death.

362
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,980
I understand you still feel really conflicted about these Ozempic style drugs. Do they really

363
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,640
work as well as they sound? Are they a magic solution or a bit of a magic illusion you write

364
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,380
about? You found that the drugs alongside the massive benefits also have 12,

365
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,579
significant potential risks that you write about. I just wanted to ask you,

366
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:31,880
can you tell us a bit about your own personal journey with taking Ozempic?

367
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:38,140
Yeah, I remember so vividly the first time I learned about their existence.

368
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:45,079
It was that moment when the world was reopening again at the end of 2022. And I got invited to a

369
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:48,619
party for the first time in ages because no one had had any parties because the world was shut down.

370
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:53,619
And I thought, oh yeah, I remember them. Okay, I'll go. And I was in an Uber on the way there.

371
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,259
This party,

372
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,759
I'm not saying this just to name drop, it's relevant. This party was thrown by an Oscar

373
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,440
winning actor. And I was in an Uber on the way there. And I was feeling a bit kind of

374
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,980
self-conscious because I was quite fat when the pandemic started and I gained quite a lot of

375
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:11,259
weight during the pandemic. I thought, oh, it's a bit embarrassing. And then I thought,

376
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:16,140
oh, wait a minute. Actually, loads of people I know gained weight during the pandemic.

377
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,059
This party is going to be really interesting. I'm going to see all these Hollywood stars with a bit

378
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:24,259
of like podge on them. This is going to be fascinating. And I arrived and I started walking

379
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:29,619
around and it was the weirdest thing. It's not just that they hadn't gained weight. Everyone was

380
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:36,700
like gone. Like everyone was like markedly thinner and not just the stars, but like people I'd known

381
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:42,420
before, their agents, the screenwriters, the screenwriters, kids. Like I was like, wow.

382
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,720
And I bumped into a friend of mine on the dance floor and I said to her, wow, it looks like

383
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,480
everyone really did take up Pilates during lockdown. And she laughed. I didn't know why

384
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,819
she was laughing. And she said, right, well, you...

385
00:28:54,259 --> 00:29:00,079
You know, this isn't Pilates, right? And she showed me a photograph of an Ozempic pen. And I

386
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:03,779
then learned in the next few days that, and obviously spent a lot of time researching this

387
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:07,940
for the book, there has been a staggering medical breakthrough. Sometimes I've seen in the Australian

388
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,700
press, this is still being referred to as if it was like a fad or, you know, a diet craze. It's

389
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,220
really important people understand. There are lots of things to be worried about here, but this is

390
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:21,359
not a fad. For the first time, we have a drug that means the average person who takes it loses

391
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,660
about a quarter of their body weight within a year.

392
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:31,759
It is staggering. And it's not a diet drug in the conventional sense. It radically dials down

393
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:37,960
your hunger. I can explain how. And I remember as soon as I learned about this, I felt two

394
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,039
completely conflicting things. The first thing I thought was, well, this could save my life

395
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,799
because I was about to turn 44, which is the age my grandfather was when he died of a heart attack.

396
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:53,900
Loads of the men in my family get fat and die of heart attacks. My dad had terrible heart problems.

397
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,680
They didn't die of them. My uncle died of a heart attack. As I said, my granddad died of it.

398
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,460
And I thought, well, I knew then that obviously obesity makes heart disease much more likely. It

399
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:07,680
actually makes over 200 known diseases or complications. It either causes them or makes

400
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,259
them much worse. So I thought, wow, if we've got a drug that can reverse obesity, that's

401
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:19,680
a big deal. But I also thought, oh, wait a minute. This sounds way too good to be true.

402
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,460
What effortless weight loss. Come on now.

403
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:28,640
So for the book, I went on this big journey all over the world, from Iceland to Minneapolis to

404
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,940
Japan, to interview the leading experts, the biggest defenders, the biggest critics of the

405
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:38,359
drug, to dig into how we got to this point as a society where so many people want to take these

406
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:42,799
drugs, what the alternatives to these drugs are. What I learned is there's a lot to be worried

407
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,880
about here. There's some really big risks, but there are staggering benefits to these drugs.

408
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:52,640
It's a complicated picture, but people should be really excited. For people with obesity,

409
00:30:53,900 --> 00:31:00,099
this is a staggering game changer. There's a lot to worry about as well, but there's a lot to be

410
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:06,059
excited about. I want to touch on that because at the end of your book, you still say you can't

411
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:13,279
be in favor or against a Zempik because you outline 12 potential side effects. Fascinating

412
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:20,039
to hear you say now that for people with obesity, we know that the life expectancy and the issues

413
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:23,880
are complicated. But you talk about in the book,

414
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:28,880
about diminished muscle mass, fears about the prevalence of the increase in eating disorders.

415
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:34,339
Can I ask you this question then? What scares you the most about these Zempik-style drugs?

416
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:41,220
The way I would put it is these drugs are an unbelievably powerful tool. This is slightly

417
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:47,039
over the top, but only a little bit. The way I think of them is a bit like fire. Fire is a really

418
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:52,759
incredible tool. It's a great tool if I use it to warm my house up. It's a pretty shitty tool if I

419
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:53,880
use it to burn your house down. It's a pretty shitty tool if I use it to burn your house down.

420
00:31:53,900 --> 00:32:01,539
And when you get an incredibly powerful new tool, it will obviously have great strengths and great

421
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:08,819
drawbacks. So we know that if you are, as I was pretty much all my adult life, obese, if you take

422
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:12,619
these drugs and you cease to be obese, as I have, I've gone from being, I'm sorry, I know this doesn't

423
00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:16,440
work for Australians, but I was 14 and a half stone. I went down to I'm a little bit more than

424
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,019
11 stone now. I can never do pounds. I'm sorry, barbaric colonials will have to do the conversions

425
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:23,880
yourself. But we know that that reduces your risk of heart attack. And I think that's a really good

426
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:23,900
thing to do. And I think that's a really good thing to do. And I think that's a really good thing to

427
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,019
do. And I think that's a really good thing to do. And I think that's a really good thing to do.

428
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:32,079
stroke by 20% in two years. Incredible, right? Might well be saving my life. And there are huge

429
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:38,339
benefits like that for health. But there are also some pretty significant risks. In terms of what

430
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:43,720
worries me most. Well, there's what worries me for myself. And then there's what worries me

431
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,460
for the society and distinguish them a bit. What worries me most for myself, I've decided to

432
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,720
continue taking these drugs. Because the heart disease risk in my family is so great. Frankly,

433
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,099
out of vanity, like I prefer it now my neighbor's hot gardener hit on me within three months of like

434
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:02,559
taking them. There's loads of great things about not being fat, right? Which are not to do with

435
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,220
health. But so I tell myself it's primarily the health benefits. Some of my friends are like,

436
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:10,359
yeah, I can get real. Yeah, health benefits are nice. But come on, let's level with yourself.

437
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:17,099
What worries me for myself, there's a few things. One of them is that we don't know the long term

438
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:21,079
effects of these drugs. So diabetics have been taking them for people who don't know in addition

439
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:26,180
to having this incredible effect for weight loss. These drugs also treat type two diabetes,

440
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,019
and they stimulate the creation of insulin. So they've only been used for weight loss for a

441
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:36,160
couple of years, but diabetics have been using them for it'll be well 19 years now. So they

442
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,539
haven't been used for that long. There could be some long term effect of these drugs that we just

443
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:45,859
don't know about. Right? Especially since we know that these drugs work primarily by changing how

444
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:51,059
your brain works. That's pretty sobering, right? One of the obesity experts saying,

445
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:56,160
I interviewed a woman in New Orleans, brilliant woman called Dr. Shauna Levy, who's at the Tulane

446
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:02,319
University School of Medicine. She's an obesity specialist there. She said to me, we don't know

447
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:07,000
the long term effects of these drugs. But we do know the long term effects of obesity, and they

448
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,860
are catastrophic. So the long term effects of these drugs would have to be really bad to outweigh

449
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:18,219
the harms of obesity. Obesity makes pretty much everything we fear in medical terms much more

450
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:21,039
common. Dementia, heart disease, stroke.

451
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:27,800
Diabetes, cancer. I mean, I was embarrassed to say I was stunned by quite how bad for your obesity is

452
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:33,280
the evidence about this. That's my biggest worry for myself. My biggest worry for the society is

453
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,000
different. This is not something I think I'm saying I'm confident will not happen to me. But

454
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,280
I'm really worried about young girls with eating disorders getting hold of these drugs, which has

455
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,019
already begun. So I think got distinguished between people who take these drugs, who are obese,

456
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:50,320
who take them to come down to be a healthy weight for which there's a strong case, although there

457
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:50,800
are still significant risks. So I think we've got to distinguish between people who take these drugs,

458
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:50,900
who are obese, who take them to come down to be a healthy weight, for which there's a strong case,

459
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:57,280
and then there are people who are already healthy weight or indeed skinny who take them to be super

460
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,719
skinny. Like I was on a show recently with one of the Real Housewives of New Jersey who said we're

461
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:10,239
all on it and they were already skinny, right? Now, I don't judge anyone for doing that. Women

462
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:13,639
are made to feel like shit about their bodies, whatever they do. So I'm not standing over them

463
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:20,659
wagging my finger. I don't feel that way. But I am worried about that. And for a lot of people,

464
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:24,960
for lots of reasons, you mentioned loss of muscle mass, it can harm you. There's health risks to

465
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,820
being super skinny, right? Particularly as you age. But I'm most worried about girls with eating

466
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,500
disorders. I'm sure you've known, pretty much everyone has known someone with an eating disorder

467
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,420
in their life. Think about anorexia. If you're anorexic, there's a conflict going on inside you.

468
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,920
There's the biological part of you that wants to stay alive and therefore wants to eat.

469
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:49,360
And then there's the psychological part of you that for complicated reasons wants to starve yourself.

470
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:54,460
And what these drugs can do, if you take them at a high dose, they can just amputate your appetite.

471
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,199
They can just cut off that biological part of you that wants to eat. Obviously, you're taking too

472
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:03,619
high a dose if that happens, but that's what they want, right? If you have an eating disorder. And

473
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:08,360
there's already a, this is happening, Dr. Kimberly Dennis, one of the leading eating disorders

474
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,639
experts in the United States said to me that these drugs are rocket fuel for people with eating

475
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:17,019
disorders. So precisely because these drugs haven't arrived in huge numbers in Australia yet, except

476
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:18,440
for people with diabetes.

477
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,860
I would really urge Australia can get this right in a way that Britain and the US have not so far.

478
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,179
These drugs, I absolutely believe should be prescribed. More importantly, the world's

479
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:31,579
doctors and medical authorities think that, doesn't really matter what I think, but they should be

480
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:39,000
prescribed very tightly. So at the moment, right, I can look at you, you absolutely do not qualify

481
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,659
for these drugs, right? You do not meet the criteria. You are obviously not obese. I guarantee

482
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:47,519
you, you could get an appointment with a doctor on Zoom and pretend to be in Britain, get an

483
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:49,320
appointment with a doctor on Zoom or pretend to be in Britain. You could get an appointment with a doctor on

484
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,860
Vegas or anywhere in the US and you would get them delivered to an address in Britain or the US.

485
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:59,139
We need to do not allow them to be prescribed on Zoom in Australia, right? You should have to go

486
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:03,840
to a doctor. The doctor should weigh you and make sure you meet the medical criteria or you have

487
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,880
type two diabetes. If you don't meet the medical criteria, they shouldn't give it to you. And if

488
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,059
you're trying to get it, you're too skinny. They should be referring you for eating disorders,

489
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:17,179
counseling and help. I worry that in addition to the massive benefits for people like me,

490
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:19,300
and there will be many people in the world whose lives are

491
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,059
saved by these drugs, there will be no doubt about that, and whose lives are massively enriched

492
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:28,699
by it. The statistics that are emerging are staggering for the health benefits. I worry if

493
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:35,780
we don't fix the regulation, there will also be an opioid-like death toll of young girls. And for

494
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,920
complicated reasons, eating disorders mostly affect young girls, obviously sometimes boys,

495
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,780
sometimes older women, but it's overwhelmingly young girls. There'll just be a massive death

496
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:46,219
toll of young girls who would not have been able to starve themselves to death without these drugs,

497
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:49,300
but who will successfully starve themselves.

498
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:54,000
So yeah, and that's just one of the 12 drawbacks in addition to the benefits that I write about in

499
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,860
the book. I'm not normally on the one hand, on the other hand kind of person, but these drugs are

500
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:03,519
so powerful that the effects are complicated and we've got to level with people. The book is called

501
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:08,139
Magic Pill because there's three ways these drugs can be magic, right? The first way is they could

502
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:11,880
just solve the problem of obesity. I've got to level with you, Luke. There are days when it

503
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,119
feels like that. My whole adult life I've been obese. Now I inject myself in the leg once a week,

504
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:18,119
barely even feel it, tiny little scratch with an EpiPen.

505
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:26,000
I'm not fat anymore, right? It's mad. I don't feel hungry very much. I don't overeat. So it could be magic like that.

506
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,139
The second way it could be magic is more disturbing. It could be like a magic trick. It could be

507
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:35,500
like a magician who shows you a card trick while they pick your pocket. It could be that

508
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:40,900
over time the 12 risks associated with these drugs outweigh the benefits. I don't think

509
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,059
that's the most likely scenario, but you definitely can't rule it out. The third way it could

510
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:48,260
be magic is I actually think the most likely. Think about all the stories of magic that

511
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:48,880
we grew up with.

512
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:55,679
Think about Aladdin. You find the lamp, you rub it, the genie appears, the genie grants

513
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:03,559
your wish. And it comes true, but never quite in the way you expected. It has all these

514
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:07,820
unpredictable effects. And we're already seeing incredible, unpredictable rippling effects

515
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:14,599
throughout the economy in the US, where now half the population want to take these drugs.

516
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:18,599
So yeah, I think it's most likely to be magic in that third way. It's going to be unpredictable.

517
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:19,099
Yeah.

518
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,219
And for anyone that's considering it, you need to read Magic Pill because the brilliance

519
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:28,579
of Johan Hari is you go and speak to the best experts in the world. And there is no judgment

520
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:33,360
in your writing. You just present the facts as you hear them and see them. And it's a

521
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,760
complex one, this one. As you said, three-year-olds understand the McDonald's symbol before their

522
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:44,460
own surname often. We're filling the advertising world with these ultra-processed ads for McDonald's

523
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,280
and fast food chain. And then at the other end now, we're saying, here's a drug we can

524
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,019
inject yourself into.

525
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:56,340
So, it's a complex time, isn't it, for young people?

526
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,219
It's so interesting you say that, Luke, because actually, when I was thinking about that,

527
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:04,260
that whole thing you're talking about, there's a really interesting moment in the history

528
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,139
of Australia that I think helps us to think about this. So on the one hand, you look at

529
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:12,579
this and go, this is fucking crazy. How did we get to the point where half of Americans

530
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:16,659
want to inject themselves with a drug to stop themselves eating? That just seems so bizarre.

531
00:40:16,659 --> 00:40:19,000
How did we reach this point?

532
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,300
And I would just say to everyone,

533
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,539
just stop listening to this podcast for a second

534
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:23,739
and Google something for me.

535
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:27,099
Google, you can, I found it online.

536
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,599
When your prime minister drowned in,

537
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:31,519
I think it was 1966, Harold Holt.

538
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,719
So I'm sure people remember,

539
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,840
but he disappeared off a beach and was never found.

540
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:41,800
Just Google the beach, video the beach that day.

541
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,980
There's news footage of it.

542
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:45,639
So loads of ordinary Australians were just at the beach.

543
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:46,260
They looked for him.

544
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,280
And you look at this beach,

545
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,000
just look at the people on that beach for a minute

546
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,079
and then come back, right?

547
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,139
It's really weird.

548
00:40:55,699 --> 00:40:57,119
Everyone on the beach that day

549
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,420
looks to us to be skinny or ripped.

550
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,079
Everyone.

551
00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:01,360
You look at it and go,

552
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,199
huh, where was everyone else on the beach that day?

553
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,980
Was it like a skinny person convention

554
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,440
that Harold Holt was attending?

555
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:09,920
And then you look at the figures for Australia.

556
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,900
That's what people look like in 1966.

557
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,780
There were almost literally no fat people

558
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,940
in Australia in 1966.

559
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,260
So in the year,

560
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,119
I was born 1979,

561
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,679
6% of British people were obese.

562
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:27,539
Now it's 27% and rising rapidly, right?

563
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,380
Between the year I was born

564
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,760
and the year I turned 21,

565
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:32,599
obesity doubled.

566
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:34,860
And then in the next 20 years,

567
00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:36,360
severe obesity doubled again.

568
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:38,719
This is really strange.

569
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,579
Human beings exist in our modern form

570
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:43,659
for about 350,000 years,

571
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,639
between 300 and 350,000 years.

572
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:47,960
And obesity happens sometimes,

573
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,099
but it was not the case.

574
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:48,239
It was the case of obesity.

575
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:48,260
It was the case of obesity.

576
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,340
It was unbelievably rare.

577
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,619
And then literally,

578
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:52,039
I think we're probably about the same age, Luke,

579
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:53,679
in your lifetime and my lifetime,

580
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,659
it has blown the fuck up.

581
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:56,719
Why?

582
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,199
We know why.

583
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:02,059
This happens everywhere that makes one change.

584
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:04,960
It's where people go from mostly eating a diet

585
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,179
of fresh whole foods they prepare on the day

586
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:10,260
to mostly eating a diet of processed

587
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,460
and ultra-processed foods,

588
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:14,159
which means foods that are built in factories

589
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,659
out of chemicals in a process

590
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:17,079
that isn't actually even called cooking.

591
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,219
It's called manufacturing.

592
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:18,820
It's called manufacturing food.

593
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:22,820
And it turns out that new kind of food,

594
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,699
which never existed before,

595
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,659
your great-grandparents never had one mouthful of it,

596
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:26,199
nor did mine,

597
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,380
nor did anyone listening,

598
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:28,360
unless you're very young.

599
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
That new kind of food affects our bodies

600
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,199
in very different ways to the old kind of food.

601
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:36,599
And I go through lots of reasons why in Magic Pill,

602
00:42:36,659 --> 00:42:39,820
but there's an experiment that to me really nailed it,

603
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:42,079
done by a guy I interviewed called Dr. Paul Kenny.

604
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,519
He's the head of neuroscience at Mount Sinai,

605
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:45,159
a great scientist.

606
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:47,340
It's a super simple experiment.

607
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,179
You can all try it.

608
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:49,920
It's at home if you're feeling a little bit sadistic.

609
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:52,900
He got a lot of rats and he raised them in a cage.

610
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,039
And all they had to eat was the kind of natural whole foods

611
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:58,019
that rats evolved to eat over thousands of years.

612
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,900
And when that's all they had,

613
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:02,239
the rats would eat when they were hungry

614
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:04,380
and stop when they were full.

615
00:43:05,139 --> 00:43:06,119
They never overate.

616
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,400
They never became fat.

617
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,199
Then Dr. Kenny introduced them

618
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:12,659
to the kind of modern American diet

619
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:13,800
that's spreading all over the world,

620
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:14,659
almost all the world.

621
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:17,019
He fried up a load of bacon.

622
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,159
He bought a load of snacks.

623
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:18,860
He bought a load of Snickers bars.

624
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,280
Crucially, he bought a load of cheesecake.

625
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,139
And he put it in the cage.

626
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:26,519
And the rats went apeshit for the American diet.

627
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:27,500
Actually, I don't know if rats can't go apeshit.

628
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:29,619
The rats went crazy for the American diet.

629
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,179
They literally would dive into the cheesecake

630
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:34,280
and eat their way out

631
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,119
and just emerge completely slicked with cheesecake.

632
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:40,139
They ate and ate and ate and ate.

633
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:41,440
The way Dr. Kenny put it to me

634
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,719
is within a couple of days,

635
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,639
they were different animals.

636
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,900
And within a few weeks,

637
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,159
they were all severely obese.

638
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,139
Then Dr. Kenny,

639
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:49,340
Kenny tweaked the experiment again

640
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,579
in a way it feels a bit cruel to me.

641
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:52,460
He took away the American diet

642
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,099
and left them with nothing but the healthy food.

643
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:55,860
And he was sure he knew what would happen.

644
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,300
He thought they would eat more calories

645
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,119
than they had before.

646
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,940
And this would prove that exposure

647
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,079
to the American diet expands

648
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,619
the number of calories you eat in a day.

649
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,880
That is not what happened.

650
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:08,219
What happened was much weirder.

651
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,780
Once they'd had the American diet

652
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,000
and they stopped,

653
00:44:12,579 --> 00:44:15,079
they refused to eat anything at all.

654
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:18,119
It was like they no longer recognized healthy food

655
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:18,579
as food.

656
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,820
They literally only went back to eating healthy food

657
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,699
when they were actually starving to death.

658
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:24,639
Now to me,

659
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,639
I've nicknamed that experiment Cheesecake Park.

660
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:29,940
I would argue we are all living

661
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,119
in a version of that experiment.

662
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,820
We're all living in Cheesecake Park.

663
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,079
Processed and ultra-processed foods

664
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:37,719
undermine your ability to feel full

665
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:39,840
and to get the signal from your body,

666
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,559
hey, stop eating now.

667
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:42,260
You've had enough.

668
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:43,739
And what these drugs do

669
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:45,239
is they give you back that feeling of fullness.

670
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:46,920
I actually realized when I started taking Osempic,

671
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,099
I had never really felt,

672
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:49,219
I had never really felt full in my life.

673
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,280
I'd felt stuffed.

674
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,880
I'd felt so stuffed I couldn't eat anymore.

675
00:44:52,219 --> 00:44:53,400
But I'd never felt full,

676
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,699
not in the way I do now.

677
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,820
But obviously that comes at a cost, right?

678
00:44:57,039 --> 00:44:58,639
So obviously the deeper solution is

679
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:00,539
let's not fuck up our kids

680
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:01,960
by feeding them this shit.

681
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:03,719
Now again, that's not something that you...

682
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:04,300
As we can see,

683
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,219
because I went to Japan

684
00:45:05,219 --> 00:45:07,139
where they don't allow that to be done to their kids

685
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:10,420
and there is literally no childhood obesity in Japan.

686
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:12,239
It's a statistically negligible amount.

687
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,079
It's a very weird thing

688
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,260
to walk around a school of a thousand children

689
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,099
and there be not one child.

690
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:19,800
One single fat child in that school.

691
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,039
It's bizarre, right?

692
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:23,579
I talk about how Japan achieved that in the book,

693
00:45:23,659 --> 00:45:25,440
but we should follow Japan's lead.

694
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,400
But for someone like me,

695
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,380
it's too late for that, right?

696
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,719
Like I would love to wind the clock back to my childhood

697
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:34,059
and do that, but I can't do that, right?

698
00:45:34,059 --> 00:45:35,360
So I face this difficult choice,

699
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,360
but we should not tolerate that being the choice forever.

700
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,619
We can solve the problem at root.

701
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:41,840
You have to take on the food industry.

702
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,179
You have to take on all sorts of factors.

703
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,920
You have to do what Japan has done,

704
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,860
but we can do that.

705
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,280
Japan is not a fictional country.

706
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,059
It can feel like...

707
00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:49,340
It can feel like it a bit at times, but it's not.

708
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,940
So yeah, we've got to solve the deeper problem.

709
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:54,780
But in the meantime, we face a difficult choice, right?

710
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,840
And some people go,

711
00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:58,280
well, you know, I thought this myself.

712
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,019
Am I being hypocritical taking the drugs?

713
00:46:00,139 --> 00:46:01,400
Because I talk all the time

714
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,340
about how we've got to solve these deeper problems.

715
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,659
So it's a hypocrisy.

716
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,500
But the way I began to think about it is,

717
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:08,659
you know, I spend a lot more time in the US.

718
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,460
I'm passionately in favor of gun control,

719
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,699
partly because of the lesson we have in Australia.

720
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,699
You haven't had any massacres since the Port Arthur massacre

721
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:17,440
because of what John Howard did.

722
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:17,500
Right?

723
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:17,559
Right?

724
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:17,619
Right?

725
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:17,639
Right?

726
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:17,659
Right?

727
00:46:17,659 --> 00:46:17,679
Right?

728
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:17,699
Right?

729
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:17,719
Right?

730
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:17,739
Right?

731
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:19,099
And the Australian people supported.

732
00:46:19,659 --> 00:46:20,940
I'm in favor of gun control.

733
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,300
Someone I know was murdered in a 7-Eleven in Vegas

734
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,559
in gun violence.

735
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,760
Random gun violence.

736
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:30,039
Not very long ago.

737
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,320
I'm passionately in favor of gun control,

738
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,500
but if I had been there when my friend Tommy was shot,

739
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,239
I would not have stood over him and said,

740
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,880
well, guys, we've got to close the gun show loophole

741
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,179
and we've got to ban bump stocks and we've got to...

742
00:46:42,179 --> 00:46:44,199
No, I would have phoned an ambulance, right?

743
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:46,940
Like, in the same way,

744
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,400
of course, we should deal with the deeper factors

745
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,619
driving up the obesity crisis,

746
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:53,340
but if you're someone who's already been fucked

747
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,739
by the fact we're in this situation,

748
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,159
I'm not going to stand over you, wag my finger and say,

749
00:46:57,219 --> 00:46:58,719
well, we've got to deal with the deeper social factors.

750
00:46:59,099 --> 00:46:59,880
I'm going to say, yeah,

751
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,019
let's make sure we all live to fight another day

752
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:04,260
and then we can deal with the deeper social factors.

753
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,739
I can't deal with the deeper social factors

754
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,119
if I die of a heart attack, right?

755
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,420
Yeah, brilliantly said.

756
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,880
And you articulate that in a really fair and unique way.

757
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,280
I have to go back and comment on Harold Holtbrief.

758
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,739
I'm sitting about 45 minutes from that beach

759
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,260
and I have looked at that vision before

760
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,400
and it is stark to see how different, you know, 1966.

761
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,460
In a classic Australian one,

762
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:27,000
only Australians can then name swimming pools

763
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,579
after a former prime minister who's drowned.

764
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:30,440
It makes me so happy.

765
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:32,639
And the Harold Holt pool is about 10 minutes

766
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:33,179
from where I'm sitting.

767
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,980
It's just...

768
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,179
One of the many things I love about Australia,

769
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:39,380
if you ever say to someone you want to distill

770
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,380
the Australian spirit into one thing,

771
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:42,619
I wouldn't show them Uluru,

772
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:43,960
I wouldn't show them a fucking koala.

773
00:47:44,539 --> 00:47:45,980
Here's the Harold Holt swing pool.

774
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:46,219
Huh?

775
00:47:46,219 --> 00:47:47,059
Why is it called that?

776
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,980
Because that prime minister fucking drowned.

777
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,820
It'd be like having a JFK shooting range or something.

778
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,860
Like, what are you doing?

779
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:53,679
Love it.

780
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,739
So Australian.

781
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,739
And the fact that you can disappear off that beach

782
00:47:57,739 --> 00:47:58,699
and never be seen again

783
00:47:58,699 --> 00:48:01,179
is still one of the great bizarre mysteries of life.

784
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,659
I love this saying, Johan, that success leaves clues.

785
00:48:03,739 --> 00:48:06,880
And I'm curious to fire a few questions your way

786
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,139
and just around what successful people like you

787
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:11,820
and you've had an incredible, fascinating, interesting life

788
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,739
and this idea of self-leadership.

789
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:15,940
But you've overcome your own fair share of challenges

790
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,599
in your life when you read about your history

791
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,119
before becoming this incredible, successful and trusted author.

792
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:22,280
You have battled your own addiction,

793
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,679
which you're incredibly open about.

794
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,280
And you resigned from your dream job as a columnist

795
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,059
and you had some public challenges with that.

796
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,159
And we know it's incredibly hard to lead other people

797
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,619
and do what you're doing without an understanding of yourself.

798
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,039
How would you describe the way that you lead yourself now?

799
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:38,320
It's interesting.

800
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,559
I don't know why, but that concept of leading myself doesn't,

801
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,840
it's not how I think about myself.

802
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,699
So I've got to think about it for a moment.

803
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:52,239
But I pursue things that I find incredibly meaningful.

804
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,239
So for me, when you get knocked off course, as we all do,

805
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,219
you face challenges, you face drawbacks.

806
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:04,480
Every book I ever write, very early on in writing it,

807
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:09,219
I write on top of it a paper, why does this matter?

808
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:15,840
And I write a list of reasons why it matters, why I'm doing it.

809
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:16,820
Why is it important?

810
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,900
And then when I have moments of writing,

811
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,579
I don't like it when writers go, oh, writing is so hard.

812
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,639
My grandmother left school when she was 13.

813
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,699
She spent her whole fucking life cleaning toilets.

814
00:49:28,219 --> 00:49:30,239
I would not go back in time and say to my grandmother,

815
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,420
God, my life's so hard.

816
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:34,320
I think when writers say that, I say, get a fucking grip, mate.

817
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,960
Go look at how the rest of the world lives.

818
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:39,920
Yeah, there are challenges in our job, but we're really fucking lucky.

819
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,659
So with that caveat, when my job is hard,

820
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:45,920
I re-anchor myself.

821
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:46,960
I re-anchor myself around meaning.

822
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,039
Meaning gets you through a lot.

823
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:55,860
I interviewed a really amazing Russian psychologist in Moscow

824
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:59,820
who said to me once, you know, Russians,

825
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:05,119
when we look at Anglo-American philosophy and psychology,

826
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:09,079
we just laugh because you talk all the time about,

827
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:13,639
oh, you know, life is about pursuing happiness.

828
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,280
You know, it's even there in,

829
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,260
is it the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution?

830
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,619
I forget the Declaration of Independence, you know.

831
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,679
So this is just, to us, this is a joke.

832
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,840
Happiness will come and go and you have very little control over it.

833
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:27,400
Life isn't about pursuing happiness.

834
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:29,000
Life is about pursuing meaning.

835
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:33,420
And when you've got meaning, you can absorb a huge amount of pain.

836
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:35,219
Just think about, this is a trivial example,

837
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,699
but I went to the dentist last week, right?

838
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,400
It was fucking agony.

839
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,900
But because that pain happened in the context of a system of meaning,

840
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,019
the dentist said, I'm going to inflict terrible pain on you,

841
00:50:47,179 --> 00:50:49,619
but it's so that you don't feel more pain in the future

842
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:51,579
and so that your teeth look nice and you're not fucked up.

843
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:54,039
Actually, I was able to endure that pain pretty easily.

844
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,980
Now, if someone broke into my house now

845
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,000
and stuck a drill into my mouth for no reason,

846
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,699
that would literally be torture.

847
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,539
I would be like traumatized for years, right?

848
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,920
So you see the difference is, what's the difference between the two?

849
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,780
So only one thing, which is the system of meaning surrounding it.

850
00:51:08,179 --> 00:51:12,280
If you have a system of meaning, you will be able to absorb a lot, right?

851
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:13,599
So for me, I think,

852
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,239
one of the reasons, one of the ways I sort of lead myself

853
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,539
is I establish, I work on things that are very meaningful to me

854
00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:21,980
and I anchor myself in that meaning

855
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:26,400
and I systematically remind myself of the meaning of what I'm doing.

856
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,619
Yeah, Johan, and the next sort of dimension I want to talk to you about

857
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:30,460
is that impact.

858
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:33,199
I mean, you've had a global impact on the way people think

859
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:36,460
and given people practical advice

860
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,880
and really important information in ways they haven't had before

861
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:43,199
and things that are incredibly challenging for those of us living

862
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:43,579
in the world.

863
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,960
What's your advice on how people can impact the way that you've been able

864
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,119
to go about other people or to be able to lead the teams of people

865
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:52,559
that they're in?

866
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:55,519
You write books and it's a bit of a solo pursuit that you're in,

867
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,000
but do you think about that impact that you have on others

868
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,760
in the work that you do?

869
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,559
I do think about it.

870
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:02,619
It wouldn't be honest if I said I didn't.

871
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,059
I was told something in the zoo in Sydney once.

872
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,559
Koala is obviously the only thing they eat, it's eucalyptus leaves,

873
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,239
but they're so thick that if the eucalyptus,

874
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,199
eucalyptus leaves are not above them,

875
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:17,059
they don't recognize it as food.

876
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:20,340
So the person said to me that a koala would starve to death

877
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:24,039
in a room full of eucalyptus leaves if they were just on the floor.

878
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:24,820
I don't know if that's actually true.

879
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:25,539
I'm going to look it up.

880
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:29,960
But the reason I mentioned that is because I think in a way,

881
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,159
a lot of us are a bit like those koalas.

882
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:36,519
The thing that drives me forward most is curiosity.

883
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,219
I'm really curious about other people.

884
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,480
I like almost everyone I actually meet.

885
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,019
And everyone you meet, you just think every single person you ever meet

886
00:52:47,019 --> 00:52:48,260
knows stuff you don't know.

887
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:51,980
And they've had a life you haven't had.

888
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:55,119
And if you can tap into that,

889
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:58,739
if you can just be curious about people and develop skills

890
00:52:58,739 --> 00:53:00,719
to kind of help people talk about themselves,

891
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,199
the world is like infinitely abundant.

892
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,460
You're just surrounded by riches.

893
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,280
But I think a lot of us, because we're in this culture,

894
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:10,719
again, it's not our fault, encourages us to be narcissistic,

895
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:13,239
to think about ourselves, to be kind of,

896
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:15,480
you know, sealed off in our own egos.

897
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:20,639
We're a bit like this hypothetical koala that's in a room full of eucalyptus leaves

898
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:23,139
but just doesn't even recognize it and is starving to death, right?

899
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,780
So I think the more you can be genuinely curious,

900
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:30,579
I think some people think that leadership is standing above people

901
00:53:30,579 --> 00:53:33,059
and directing them, right?

902
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:35,460
And of course, there'll be times when leaders have to be like that, right?

903
00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:41,340
A general on a battlefield is not conducting an open seminar the whole time, right?

904
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,159
The more you can be driven by curiosity,

905
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,599
the more you genuinely listen to people,

906
00:53:49,219 --> 00:53:52,940
I think the, firstly, just the smarter you'll be.

907
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,219
Like, you learn stuff from everyone, right?

908
00:53:56,659 --> 00:53:59,440
But also, the more people will lean into you,

909
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,360
particularly in a very narcissistic age,

910
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,840
when actually very few people feel listened to,

911
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,400
very few people are listened to,

912
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:08,719
I think the core of the answer to what you're,

913
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:10,059
I'm not quite getting at it,

914
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:10,519
but the,

915
00:54:10,519 --> 00:54:11,320
the,

916
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,500
the reason I think I'm effective in so far as I am

917
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,300
is because I'm genuinely curious about these questions

918
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,679
and that means that I'm also eager once I've learned it

919
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:24,639
to communicate it to other people, right?

920
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:27,940
So I think a lot about how to communicate with people.

921
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,159
I don't talk in an,

922
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,039
you know, also partly, you know,

923
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:32,019
I'm from a working class family,

924
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:33,019
my dad was a bus driver,

925
00:54:33,139 --> 00:54:34,000
my mom was a nurse

926
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,900
and then worked in shelters for victims of domestic violence.

927
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,199
I was mostly raised by my grandmother

928
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:39,940
because my mother was ill,

929
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,920
my dad was in a different country,

930
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,300
so most of the time,

931
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:41,780
I was raised by my grandmother

932
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,320
who, like I say,

933
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,420
left school when she was 13,

934
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,280
was a fucking amazing person.

935
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,059
I want to communicate

936
00:54:47,059 --> 00:54:49,059
with the widest possible range of people.

937
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,280
I would always want to write a book

938
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,619
that my grandmother could have read, right?

939
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,300
A lot of people think kind of,

940
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,159
well, the wanky term,

941
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,099
even I even hate to use it,

942
00:54:58,159 --> 00:54:58,940
but like thought leadership,

943
00:54:59,139 --> 00:55:00,400
a lot of people think thought leadership

944
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,980
is making things complicated.

945
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,059
You know, you don't want to simplify things,

946
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:08,960
but at all,

947
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,179
but real intelligence comes from,

948
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:13,360
from making complicated things comprehensible,

949
00:55:13,659 --> 00:55:15,980
not from making simple things incomprehensible,

950
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:17,840
which is how many people seem to think of it.

951
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,780
Which is the genius of your writing for me

952
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,280
is that you take these complex issues

953
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,719
and you write them in a way

954
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,840
that we can understand that very few can.

955
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,099
I want to pick up on that curiosity

956
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:27,679
because you strike me

957
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:28,679
as one of the most curious people

958
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:31,780
I've ever had the pleasure of speaking to you.

959
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:34,780
Could you give an example of a rabbit hole

960
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:35,860
you've gone down recently

961
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,679
where that curiosity just takes you

962
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:39,460
into a different direction?

963
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,159
Well, the last 15 years,

964
00:55:41,179 --> 00:55:42,980
I've been investigating a series of crimes

965
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,300
that have been happening in Las Vegas.

966
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,679
My publishers will taser me

967
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:48,519
if I talk about it too much, but...

968
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:49,460
Is that the next book?

969
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:50,440
Is that...

970
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:50,960
Yeah.

971
00:55:52,659 --> 00:55:54,800
And I've been working on it a really long time.

972
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,179
It's a really strange story, but...

973
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,519
And so on that, without giving away,

974
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,219
which you won't with the book to come out,

975
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,000
is it just a story that takes you

976
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,559
and that's enough to send you

977
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:10,400
on a mission to uncover more?

978
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,159
I mean, so it feels like,

979
00:56:11,179 --> 00:56:14,059
a very different genre for you to go down.

980
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,780
It's just curiosity's got you

981
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:16,760
and you want to tell this story?

982
00:56:17,739 --> 00:56:19,719
I learned that there were people living

983
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:21,539
in the drainage tunnels beneath Las Vegas.

984
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,159
So I went there in 2011

985
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:27,159
and I met this amazing couple

986
00:56:27,159 --> 00:56:29,480
who I really kind of fell in love with

987
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,239
who were living there.

988
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:33,659
And they brought me into this world

989
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:37,579
and then we discovered some really

990
00:56:37,579 --> 00:56:40,500
strange things were happening

991
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,159
in that world.

992
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:45,260
And I kept going back.

993
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:51,219
And it was curiosity.

994
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,619
It was concern for them.

995
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,780
It was something in myself.

996
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,119
I think a lot of people

997
00:56:58,119 --> 00:56:59,360
who spend a lot of time in Vegas,

998
00:56:59,659 --> 00:57:00,179
they...

999
00:57:01,099 --> 00:57:03,639
Vegas attracts people who have a wound

1000
00:57:03,639 --> 00:57:05,000
and don't quite know what it is.

1001
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,420
That's a very pretentious thing to say,

1002
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,360
but I do think it's true.

1003
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,280
Benny Binion, who was in one of the

1004
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,159
kind of...

1005
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:13,519
iconic casino owners of Vegas,

1006
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:13,800
said,

1007
00:57:14,019 --> 00:57:15,619
if you have a weakness,

1008
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,000
Las Vegas will find it.

1009
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:20,639
Which I thought was a very true thing to say.

1010
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,599
But yeah, I think there are lots of things.

1011
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,800
So, I mean, that's been a bizarre rabbit hole

1012
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,519
for a big part of my life.

1013
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,320
And there's something about...

1014
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,599
You get a depth of understanding

1015
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:35,400
when you work on something

1016
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,760
for such a long time.

1017
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,340
Although I did the other day,

1018
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,079
quite recently,

1019
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,719
get someone I know

1020
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:41,800
who lives in one of the tunnels saying,

1021
00:57:42,019 --> 00:57:43,579
have you still not written your book yet?

1022
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:44,139
I was like, wow,

1023
00:57:44,179 --> 00:57:45,679
I'm being chided on unproductivity

1024
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:47,820
by one of our J's who lives in the tunnel.

1025
00:57:48,619 --> 00:57:50,719
This is not a good sign, but...

1026
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:51,940
Johan Hari,

1027
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:54,099
who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1028
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,519
Oh God, there's so many.

1029
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:56,539
My grandmother.

1030
00:57:57,239 --> 00:57:58,539
It was a great human being.

1031
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,380
Two people come to mind.

1032
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,099
My friend, Dorothy Byrne.

1033
00:58:02,659 --> 00:58:03,679
So lots of British people

1034
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:04,360
will know who I'm talking about.

1035
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:05,739
Dorothy is an absolute legend

1036
00:58:05,739 --> 00:58:06,860
in British television.

1037
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:08,980
She was the first woman

1038
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:09,980
to run orchestras

1039
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:11,699
for Current Affairs and News

1040
00:58:11,699 --> 00:58:12,739
for a British TV channel

1041
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,019
for Channel 4 News in Britain.

1042
00:58:15,179 --> 00:58:16,500
She ran it for 20 years.

1043
00:58:16,679 --> 00:58:18,500
She's one of the wisest people I know.

1044
00:58:18,539 --> 00:58:19,699
She's one of the funniest people I know.

1045
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,019
One of the wisest people I know.

1046
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:22,980
And she's a really...

1047
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,480
If people Google Dorothy Byrne,

1048
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:25,980
it's B-Y-R-N-E.

1049
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,099
She gave something called

1050
00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:29,260
the McTaggart Lecture in 2019,

1051
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:29,880
I think it was,

1052
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,360
which is like one of the funniest

1053
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,619
and most brilliant talks you'll ever see.

1054
00:58:33,699 --> 00:58:34,219
And you get a sense

1055
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:36,639
of what an incredible human being Dorothy is.

1056
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,780
But she's someone I've...

1057
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,079
We've been friends for 20 years.

1058
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:40,699
She's someone I go,

1059
00:58:40,699 --> 00:58:41,599
I go to for advice a lot.

1060
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:44,800
She's got a really interesting style, Dorothy.

1061
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,579
She's just an incredible human being.

1062
00:58:46,699 --> 00:58:47,340
She's someone...

1063
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,340
Another one is someone in Vegas,

1064
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:49,460
my friend Paul Votrino

1065
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,099
and my friends Paul and Rob,

1066
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,300
Rob Banghart.

1067
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:53,760
Paul and Rob used to live

1068
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,920
in the tunnels beneath Vegas.

1069
00:58:55,639 --> 00:58:56,559
They got out.

1070
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,880
They now run a group

1071
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,219
which people can donate to online

1072
00:58:59,219 --> 00:59:00,119
called Shine a Light

1073
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:03,460
where they go back into the tunnels every day.

1074
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,320
They give out supplies,

1075
00:59:05,619 --> 00:59:06,539
food, water,

1076
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:07,880
sanitary products,

1077
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:09,500
stuff people need,

1078
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,500
but also most importantly,

1079
00:59:10,699 --> 00:59:11,980
they offer people help.

1080
00:59:12,099 --> 00:59:12,980
So if you want to get out,

1081
00:59:13,139 --> 00:59:13,900
they help you.

1082
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,559
They've got hundreds of people

1083
00:59:15,559 --> 00:59:16,219
out of the tunnels

1084
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,380
and back to a healthy life.

1085
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,920
They're just the best people I've ever met.

1086
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:23,000
They're amazing people.

1087
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,699
And they're like a real model of...

1088
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,800
I was thinking about a model of leaders.

1089
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:27,539
They're, fuck me,

1090
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:27,699
they...

1091
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,480
Rob and Paul know how to lead.

1092
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:29,699
And it's...

1093
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,239
In a funny way, like Dorothy,

1094
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:32,699
they lead in a very...

1095
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:35,019
They're hard-headed people,

1096
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:36,460
but they lead very much

1097
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:37,860
in a spirit of love and compassion.

1098
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:40,300
Dorothy's very much like that.

1099
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:40,659
And Dorothy,

1100
00:59:40,659 --> 00:59:42,960
what I love about Dorothy's style of leadership

1101
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,219
and Rob and Paul's style of leadership

1102
00:59:44,219 --> 00:59:47,139
is they're people who are very focused

1103
00:59:47,139 --> 00:59:48,900
on the people who most need help.

1104
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:49,480
I'll give you an example.

1105
00:59:49,579 --> 00:59:49,880
Dorothy,

1106
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,780
there was a paedophile in Britain

1107
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:52,739
called Sidney Cook

1108
00:59:52,739 --> 00:59:55,119
who was one of the worst child abusers

1109
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:55,820
in British history.

1110
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:58,320
And Sidney Cook was about to be released.

1111
00:59:59,219 --> 01:00:00,800
And Dorothy went into the NEWS meeting

1112
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,699
and they're having all this conversation about

1113
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:04,719
where's Sidney Cook going to live

1114
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:05,480
when he's released

1115
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,659
and how that's going to be handled.

1116
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,239
And Dorothy said to them,

1117
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,460
you're all asking the wrong question.

1118
01:00:10,659 --> 01:00:11,760
The question isn't

1119
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,820
where will Sidney Cook live

1120
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:14,059
when he's released?

1121
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,199
The question is,

1122
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,800
why the fuck is Sidney Cook being released?

1123
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,820
He's one of the worst paedophiles

1124
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:18,500
in British history.

1125
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:20,679
Let's find all his other victims

1126
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:21,659
who haven't come forward

1127
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:23,760
and make sure he never gets out of prison.

1128
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:24,539
Right?

1129
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,139
So she then makes a film about that.

1130
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:28,780
He never got out of prison.

1131
01:00:29,019 --> 01:00:29,219
Right?

1132
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:30,619
I mean, I could tell you

1133
01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:32,000
like a hundred things like that

1134
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,719
that Dorothy did and led.

1135
01:00:34,579 --> 01:00:36,440
Lots of Australians will have seen

1136
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,260
she made the documentary

1137
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:38,219
Leaving Neverland

1138
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:39,860
about Michael Jackson.

1139
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:40,619
That was her idea.

1140
01:00:40,659 --> 01:00:41,900
She was one of the producers.

1141
01:00:42,579 --> 01:00:43,760
She made the recent documentary

1142
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,739
about Kevin Spacey

1143
01:00:44,739 --> 01:00:46,039
with my other amazing friend

1144
01:00:46,039 --> 01:00:46,860
Patrick Strudwick

1145
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,639
exposing him.

1146
01:00:49,019 --> 01:00:49,179
You know,

1147
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:50,619
I mean, Dorothy has just

1148
01:00:50,619 --> 01:00:52,199
fearlessly taken on

1149
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:53,099
very powerful people

1150
01:00:53,099 --> 01:00:54,280
in the interests of powerless

1151
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,480
or people who don't have much power.

1152
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,880
And Rob and Paul are the same.

1153
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,599
Always focused on, you know,

1154
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,559
hard to imagine less powerful people

1155
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:03,039
than people literally living in the drains.

1156
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:05,019
They are focused every day on

1157
01:01:05,019 --> 01:01:07,579
they are rightly as valuable

1158
01:01:07,579 --> 01:01:09,280
as every other person in Las Vegas.

1159
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:10,519
And okay,

1160
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:11,519
how do we get them

1161
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:12,920
the help they need

1162
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:13,760
to live the lives

1163
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,860
that they deserve to live?

1164
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,139
Yeah, brilliant answers.

1165
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:17,559
I love asking that question.

1166
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,699
You know, you went to your grandma

1167
01:01:18,699 --> 01:01:20,199
and then these extraordinary people

1168
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:22,400
and that's what fills me with optimism

1169
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,300
is there's great people

1170
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,659
doing extraordinary things.

1171
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,380
And, you know, for someone like you

1172
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:27,500
to shine a light on that

1173
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,320
as you do is a really powerful thing.

1174
01:01:29,539 --> 01:01:30,920
We're a bit obsessed with collaboration.

1175
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:31,800
We feel like the world

1176
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,739
had gone into silos

1177
01:01:33,739 --> 01:01:35,139
and people, as you described,

1178
01:01:35,219 --> 01:01:36,480
loneliness is a huge issue

1179
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,980
and great things happen

1180
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,400
when you connect people together

1181
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,400
in unique ways.

1182
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,539
From different backgrounds,

1183
01:01:41,659 --> 01:01:43,099
a bit like your answer there, isn't it?

1184
01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:43,940
Two people living

1185
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,659
in the drains of Las Vegas.

1186
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:46,719
Most of us didn't even know

1187
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:47,940
there were drains in Las Vegas,

1188
01:01:48,019 --> 01:01:49,619
let alone a community living down there

1189
01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:51,139
and exceptional producers

1190
01:01:51,139 --> 01:01:52,219
changing the world.

1191
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,239
Is there been someone you thought,

1192
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,840
God, I'd love to collaborate with them

1193
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,940
on a project

1194
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:58,420
or another passion of yours

1195
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,099
or another area of your life?

1196
01:02:00,139 --> 01:02:02,059
Is there a name that comes to mind?

1197
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:02,840
Clearly you've had access

1198
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,280
to interesting people over the journey,

1199
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:05,059
but has there been anyone

1200
01:02:05,059 --> 01:02:06,539
that you've been curious about?

1201
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,619
I've been like freakishly

1202
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:10,239
and insanely

1203
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:11,559
lucky on this front.

1204
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:13,159
For my book, Stolen Focus,

1205
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:15,280
I did this experiment

1206
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,579
where I went off the internet

1207
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:17,239
for three months.

1208
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,079
I had no smartphone.

1209
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:18,940
I had no laptop.

1210
01:02:19,059 --> 01:02:19,659
I went to this place

1211
01:02:19,659 --> 01:02:21,119
in Cape Cod called Provincetown.

1212
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,519
It's kind of very up and down experience

1213
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:24,380
that I described in the book.

1214
01:02:24,539 --> 01:02:27,219
But when I got reunited with my phone,

1215
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,039
for a couple of weeks,

1216
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:30,380
I didn't listen to all the voicemails.

1217
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:31,860
And there was a voicemail.

1218
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:32,360
I was going through

1219
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,300
the unidentified numbers

1220
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:37,619
and I was just deleting information

1221
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:39,239
like, you know, just spam.

1222
01:02:39,239 --> 01:02:39,460
And I was like,

1223
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:41,039
and I almost didn't listen to this one

1224
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:41,900
that was an unidentified number.

1225
01:02:42,019 --> 01:02:42,980
And it said,

1226
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:46,219
hi, Johan, this is Oprah calling.

1227
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:47,599
I read your book.

1228
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:48,860
And it was this long message from Oprah.

1229
01:02:49,739 --> 01:02:50,980
And I, because my friends know

1230
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:53,159
how much I fucking love Oprah, right?

1231
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:55,079
Like, I know everyone likes Oprah in that way,

1232
01:02:55,099 --> 01:02:55,639
but like, I mean,

1233
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,079
I was profoundly shaped

1234
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:00,519
by watching the Oprah Winfrey show every day

1235
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:02,280
for years and years and years, right?

1236
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,079
I'm like an Oprah mega fan.

1237
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:06,019
And I thought this is one of my friends

1238
01:03:06,019 --> 01:03:06,840
taking the piss, right?

1239
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:07,119
But I was like,

1240
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:08,739
God, they've done a really,

1241
01:03:08,739 --> 01:03:09,420
really good job.

1242
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,480
Really good impression of Oprah, right?

1243
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,900
But at the end of this message,

1244
01:03:13,159 --> 01:03:14,119
she doesn't, she says,

1245
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,719
well, because your answer machine

1246
01:03:15,719 --> 01:03:16,300
doesn't have your voice,

1247
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,880
I'm not sure this is actually your number.

1248
01:03:18,179 --> 01:03:19,340
So I don't want to leave my number

1249
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:20,099
on a random answer machine.

1250
01:03:20,179 --> 01:03:21,480
So I'll call you back, right?

1251
01:03:22,179 --> 01:03:23,559
Three fucking months passed.

1252
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:24,980
I did not get a call back from Oprah.

1253
01:03:25,099 --> 01:03:26,639
I was like, well, I said, I fucked it, right?

1254
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:28,139
This is, I've missed my one chance.

1255
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,599
She'd never got off the internet.

1256
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:31,539
And then she phoned me one day.

1257
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:33,380
I find this slightly surreal to say,

1258
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:34,639
but we are friends.

1259
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:35,659
I'm going to go and see her

1260
01:03:35,659 --> 01:03:36,920
in Montecito in a few weeks.

1261
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,300
And probably the two people

1262
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:40,400
I most admire in the world

1263
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,199
are Noam Chomsky.

1264
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,340
In fact, probably the three people

1265
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:43,139
I most admire,

1266
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,039
kind of public figures,

1267
01:03:45,619 --> 01:03:47,119
are Noam Chomsky, Oprah,

1268
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,000
and Eve Ensler,

1269
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:48,699
who a lot of people won't know

1270
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:49,760
because she wrote the vagina monologues,

1271
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:50,940
but has done many things.

1272
01:03:51,539 --> 01:03:53,400
And I'm friends with all of them.

1273
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,739
So that's been a really bizarre,

1274
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,380
like I've cooperated with Chomsky

1275
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:57,760
because I was,

1276
01:03:58,099 --> 01:03:59,159
he's sadly not well now,

1277
01:03:59,219 --> 01:04:00,780
but he, for many years,

1278
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,239
I've been writing his biography,

1279
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,360
another long-term project.

1280
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,019
He's now 95 and I'll probably be older

1281
01:04:06,019 --> 01:04:07,079
than he is now by the time I finish.

1282
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,139
So I've been really,

1283
01:04:09,139 --> 01:04:10,300
really lucky with all three of them

1284
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:11,360
to get to know them well

1285
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,360
and sort of collaborate with them

1286
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,079
in various ways.

1287
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:14,940
With Oprah,

1288
01:04:15,079 --> 01:04:16,320
she's interviewed me a few times.

1289
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:17,659
I'm going to go and see her

1290
01:04:17,659 --> 01:04:18,800
because she's interviewed me again.

1291
01:04:19,639 --> 01:04:21,480
If you had told my 10-year-old self

1292
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,579
one day you'll,

1293
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:25,840
well, I wouldn't know what texting was

1294
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:26,519
when I was 10, I guess,

1295
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:28,340
but you'll be like texting with Oprah

1296
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:29,420
and Chomsky.

1297
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:30,539
I would have been like,

1298
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:33,780
yeah, and you'll have a device

1299
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:34,840
on which you can push a button

1300
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,099
and someone will deliver KFC

1301
01:04:36,099 --> 01:04:37,239
to your house.

1302
01:04:39,139 --> 01:04:40,780
And you'll have a massive television

1303
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:43,199
on which you can watch any film

1304
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:43,940
that's ever been made.

1305
01:04:44,019 --> 01:04:44,360
I would have been like,

1306
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:44,920
well, that's it.

1307
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:46,579
What you're telling me

1308
01:04:46,579 --> 01:04:48,119
is I will live in Nirvana, right?

1309
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:50,239
My life will be entirely complete

1310
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:51,639
and I'll be in a state

1311
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:53,820
of constant ecstasy until death, right?

1312
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,639
So yeah, I've been very,

1313
01:04:55,639 --> 01:04:56,940
very lucky with that.

1314
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,239
What a brilliant note to finish on

1315
01:04:58,239 --> 01:04:59,360
and I've thoroughly enjoyed

1316
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,340
our conversation.

1317
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:01,679
I could talk for hours.

1318
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,800
So curious about the many things

1319
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,420
that you do and really excited

1320
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:06,280
to see you here in Australia.

1321
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:07,539
Hopefully you get to catch up

1322
01:05:07,539 --> 01:05:08,539
in person.

1323
01:05:08,539 --> 01:05:09,119
I know you're doing a lot of stuff.

1324
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:09,760
You're doing a great tour.

1325
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,960
Yeah, come to the Melbourne show.

1326
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:12,619
I should say to people

1327
01:05:12,619 --> 01:05:14,280
or my publicist will taser me.

1328
01:05:14,739 --> 01:05:15,699
But yeah, I'm speaking

1329
01:05:15,699 --> 01:05:17,159
about our attention crisis,

1330
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:18,739
why it's happening in Australia,

1331
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:20,079
what people can do about it,

1332
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,539
very practical level,

1333
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:23,300
how we can all get our focus back.

1334
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:25,280
I'm doing it in Sydney, Melbourne,

1335
01:05:26,119 --> 01:05:28,260
Perth, Adelaide, Canberra.

1336
01:05:28,539 --> 01:05:29,539
We'll put all the dates out

1337
01:05:29,539 --> 01:05:31,079
on the show notes on this show

1338
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:33,159
and hosted by the beautiful

1339
01:05:33,159 --> 01:05:34,659
Sarah Grimberg, who's a champion,

1340
01:05:35,539 --> 01:05:36,800
who's going to be sensational.

1341
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:38,760
And Johan, it's a great contribution

1342
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,320
that you make every day.

1343
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:41,860
We've all been inspired by your work

1344
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:43,960
and real pleasure to speak to you today.

1345
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:44,539
Thanks for your time.

1346
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:45,900
Oh, I really appreciate it.

1347
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:46,659
