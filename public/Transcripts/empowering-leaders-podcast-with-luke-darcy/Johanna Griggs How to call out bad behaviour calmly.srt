1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
We had a promo going many, many bosses back at Seven, where I feel very safe to say it,

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,640
where they wanted all of their network talent in bikinis, running along the beach,

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,580
slapping each other on each other's bum.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,259
By what style?

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,300
Yep. And I was just like, no. And they were like, why not? You've been in plenty of causes

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,940
in your life. I'm like, a hundred percent. They said, you modeled for inside sport. I said,

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,600
I did as an athlete. Yeah, a hundred percent. And I said, well, put it this way. I'll do it

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,879
when you have Bruce McIverney in a pair of slugos running on the beach, hitting, I don't know,

9
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:31,160
a couple of guys on the ice. How about that? And that was the end of the conversation.

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,289
I genuinely loved this week's episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast with Jo Griggs,

11
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,909
a world champion swimmer as a teenager who has gone on to be one of the most respected

12
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:49,289
and loved broadcasters in Australian television history. Jo's decade-long success in the male

13
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:55,210
dominated, at times brutal world of media is a great story. She has a unique ability to call

14
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,750
out bad behavior with a smile. You'll hear her passion for creating great teams,

15
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,850
around her in everything she does, and is relentless in making sure that she's surrounded

16
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:09,189
by high quality people who share her values. We know that success leaves clues. And in this

17
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:13,849
conversation with Jo Griggs, you will get a very clear picture of why she has consistently

18
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:19,409
achieved. She has a legendary work ethic. She is a fanatical researcher ahead of Olympic games

19
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:25,049
and major events, and is truly one of the happiest, most engaging and fun people you'll ever meet.

20
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,689
These people like Jo Griggs will inspire the work we do at Alita.

21
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:52,269
You can book a discovery call today. Big thanks as always to Jason Nicholas and his team from

22
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:58,150
Temper Bedding. Temper is NASA approved and the world's best in bedding. Inspiring people like

23
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,750
Jo Griggs all understand the value of bedding.

24
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:05,810
To live the happy and successful lives they do. So investing in a temper bed is a decision that

25
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:12,139
will change your life. Griggs is one of the most loved and respected figures in Australian

26
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:17,020
television history. She was the first Australian woman to solely host an Olympic games at the 2002

27
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,680
Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and has been a mainstay of Channel 7's Olympic and Paralympic

28
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,020
coverage for more than two decades. Her long and successful career includes hosting the Australian

29
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,819
Open Tennis Sports World. And for the past 20 years as the host of the incredibly successful

30
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,719
gardens. As a 16 year old, Joanna Griggs won a Commonwealth Games bronze medal in the hundred

31
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:42,280
metre backstroke before her career was cut short with chronic fatigue. Before a comeback then saw

32
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,300
her record the fastest time in the world in the 50 metre backstroke, ultimately retiring from

33
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,319
competitive swimming. The next day, Griggs, it's always great to see you. Thanks for joining me.

34
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,500
It's lovely to see your smiling face again.

35
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,979
Well, you've got this incredibly infectious personality. Every time I've had the pleasure

36
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:01,039
of being around you, it's like there's a happy journey. Were you born with that or is that

37
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,400
something that's always been a part of your life?

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,539
Yeah, it's always been a part of my life.

39
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,759
For my family, they would say it's always been, but we laugh like this morning, my husband and I,

40
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,699
we wake up between four and five every morning and he takes a while to wake up. He just,

41
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,439
he just, a half an hour after we got up this morning, by that stage, I'd gone out,

42
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,060
I'd packed up the car, I'd done a thousand. He looked at me, he goes, I don't, he goes,

43
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:22,860
do you ever just wake up and just go, I'm going to take it really slowly today. I don't think

44
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,400
it's part of my makeup. There's no, no other gear is there for you. It's on or that's it?

45
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,400
It's on. Yeah, I can, I can definitely, I'm really good at, at mindfulness. I'm really

46
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,740
good at looking after myself and winding down and really very importantly, getting great sleep

47
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:41,300
and solid sleep. But when I'm awake, there's just so much to jam packing and, and I'm lucky. I love

48
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,639
my job and I love who I work with. And, you know, if you're doing live, I think the first day that

49
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:50,340
we were doing rehearsals, I think you realize I get, I'm so energetic that sometimes makeup

50
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,900
artists will say to me, they just have to step back a little bit because you're the energy that's

51
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,759
coming out of me so much more. So I know I can be a bit much. You're like your own life force. And

52
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,379
as I said, I'm a makeup artist. I'm a makeup artist. I'm a makeup artist. I'm a makeup artist.

53
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,460
As you said, it's infectious. It's just a brilliant thing to be around you. I want to go

54
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:10,080
back to you as a, as a swimmer, as a 16 year old. To win a Commonwealth Games medal at that age is

55
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,740
an incredible achievement, but it gets cut short. Was that difficult for you when that part of your

56
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,279
life ended? Yeah. I mean, I, I, the next year I got a silver medal at the world champs and the

57
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,459
relay. And then it was after that, that I actually went on a holiday. And I think I've had a lot of

58
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:29,339
time to reflect on that. It's a long time since I hung up my speedos, but yeah, I think what it was,

59
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:30,839
I didn't, I wasn't a swimmer that,

60
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:35,560
damn crazy kilometers their whole life. Like I started quite late in swimming and it was by

61
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,699
chance I went to a swim meet with a, another swimming family and just loved it, loved the

62
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:46,699
vibe and cleaned up at the meet and was spotted by talent scouts. And so all of a sudden, you know,

63
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,740
mum held off for probably a year or two, but then I literally went from two sessions a week to six

64
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:59,000
to 10 hours of training every single day past Sundays. We do a massive session on, on a Saturday,

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,360
but I think that physically took its toll.

66
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,959
And also we're of the era where if we so much as sneeze, because, you know, back then,

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,740
like, it's funny, like it, I feel like I'm a hundred years old of this era, but yeah,

68
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,980
we were of the era back then that Australian swimming felt like to be part of the world,

69
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,500
we had to go over there and prove ourselves, which is ironic now because everyone comes to

70
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,980
Australia. They come for our coaches. They come to be near our amazing athletes. And we had those

71
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,779
amazing, amazing athletes then, but the amount of travel that we used to do was just brutal.

72
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:31,000
Like I can remember, you know, you'd get first of all, a letter,

73
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:34,920
and that's how you found out you're on trips. You know, I remember coming back from a trip and

74
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,000
having like two days at school and sitting on the toilet, opening the mail and seeing that I had to

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,139
pack my bags and be gone again by the end of the week, because yeah, that was, it was always about

76
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:48,759
being overseas. So I think really it was just wear and tear on, you know, physically, mentally,

77
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,279
and my body shut down. So, you know, it told me in the most emphatic way possible that,

78
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,980
that it was not going to do anything else. And I was really, really unwell. And it took two and a

79
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,759
half years of,

80
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:05,759
everything from changing complete diet. So I had two and a half years of a wheat-free,

81
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,480
yeast-free, egg-free, malt-free, sugar-free, dairy-free, herb-free, spice-free, caffeine-free

82
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,720
diet. I was, I had to have a lot of iron. So I, everywhere I went, I had to have, you know,

83
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:20,920
liver and just, I'm still not a massive fan of them, foods. But we, we went from the hours that

84
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,839
I would train a day to doing what I call complimentary medicine. And so, and you were

85
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:29,620
trying anything and everything. So I think the hardest part was one, understanding physical

86
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,199
limitations. I'd never had that before.

87
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:36,300
Never experienced that before. Two, understanding, and I think it's actually helped me in very good

88
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,699
stead for the rest of my life. But when people don't understand something and there's not a

89
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:45,040
quick fix, if they don't know what to say, they just stay away. So, you know, I, I was one of the

90
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,240
few that was making a great income from, from swimming. I lost all my sponsors within about

91
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,279
four months because at first they were all, yep, we're here for you. And then when it didn't look

92
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,680
like it was going to be a quick fix, they just dried up instantly. And then I learned human

93
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,360
nature is that people are the same. Not that they, not that they're the same, but they're the same.

94
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:06,240
They don't care about you. They just don't know what to say to you. So, you know, that whole year

95
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,379
after this initial first flush of just endless visitors through, no one came. I had like five

96
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:17,899
friends that came over that next 12 months. And so the challenging part for me was, was having to

97
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:22,540
spend so much time, I mean, obviously with my family, but by yourself and, and asking yourself,

98
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,560
are you being really honest with yourself and, and are you doing everything that you can to

99
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,360
recover? So I think that at that age, cause I was 17 when I fell sick,

100
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:38,540
I think from 17 to 19 and a half, you're usually bulletproof. And I had the exact opposite. I had

101
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:44,079
everything taken away. It wasn't in my control. The only thing that I could control was just to

102
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,899
try my absolute best. And sometimes whatever I would try on that day would put me back two steps.

103
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,899
So it was just a really intense period of learning, but it's also the period that I'm

104
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:58,720
most grateful for in my life because I think most athletes struggle in life after sport because

105
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,819
they only identify themselves as,

106
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:05,779
you know, whether it be one sport or how they see themselves in one way. I didn't have that

107
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:10,100
option. I had it all taken away. So I had to be really honest and really comfortable in my own

108
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:16,740
skin. And as an 18 year old having to, you know, the wheat-free, gluten-free, caffeine-free, that's

109
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,079
a lot for a young girl to deal with. Plus not being around the people that are your community.

110
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:24,480
And as you said, people, they're not mean, but people do drop off.

111
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,220
They just don't, they don't know what to say. And I really did work that out. And I saw it years

112
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,139
later when one of my best friends had brain cancer and she eventually,

113
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:35,519
but when she was really, really ill, it was quite extraordinary. You know, she was,

114
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:41,419
she was in a wheelchair. She absolutely had all her mental capacity and capabilities,

115
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:47,259
but people just avoided looking her in the eye or they thought she was mentally incapacitated or

116
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:51,220
they just didn't want to actually look at her because in case they had to have a conversation

117
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,419
with her. So it was fascinating watching that up close again, thinking, oh, we haven't really,

118
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,299
nothing's really, we haven't really learned from this or people around me haven't learned from this

119
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:01,360
that they, it's so easy just to look at her and say, oh, she's got a lot of pain. And I think

120
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:07,059
there's lots, like even the diet, like, I'm so glad I went through that then because these days

121
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:11,179
there's so many food intolerances that people have. Like I'm the person to cook for anyone

122
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:15,720
with a food intolerance. It doesn't matter what they throw at me. I will make an amazing menu

123
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,759
that they will just not even realize they're missing out on anything. And my husband's had

124
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,879
different periods of time with his health where he's had to go off certain foods. And it's just,

125
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:29,080
to me, it's a piece of cake because I'm like, oh, what meat, sugar, dairy. Are you serious?

126
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,159
Well, I'm not surprised because you're having,

127
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:35,220
had the pleasure of spending some time with you and your great passion for the Paralympics I want

128
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,440
to talk about, but also you've been on the board of Beyond Blue for a long period of time. There

129
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,220
is nothing awkward about you at all. And I think you're right. A lot of us, and I've been in a

130
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,779
situation where you don't know what to say and you don't want to put your foot in it.

131
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,759
And that's what most people are afraid of. You nailed it then. They're afraid they're

132
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:53,759
going to say something that's either going to upset the person or make themselves feel silly.

133
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,419
Yeah. And I had this great chat with your great friend, Kurt Friendly recently,

134
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:01,259
and he was saying, well, that's not an excuse. You have to then-

135
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:01,600
Absolutely.

136
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,580
Give of yourself to go and sit down, have that conversation. You've got to get past that. It's

137
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:12,080
not good enough to accept that. And I can see why you're the person for that because I can't imagine

138
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,960
a situation where you're not going to be able to approach someone no matter what the situation.

139
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:19,659
Oh, look, sometimes you approach people and they don't want to speak to you and you just

140
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:24,740
have to respect that as well. But it's also learning that that's okay. I mean, I think

141
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,360
you're being a little bit kind because you know how unco I am. In everyday life, just the most

142
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,740
basic things kind of.

143
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:36,740
I imagine I'm going to walk straight through a door and then walk full on into a wall. So I have

144
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,580
all these moments. I make a fool of myself regularly and I just try not to do it at anyone

145
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,419
else's expense.

146
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:49,740
Well, you've transitioned into television with great success and TV's a high ego business that

147
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,860
I think there's any other way to say it. But being around you, the makeup staff love being around

148
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:01,200
you, the floor managers, the production staff, everyone involved on set has a great time because

149
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:06,019
of you showing up the way you are. And it's a great thing that you do. Have you done that

150
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:07,559
consciously or is it just you being you?

151
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:12,480
No, I think it comes very naturally, but it also is a very conscious effort. The thing I've noticed

152
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:20,299
over the last 32, 33 years in TV is they want to dehumanize it. They want to take away people

153
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:24,440
knowing about each other. They love hot desks where you can't have any personal items left on

154
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,580
it or they really want to make it so that it's quite impersonal. The best way to get the best

155
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,139
out of people.

156
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:35,840
Is to have it so that everyone feels part of something and that hopefully they're all

157
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,799
enjoying. I know when I turn up to any job that I do for Better Homes and Gardens, that the first

158
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:45,980
contact they've had with one of my researchers in the office or whether it be one of our production

159
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,580
team is doing the organization, they are such good people and they're so kind and considerate

160
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,200
and they've thought about everything. So that's their first interaction. Then they get out onto

161
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,899
the set and they might be a little bit nervous about having a TV crew there or maybe meeting me.

162
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,240
Everyone, the makeup artists, the sound, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the

163
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:06,159
sound, the cameraman, everyone has their product, their producer, everyone. Our goal is to make

164
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,120
everyone have a fantastic experience. And I think, I think I learned it from people like Bruce

165
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,120
McEvaney. I had a couple of really great mentors early on and I had a couple of really horrendous

166
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,919
people that were in charge and still have right the whole way through my career. And I think you

167
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:24,960
get the best out of people when you're having fun and when they're having fun. And then it doesn't

168
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,299
actually feel like a chore. Even if you're doing crazy long hours, it doesn't feel like a chore.

169
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,139
Yeah. And it's a brilliant thing because,

170
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:36,720
it applies to every environment that anyone's in. And you do get a choice around how you turn up and

171
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,740
your smile and it's authentic. And you can also, you don't take any shit. You're prepared if

172
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,980
there's something out of line to call it out, but it's done with these really strong relationships

173
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,500
all the way through. And I think there's a, to me, Griggs, I look at people aren't as successful

174
00:12:53,500 --> 00:13:00,059
as you are by mistake. There's always a story behind it. And watching you up close in the

175
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:06,740
Tokyo Olympics, the amount of preparation you had done blew me away. Literally, I remember looking

176
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:12,600
at the folders and folders that you had thinking, this is unbelievable. Again, is that just you

177
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,700
being you or is that a learnt skill? That's from being an athlete. And in those very short moments,

178
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,940
we have a chance to share their story. And for some sports, they're going to get a lot more

179
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,940
airtime than others. But for some of those more smaller sports or unique sports that don't get

180
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,039
the coverage, they might not get the coverage. And I think that's a really good thing.

181
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,059
They might get a mention once in a blue moon. They might have the most amazing backstory. And

182
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:39,159
if you get a chance to tell it, you want to do it justice. And I always remember the first

183
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:44,539
Paralympics that I did. I remember every time Todd would come inside, he'd be out in the tractor for

184
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:48,019
hours. He'd come in and I'd be like, Todd, I've got to tell you about these athletes. I've got

185
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:52,000
to tell you their stories. Like, I am sitting here. I'm so blown away. Like, I'm crying. I'm

186
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,100
laughing. They're amazing people. But listen to this. This is what they've been through. And then

187
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,539
sometimes it's not just one thing they've been through. It's several challenges they've had in

188
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:03,879
their lives. And Todd was like, oh, that's amazing. First time. Second time he came in,

189
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,700
he's like, wow, that's incredible. But he's like losing, you know, 45 minutes. And anyone knows

190
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,860
if they love being out in a tractor, they're just looking at sunlight to see how much they've got

191
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,980
left in the day. And I remember the third time he came in, he said, just so I know, how many

192
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,720
athletes are on the team for Australia? I went, I've got some great overseas stories as well. And

193
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,779
he's like, but how many am I going to hear? And I said, you're going to hear everyone. And that's

194
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:28,620
ultimately, if you could, that's what you want to do. You want to be able to tell everyone's story.

195
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,039
And so that's been the goal.

196
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,320
We, you know, on our shift during the Olympics, we tried to get every Australian's result away.

197
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,120
Even if it was just a mention of how they went, because there would be a family, a town, you

198
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,539
know, maybe a school who's watching that, who just get the biggest thrill of their life when

199
00:14:44,539 --> 00:14:48,539
they actually hear how they go. And it's not that hard to give a verbal mention.

200
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,600
No. And your commitment to that was brilliant. And the ones you missed, you told me about in

201
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,559
the ad break. I got replaced in Todd's role there. And I heard every story that you had.

202
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,860
And I loved it.

203
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,039
And I love it.

204
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:03,980
And people won't understand this as well. You're walking in and you get to work with

205
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,960
someone for two weeks in an intense period of time. You shared, you were clearly better

206
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,059
prepared than me by a factor of about 10, but day one, you gave me all your notes. And

207
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:15,860
you just said from the start, we're going to-

208
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,019
We're a team.

209
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,159
Yeah. And you know what? That's, again, something I just was taken by.

210
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,139
Did I do that with any of you?

211
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:21,679
I know you would.

212
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:25,960
So like anyone who I see that's struggling or anyone, because the first Olympics I did,

213
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,960
no one did that. So you don't actually know what to prepare for. So you prepare for-

214
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,159
Yeah.

215
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:34,139
The most ridiculous amount of things that you might only use a percentage. So the real

216
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,960
trick with an Olympics is do your base knowledge, but then know where to find your information.

217
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,179
And the same for the Paralympics. So you've got to have it. So you have it all there and

218
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:45,539
all done, but you know how to find it in a very short space of time if you need to check

219
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:50,039
something. And so when I see people struggling, I'm like, I don't understand this silo thing

220
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,919
where people just look after themselves. Our coverage is better when everyone's well

221
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:59,480
prepared. Our coverage is better when we work as a team and actually, particularly, I think

222
00:15:59,480 --> 00:15:59,940
the Paralympics.

223
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,419
Because we were also in lockdown here in Melbourne. So we had six months down here.

224
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:09,120
Yeah. We managed to, Emma Vostie, we managed to, through her, we got contacts with team

225
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,019
captains and then we got the heads of every single sport. And then we got the coaches

226
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,039
and then we got anyone that we could think of that could give us an insight that you're

227
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:21,360
not going to find necessarily in an article or you're not going to find in a tiny briefing

228
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,519
package that you're given that you actually can hear the latest and what's happening in

229
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:28,059
their life and what to be a little bit more sensitive about. And it actually made our

230
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,919
coverage better because we had all the commentary.

231
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,000
We had all the hosts on. We had everyone behind the scenes. So this whole production

232
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,919
team started to get an understanding of what it took for these athletes to be there under

233
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,519
those circumstances and what makes them so amazing.

234
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,419
And I generally think the audience at home can sense when people are working together

235
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:50,000
well as a team and it comes across. And it's not always the case. I think there's an instinct

236
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,179
for some people to hold back and I'm going to look better if I have these extra facts

237
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,039
and you've been around long enough to-

238
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:59,919
Don't get me wrong. There are definitely those people. And they're people who just literally

239
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,119
will line people up to try and make them look silly. And I've been through all of

240
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:08,299
that. I've had my battles with those people and generally I've come out on top because

241
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:13,480
if you're going to be a female starting out in sport, you're kind of going to be dealing

242
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:19,220
with a lot of misogyny, whether it's open or hidden away at different stages when you're

243
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,859
starting out. And I think some of the best bit of advice I had was how you start is how

244
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:28,519
you finish. So don't go in and be all agreeable at the start. If there's something you don't

245
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:29,839
agree with, call them out on it.

246
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,220
And I've done that consistently the whole way. There are lots of people who, because

247
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:38,779
of that, I'm sure do not think that fondly of me because I call out their bad behavior.

248
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,900
But as I say to them, I've never been any different. And every night I can put my head

249
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:50,519
on a pillow and I can go to sleep and I sleep like I am dead. I am so stress-free. And it's

250
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:56,400
because I actively think about the decisions I make. I think about what I'm doing in my

251
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,680
private life. I think about would that impact the network?

252
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,099
So I keep saying to the bosses, every time I think I'm going to be sacked, I say to them,

253
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,720
and they go, why would we sack you? I go, well, because obviously sometimes I can raise

254
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,819
things that you're uncomfortable with. And I say to them, but it's not by mistake that

255
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:17,500
you haven't had some scandal relating to me. It's because I think about everything. I have

256
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,859
a responsibility to do that. And I like to live my life that way.

257
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,859
Yeah. And you've got a clear conscience. I think that's probably why you-

258
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:27,059
I have morals. And I have a very clear guideline with what I will and won't accept.

259
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,799
And you call a spade a shovel if you see something you don't like. I saw a video of you doing that.

260
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:29,819
Yeah.

261
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,259
I saw a bit of that up close and personal. And I loved it because it just was really

262
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:38,900
clear around, hey, these are how I like to operate. And this is what I expect from other

263
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,720
people. And I think it's brilliant. And you can do that with charm, do that with a spade.

264
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:48,599
You don't have to be mean. It's amazing how much conviction you can have when you live

265
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:53,480
by what you're talking about. And I think that's always been the thing that I've been

266
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,160
able to come back to at any time where it has been a challenging time at the network.

267
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,519
It's just like, well, you're saying this.

268
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:05,180
But I'm living it. And the difference between you and I is that I do that 24-7. And you just

269
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,180
want to say something just to smooth something over. Well, unless you're actually going to back

270
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,519
it up with actions, I'm sorry. That's just not good enough.

271
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:19,460
32 years, going on to 33 years in the industry, as you said, going back in time, that's a hard

272
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,640
place to be, media in Australia. And you said that misogyny, whether you like it or not,

273
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:29,019
you only have to look back at some of the clips of the pioneers as you were the way they- I saw

274
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:29,480
a clip of the-

275
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,759
Dave, one of the first female women in sport on the ABC, being interviewed on the ABC. And the

276
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:39,339
reporters basically say, why do you think it's appropriate for you to be here, given you know

277
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:45,900
nothing about sport? This is 30 years ago on the ABC. You must have had some heartache along the

278
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,119
way.

279
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,339
So many doozies along the way. And the other thing that I couldn't ever wrap my head around

280
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:55,880
is as an athlete, not only are you used to trying to excel yourself and doing everything that you

281
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,460
can to improve, but you have a coach. So if you can't see it-

282
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,859
You know, AFL, you probably had several coaches who are working on one specific thing. But in

283
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:09,539
swimming, it was really clear. I had a coach who I absolutely adored, who was just everything that I

284
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:13,799
like. I just wanted to make him happy. But also he could be brutal. So he would tell me what's

285
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:18,759
working and what's not working. And he also taught me early on that the only way that I was actually

286
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,559
going to be able to really make that effective in the pool was to leave the bits that weren't

287
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,900
working behind. So just don't take it as a criticism. My job is to tell you what you're

288
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,059
doing well. They don't do that in TV.

289
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,359
It constantly blows my mind still to this point. That's why I mentor anyone who asks for it,

290
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,140
because it blows my mind that they'd actually rather see people fail. And these days,

291
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,440
failing with social media is often the end of someone's career before it started. I hate this

292
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,000
mentality that we're not allowed to make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes. I have never met a

293
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,740
perfect person. The trick is if you're going to make a mistake, make it, learn from it,

294
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:57,359
and then try to avoid making that same mistake again. But yeah, I would go into my boss's

295
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:59,460
office and they would be roaring with laughter at things that they were doing.

296
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,880
And I'd come off air and I'd be so frustrated because I knew I was terrible, like just

297
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,940
absolutely so green and so terrible that I was so green I would answer the person talking in my

298
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:17,640
earpiece to that person whilst I was live on air. And then I'd hear them go, don't answer me. What

299
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:23,599
are you doing? And then I'd be flustered. And then it was genuinely awful to watch.

300
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,980
But they thought it was funny, which I guess in hindsight, I was lucky they thought it was

301
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,279
funny and didn't just yank me off.

302
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,519
I think it was the amusement factor for them that actually kept you there. But I'd go into

303
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,859
them and I'd say, so can you please just play this back? Show me what I'm doing well and

304
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:42,619
tell me what I need to improve on. And tell me what I'm doing dreadfully badly that I

305
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:46,079
obviously, I'm going to see some very obviously myself, but there's got to be some tricks

306
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,920
and tips. And they'd say, no, no, don't worry about it. You'll be right. And I'm like, no,

307
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,700
no, I'd possibly like to learn another way other than just through public humiliation.

308
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:59,200
I feel like there's a more constructive way that I could be learning. And so, yeah, I'm

309
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,700
keeping in touch with a lot of those early mentors now. And they just said they couldn't

310
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,859
quite get that I would come in and ask them questions. And to me, that was like, that is

311
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:10,640
the obvious thing. So over the years, I've seen people be thrown into things and everyone

312
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,119
has idiosyncrasies and everyone has tics that they don't realize that they're doing. They

313
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:18,039
might clear their throat more regularly or they might twitch something. And often you

314
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:20,859
just grab them for five minutes and you say, hey, listen, let's just watch this back. I

315
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:24,519
just want you to see, let's write a list of 50 different things that you could say in

316
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:28,579
this moment. So it's just like giving that knowledge that you learned through the humiliation.

317
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:32,579
And I mean, I tell a story all the time, but there's one great one. And it was during

318
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:36,059
that, the Salt Lake Olympics when I was solo hosting the coverage for the first time as

319
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:42,839
a female. And one of my original bosses called me up in the hotel room and I heard his voice.

320
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,079
I knew his voice because it had been down my earpiece for some of the most traumatic

321
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,779
experiences of my early days in television. I heard his voice and he didn't say who it

322
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:53,940
was. He said, come down and have a drink. I knew exactly who it was. And there was so

323
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,500
much security after post 9-11. Then when I got down there, he's like, you didn't even

324
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:58,559
know who it was. And I was like, no, I didn't even know who it was. And he's like,

325
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:02,519
why? I was like, why could it be an ex-murderer? And I was like, no, I know exactly who it

326
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:07,900
is. And I said, I don't forget that voice. That's pretty well connected with some traumatic

327
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:13,660
moments. And anyhow, he only came to say sorry. And he was apologizing because he said he'd

328
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,579
had time to reflect on the situations that they'd put me in, the times where they would

329
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:21,119
sort of give a nudge in a truck and piss themselves laughing and say, let's see what Joe does

330
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:26,160
with this. And he said they would actively set up situations to see you fail on air effectively.

331
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,019
And he said, and you always had a way where you would,

332
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:32,160
either laugh with the person or you'd just laugh at yourself or you'd find a way to twist

333
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,720
it back. But you just kept powering on. Well, I'm thinking, well, I didn't know there was

334
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,119
any other way. You're live on air. But I said to him, you know, it was really lovely. He

335
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:43,180
never had to actually say sorry. But he said, well, I'm saying sorry because at this point

336
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:48,839
here you are solo hosting Olympic Games coverage and I'm unemployed. And I use that as an example

337
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:52,799
all the time when I am out talking to schools with a charity worker to explain the power

338
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,779
of a conversation because there was a bit of validation for me. You always knew it was

339
00:23:56,779 --> 00:23:57,940
going on, but you could never explain it.

340
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,720
You never, ever have said something back then because you would have just been absolutely

341
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,519
thrown to the dogs if you did. But you would question things and you'd always get some

342
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:10,119
kind of smart ass answer back. And you're just like, okay, I'm going to put that one

343
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:13,940
in the cupboard and just remember it. But I'm going to learn from what I can from it.

344
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,799
And I can see that you've had a lot of people's back going forward. A lot of young females

345
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:21,480
coming into the industry. Anyone who works with you, I had that great pleasure of experiencing

346
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,500
that as well. It's like we're working together as a team. We share everything. I've got you

347
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,819
back here. And I think, you know, I found it really

348
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:32,039
confronting playing professional sport and going to the media. And you just, how do I

349
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:34,880
get better? Can you get some feedback? No one will give you-

350
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,220
No one. Unless it's really bad.

351
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,079
Or you're sacked.

352
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,220
Yeah, 100%.

353
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,859
And that is sort of the end point is that we'll tell you when we don't want you and

354
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:46,960
that will be the end of it. It's like, what a foolish way to go about it. And the amount

355
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,960
of people that are ruined by it. And as you said, now with cancel culture, we're not allowed

356
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,559
to fail anymore.

357
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:55,039
No one's allowed to fail anymore. And even silly things. Like I can remember they did

358
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,799
this sports pilot one day and they had this comedian doing,

359
00:24:57,819 --> 00:25:02,359
a sports show. And they asked me if I would like do the news updates, the sport updates.

360
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,420
And I was like, right, this would be excellent. And then I got in there and my wardrobe was

361
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,200
just like, I don't know. I looked like I was going to be, you know, what's one of those

362
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,299
shows where they hold the suitcase and you're basically gesturing around. I was literally

363
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:19,000
like, why do I need to wear that to give sports results away? So thankfully, because I am

364
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,619
nice to everyone. And this is the other thing. If you know security, if you know the cleaner,

365
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:27,140
if you know the people with what some would consider the lowliest jobs, well, they all

366
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,799
have a role to play.

367
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:30,880
They are actually in charge of your career. Because if any of them decided they wanted

368
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,799
to ruin your career, they could easily do it a thousand times over. So you always treat

369
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:40,180
people with respect. Because I say to anyone starting out, I promise you, as you're falling

370
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:44,559
down, if you haven't, they're not going to be there to make it a gentle fall. They will

371
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,000
just be there standing back with their hands on their hips and drawing you, just crashing

372
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,839
to the ground. And so, you know, this head of security, I asked him to let me into the

373
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:57,519
wardrobe. Back then, Channel 7 just had this massive big warehouse of wardrobe. I found

374
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:02,380
a jacket that buttoned up underneath my chin and went down to my knees. And so I didn't

375
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:07,460
show anyone until I walked out to do the piece. And I got in so much trouble for it. But then

376
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,180
it became a conversation, well, why do I have to wear this? So why can't I wear that jacket?

377
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,880
Oh, so you actually don't want me to give you the sports update. You just want to see

378
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,400
what my breasts look like on camera? Is that basically what you're doing? And then when

379
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,720
you put that on someone, they don't know. And they can't hit reverse quick enough to

380
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,220
get out of justifying why that's not really what they're after.

381
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,220
This is what I love about you. I can actually...

382
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,579
Picture this conversation word for word. And it's brilliant. Calling out would have

383
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:32,599
been a male executive.

384
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:32,960
A hundred percent.

385
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,380
It's put you in this revealing, ridiculous... You didn't feel comfortable. You've gone and

386
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,240
sorted it out. But you've always had the presence, it seems, to be able to call that out. I mean,

387
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,339
there was a... Not too long ago, young girls used to be... Kerry Armstrong was picked up

388
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:51,200
from school and did the weather in a bikini on Channel 9 News in the 80s.

389
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,319
We had a promo going many, many bosses back at 7, where I feel very safe to say it, where

390
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,200
they wanted all of their...

391
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,339
Network talent in bikinis, running along the beach, slapping each other on each other's

392
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:01,539
bum.

393
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,519
Yep. And I was just like, no. And they were like, why not? You've been in plenty of causes

394
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:10,079
in your life. I'm like, a hundred percent. They said, you modeled for Inside Sport. I

395
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,880
said, I did as an athlete. Yeah, a hundred percent. And I said, well, put it this way.

396
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:18,559
I'll do it when you have Bruce McIverney in a pair of slugos, running on the beach, hitting,

397
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,940
I don't know, a couple of guys on the ass. How about that? And that was the end of the

398
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:27,500
conversation. But it was just like, those moments. And even as recently as after the

399
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,319
Olympics and Paralympics, I had one of the male bosses sit down. And because I'd caught

400
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:35,859
him out on some bad behavior, he basically wanted to talk to me about, was I missing

401
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:41,980
my kids? And I was like, what? My kids at that stage, 27 and 26, like one at that stage

402
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:48,059
lived in cans. And they're very, very confident, very self-assured and very self-efficient

403
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:52,819
young men. I'm like, how many men do you have this conversation with? Because I'm fine.

404
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:57,480
He's like, well, but you must miss your husband. And I'm like, my husband is having the greatest

405
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,700
time of his life at the moment. Like we'd probably been together enough through COVID

406
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,880
that he could not wait till I got sent away for six months. And he missed me long enough

407
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,059
that by the time I got back, it was just, it was awesome for our relationship. Like

408
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:12,319
we had so much fun seeing each other again. But literally I was just saying to him, hang

409
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,039
on, before I answer any of this, when have you last had a conversation with a man about

410
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:20,339
these things? Like what has this got to do with anything? And it actually came out that

411
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:22,380
he just didn't want me to call him out on his bad behavior.

412
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:24,819
Yeah. And you will consistently.

413
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,259
I said, well, don't behave badly. And there's the answer.

414
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:33,140
I haven't got a problem. It's genius. And I think you've carved a path that is a really

415
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:37,559
impressive one for everyone, male and female. Griggs, you and I got enormous respect for

416
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:40,619
you on that front. You mentioned the boy. I'm always curious on the home front. What

417
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,019
do you like as a mum?

418
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:47,680
Well, I think I'm a very consistent mum. I have a great relationship with the boys. I

419
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,779
mean, our boys were wild. And I think, I mean, they're still wild. Don't get me wrong. They're

420
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:57,259
now 28 and 27 and they are the best fun to be around, but they are wild.

421
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,099
And they always were. I think what was really important is, I said, this is where I'm talking

422
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:07,259
about like, yeah, there's no scandals. There could have been a million scandals if anyone

423
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:11,359
had actually seen what was going on behind closed doors with our kids, because they were,

424
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:15,460
they were, they pushed the boundaries on absolutely everything. But because I didn't, I don't accept

425
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,759
free gifts. Like I never have. And if I go into a contract with someone, I'm happy to share

426
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:26,400
everyone the details of if it's a mutual, I give you this for this, I'll do it. But for the most

427
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,480
part, I don't, I don't accept free gifts. I don't accept free gifts. I don't accept free gifts.

428
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:33,079
I never have. And I don't accept free tickets to events. I make a lovely excuse, but I pay for the

429
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:36,000
tickets and I go with friends. And then therefore there's not an obligation that you have to have

430
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,660
a photo. So what it allowed us to do was for the years where the boys were, you know, rat bags is

431
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:46,579
probably a very polite way of saying what I'd like to say. Yeah. We had forever said to people

432
00:29:46,579 --> 00:29:50,859
off limits with the kids, let kids be kids. Kids are mean enough to other children,

433
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:54,880
particularly through those formative years with the added pressure of social media,

434
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,420
which we didn't have when we were growing up.

435
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,640
And so people respected that because I wasn't being a hypocrite. I wasn't turning up to the

436
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,839
opening of an envelope. Like I do publicity as per my contract and that's it. And so because of that,

437
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:11,039
the boys were, they were like, they were so naughty and they got themselves into so much

438
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:16,079
trouble, but no one never, never saw that because we had the door closed. So at home, like they

439
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,619
always hated me wearing too much makeup for work, still do. But any girlfriend they've ever had,

440
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,740
they're like really natural girlfriends, which I'm sure is some weird little kickback to seeing

441
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,400
their mum always, you know, doled up for wrong things.

442
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:32,660
Um, but you're just mum and, and Todd's just dad. So you, you are, they respect you for how

443
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,480
consistent you are with the boundaries that you set them. And now they're past all those horror

444
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,460
years and they keep saying to us, geez, we really, we're really sorry. Like we really don't quite get

445
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,920
why we were that bad. And it's like, yeah, you're also pretty lucky. And then I remember the exact

446
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,000
year where Jesse said one day at the races, I think I'd like to come to the races with you.

447
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:53,740
And I said, okay, but you have, you, you need to understand the gloves are off then at any point

448
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,240
now, if you're, if you go into that social,

449
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:01,460
if you go into, you're coming to an event, you cross a line in the sand that you can never come

450
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:05,079
back. And I feel like you've, you've witnessed enough of everything that I've gone through,

451
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:09,359
the highs and lows in the industry, everything there, you know, but that has gone through in

452
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:14,720
the industry that if you cross that line, then all of a sudden you just have to understand for

453
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,839
every action, there's a consequence. What a gift you gave them when you look

454
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:22,059
back, isn't it? And that, I mean, cause it's, it's intoxicating sometimes and you gotta free,

455
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,180
there's free stuff everywhere in our industry and, and tickets to go to things. But for you

456
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:26,400
to understand that, it's a gift.

457
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:30,480
I understand that before it all started. And, and that's how we want our kids to grow. We want

458
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,579
them to make those mistakes.

459
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,400
We want them to make mistakes because it makes them better humans. And that's that whole thing,

460
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,880
like makes anyone making a mistake. If you learn from it, it makes you a better person. So yeah,

461
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,039
I think, I think it's,

462
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,599
Would have been 10 times harder wouldn't have, if they had had to have the public,

463
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:46,920
they may not have come to the other side.

464
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:51,680
Look, it could have gone absolutely pear-shaped for them. And it's a pressure that, you know,

465
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,140
they might have thought they understood, but they don't. It's probably only now that they truly

466
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,319
understand, you know, how much you think about those things and, and why you made those decisions.

467
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:04,319
Like they, and like they, they spent years at Melbourne Park. Like they got so spoiled with

468
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:09,160
tennis cause I've hosted it for 17 years and they'd go to so many matches that often there'd

469
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,380
be some blockbuster and at Rod Laver Arena, we have tickets for them and they just play handball

470
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:18,039
out the front of the, of the studio. And then when they got bored, they'd go and get room service,

471
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:21,559
but they, you know, they've always been independent, but they definitely have been

472
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:25,119
allowed to, to grow up and go through their own challenges, which every,

473
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,920
every child goes through.

474
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,180
Yeah. And it's brilliant. You, you share that. And being around you, I know you have,

475
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,900
and I look at my house and think of some of the loose things, but your purpose built to do that.

476
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,960
I mean, you know, particular boys' brains don't form properly. Still waiting for that to happen.

477
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:43,819
And I even, I look at myself, like we did stupid things in our teenage years.

478
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,440
And I think cause they were a day under a year apart as well. They never were making a stupid

479
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,759
decision by themselves. Like they always had each other as backup. So they just would double down.

480
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,019
And like, I'm so stubborn. Todd is so stubborn. Like,

481
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,700
it's not a surprise when they've decided to be stubborn back to us.

482
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:02,819
Jess is also, he's got a mind of a lawyer. He's the most brilliant person to have an

483
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:07,819
argument with or a debate with because he can just, one, his memory, I've got a pretty

484
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:12,940
phenomenal memory, but his is next level. And you just, you kind of, you kind of get frustrated,

485
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:14,539
but in awe at the same time.

486
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:19,480
The DNA is fascinating, isn't it? When you can see it coming back at you reflected, it's,

487
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,619
it's, it's interesting, isn't it? You're always trying to claim the good traits and

488
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:25,059
hand the other ones off to Beck that aren't.

489
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,799
So enticing. I love that, you know, Bed, Homes and Gardens, 30 years, 20 years as your host has

490
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:37,319
told positive stories that have improved people's lives. They're not there to judge or denigrate

491
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:43,099
anyone. I love that very few spots on mainstream TV where that exists. And it, and again, no

492
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:46,220
surprise you're the host because I don't think you'd stand for much else.

493
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:51,339
Well, even I did a foray into reality TV for seven years and I've got to say outside of

494
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:55,119
the teams that I loved and some of the crews that I had worked with,

495
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,799
that I adored, that was the most excruciating thing because it was the opposite of that.

496
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,839
It was about trying to be awful and it didn't start out like that, but it evolved into that

497
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:08,099
because now TV executives have convinced themselves that everything has to be controversial and,

498
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:12,300
and outrageous. And it's got to, you know, you've got to have people in tears. You're

499
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,599
going to have high drama. When I started House of Wars, it was just a really positive,

500
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,619
gorgeous show. And it just kind of evolved and started going down. And every year I'd sit with

501
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:24,599
the bosses and I'd have a hundred suggestions for them. And it's the only genre I've ever worked in

502
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:29,280
where they honestly think that it's, it's a whole new thing, this television thing that they're

503
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,760
making. So they wouldn't, they won't listen. They won't take input, won't take feedback.

504
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,760
And so it just kept going. And it got to a point where I actually could not, I could not live with

505
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,179
myself working on a show that was actively ruining people's lives. And so again, you know, we did,

506
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:48,260
we shot two endings one year and I went to the farm and cried for a week after it. I was so upset

507
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:53,860
what I'd done to those teams. And yeah, I sat down in a meeting with the bosses and between us,

508
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:57,239
I kept saying, between us, we've got over 50 years of experience around the table. In my head,

509
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:02,239
I was like, if you add up mine, I've got more than the two of you together. But that aside,

510
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:07,519
I kept saying, I thought it was horrible. And they said, well, we didn't think it was that bad.

511
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,639
And I said, well, that's what we do in television. We convince ourselves that we're all so fabulous

512
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:14,539
that there's no reality checks in it. And you don't have people around you that are willing

513
00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:18,980
to pull you up on these things. I said, so I've stepped over the line again. And I've actually

514
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,659
asked the contestants to write their experience and their family members to write their experience.

515
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,280
And I said, so I've blown it up to make this really easy. But what I have highlighted are

516
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,539
the absolute devastation, the anxiety they felt, how it's impacted their lives, how they're not

517
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:35,880
sleeping. So it doesn't matter what you tell yourselves, this is what they're experiencing.

518
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:41,139
And it's because of what we actually did to them. So now that we've got that aside, between us,

519
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:45,300
let's work out a way where we can do one ending and still have all the sensitivities that you

520
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,960
want protected. And they're saying, oh, it's not true. We shoot two endings because it could still

521
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,519
go either way. I said, well, then how come I only ever got one script? It's as simple as that.

522
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,960
I only ever had one winner. So again, you can tell yourself that there were going to be two

523
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:03,500
versions. But as host, I only ever had one script. So from that point on, we never shot two endings

524
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:09,639
again. And I know it bugged them, absolutely killed them. But it's just like, treat people

525
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:13,719
well. You'll get more out of them. So when I started, you weren't allowed to talk to the teams.

526
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:17,559
You weren't allowed to talk to crew members who I'd worked with for all those years. None of it

527
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:21,920
made sense in my head, which everything else I do in my life is the complete opposite. And so part

528
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,380
of that decision to leave was just like, I've got to do this. I've got to do this. I've got to do this.

529
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:28,360
I couldn't be on the board of Beyond Blue and then work on a show that was actually... And they'd

530
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:32,980
say, well, it's not really impacting their lives. I'm like, actually, one of these guys, he was

531
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,800
working for the Australian Federal Police. You made up a storyline about him being disrespectful

532
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:43,639
to women. It almost cost him his career. He's now so high up the food chain with his job because

533
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:49,480
thankfully he was able to keep it. But it was touch and go there for a while. And then what

534
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,519
they want you to do is not have any contact with them so that they're never held accountable.

535
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,559
It's like, I don't operate like that. I'm going to get the best out of them. Every new series,

536
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:01,059
I just walk in and say, they're going to stop me soon, but I just want you to know this. I'm here

537
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:04,659
to defend you. So any of you have any problems, you come to me. If you think something's untoward,

538
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:09,239
you come to me and I'll take up that fight for you. And then I'll just be like, almost crash

539
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:14,239
tackled to the ground with a, stop speaking. Never go to a meeting with Jo Griggs and not

540
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:18,719
expect her to be well-prepared. Not surprised you went to the families. But again, I love,

541
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:23,260
I hope maybe the needle does shift eventually. It seems like mainstream TV now,

542
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,219
it's just as nasty. It's nasty. And the funny thing is it does affect the families. Like

543
00:37:27,219 --> 00:37:31,260
parents be on the phone and them sobbing their hearts out because they were so worried about

544
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,500
what would happen to their kids. It's public humiliation. It's public humiliation. And so

545
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,480
when they keep telling me this is the way they have to go, I say, then how come Better Homes

546
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:45,659
works? We only celebrate people who are passionate and have great ideas and who love what they do.

547
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:49,719
And we get to do nice things for people, but also you just get to speak to people who are

548
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:52,960
doing great things in the world. And here it is 30 years.

549
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:56,780
And yeah, I remember very last meeting when I was stepping down from House Rules,

550
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,420
one of the bosses said to me, I believe, he said, this is the direction we're going to go in. And I

551
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,960
believe that you think you have too much integrity to do it. And I just started laughing. I said to

552
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,719
him, well, this is a first. I've actually never heard anyone use integrity as an insult.

553
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:15,719
And I said, impressive. But I said, I said, I just want to say, you're right. I'm not going

554
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:20,380
to do it. But as, as I would also like to get in early with my, I told you so, because I give this

555
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,360
show very little time on air before it fails. And it was,

556
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,219
two nights on air before it got bumped. Too much integrity. There's a first,

557
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,659
isn't it? You're not suitable because your integrity is at too high a level.

558
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:37,780
And I love your story because to me, you have gone in to fight authentically for everything

559
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,380
you believe in. And you know, I'm passionate about what leadership looks like in different

560
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:45,079
settings. And I think your version of that is quite incredible. And we've seen these patterns

561
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:48,699
around what different leaders look like, Griggsie. So I want to ask you a few questions on these

562
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:52,239
different dimensions of leadership and the idea that's very hard. I think you've got a clear

563
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:52,900
example of this.

564
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:57,360
To lead anyone else, unless you know yourself really well and your own sense of self-leadership,

565
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,119
what does that mean to you?

566
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,400
Well, I think you've got to know what your strengths are and also when you need to delegate

567
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,440
and when you need to rely on other people's strengths. I think a lot of the, I guess,

568
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:10,840
less popular leaders, in my opinion, that I have watched up close have been the ones who,

569
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:17,260
who just are so controlling that they won't let anyone else have a suggestion or take any

570
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:22,440
responsibility. If you, if you're a really great leader, you actually have quite a lot of spare

571
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,360
time because you've actually, you've got a lot of time. And you've got a lot of time to

572
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:28,199
actually found great people. You've, whether it's, whether it's, you've educated them in

573
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,480
certain things that you want them to get their skills set up, but you, you recognise what

574
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:36,219
you're lacking in and how they can, how they can actually be great leaders because then

575
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:40,300
it's a team thing. And I remember like part of what I do for BU is I chair the National

576
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:45,539
Advisory Council. And BU is the National Mental Health Initiative in early learning services

577
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:49,260
and schools across the country. So it's in one in three early learning services and over

578
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,219
70% of all schools. And we just got put in every school in the Northern Territory through a

579
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:57,719
government initiative. And I remember being so overwhelmed seeing the names around the table

580
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:01,440
and representatives from health and education from every state and territory and the government level

581
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,679
in that room. And it was my husband. He said to me, you're not there to be the expert. You have

582
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:11,019
a room full of experts, Jo. Your job is to be the conduit to get them to, to, to open up and to

583
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:14,300
share their expertise. And some of those people are going to be extroverts and some of them are

584
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,579
going to be introverts. And you're going to have to work harder on the introverts because what they

585
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:21,400
have to say has just as much value as the extrovert, but often they don't get heard in that

586
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,000
kind of setting. Yeah, it's a brilliant,

587
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:27,440
um, insight. No, not surprising that Todd, your husband had that about you because I could picture

588
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,980
you bringing a team like that together. And I've never seen this before working on the

589
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:37,960
telecast of the football guys holding the camera have got the best ideas because they watch it

590
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,920
more closely. And I often think what a waste not to ask them for their ideas or not to collaborate

591
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,679
with the whole range of people in the industry that are sitting there. They get rid of those

592
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:51,639
people with all that experience, like the intellectual property that goes, the, the

593
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:52,880
insights that they have. I,

594
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:56,719
I don't understand that. They're the best people in the world to sit down and just natter with

595
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:00,820
coming back to better homes. One of my cameramen shot my very first piece to camera.

596
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,400
Another one just retired last year after 45 years in TV, 20 years on better homes. Another one I've

597
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,920
worked with for 18 years. You know, I'm lucky now. I only work with people who, who have the

598
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,599
same sort of philosophy and same values, but they also are people who have been around for a while

599
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,780
and are flexible. Like they're not rigid in their ways. They're happy to always learn and upskill

600
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:26,059
talk to someone who has that experience and take it on board.

601
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:30,860
Yeah. Brilliant. Not surprising. They're great lifelong friends of, uh, of yours. We see leaders

602
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:35,239
are really conscious around on a daily basis, how they positively impact people in the environment

603
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:40,840
they're in. This is right to your forehand. Uh, do you conscious about that impacting people

604
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:45,360
positively? Yeah, I think, um, I think a lot of people can go to work these days and not feel

605
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,960
like they're seen or heard. And I think feeling like you're not heard is horrible, but feeling

606
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,260
like no one even sees you is horrendous. So.

607
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:58,079
So I make a conscious effort, you know, to make sure I'm regularly in our production office. Now,

608
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,719
lots of presenters might not ever go in there, but it's about going around and talking to each

609
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:07,360
person and finding out a little bit about their lives and their families. And, you know, I remember

610
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:12,400
doing a big, um, like a big weekend up at the farm. We had 110 from Better Homes and it was

611
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,079
just fascinating watching other people look at other people and go, oh, she's got six kids. Now

612
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,179
I know why she tries to get out the door at 4.30 in the afternoon. You know, like she's, she starts

613
00:42:22,179 --> 00:42:22,920
earlier, but she.

614
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:27,539
She's getting out the door because she actually wants to be present in a work-life balance. And

615
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:31,659
this is well before COVID where that was even something that was even considered. So again,

616
00:42:31,659 --> 00:42:36,159
it's about humanizing all those people around you so that you have a greater understanding of

617
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,900
what makes them tick. And there are going to be some people who have severe anxiety, or there's

618
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,699
going to be some people who, you know, I hate walking in front of a room full of people I don't

619
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:47,880
know. Um, you've got to let all those people still be heard and be seen.

620
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:52,900
Yeah. And then your life is so much more magnified and better, isn't it? Yeah. So again,

621
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,139
it sounds like.

622
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:57,619
Sounds simple, but you do it in a really special way. We see leaders are really conscious around

623
00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:01,760
the vision they want to create for the spaces they are in. And you've got to really, you know,

624
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,800
I'm not sure if you actually articulate it, but you walk into a space with you and it feels like

625
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,739
you know exactly what you want it to be. How have you gone about creating and sharing that with

626
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:10,000
others?

627
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:15,699
I think I just tried to remember what it's like when I started out and all those things that I

628
00:43:15,699 --> 00:43:21,420
found strange that people wouldn't do. Like just say hello. I know it sounds like a simple thing,

629
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:23,119
but I used to blow my mind.

630
00:43:23,139 --> 00:43:27,199
We'd go to these big production meetings and you'd be sitting next to people who you're going

631
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,539
to be working with really intensely for a period of time. And no one would talk to each other.

632
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:35,800
They're not given a time just to, to actually just meet and greet and say g'day. So I think,

633
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,219
I think, I think about things like that, about, uh, of just spending the time

634
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:44,539
wanting them to enjoy themselves, wanting them to feel like nothing that they're going to say

635
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:48,699
is silly. Like it kills me when someone in our office says, look, this is probably going to be

636
00:43:48,699 --> 00:43:52,679
the silliest thing you've heard. And you're going to shoot me. Absolutely not. There's no such thing

637
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:55,960
as a silly question. And there's no such thing really as this. I mean, there can be some pretty

638
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:00,480
funny statements, but sometimes those people have the most amazing insights because they also have

639
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,619
sat back and watched and observed. And there's a lot to be said for just doing that alone as well.

640
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:07,599
And if you don't create the conditions where people are comfortable to ask one,

641
00:44:07,699 --> 00:44:09,019
then you're going to lose all this gold.

642
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:13,760
All that gold. And you also lose someone who might potentially be somebody who could go

643
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,500
all the way through everything that you're doing in your business model set up to end up being the

644
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,599
leader. Yeah. I know with Better Homes, it took us a long time.

645
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:25,820
To get the right people in charge of the show. And that's because the network kept saying they

646
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:30,539
weren't going to listen to talent. It took 10 years to get the right person in. And we had

647
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:37,880
some absolute disasters along the way. But I was told ultimately that the person that I kept putting

648
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,480
forward was someone who was working in our office, not the loudest, not the noisiest, not the

649
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,619
most in your face, but the person who was the one that was going around and checking on people and

650
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:50,219
keeping things going and keeping communication open. It took 10 years to get him put into that

651
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:52,539
position. Such a condescending word, talent.

652
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:58,400
You know, hair stands on the back of it. You're the talent. Why would we listen to you? It's like,

653
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,980
because maybe I've been doing it for 33 years and potentially together, we might be able to,

654
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:05,639
not surprised you won the day again. It took you 10 years, but.

655
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:09,739
Well, I actually also got an apology from one of those bosses because I remember in one particular

656
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:14,159
meeting and saying, have you checked the references of the person you are putting in? And they were

657
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:18,539
like, it's none of your business. And I went, okay. Cause I figured this is the news you're

658
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:22,619
going to drop to me. I've been having me sit out in the foyer for 40 minutes. So I've just

659
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:26,420
spent 40 minutes doing a bit of research. So I just reeled off what I'd learned. And they looked

660
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:30,300
at me and they're like, again, this is none of your business. I said, yeah, but I'm red flagging

661
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,659
something with you. And they're like, well, we'll just have to wait and see. And sure enough, it was

662
00:45:34,659 --> 00:45:40,019
pretty much a capitulation of the highest level you could imagine what eventuated. But one of

663
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:43,760
them ended up, you know, again, they wanted to go with someone different even after that. And then

664
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,320
I said, can you just, just put him in for a trial? And one of them said, you know what,

665
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:51,179
Greasy, this is amazing. You're right. He's actually really great in that role.

666
00:45:51,179 --> 00:45:56,679
Yeah. So I was like, really? Yeah. I'm going to now feed your ego and say, thank you. That's

667
00:45:56,679 --> 00:46:00,179
wonderful news. You're amazing that you actually took that step and put him in. But in my head,

668
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:03,980
I'm just like, we could have saved 10 years and all these great people we lost along the way

669
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:09,000
because of really terrible people management. Yeah. And I always railed against those people.

670
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:14,420
And so as I've got older, you almost feel sorry for those people we put in roles. No skills to do

671
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:20,000
or no lessons on how to manage people or how to interact properly. And so you set those people up.

672
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,400
Yeah.

673
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,360
They love that look. That's what they say to me. You have to understand they've just,

674
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,119
these are people that we've just promoted through TV. I go, well then when is it as a,

675
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,019
as a business model, when is it going to be that you put these people into these roles and then

676
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:35,920
you upskill them, you send them off to management training, you send them off to different things,

677
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,960
you give them opportunities where they can go somewhere really inspiring for them,

678
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,900
where they can learn off somebody. And then actually then no one can say they don't know

679
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,260
how to manage people. That's not the excuse we're going to hide behind.

680
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:50,380
Yeah. No, it's a great, it's a great point. We see people are successful consistently and

681
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,360
show up in that way are really curious and through curiosity, they're constantly learning.

682
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,159
Is that, is that you?

683
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,739
Constantly. Like both at work and also away from work. Like I just, I feel like, and sometimes

684
00:47:00,739 --> 00:47:05,739
I've often said to Todd, I wonder if it's because, because of swimming, I only had a couple of months

685
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:11,000
secondary education. So I never actually finished school and never sat an exam. And, and sometimes

686
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,300
in the situations and the settings, I mean, and the things I'm doing, I'm, I feel very self-conscious

687
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:20,380
of that. And so I think it's just created this lifelong passion just to learn. So whether it's

688
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,960
about diet, you know, we did an artificial insemination course last year on, on our cattle.

689
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:32,659
I'm about to do a butchery course in two weeks time. Yeah. I'm a beekeeper. I love, I grow 85%

690
00:47:32,659 --> 00:47:36,500
of all my veggies because that goes back to when I was sick. And I know that the very best food can

691
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,960
be the organically grown food that I can grow. And I've learned all this stuff from Better Homes

692
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,699
over the years. So, you know, we really basically only ever have to shop to top up. We don't,

693
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:50,199
we don't have to, we can get everything out of our garden. And then I've learned how to preserve it

694
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:55,059
and pickle it and dehydrate it and turn it into powder. So there's very little waste. And I'm so

695
00:47:55,059 --> 00:48:00,280
big on the sustainability and recycling aspect that, that you actually, you live what you

696
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,300
dreamt about and it's amazing how satisfying and fulfilling it is, but you're always learning.

697
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,820
And what I love, it's a great message again. There's an obsession with ATAR and

698
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:15,480
smartest people that are in my world are like you either hated school, dropped out of school,

699
00:48:16,219 --> 00:48:20,079
failed miserably a lot of the time. And there was, they learn in different ways.

700
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:23,760
And so I think, yeah, again, you see a generation of kids are told they're dumb because

701
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,800
they can't write, learn and get a good ATAR. It's like, it opens your brain in a different way. And

702
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,960
it's, um, yeah.

703
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:34,699
It's funny how, like I talk to school kids a lot about that. I talk about the transition years and

704
00:48:34,699 --> 00:48:40,539
I talk about the, the, the end of school and I stand up in front of them and I can recognize in

705
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:44,380
their faces that they're just like, we have no idea who she is because they don't watch free to

706
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:49,039
wear. Right. So you've got like years of these kids just looking at you just going, uh-huh.

707
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:50,179
And then you go, oh, I don't know. And then you go, oh, I don't know. And then you go, oh, I don't

708
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:53,460
know. And then you go, okay. And better than that, I know that you have no idea who I am. I'm

709
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:57,059
going to talk to you about a medium that you don't watch. It's called free to wear TV. And then

710
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,920
they're all like, yeah, we watch YouTube. We do this, we do that. And then, and then you go, but

711
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,480
I still think there's going to be some lessons in this that you can learn from, which is don't let

712
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,780
somebody tell you one result is going to be the emphasis for the rest of your life. There's,

713
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:15,320
there's so much available to, you know, as I'm 50 now that I could go down several different paths

714
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:19,260
and toy with the idea. Like if, if the Olympics had been canceled, I was going to go and do an

715
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:24,219
agronomy course. So I will continue just to keep learning in every possible way.

716
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,980
And Grigsy, you communicate for a living now and you do it, do it brilliantly. You shared with us

717
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:33,659
that, you know, at the start, there was some rough moments as there was for everyone. Have you

718
00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:39,119
thought really about the way you communicate your message? I think I don't really have to these days

719
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,880
now with Better Homes because it is so positive. It's more about relaying it to somebody who's

720
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,880
very nervous, just to, just to reassure them that you are not going to make them look silly. You

721
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,239
know, that's everything.

722
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:53,320
Everyone's fear. They don't want to look silly and, and that everything that is going to put to

723
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,519
air, it's not just me. It's a team effort. We will just protect them and they will look at this and

724
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:02,079
they'll be like, my God, I'm amazing. By the time they've watched the story go to air. I think with

725
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:07,860
sport, I make a conscious effort to try and focus on the positives. Even, even in sport, those

726
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:12,019
stories where people are going off the rails or, you know, something's happened in their life,

727
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:18,400
that can be told in a really positive way. I mean, I, I do hate, I hate the way that a lot of news

728
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,039
gets reported.

729
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:24,099
And the relentlessness of it. And, you know, we're still seeing from a Beyond Blue point of view,

730
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:30,400
the, the impact of kids hearing death tallies from state versus state and country versus country. And

731
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,159
you know, in Australia, we're not really great at, at celebrating, acknowledging death. There's

732
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:38,659
some cultures that are really fantastic at it. I spoke to Ray Martin the other day. He's done

733
00:50:38,659 --> 00:50:42,920
this great series on just following different cultures and how they treat it. I feel lucky.

734
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:47,780
We grew up big country family. We'd go to a funeral. It would start off with everyone crying.

735
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,239
By day three, your parents were dead.

736
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:52,260
Everyone was dancing on a table and everyone was just celebrating someone's life, but it was always

737
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:58,059
an event. And it's kind of nice to that. So I, even in, even those negative stories,

738
00:50:58,059 --> 00:51:01,579
you can actually still find a positive way to tell them. I think I really am conscious of trying to

739
00:51:01,579 --> 00:51:01,980
do that.

740
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:06,679
Yeah. And it's brilliant. I, I, it's so aligned with the way you think it's, you know, sport gets

741
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:09,840
covered now with the worst headline and the...

742
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,900
And the clickbait. Like, and I've been receiving end of just rubbish stuff with clickbait, which,

743
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:17,559
which if anyone, like, you know, the people who are slamming haven't actually listened to it,

744
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:19,239
or they would realize there's actually nothing.

745
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,840
There's no story in it. But by that stage, you've got athletes commenting on it and this,

746
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,320
and you're just looking at it going, oh my gosh, this is...

747
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,579
Is there one you can share? Is there one that jumps out?

748
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:31,739
Oh, there's, I could share too. Like the, my dummy spit after the Commonwealth Games closing

749
00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:37,099
ceremony on the Gold Coast. I, not from the athletes. The athletes were just thanking me

750
00:51:37,099 --> 00:51:37,320
about what a debacle.

751
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,659
Because you were fighting for the athletes, weren't you?

752
00:51:38,739 --> 00:51:41,980
Well, I was fighting for the, I was just fighting because I thought it was a rotten decision and a

753
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:42,940
stupid decision.

754
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,539
So remind people again, they didn't allow the athletes to be in...

755
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:48,960
They made a decision to turn the lights off the athletes. So they made them, like they had the

756
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,199
athletes watch the game.

757
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:49,239
Yeah.

758
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:54,679
Before the televised ceremony actually started. And that's happened plenty of times before and

759
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:59,480
it's worked beautifully. But usually an opening is very full of all the official parts of a

760
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:04,420
ceremony. And the closing is just a joyous celebration. And, you know, Gold Coast had

761
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:08,500
done such a great, great job with it. And they made a choice to turn off the athletes,

762
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,360
not make it about the athletes. And so the athletes just left.

763
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,940
So the lights went on and you could, yeah.

764
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,940
Yeah. They'd never seen, never seen. And, you know, like Kurt Fearnley, I remember him

765
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:18,699
coming out and he had the flag because he was carrying the flag in.

766
00:52:18,699 --> 00:52:21,840
And I remember looking down and somebody's walked up to him and ripped the flag out of

767
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,460
his hands. And then he was just kind of looking around going, what? And then they realised

768
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:28,840
they needed him for a photo op. So they shoved the flag back in and got him up the other

769
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:32,900
end of the thing. He was home. Yeah. He was actually, I think, at a mate's place having

770
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:33,280
a beer.

771
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:35,500
And you were doing the official broadcast.

772
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:41,380
Well, and I was saying, guys, get a camera. The athletes have, they're all out of the,

773
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:45,159
they're heading out of the stadium in a hurry. And they're going, no, no, we still got some.

774
00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:48,639
But by the time they showed athletes, you're lucky if there were 200 left

775
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:52,699
in the stadium, but also the stadium, a lot of the stadium had left as well. So I just,

776
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,619
you know, they said, as broadcasters, we have to spin this as a positive thing. And I was

777
00:52:57,619 --> 00:53:01,460
like, no way, there's literally no way I'm going to do it. And they're like, well, we

778
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:04,900
think you have to, because we're broadcasting it. And I said, well, I'm giving you fair

779
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,800
warning. I'm going to go rogue. And so I just remember there's this big silence. They said,

780
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,619
hold on a second. And they obviously cleared it right to the top. And they came back and

781
00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:15,719
they just said, say whatever you feel like you need to say. And so like, that was funny

782
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:18,619
because it was actually, funnily enough, a female woman in sports.

783
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:22,340
Who decided to absolutely attack me. And it was the most ridiculous. Like it wasn't

784
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:27,039
even, it wasn't even fact-based. It was the most ridiculous thing. But boy, people jumped

785
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:30,980
on board that. And I just remember for a couple of days, just, I actually was in a voiceover

786
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:34,639
booth. So I didn't even really see it. All I remember is I got home. Todd, of course,

787
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:38,099
he never watches anything that I do, which I kind of love. Nor do my boys. I love it.

788
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:43,059
I actually love that about all of them, you know, because you are just mum and wife. And

789
00:53:43,059 --> 00:53:47,000
Todd just rang me in the morning. And by that stage, I'd realised that my phone had blown

790
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
up and everyone was faffing.

791
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:52,380
And I had the publicist and they're freaking out about how to handle it. And Todd just

792
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:57,139
said to me, hey darling, anything happen last night? I was like, oh yeah, I think I might

793
00:53:57,139 --> 00:53:59,199
have blown up my career. He goes, oh, again.

794
00:53:59,639 --> 00:53:59,920
Again.

795
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:04,179
How do you, how do you feel about it? And I said, I feel, I feel like it was the right

796
00:54:04,179 --> 00:54:07,380
thing to do. He said, well then don't worry. He said, it'll pass.

797
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:07,780
Yeah.

798
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,960
He said, love you. Just come home safely. And that was, that was all we discussed about

799
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,019
that. But it went for days. Like I remember Julia Gillard, who was our chair at Beyond

800
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:18,619
Blue at that point, she sent me an email going, hey matey, you're a good girl.

801
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:22,780
Okay. And I was laughing because I'm like, what you went through was so much worse than

802
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:28,420
this. And she's like, this is pretty vicious. And I was like, mate, I said, look, I'm, I'm

803
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:34,039
actually fine. Another one was a journo through the Olympics. I think it was with Kyle Chalmers

804
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:37,619
and saying that we were commenting on Kyle's relation. I don't know. I can't even remember

805
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:41,579
what it was about. And then that got picked up as this big thing. Never said it. Just

806
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:45,119
said that the person, in my opinion, who kept talking about it was Kyle himself, which he

807
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,619
did out of every single race. And I got smashed by that.

808
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:54,480
But it was, it was again, like his dad did radio and I was just watching it going. I

809
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,039
think I've had enough of it that you kind of get a thick skin, but you're just looking

810
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:00,920
at going, wow. Again, if that was someone that was starting out, that would probably

811
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:05,000
really affect them. Whereas I was like, yeah, water off a duck's back. Do your best. This

812
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,559
will be hilarious.

813
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:11,519
Brilliant. And I love every part of that. Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

814
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:18,380
I would have to say from example, my mum. She, like we, we look at it now, four kids,

815
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:25,079
work full time, studied full time, never made any of the four of us feel like we, we

816
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:30,340
weren't the priority, which as a mum of two young men now, I go, how did she actually

817
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:34,440
do that in that, in that era? And with, you know, lots of other sort of pressures around

818
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:40,000
it. So she, she led by example, but also my sisters, like my oldest sister, I always say

819
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,980
to everyone between my sisters and my younger brother that I'm the underachiever of the

820
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:48,079
family because they're all pretty extraordinary. My sister was, you know, first female president

821
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:53,760
of the company that came up with the technology that photographs of Mars, you know, felt compromised,

822
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,059
left a job, went around Australia and started two businesses. And then like she now runs

823
00:55:58,059 --> 00:56:02,320
the leading, you know, social media business company in Australia. Like there's people

824
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:08,519
who, who I guess have set their values, not compromised it, like follow their passions,

825
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:13,559
but not compromise the things that are important to them. And, and yeah, we talk about whether

826
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:17,619
you can have everything. And I think sometimes you can't have everything, like you're going

827
00:56:17,619 --> 00:56:18,519
to feel like you're a failure.

828
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:22,360
As a mom, we're going to feel like you're a failure at work, but you, the one thing

829
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:26,760
you actually can have, if you strip everything else there, uh, how you feel about yourself

830
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:31,739
and how you treat people, because you're in control of that. And that is probably the

831
00:56:31,739 --> 00:56:33,960
ones, they're the people that I've learned those lessons from.

832
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,119
Yeah. What a great message that is. And it's so nice that you go to the home front, isn't

833
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:41,219
it? And I know your relationship with your mom and your, and your siblings is incredibly

834
00:56:41,219 --> 00:56:45,219
strong. We're a bit obsessed with collaboration and you talked about moving the world out

835
00:56:45,219 --> 00:56:48,159
of silos into more, and you're an incredible collaborator.

836
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:48,179
Yeah.

837
00:56:48,179 --> 00:56:48,239
Yeah.

838
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,920
And you're an incredible collaborator and you've got lots of passions and your whole

839
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,199
range of areas. We could do another whole series on, on the growing the veggies and

840
00:56:56,199 --> 00:56:56,619
the hobbies.

841
00:56:56,699 --> 00:56:57,760
Mrs. Huggins hobby hub.

842
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,800
I love it. There is a TV show in that, but has there been someone you thought, God, I'd

843
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:07,159
love to collaborate with that person on one of the things or that you're passionate about?

844
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:11,460
To be honest, I feel like I get to work with all the people that I've seen that I want

845
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:16,860
to do that with. Like, um, I mean, even like silly frivolous things like my stylist, uh,

846
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,619
which in visual medium.

847
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:23,199
Um, is really important. I had so many years of just shocking solace because I'm not a

848
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:27,760
size, you know, six and I'm six foot tall. So most people just, you know, particularly

849
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,440
in that world, they look at you and they're like, how much material are we going to have

850
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:35,199
to use? Oh my God, let's just cover her up. And, and I just didn't care enough about fashion

851
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:39,199
to really ever pay any attention to it. So for years, some of the stuff I'd be wearing

852
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:43,380
at the races I'd be looking at. And then it just got to a point where I felt like it was

853
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:48,159
grab a granny night on Tuesday night, the RSL and that they just basically went down there

854
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:52,059
and gave someone 10 bucks for the outfits and bought it back for me to wear. Um, and

855
00:57:52,059 --> 00:57:56,119
so, you know, I found somebody who actually dresses me in stuff that I'm comfortable in

856
00:57:56,119 --> 00:58:00,400
and came and looked at my wardrobe and worked out what that was. And so little things like

857
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:05,500
that. I, I love, um, Julia Gillard was a real highlight for me to work with. Our new chair,

858
00:58:05,559 --> 00:58:07,539
Sam Mostyn is another one who's a phenomenal leader.

859
00:58:07,539 --> 00:58:08,679
She's on the Beyond Blue board.

860
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:11,960
Beyond Blue board. And I've done my three terms. I've just been extended for another

861
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:16,900
two years with that. Um, I, I work with lots of charities with people that you never hear

862
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,099
their names, but they've done them.

863
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:22,760
Most extraordinary work behind the scenes for decades now. And so I don't know, I think,

864
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,980
um, there's not actually anyone that I can think of that I look at and go, geez, I'd

865
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:30,340
like to just do something just with you. I think, I think I've got lots of those good

866
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:35,000
people around so that I know that if I ever went, right, what I'd like to do is rip up

867
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,880
this show and just have everyone working in this amazing environment, just to prove to

868
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,639
people that you can actually have it done like that, that, that I'd be able to fill

869
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:44,699
a production team in half a heartbeat.

870
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:47,900
Yeah. And I'd like to see you do that because I'm sure you could.

871
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:49,599
And you've probably half done that anyway.

872
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:53,179
I don't know. I don't know how I'd go with actually the negotiation part of it again

873
00:58:53,179 --> 00:58:55,800
with the bosses, the many bosses that I've pissed off.

874
00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:00,280
Well, Griggs, it's a great pleasure to spend any amount of time with you. You are a legend

875
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:04,659
and, and, um, the great privilege to have worked with you and seen how you impact others

876
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:08,519
every day is inspiring. And, um, I hope you keep doing it for as long as you possibly

877
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:12,239
want. I'm sure there's another great chapter coming up, but thanks for taking the time

878
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:12,460
today.

879
00:59:12,619 --> 00:59:16,000
Oh, it's been a pleasure. Thank you. And I love it. You know how much I loved working

880
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,619
with you. I felt like I had the luckiest.

881
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:22,280
Olympics and Paralympics. I had you and then I had Kurt Fearnley and I just got to spend

882
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,760
that much time with you. And it just, it was such a joy.

883
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:29,260
