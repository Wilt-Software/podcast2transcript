1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:11,089
John Aloisi is responsible for one of the greatest moments

2
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:12,130
in Australian sport.

3
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:15,830
As he stepped up and scored the penalty to send the Socceroos

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,649
to the 2006 World Cup, he etched his name in history

5
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:22,030
and changed soccer in Australia forever.

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,870
G'day, it's Luke D'Arcy.

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,750
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,490
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,409
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

10
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:39,149
and I've had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

11
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,329
in education, sport, industry and the arts

12
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,289
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

13
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:47,750
where everyone has a voice.

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,329
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

15
00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:12,560
What mindset and leadership skills allow you to execute perfectly

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,780
in the biggest moment of your sporting life?

17
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,540
How do you use the power of visualisation and positivity

18
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,799
to create the outcomes you want in life

19
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:21,459
while still maintaining the spirit of the sport?

20
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:24,180
Whilst also being real and working through the many challenges

21
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,640
life sends our way.

22
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,680
John Aloisi is now using the same determination and self-belief

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,959
as the head coach of the A-League's newest club, Western United.

24
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,239
Having survived a serious health scare in recent times,

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,239
how is an Australian sporting legend approaching the next chapter in his life?

26
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:47,700
John Aloisi is a legend of Australian sport.

27
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:51,459
He is widely respected as one of Australia's soccer's greatest ever players.

28
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:54,579
The first Australian player to play at the highest level

29
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:56,900
and score in the three big leagues of world soccer,

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,760
La Liga in Spain, Premier League in UK and Serie A in Italy.

31
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,239
John scored 127 goals in his 459 senior appearances

32
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:09,139
in an outstanding professional career spanning 20 years.

33
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,419
On top of that, John scored 27 goals in 55 matches representing Australia,

34
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,900
a record at the time of John's retirement from the game.

35
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,639
John's penalty kick that took the Socceroos into the 2006 World Cup

36
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,639
was voted by the Sport Australia Hall of Fame,

37
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,979
as one of the three greatest moments in Australian sporting history.

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,340
John is the current head coach of A-League club, Western United.

39
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,800
And I feel very privileged to call Johnny a friend.

40
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:36,879
We went to school together, John, way back in year three.

41
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,180
And it's always great to catch up with you, mate.

42
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:38,939
Thanks for your time today.

43
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,020
Thanks for having me on, Daz.

44
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:41,099
Well, I'm going to go back, mate,

45
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:44,599
because it's a story you and I have shared over many years.

46
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,699
And I think you probably know where I'm heading with this.

47
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:50,360
But in year four, our teacher was Peter Waters, Muddy Waters.

48
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,199
And you and I have spoken over the years about his influence.

49
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,780
He's probably the teacher we love the most.

50
00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:00,020
But he asked us to do an exercise to put a time capsule into the ground

51
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,520
that was going to be open in 2020.

52
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,860
Now, you and I have talked about this for a long time.

53
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:06,219
What was your recollection of that event?

54
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,240
Yeah, it was funny because ever since I remember,

55
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,439
I wanted to be a footballer.

56
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,939
I wanted to play professional football.

57
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:18,599
So I remember when Muddy Waters told us or asked us to do this,

58
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,199
we were excited and wrote down on a piece of paper.

59
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,120
And then you put this in the time capsule.

60
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:24,639
And I swear I put that.

61
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,780
I was going to play for Australia or, you know,

62
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,020
play professional football in Europe.

63
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:33,800
And I don't know if it's true or not, but I swear I did.

64
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,960
And I think you did the same.

65
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,740
You said you're going to be an AFL footballer.

66
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,800
Yeah, the exercise was, wasn't it?

67
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,620
What was your life going to look like in 2020?

68
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,259
So that was, you know, the cap capsule was supposed to be open two years ago.

69
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,379
Little did I realize I was going to be 45 years old.

70
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,840
Well, that's right, mate, and how life turned out.

71
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,539
And you and I used to say, hey, I know exactly what it was.

72
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:54,180
You and I were very much the same age.

73
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,759
I was determined that I was going to play AFL football

74
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,319
and used to get laughed at at that age.

75
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,620
But that was always you from my memory, John.

76
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,560
You had a really clear focus on what you wanted to be from that young age.

77
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:07,580
And so I have been back to the school for the first time in 30 years.

78
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:10,939
And I walked around trying to find that time capsule, Johnny,

79
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,879
just to see and spoke to the principal.

80
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,519
Apparently, yeah, there are time capsules planted everywhere around the grounds.

81
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:19,420
But I've often wondered, you know, it'd be great to open that up

82
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,879
and see if actually what we had in mind turned out as we planned.

83
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:24,379
Yeah, that would be great.

84
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,019
And I think COVID hindered us opening it up in 2020.

85
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,379
So, yeah, you never know.

86
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,980
It would be funny if I put, like, I wanted to be a schoolteacher

87
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,120
because I love muddy water so much.

88
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,139
We've been talking about that for a long while, haven't we?

89
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,019
So we have to make that happen at some stage, Johnny.

90
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:45,259
Now, another incident that I haven't spoken to you about for a while,

91
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:48,240
but we were great friends, you know, growing up.

92
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,079
But the school we went to, Ross-Tripper College, was interesting.

93
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,459
It was almost sort of 50-50.

94
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,519
There was a lot of Italian families like the Aloysius,

95
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,639
and a really strong sporting school, soccer program,

96
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,259
when you and your brother Ross were coming through.

97
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,399
And on the other side, we were the strong AFL guys.

98
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,040
And as was the case in about year nine, testosterone-filled,

99
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,939
a few blues would start breaking out, you know,

100
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,819
between the skips, as you'd call us.

101
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,319
And do you remember the principal grabbing you and me and saying,

102
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,220
hey, we need to sort this out?

103
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,560
And clearly he saw leadership in you because you were the only guy

104
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,480
that crossed over and played cricket with us guys as well as soccer.

105
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,939
But you were there as a mediator at that stage.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,399
Do you remember that?

107
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,779
I remember being a mediator.

108
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,699
I can't remember the principal pulling us aside.

109
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:30,360
I remember you and I getting together and saying, look, you know,

110
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,819
this is getting ridiculous now.

111
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,259
You know, we're fighting on the hill.

112
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:36,879
It's about 100 guys having a fight.

113
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,899
It's like, what are we fighting for?

114
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,579
Aren't we mates?

115
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:44,079
So we had to sort of calm, you know, I had to calm my group down,

116
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,519
you know, the soccer boys, and you probably calmed the, you know,

117
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:47,680
the Aussie Rules boys down.

118
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:50,540
And then I think Ladron, it was fine.

119
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,720
I can't remember after that there being any issues.

120
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,540
But, you know, it was great.

121
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,860
It was a funny era back then because it was really split, the school.

122
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,160
You know, there were, you know, you just hung around with, you know,

123
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,180
the sport that you played in and it happened to be a lot of Italians.

124
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,600
And, you know, with you it would have been, you know, the Skips,

125
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,879
as we called them, or the Aussies.

126
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,800
But, you know, we didn't, like, our friendship wasn't the same

127
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,379
as it was in primary school because we were really close.

128
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,980
But we still had a really good respect for each other.

129
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,379
So that's probably why I think, you know, the principal got us aside

130
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:24,339
because they could see that.

131
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:24,480
Yeah.

132
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:24,540
Yeah.

133
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:24,600
Yeah.

134
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:24,620
Yeah.

135
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,339
We respected each other and, you know, where we were coming from.

136
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,060
And perhaps we could sort it out.

137
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:31,040
But you always had presence, Johnny.

138
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,139
Everything about you from young age, I remember.

139
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,639
Whatever you did, you had presence.

140
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:38,459
Did you feel like you were a leader as a young guy in your community?

141
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,420
No, I didn't feel like I was a leader.

142
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,279
I just, you know, used to do things because I loved it.

143
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,420
You know, maybe that sometimes, you know, it shows a bit of presence

144
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,139
because you're really passionate about something.

145
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,220
And, you know, I remember, you know, playing soccer at school.

146
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,600
You know, now looking back.

147
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,639
I remember a lot of the players following, you know, when I was playing,

148
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:02,540
you know, what I was doing and how, you know, that they would turn to me

149
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,660
if it was a close game.

150
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:06,339
And I remember a teacher pulling me aside once.

151
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:10,480
So that's when I started to think the influence I had on my teammates was,

152
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:15,339
you know, I got sent off in a game and they weren't too happy about it.

153
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,720
And the reason why I got sent off, I lost my head.

154
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,279
And the teacher goes, you know, do you understand that what you're doing

155
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,579
isn't positive for your team?

156
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:27,620
Because they really look up to you and turn to you when, you know,

157
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,399
they go and get staffed.

158
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,459
So if you do that, they're going to lose control as well.

159
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:36,060
So that's when it sort of clicked a little bit that I was one of the leaders of that team.

160
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:39,779
And I remember, John, we talk about, you know, year four and the time capsule

161
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:44,220
and, you know, a long discussion around you wanting to be a professional sportsman.

162
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,699
I had the exact same goals.

163
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,879
But then at 15 years of age, 1991, you make your senior debut for Adelaide City

164
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,720
in the National Soccer League.

165
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,259
Incredibly strong competition at that stage.

166
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:55,800
You're just a schoolboy.

167
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:58,120
And I remember looking up thinking, my God, John's there already.

168
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,779
He's done it.

169
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:02,399
I mean, when you look back, I mean, it was an incredible effort at 15.

170
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,319
You scored eight goals in that first year.

171
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:05,279
Like you had an impact.

172
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,579
Did you think that maybe that was too young or were you ready?

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,660
No, I felt that I was ready.

174
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,379
And when you're that young, you sort of got that fearless nature about you.

175
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,920
You know, you think, well, I can conquer the world here.

176
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,620
And because I was training with these players, you know, night in, night out,

177
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,379
because at that time,

178
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:26,920
semi-professional, they would go to work in the morning,

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,980
I'd be going to school and then at night we'll be training together.

180
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,580
And I'd been training with them already at the age of 14.

181
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,320
So it wasn't like, you know, one training session and I'm thrown into the team.

182
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,720
And it was pretty ruthless back then.

183
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,360
So the senior boys, if, you know, you weren't doing the right thing,

184
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,320
they would let you know and not as nice as what we do now with the younger players.

185
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:53,899
But we had great leadership in that team as well

186
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:54,559
because we had the best players.

187
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,559
The likes of Aurelio Vidmar, a Socceroo, Milan Ivanovic, a Socceroo,

188
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,279
Alex Tobin, the captain of the Socceroos, you know, all in that side.

189
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,519
And so, you know, I was able to sort of follow them and they helped me a lot too.

190
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,379
So when I went on to the pitch, it wasn't like there was a bunch of young kids.

191
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,940
There was a lot of senior pros that actually helped me and looked after me.

192
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,480
So it was great for me.

193
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,799
It was a good learning experience.

194
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,539
I didn't stay too long because I ended up going to the Institute of Sports.

195
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:29,480
I bought after that, which was all the best young talented players from that era,

196
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,100
which, you know, Mark Viduka, Josip Skoko, Craig Moore.

197
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:34,279
So we had a pretty good group.

198
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,779
And that was a first taste of living away from home.

199
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,779
So that's when I started to realize, okay, it's not just about football.

200
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,200
It's not just about, you know, being good at your sport.

201
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,519
It's about, you know, how do you cope away from home when things aren't going well?

202
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,200
And so that matured me a lot.

203
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:54,539
You mentioned those names, Aurelio Vidmar and Alex Tobin.

204
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,700
And then you go to the Institute of Sport, Mark Viduka.

205
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,820
These are some of the greats of Australian soccer and Australian sport.

206
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,480
I mean, do you see, timing was probably great for you, really, wasn't it?

207
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,759
To come through in an era where, you know, you guys really changed the way those

208
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:12,600
who don't follow the round ball game as closely really viewed Australian soccer.

209
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,059
And a lot of you went international and went on and had great success.

210
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,860
Yeah, timing, look, it's everything.

211
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,740
But it also, you know, it's the opportunity.

212
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,840
You're there, ready for that opportunity.

213
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,120
Yeah.

214
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,139
Yeah.

215
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:24,159
Yeah.

216
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:24,259
Yeah.

217
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:24,279
Yeah.

218
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:24,299
Yeah.

219
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:24,320
Yeah.

220
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,340
Yeah.

221
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:24,360
Yeah.

222
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,379
Yeah.

223
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:24,419
Yeah.

224
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,759
You know, people had the same opportunity and probably didn't take it.

225
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,879
But, you know, I was fortunate that I, I probably at the time didn't realize, because I didn't

226
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:36,639
know Mark Viduka was going to be, you know, the superstar he was.

227
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,000
I was one of his teammates, you know, I was trying to, you know, play alongside him and

228
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,559
we're trying to win football games.

229
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,840
But with Aurelio Vidmar, Milano Vanic, Alex Tobin, I knew at that stage they were already

230
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,039
at that level playing for the Socceroos.

231
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,279
But I was involved in a club, Adelaide City, that, you know, I was involved in a club,

232
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,539
and, you know, that's where I think I was fortunate, because, you know, I took the

233
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:01,120
opportunity because I was in such a good club.

234
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,500
And you know what it's like, if you're playing and training with the best, you become better.

235
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,539
And, and so that's where, not only them, but also my brother, because my brother was

236
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:11,399
three years older than me.

237
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,279
So I always had someone there that I was striving to, to get to that level or be better or,

238
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,519
or compete with.

239
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:22,139
And, and that helps you, you know, probably progress a lot quicker than what others would

240
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,440
if they weren't training at that level.

241
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,259
I want to speak about you.

242
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:26,320
Your brother, Ross, who had an outstanding professional career.

243
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,860
I know the two of you have coached together and, and had this incredible connection over

244
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,440
many years.

245
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,039
And your dad, Rocky, is this legendary figure in your life.

246
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,700
You know, when I speak to you over, over, over the journey, Rocky's influence, you know,

247
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,980
always is a big part of, of, of what he was able to impart on you.

248
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:47,340
Can you describe, you know, the leader that your dad is and what he's been like for you

249
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:47,779
in your life?

250
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,200
Yeah, my dad, look, it's funny because he was hard.

251
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,539
He was a, he was a hard person.

252
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:57,440
And he didn't give you too many compliments, if any, growing up.

253
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,659
So it was always, you know, if, if you came home, I remember like at sports night, you

254
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:06,279
know, at, at school, you know, I came home with a few athletics trophies, a few soccer

255
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:11,639
trophies, and, you know, someone's congratulating me and, and my dad goes, yeah, that means

256
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,279
nothing, you know, and you have to work harder.

257
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:17,559
And, you know, it was always about work ethic, work ethic, work ethic.

258
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,179
And, you know, I used to see that he used to go off to work at, you know, wake up at

259
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:23,519
5.30 and, you know, he, he, he, you know, he, you know, he, you know, he, you know, he, you

260
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,740
know, him and my uncle or he and my uncle had their business, uh, uh, cabinetry business

261
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:35,019
that they built up from, you know, the seventies and, uh, and it's been going ever since.

262
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:38,799
And he's still working, still, you know, owns the business and runs the business.

263
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,940
So he's, uh, he's always been a leader from a young age.

264
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,159
And then he was coaching at a young age and then coaching us.

265
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:49,419
And, um, you know, he, he coached me and, and he said, you have to be better than the

266
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:51,340
other players or else I can't pick you.

267
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,500
So that means train hard.

268
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:53,899
Yeah.

269
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:54,799
It's like school.

270
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,940
Don't just come to training and, you know, like going to school, don't just go to school.

271
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,740
You need to go home and do your homework to get better, you know, read and, you know,

272
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,120
practice.

273
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:06,980
And that's the same with, um, with soccer, go out in the backyard, kick the ball against

274
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,259
the wall, train with your brother, um, you know, whenever you can play, play.

275
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:16,139
And so, you know, he instilled that within us, that, that work ethic, but I'll never

276
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:16,580
forget.

277
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:21,340
And he was a mad cricketer, you know, he loved cricket and played amateur cricket, you know,

278
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,259
nothing at a high level, but he took it serious.

279
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:27,600
And, uh, I remember going and watching him once and there was a grand final and, you

280
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,919
know, his team was down and out and he was a fast bowler.

281
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,059
He was a mean fast bowler.

282
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,340
He wasn't too nice actually.

283
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,100
And he didn't mind a bouncer here or there.

284
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:38,360
And they put a few people in hospital with the, the, the delivery.

285
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:39,080
Big Rocky, did he?

286
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:39,480
Yeah.

287
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,860
Cause back then they didn't wear helmets.

288
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,519
So, you know, they used to want to show you how much they were.

289
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,120
And, um, you know, his team were losing.

290
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,460
They, they, they needed a six wickets or whatever.

291
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,980
And there was only 20 runs left.

292
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,039
And, um, and the captain at the time, which was his cousin.

293
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:55,679
He said, oh, you know, let's give, uh, someone else a bowl.

294
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,460
He goes, no.

295
00:13:56,659 --> 00:14:00,080
He goes, I've been busting my gut all day in this heat.

296
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,919
He goes, I'm fighting till the end.

297
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,779
He goes, so if you're taking me off, I'm walking off the field.

298
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,379
So my dad's cousin was scared of him.

299
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,340
And, uh, my old man took a wicket, then took another one, took another one and bowled them

300
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:11,679
all out.

301
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,820
And, uh, and that lived with me because that, that, that showed that you never give up.

302
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,519
You know, you keep going right to the end.

303
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,279
And that's something that, you know, has lived with me forever.

304
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,879
You're a parent of, uh, of three beautiful daughters.

305
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,100
And, uh, I want to speak about Andrew as your childhood sweetheart, you're married

306
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,659
at 15 and your, and your own family.

307
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,600
I didn't marry at 15.

308
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,580
I was, I was with her.

309
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:29,860
Sorry.

310
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,200
Yeah.

311
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,340
You were with her from 15 and you've been married and, uh, had the three beautiful daughters

312
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,639
and traveled all around the world playing, playing soccer.

313
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,899
But you, but you look back at your dad's, your dad's influence, that influenced your

314
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:43,539
parenting style or you're a softer version of that or?

315
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,840
Um, yeah, softer version.

316
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,659
Um, but you know, also clear with the, you know, the, the way you want to bring up your

317
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:52,639
kids in, you know, the, the values that you.

318
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:58,200
You try and, you know, uh, instill in them and, uh, and what, you know, that, that, uh,

319
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,019
you know, that the respect factor and, and all that.

320
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,320
And, uh, so yeah, there's a lot of traits that, you know, from both my parents that

321
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,679
you, you try and, and, and then you, you know, you have to be your own person.

322
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,120
I'm not exactly like my old man.

323
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,340
So, um, but yeah, a lot of those things, you know, you, you feel, you know, he was, uh,

324
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,000
he was very, he was a lot stricter than what I am.

325
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:18,659
Put it that way.

326
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:22,860
He was, uh, you know, if I had a game, you know, the next day he goes, you can't, you

327
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,700
can't go to that party, you know, do, what do you want to do?

328
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,320
Do you want to focus on non-playing soccer or do you want to go to the party?

329
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,200
I'm a little bit more lenient in that way.

330
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:34,539
Do you look back and do you think that that was massive in, in your development?

331
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,500
I mean, to back you in as a, as a parent and say, you're ready to go and play, you know,

332
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,159
in the NSL as a 15 year old, he obviously had a lot of confidence in you and he was

333
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:42,799
pretty tough on you.

334
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,220
But I also remember if you felt like someone was on the wrong side of the Aloysio boys,

335
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,240
Rocky could come to school and let everyone know exactly where that stood too.

336
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:52,779
So he was, he was in your corner.

337
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:53,240
Yeah.

338
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:58,779
And I think that's a sign of, uh, good parenting and good leadership is that, you know, you're,

339
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:02,080
you're strong with an individual, but you also have to show your caring part.

340
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,580
His caring part was to show that if anyone was against us and he knew that, you know,

341
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,659
we were in the right, he would back us all the way.

342
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:14,480
And, uh, and then that was something, but yeah, you know, looking back, I can't understand

343
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,740
the playing the NSL at the age of 15, you know, he obviously, you know, felt that I

344
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,419
was good enough and, you know, that he didn't have an issue, uh, that because physically

345
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:22,860
I was, uh.

346
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:23,980
At a, at a good level.

347
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,159
Um, but allow me to go overseas and follow my dreams at the age of 16, that, that would

348
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,960
have been hard on, uh, on my parents.

349
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,679
And, uh, but you know, he saw that, you know, in my eyes, obviously that there was something

350
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:40,360
there that I was driven and I was going to make it at all costs.

351
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,240
And so he allowed me to do that because back then it's, you know, there were, uh, there

352
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,700
weren't, there was no Facebook or there was no, you know, FaceTime or there was no phone.

353
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,080
There wasn't a mobile phone, you're right.

354
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,539
So, so it was, uh, you know, call home once a week, you know, the reverse dial and, and

355
00:16:56,539 --> 00:16:57,159
all that stuff.

356
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,620
So it's, uh, yeah, looking back, I'm, I'm thankful that they allowed me to do that.

357
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,519
And, and I mentioned in the intro, Johnny, as the, as the first Australian to, to play

358
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:11,319
in the three big leagues and, you know, you, you went, played Serie A and you had a great

359
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:15,819
stint in the, in the English Premier League and a fantastic time at Osasuna in Spain.

360
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:19,079
But as you said, you're a 16 year old, your first stop was in the Netherlands, was it?

361
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,539
No, Belgium.

362
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,359
In Belgium, sorry.

363
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,019
I mean, that must, you must've had some experience.

364
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,400
Did you feel like packing it in at stages and coming home and, and what within you got

365
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:27,920
you through that?

366
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:32,140
Yeah, there were, there were definitely moments that, uh, I just wanted to come home.

367
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,279
I think that lasted probably about the first two, three years that I just.

368
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:36,460
Really?

369
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:37,880
Yeah, it was, it was tough.

370
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:38,779
It was tough.

371
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:43,059
So when I first went to Belgium, I went to Liège in the French speaking part and, you

372
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:48,039
know, not too many of the, the players spoke English or they didn't want to speak English

373
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,319
to you because you're taking a, a local spot.

374
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:50,559
Yeah.

375
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,059
Um, and then I went to the.

376
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,059
The Flemish speaking part in Antwerp, which was a little bit easier because the majority

377
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:59,960
of the people spoke English, you know, then, you know, you, you, you seem to find friends

378
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,940
outside of football, which is important because, you know, in football, you go on, who do I

379
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,539
trust here?

380
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:05,920
You know.

381
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,539
Yeah.

382
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:11,299
Who are really my mates and who are just there to, you know, fight for your place.

383
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,940
So, um, but yeah, there were, there were times, what kept me going was that I knew that to

384
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,059
play at the highest level, I need to stay in Europe and also looking back and then, you

385
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:27,319
know, speaking to, you know, people and then also my, my parents about, you know, what my

386
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:31,880
grandparents did, you know, so my grandfather, uh, and a lot of the, you know, the Italian

387
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,640
immigrants did the same, the ones that migrated to Australia, you know, my grandfather moved

388
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,579
to Australia four years before the rest of his family to, to, to, you know, have enough

389
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:41,680
money to bring them all over.

390
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,319
And I'm thinking, look, if he could do it back then, you know, because he was, for them,

391
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:47,160
it was about survival.

392
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,539
It was about building a better life.

393
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:52,039
For me, it's about, you know, I want to achieve something in the sport.

394
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:55,500
So it's, it's not too dissimilar.

395
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,380
If you really want something, you know, you deal with the hard times and, and that, that

396
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,140
got me through a lot.

397
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,859
You're a 16 or 17 though, John's young and you pick up the phone.

398
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,859
What, what happened when you rang mom or rang, you know, your dad, Rocky, what was their

399
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:08,220
advice?

400
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:09,339
Would they stick it out?

401
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:10,660
Yeah, they'll, they'll stick it out.

402
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:11,500
They'll stick it out.

403
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,859
They said, look, we'll be always here to support you.

404
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,839
If you want to come home and you badly want to come home, you know, there's, there's,

405
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,160
you know, we'll be here to support that as well.

406
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,019
But, um, you know, it was the many times that I was crying because.

407
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:24,400
You know, it was like, I just don't know if I can do this.

408
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,460
And, but, uh, my brother was good.

409
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:30,039
My brother helped me because at that time, my brother had already been overseas and then

410
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:30,819
come back to Australia.

411
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:35,500
He said, do you really want to come back and work and play semi-professional football?

412
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,359
Or do you want to stay over there and play professional football?

413
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:42,359
So, you know, he, he, uh, he gave me pretty good advice.

414
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,819
He goes, don't come back.

415
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,119
So Ross was strong.

416
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:45,640
Yeah.

417
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,640
He goes, stick it out.

418
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,759
Was there some regret for him that maybe it didn't quite work out?

419
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:50,440
He played professional.

420
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:50,680
Yeah.

421
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:52,019
He ended up going back overseas.

422
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:54,980
But there was regret that he came back too early.

423
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,579
He should have stuck it out, you know, as much, as long as possible because, you know,

424
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,099
but then after that, he's, you know, things work out anyway.

425
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:06,220
But, uh, at that time he was, he didn't really want to be back in Australia playing.

426
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,140
John, I don't think you would have had a conversation, uh, since this moment where it hasn't been

427
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,720
brought up and it's defined your life.

428
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,319
Not a bad thing to define your life, John.

429
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,700
I wonder how many times you've actually heard and seen, I assume you don't get bored of

430
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:18,839
it.

431
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:22,019
And I said in the intro, the, uh, the Sport Australia Hall of Fame.

432
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:26,680
Voted this moment as one of the three greatest moments in Australian sporting history.

433
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,859
You clearly know what I'm about to do.

434
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,500
16th of November, 2005, Australia versus Uruguay.

435
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:36,079
How many times have you, have you seen it before I play it back to you, Johnny?

436
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,420
I wake up to it every morning, Dax.

437
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:41,240
Good way to start your day, mate.

438
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:46,119
Is it, is it the thing that everyone wants to talk to you about the most more than anything?

439
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:46,720
It is.

440
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,579
Uh, in Australia it is definitely.

441
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:50,980
Um, you know, if I go back to Spain, it's something else.

442
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,500
You know, if I'm in England, it will be, you know, it will vex the teams that I play

443
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:54,660
for.

444
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,279
It'll be something else.

445
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,779
But in Australia, it definitely is.

446
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:02,359
And, and the thing is, uh, what I love about it and, you know, it, it take away that, you

447
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:07,019
know, I live the moment is where people were and people always want to bring up, you see,

448
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:11,460
you know, where I was in that, that I was in a pub or I was here and I was at the stadium

449
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,920
and I was hiding behind a pole and, you know, strangers are hugging me.

450
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,940
And have I told you where I was?

451
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,799
Cause it's one of those moments where everyone, so I did my knee at the start of 2000.

452
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,680
And five, uh, season.

453
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:25,599
So I was just, uh, named captain of the board, did my knee.

454
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,460
So I'm feeling pretty down and I'm downstairs on the couch and, and Beck was asleep upstairs

455
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,960
and, you know, just had the surgery.

456
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,480
So keep the knees steady.

457
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,640
Don't, you know, move it.

458
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:35,819
Yeah.

459
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:36,799
The grass got a stick.

460
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,779
And then you scored the goal and I leapt off the couch and screamed because I thought I'd

461
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:42,140
ripped it.

462
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:42,539
Yeah.

463
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,279
Beck comes running down.

464
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,480
I'm like, Johnny scored the goal.

465
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,180
He's got us into the world cup.

466
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:56,869
You went into that huddle at that moment.

467
00:21:56,869 --> 00:21:59,230
And said, I'm going to take the last kick.

468
00:21:59,349 --> 00:22:02,690
So you're either the hero or, or zero effectively.

469
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:08,210
What in you had that ability to back yourself in and trust yourself to take that moment?

470
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:13,549
There were moments in my career that, uh, that I used to tell myself that this was going

471
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:14,049
to happen.

472
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:18,710
It was, uh, you know, that like when I was younger, that I was going to become a professional

473
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:23,930
footballer or, you know, that I was going to play in the Serie A or, or, and, uh, and

474
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,849
for, uh, I had a lot of setbacks with the national team.

475
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:30,930
That, you know, I didn't always play or, you know, the previous world cup campaign against

476
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:31,569
Uruguay.

477
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:35,150
Um, I played about five minutes and that was in 2001.

478
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:40,130
And I remember after that, you know, I was, I was so down that I was, I thought, you know,

479
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:42,369
I don't really want to play for the national team again.

480
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,049
And, uh, and then, you know, give it a couple.

481
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:45,690
That's unheard of.

482
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:49,349
You know, many people would say we always see the glory at the end, but you were that

483
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:49,869
low after 2001.

484
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:50,970
Yeah.

485
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,450
You thought not for, not for you maybe.

486
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:52,809
Yeah.

487
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:56,849
Because I was, I was part of it, but you know, when you're not really playing a big,

488
00:22:56,869 --> 00:23:01,369
you start to go, it weighs you down after a while because you're traveling here, there

489
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:01,750
and everywhere.

490
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:02,750
You're not always playing.

491
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:09,109
And then, and then I thought, you know, no, um, I really, I really believe that I can

492
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:10,750
do something special with the national team.

493
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,029
And, uh, and so, uh, you know, I was saying that the next four years I need to be playing

494
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:18,930
at the highest level possible, the best, you know, that, that I've played.

495
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:22,869
So then I, um, the next qualifying campaign, I'll play a big part.

496
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,650
Um, and what gave me a bit of confidence was the Confederations Cup leading

497
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,210
into this.

498
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:31,529
I was, uh, you know, the second leading goal scorer that we, you know, along with, uh,

499
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:35,710
Balak, who was a German international that, uh, so it was in the tournament that we played

500
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,710
in Germany where the World Cup was going to be held.

501
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:42,349
And we had, uh, Germany in our group scored a couple of goals against them, had Argentina

502
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:44,069
in our group scored a couple of goals against them.

503
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:45,849
So I scored four in this, this tournament.

504
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,430
Against the Germans and the Argentinians.

505
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,230
That gives you some confidence.

506
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,450
Yeah.

507
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,269
So I'm feeling confident.

508
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:54,910
After that, I said, I used to say to my family and, uh, and Angela, my wife, you know, on

509
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,910
nearly a daily basis.

510
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:59,710
Oh, I'm going to score the winning goal to take Australia to the World Cup.

511
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:02,670
And they used to just go, all right, all right, good, good on you.

512
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,250
You know, all right, leave us alone.

513
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:10,170
Stop talking about yourself because I don't know if I did it also subconsciously to get

514
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:14,130
myself to believe it and say it out loud as often as possible.

515
00:24:14,349 --> 00:24:15,769
So it was, it was going to happen.

516
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:17,190
It's brilliant, Johnny, isn't it?

517
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:22,289
And it seems to me that has been your ability to manifest what you want has been a real

518
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:22,849
skill of yours.

519
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:23,089
Yeah.

520
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:25,890
So you're half doing that, convincing yourself.

521
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:31,210
So when that moment arrives, did you know that you were going to ask for the last kick?

522
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:38,109
Well, I didn't know because I didn't know that, uh, look, I thought that the day before

523
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:42,910
we were, we practiced the penalty each and whatever else and, uh, you know, in training

524
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:47,569
and, and, um, and then we, we stayed behind a couple of us, you know, myself, Lucas Neal

525
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:51,970
and, and I hit it, you know, five penalties, all the same corner down that end actually.

526
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:55,750
And, uh, cause I felt that was where our main supporters are going to be.

527
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:55,829
Yeah.

528
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,170
That's where we're going to take the penalties.

529
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,289
And Lucas turned to me, he goes, why are you taking it all the same side?

530
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:01,769
And I said, well, I'm on the bench.

531
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:05,230
You know, if I come on, I'm only going to get one opportunity, you know, probably be

532
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,750
in a penalty shootout or something like that.

533
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,410
But I actually believed I was going to score a normal time because I came on with about

534
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,329
half hour to go.

535
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,650
And I just felt that it's going to happen.

536
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:14,289
It's going to happen.

537
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:14,930
It's going to happen.

538
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:20,470
And then, um, Graham Arnold, who was the assistant coach at the time to Gus Hitting, um, you know,

539
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:23,049
we got into the group and he said, uh, he wants to take a penalty.

540
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:23,970
I said, yeah, I do.

541
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,690
And he said, okay, you go number one.

542
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,970
I said, no, no, put me number five.

543
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:30,529
And then as soon as, uh, he said, okay, I just walked off.

544
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,250
Yeah.

545
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,690
So I didn't know who else was taking a penalty.

546
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:34,930
I had no idea, you know, who was taking a penalty.

547
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:39,670
I just walked off and then just got into this zone of, uh, just, you know, concentrating,

548
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,529
focusing on what I was doing the day before.

549
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:41,990
Yeah.

550
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:42,289
Yeah.

551
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,569
And so you knew then top right corner at that stage.

552
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,089
No, no, nothing else.

553
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:46,829
I wasn't going to hesitate.

554
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:47,849
That, that, that was it.

555
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:49,009
That was my strongest side.

556
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:50,089
I felt really comfortable.

557
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:55,509
I, I hit them all really well the day before, you know, so I knew when I was putting down

558
00:25:55,509 --> 00:25:55,670
the,

559
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,130
the ball and where I was lining up.

560
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,009
So I'd come just to the edge of the 18.

561
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,829
I would line up with the, the, the post on our, my right hand side.

562
00:26:03,349 --> 00:26:05,309
Um, then I'll just focus on the ball.

563
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,049
I wasn't looking at the goalkeeper at all.

564
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:09,490
Just focusing on the ball and just focusing on the connection.

565
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:09,970
Really.

566
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:11,089
That was all it was about.

567
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,750
And so can you remember when you say that to, to Graham Arnold, the assistant coach,

568
00:26:15,829 --> 00:26:18,150
take me number five, is there any glance around from there?

569
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,029
It's probably a bit of relief from some of the other players.

570
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,049
I mean, not many want to do that, do they?

571
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:22,349
No.

572
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,410
Well, I don't look number five.

573
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,289
It doesn't.

574
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:25,650
Sometimes.

575
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,910
It might mean you're not going to take a penalty, but I just had that feel that was

576
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:32,650
going to be the penalty that would, you know, and it wasn't a person.

577
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:34,630
It wasn't just, I wanted to be the hero.

578
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:34,950
Nah.

579
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,190
You know, it's like, I just felt that was the right thing.

580
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,950
You know, that, that was the right, you know, yeah.

581
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:44,690
And, um, because, you know, then Harry Kuehl was different.

582
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:49,329
He thought number one was his spot because that was to get off to a good start, you know,

583
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:51,549
and, uh, because he felt that he was going to score.

584
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:55,109
So if we got off to a good start, normally you go win the penalty shootout.

585
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:59,730
But I remember it like, a lot of us didn't know who was taking penalties and a lot of

586
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:03,569
players didn't want to take a penalty because they were tired, you know, the flight from

587
00:27:03,569 --> 00:27:09,269
Uruguay, 120 minutes, um, a lot of them were fatigued, you know, so it was, it was one

588
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:12,190
of those moments that I think only five of us said that they'll take a penalty.

589
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,769
Can I, is that commonplace that, is that the way it works normally, John, in a penalty

590
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:16,289
situation?

591
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:20,269
It's, it's put your hand up or does the coach sort of go, Hey, you know what?

592
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:23,529
You're our striker, John, you're taking one, Harry Kuehl, you're taking one.

593
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,049
I mean, is it?

594
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:24,329
Yeah.

595
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,089
A lot of different coaches.

596
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:28,490
A lot of different coaches have different approaches to it that, um, you know, I've

597
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:32,430
had coaches before that will, you know, have on the sheet, which ones they want to take

598
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:32,789
a penalty.

599
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:37,630
Um, but then you have to see, you know, how a game's going, how a player's feeling, you

600
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:41,349
know, if he's confident, if he's feeling, and I think it's a good thing to ask the player,

601
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,049
you know, do you feel up to taking a penalty?

602
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:47,549
And, and normally the player, you can see in their, their response, whether it's, yep,

603
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,589
no problem, put me in, or yeah, yeah, okay.

604
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:54,589
So you, you sort of know that, you know, because I've been,

605
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:58,990
on the other side, coaching in a penalty shootout, so you sort of have a, a bit of

606
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:03,910
a sense who the stronger penalty takers, um, but it was, it, we were at the halfway line

607
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,710
and, you know, we had our arms around each other and, and I turned to, to Lucas and I

608
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,569
said, are you taking a penalty?

609
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,809
He goes, yeah, yeah, I'm taking a penalty.

610
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:10,849
And he said, are you?

611
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,170
And I said, yeah, I'm number five.

612
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:15,009
And, and then I said, oh, you know, hero or villain.

613
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:18,049
And, uh, and just had a bit of a chuckle and he was looking at me and he was chuckling

614
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:18,529
himself.

615
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:21,970
We're trying to remain calm in a tense, you know, situation.

616
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,670
Great celebration too, mate.

617
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:25,089
It just, it makes you smile.

618
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:27,109
I mean, you're, you're pretty conservative.

619
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:28,970
I would describe you as Johnny.

620
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:33,029
Like you, you, you don't, uh, but that was just unbridled joy, wasn't it?

621
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:35,829
I mean, you couldn't, you couldn't have manufactured that if you tried.

622
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:42,650
No, that's years of, uh, you know, of wanting and hoping and praying you're going to go

623
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,369
to the biggest tournament in the world.

624
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:50,829
And, uh, and all the relief, not only with, uh, you know, on, with me or with the group

625
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,150
of players that were playing with, with the whole Australian football community, because

626
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,089
it's been, it was 32.

627
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:59,150
So we hadn't qualified for a world cup and I'd watched the heartache and I'd been involved

628
00:28:59,150 --> 00:28:59,750
in the heartache.

629
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,190
So there was all that emotion coming out.

630
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,990
Um, it's hard not to get emotional when there's, you know, 80 plus thousand people there screaming,

631
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,930
um, knowing what it means to everyone.

632
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:15,750
And, um, and look, the, the taking off the top wasn't planned, but the running in where

633
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:20,869
I stopped was that because I asked the day before our team manager, Gary Moretti, who's

634
00:29:20,869 --> 00:29:23,769
another Adelaide boy, um, where our family's sitting.

635
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:25,089
And, uh, and he said, oh, they're sitting.

636
00:29:25,089 --> 00:29:25,589
They're sitting over there.

637
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:28,269
And I said, oh, I just want to know where I have to run to when I score the winning

638
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:28,630
goal.

639
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:29,410
Did you say that?

640
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:29,910
Yeah, I did.

641
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,849
You know, sometimes you, you, you look back and go, gee, you're full of yourself, but

642
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:39,890
it's, it's one of those things that you, you're doing it because you're again, getting yourself

643
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,150
to believe that it's going to happen.

644
00:29:41,829 --> 00:29:43,410
Um, and it's not being big headed.

645
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:44,069
I didn't want, um.

646
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,029
You're the opposite of that, mate.

647
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:46,890
You don't even have to.

648
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:51,150
I mean, the humility comes out in everything you do, but I'm fascinated, John.

649
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,609
For me, this is your superpower.

650
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:55,069
And, and that's why I started with that story from year four.

651
00:29:55,089 --> 00:29:57,309
Because I've spoken about it a lot.

652
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,289
Does that come up in other areas of your life?

653
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:03,049
I think people listening to this podcast will say at the moment you're coaching West

654
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:07,569
United, I know you've got great ambitions with your managing and, and senior coaching.

655
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:12,450
Do you apply that in other areas of your life now where you're really talking to yourself

656
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,390
and manifesting what you want your life to be?

657
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,150
Yeah, I do.

658
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,349
And, and look with this, you know, you, you, you're manifesting, you're manifesting, but

659
00:30:19,349 --> 00:30:21,509
you also have a lot of setbacks during it.

660
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:23,890
You know, there's a, it doesn't just happen all the time.

661
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,009
You know, there's, there's a lot of.

662
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:30,009
You know, a lot of people see this moment and go, oh, you know, you're lucky to be in

663
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:30,349
this moment.

664
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,549
Yes, I was lucky, but you know, there was a lot of setbacks before that.

665
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,049
There was a lot of heartache before it.

666
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:36,029
There's a lot of injuries.

667
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:41,710
There was a lot of, uh, you know, times that I was, uh, you know, not playing or on the

668
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,349
bench and not getting that opportunity.

669
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:48,509
So, you know, that can get you down, but always in the back of my head is that, you know,

670
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:49,730
my old man, don't give up.

671
00:30:49,829 --> 00:30:51,029
Just keep going for it.

672
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:54,990
Keep going for what you believe you're going to achieve and what you want to achieve out

673
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:55,269
of it.

674
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:56,769
And so it's the same in coaching.

675
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:01,089
I've had, you know, a lot of, uh, situations that, you know, hasn't gone my way or, you

676
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:04,670
know, you can class it as failure, but I don't see it as failure.

677
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:07,109
I see it as a step, you know, in the right direction.

678
00:31:07,109 --> 00:31:11,569
You know, even if we're not getting the results, you learn from it, the experiences, but I

679
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:12,829
do apply it still today.

680
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:18,910
I applied it a lot when I, um, had heart surgery two years ago, because that was probably the

681
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,950
scariest thing that I've ever had to do.

682
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,210
Yeah.

683
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:24,910
And, and, and when I sat there and, um, no one that had.

684
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:28,250
They have open heart surgery was like, well, how do I get through this?

685
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:32,250
Because, you know, a lot of negative thoughts are coming into your head and, and it was,

686
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:36,829
you know, so I wrote down on a, uh, a piece of paper that, um, you know, what I wanted

687
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:39,150
to come out of it, like how I wanted to come out of it.

688
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:42,890
So, you know, I was, I was thanking the surgeon, you know, Bruce garlic, Dr.

689
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:43,390
Bruce garlic.

690
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:47,549
So, you know, I wrote down a piece of paper, you know, I'd like to thank that Dr.

691
00:31:47,549 --> 00:31:51,130
Bruce garlic for, you know, successful surgery of my mitral valve.

692
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:53,970
And then, you know, I'd like to thank this.

693
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:54,829
And I, and, and.

694
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:59,069
This and, you know, and, and so I wrote about five different things down then, and I read

695
00:31:59,069 --> 00:32:03,210
it, read it, you know, constantly the, during the day, I just kept on reading it, reading

696
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:03,769
it, reading it.

697
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:09,269
Um, so I was trying to manifest that it was, I was already fit, you know, from it, but

698
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:14,130
I was going into surgery, you know, within a week, um, because I was just trying to calm

699
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,650
my nerves down because it was, it was a nervous time.

700
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:18,230
Just shows how powerful, isn't it?

701
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:22,630
Your mind is and how that can, as we know, and all the studies tell you that it affects

702
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,029
your nervous system and your physiology.

703
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,269
Yeah.

704
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:25,890
And how you physically respond, isn't it?

705
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:30,069
And, and, uh, that great school that you've got for those that don't quite know that story.

706
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:32,549
Uh, you're a healthy guy, fit as always.

707
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:35,690
You, you couldn't be more healthy and you start, you know, feeling the shortness of

708
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:39,529
breath and you being you, John, you're, you're busy and you're coaching and normally you'd

709
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:43,569
probably just push through that, but, uh, you know, tear in the, in the heart, it's

710
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:46,930
like tearing a muscle effectively, but it's the heart and really a time bomb.

711
00:32:47,109 --> 00:32:50,809
I mean, there's a big chance your heart starts getting inflamed.

712
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:54,250
I mean, without getting that checkup, it could have been all over for you.

713
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:55,410
It was very serious, wasn't it?

714
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,269
Yeah, it was very serious.

715
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,190
So I was leaking 50% of the blood through that mitral valve.

716
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:05,130
Um, and, and, and my heart had expanded because I didn't know that I had, uh, had a tear in

717
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:05,329
there.

718
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,769
Um, I was getting shortness of breath, but I just thought, you know, I'm training hard.

719
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:10,690
I'm a little bit unfit at the moment.

720
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:15,150
Um, but then I, I started to feel my heart just pounding at times when I was sitting

721
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:15,789
on the couch.

722
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:19,309
And so I was like, well, that's not quite normal.

723
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:21,789
And, um, and Angela said, just go get a checkup.

724
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:23,630
You know, what's the harm in getting a checkup?

725
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,029
You know?

726
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:27,750
The alpha male doesn't really like to go to the doctor and get a checkup too often.

727
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:31,970
So, you know, she pushed me and then I said, okay, I'll go get a checkup.

728
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:36,970
And, and, um, you know, as soon as I did that, they sent me straight to the cardiologist.

729
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:42,170
And when they had the scan, they said, you know, you need to go into surgery next week.

730
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,849
And so, you know, it was, it was pretty serious.

731
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,269
They, they said that they asked me all these questions.

732
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:48,130
Have you had a heart attack?

733
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,970
I said, I don't know if I had a heart attack.

734
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:53,589
And, uh, I don't feel too bad.

735
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:53,789
Yeah.

736
00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:54,250
I didn't feel bad.

737
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:54,890
I didn't feel that bad.

738
00:33:55,289 --> 00:33:59,130
But, uh, they said it's, it's serious, you know, that you, you could have been working

739
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,170
out and just dropped.

740
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,490
So, you know, luckily that, uh, they found it in time.

741
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:07,190
And then once again, your, your positive mindset, uh, in the healing process.

742
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,710
And I was caught up with you recently, John, you were talking about, as always, you know,

743
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:14,070
your father with, with the three daughters and your, you know, your beautiful wife, Angela.

744
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,869
But it was when you rang your dad, Rocky, that, you know, the emotions really just over,

745
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:18,530
overtook you.

746
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:18,750
Is that?

747
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:19,010
Yeah.

748
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:19,929
You tell us that story.

749
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:23,610
Yeah, that was, uh, so I went to the cardiologist then by myself.

750
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:27,769
Uh, Angela knew that, uh, I was going, but, uh, I said, don't worry about coming or, you

751
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:29,230
know, it's, it's not a major issue.

752
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:29,869
I'll be fine.

753
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:33,150
And then, you know, uh, once I walked out of there, I was going, well, shit, how do

754
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,710
I explain to her what, uh, what's going to happen?

755
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:40,329
So I ring her up and, and she's crying, but I'm, I'm feeling strong, you know, don't worry.

756
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,010
This will happen.

757
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,429
We'll do our research.

758
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:48,150
We'll, we'll ring people that we know and, you know, made of ours, Tim Sligar, um, who

759
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:53,590
knows a lot of surgeons here in Melbourne, um, you know, through, uh, years of experience,

760
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:58,550
uh, you know, rang him and, and found out, you know, just find out I've got this issue.

761
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,230
Is this the best procedure?

762
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:03,550
So you, you start to do all your research and then make sure you're doing, you know,

763
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,349
all the right things.

764
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:09,090
Then, um, I go to pick up, well, first of all, then I ring my mom.

765
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,469
My mom's crying, but I'm still strong and I'm, I'm going to pick up the girls and I'm

766
00:35:13,469 --> 00:35:16,369
thinking, okay, I'll, I'll ring my dad before I pick up the girls.

767
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:22,250
And, um, you know, I just let my guard down and just burst into tears and, and, and that's

768
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,530
when he was strong for me.

769
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:29,309
And, um, then I realized after he was a mess, you know, when he wasn't speaking to me.

770
00:35:29,309 --> 00:35:34,769
So then when I picked up the girls, uh, again, you know, it was back into the father mode.

771
00:35:34,989 --> 00:35:36,530
Don't worry girls, it's not major.

772
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:40,789
It's just, you know, I have to go in and have this surgery and, and your dad will be fine.

773
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:46,329
And, and so they, they felt, you know, uh, comfort in that, that I was feeling positive

774
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:49,110
about it until, you know, they saw me after surgery.

775
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:53,449
They, we didn't realize it was this, you know, and, you know, my girl was 16.

776
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:53,590
16.

777
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:53,610
16.

778
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:58,030
17 at the time, you know, but they, they just felt that I was confident and positive

779
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,110
about the whole situation.

780
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,630
So they felt at ease.

781
00:36:00,949 --> 00:36:05,250
Speaking of the girl, I love asking this question, uh, Johnny, on, on this, uh, empowering leaders

782
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:09,130
podcast, people like you I've known from a young age and other people around who've had

783
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:13,769
successful and busy lives and, and, and balancing that with family life and your values are

784
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:18,389
so strong and, you know, incredible relationship that you've got with Angela, but you have

785
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:22,210
moved all around the world from a young age and you've taken the kids in and out of different

786
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,510
schools at various times.

787
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,150
How challenging has that been to get that right?

788
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:30,750
Yeah, it's been, uh, challenging, but it's also been great because you've been able to

789
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,070
spend quality time.

790
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,809
Look, when you're coaching, it's, it's hard to spend real quality time all the time with

791
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:39,090
your kids because, you know, it's, it's a virtually 24 seven job.

792
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:43,650
Um, and, and then I noticed that at the start, you know, when I was playing, it was a little

793
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,710
bit different because you, you're recovering from training or whatever.

794
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,929
So you still go home and spend, you know, good time with the girls.

795
00:36:49,929 --> 00:36:53,489
But when you're away from your immediate family, you know, a lot of times, you know, you're

796
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:58,210
out of your values that you're, you know, uh, you have within your family circle that

797
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,630
the, you know, a lot of other people aren't interfering because, you know, you're able

798
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,530
to sort of control the environment a lot more.

799
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:09,489
Um, and we become closer from that, you know, because, you know, we're not just, uh, leaving

800
00:37:09,489 --> 00:37:14,269
the kids at my, my parents for, you know, the weekend or not leaving it with my, my

801
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:16,530
brothers or sisters or whatever it is.

802
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,170
So, you know, that, that, that side of it's been good at times.

803
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:23,389
It was really tough on Angela because, you know, she's having to travel with three kids,

804
00:37:23,489 --> 00:37:28,030
by herself all the way back to Australia, you know, the, the ages of four, three and

805
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:31,230
six months, you know, that, that, that, that side in itself is tough.

806
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:37,650
Um, but you know, if, if you want to be successful in anything, you need a supportive partner

807
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:43,050
or, you know, or you, you have to be, you know, understanding of each other's, uh, situation.

808
00:37:43,269 --> 00:37:48,369
So, uh, it's been tough, but it's been, you know, I think good because, you know, the

809
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:53,429
girls are able to see close up, you know, the highs and lows of, of sport and then that

810
00:37:53,429 --> 00:37:57,769
also, you know, is, is, uh, you know, the highs and lows of life, really, you know,

811
00:37:57,769 --> 00:37:59,289
you're going to have your ups and downs in life.

812
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:03,630
And experience great cultures and lived in Spain and live around the world and, uh, you

813
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,590
know, amazing, uh, you know, girls that, that, that they are.

814
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:11,190
Um, you're now a manager, you have been, you had successful stints with Melbourne Heart

815
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:16,090
and, and Brisbane Raw who took to the finals regularly and now Western United is your current

816
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:16,309
role.

817
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:19,389
So you're managing lots of people, you're leading lots of people.

818
00:38:19,909 --> 00:38:22,130
How would you describe, what sort of leader are you at the moment, Johnny?

819
00:38:22,949 --> 00:38:23,269
Um.

820
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:27,349
You look, you're always evolving and you're always learning from your experiences.

821
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:33,170
I think that the biggest thing that I like to, you know, have with the playing group

822
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:35,210
and the people around is having a connection with them.

823
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,110
And we all want the same thing.

824
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:41,289
We, we want to be successful, yes, but, you know, to be successful, you're looking at

825
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:42,409
improving every day.

826
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:46,630
And, and that's what, you know, the, the, the thing that I say to the players the most

827
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:50,969
is that, you know, as individuals, we're looking to improve and as a collective, we're looking

828
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:51,570
to improve.

829
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,510
Um.

830
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:59,210
And, and so you, you, and I have my key values, uh, that, you know, and those behavior guidelines

831
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:04,409
that, you know, the players, you know, the, they need a little bit of, uh, you know, a

832
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:08,929
guideline or else, you know, once they, if they, if they step over the mark, then they

833
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:12,610
need someone to pull them back in and, and they don't mind that, I, I believe.

834
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:12,789
Yeah.

835
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:18,210
So, um, and, and they drive that a lot themselves, you know, I, I'm not a big, uh, fan of, you

836
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:22,349
know, fines or, you know, if someone turns up late, you fine them or whatever else, but

837
00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:26,610
the playing group came to me, the, you know, the leaders and said, look, we'd like, within

838
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:29,349
your behavior guidelines, we'd like to create a fine system.

839
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,530
I said, no problem.

840
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,010
Do you guys, you know, run that?

841
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:37,590
Um, and then if, uh, if the player does consistently get fined and whatever, I said, just send

842
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:40,170
them to me to explain why they're not doing the right thing.

843
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:45,610
Because, uh, if you lose the trust of the group, then, you know, the, the players, uh,

844
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,090
don't trust them when they're on the pitch.

845
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:47,389
Yeah.

846
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,070
And, uh, so I'm a big believer in that.

847
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:52,329
So the discipline off the pitch, you know, is the same as the discipline on.

848
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,090
The pitch, you know, you're playing to a structure.

849
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:58,030
So I'm the believer in structure on and off the pitch.

850
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:02,309
And then that's really important within a group of, uh, of men really.

851
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:02,670
Yeah.

852
00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:03,010
Yep.

853
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,550
And managing the different personalities, different age groups.

854
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:10,190
You're dealing with, uh, a whole range of, uh, of, of ages now that you millennials and,

855
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:14,570
you know, who, you know, quite different to us, John, I mean, you were such dedicated,

856
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,969
naturally talented, but your work ethic was really strong from a young age.

857
00:40:17,969 --> 00:40:22,130
How do you go coaching and leading someone that it didn't come?

858
00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:26,909
Maybe as easy as it did to, you're not saying that it came easy to you, but are they a harder

859
00:40:26,909 --> 00:40:32,590
bracket for you to coach in this generation or, um, they're all different, you know, someone

860
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,929
told me that at the start, you know, I've treated them all the same.

861
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,110
That's, that's not true.

862
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,710
You, you know, it's even like your kids, you can't treat them all the same.

863
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,030
They're all different human beings.

864
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:42,010
So it's the same with a playing group.

865
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:47,190
You know, you have players that work and work hard and, uh, and you know, they're the, they're

866
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:51,389
the players that are easier to coach because you know, that as soon as you put on a session,

867
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:52,329
they're going to work at a level.

868
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:58,590
The ones that are more talented, um, that, uh, you know, sometimes you need to, you know,

869
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,150
try and get the best out of them.

870
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:05,030
You know, you might have to put a rule in training that, uh, you know, so it's a competitive

871
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,510
sort of training session.

872
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:11,030
And so, you know, you try and do that, that all together that, you know, well, I know

873
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:15,710
this guy's going to work, but this guy needs, you know, he needs to make it a game situation

874
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,570
for him to actually work to that level.

875
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:22,250
And, uh, and so, you know, without pushing him, you know, you can sort of,

876
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:24,389
create certain rules within your training.

877
00:41:24,989 --> 00:41:29,570
Um, and then, you know, there's certain players that you, you connect with on a personal level

878
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:34,050
and there's other players that you might not, but you've got other staff members that will.

879
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:38,130
Um, and, and I think it's important that, you know, you have that connection within

880
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:42,170
the whole group, but it might not be necessarily that the head coach or the manager that's

881
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:46,170
always, you know, uh, got that closeness to a certain individual.

882
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:51,550
Um, and you know, we've got, we've got the, uh, the interesting part that we've got like

883
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,309
a lot of players.

884
00:41:52,329 --> 00:41:57,050
Foreign players, you know, so we've got, you know, five foreigners in our team, Japanese,

885
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:03,849
uh, Slovenian, uh, Serbian, Swiss, Serbian, uh, Swiss guy, and then also an Italian.

886
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:07,869
But then within that, you've got different backgrounds from the Australian, you know,

887
00:42:07,949 --> 00:42:12,070
so you've got the Croatian, you got Serbian, you got Macedonian, you got a Greek, you got

888
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:12,530
an Italian.

889
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:18,789
So, you know, all these cultures together, it's quite difficult to find, you know, how

890
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:21,630
do you actually, you know, relate to all of them?

891
00:42:22,329 --> 00:42:27,389
Um, so I think the biggest thing is that, that respect, uh, factor, if you can, you

892
00:42:27,389 --> 00:42:32,170
know, drive that every day, then players will, you know, follow, I believe.

893
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:33,710
It is the United Nations, isn't it?

894
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,050
It is.

895
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:37,909
When you think of your role and, and as you said, cultural, uh, differences and then trying

896
00:42:37,909 --> 00:42:42,030
to, uh, to, uh, to get everyone to sort of, um, you know, get on the same page.

897
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:45,670
But I think what comes out always with you, John, is your values are so strong and the

898
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,670
respect is so strong.

899
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:51,030
John, we've been identifying with, uh, this group of leaders through the work I'm doing

900
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,269
with my, my great friend, Matt.

901
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:56,550
What a wits at, at a leader, these similar characteristics we think that make great

902
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:56,929
leadership.

903
00:42:56,929 --> 00:43:00,789
And so I've been asking a range of leaders, which I've really been enjoying and seeing

904
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:01,769
where the common traits sit.

905
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:05,289
So I'm going to fire a few questions at you, dimensions of what we think a great leadership

906
00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:07,409
and starting with self-leadership.

907
00:43:07,409 --> 00:43:10,230
When I pose that to you, what does self-leadership mean?

908
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:16,530
Uh, I think self-leadership is that if you've got certain values that you're, you're driving

909
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:20,150
that every day, then, and that means that, so if I'm saying that, uh, you know, I want

910
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,409
everyone to turn up on time.

911
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:22,210
It's a success.

912
00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:22,909
It's a simple thing.

913
00:43:23,449 --> 00:43:24,710
I, I have to turn up on time.

914
00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:29,369
I, I can't be turning up late or if, you know, if I'm saying to the, you know, the, the players

915
00:43:29,369 --> 00:43:34,170
to prepare properly for a, a training session, I have to make sure that I'm prepared for

916
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,250
a training session, you know?

917
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:39,230
So all those little things that the, you know, I, I think that's self-leadership.

918
00:43:39,289 --> 00:43:45,570
I think that's, you know, showing that, um, you know, by example that, um, I find that

919
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:50,969
easier anyway, but, uh, I think that, that there, then the players see it and they follow

920
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:51,090
it.

921
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:51,809
Not only players.

922
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:52,670
You're coaching staff.

923
00:43:52,929 --> 00:43:57,809
So if they see that I'm at work, uh, early and I'm, I'm leaving late, I'm not saying

924
00:43:57,809 --> 00:44:01,889
that, you know, you don't work at home or whatever, but they go, well, they don't leave.

925
00:44:01,929 --> 00:44:03,510
They, they stay and they do work.

926
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:07,110
And, you know, so I believe that's what self-leadership is really.

927
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:09,789
Setting the example and, uh, and it makes sense to them.

928
00:44:09,809 --> 00:44:13,849
I always found that in, in, in sport or in life is that once you actually start speaking

929
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:16,889
up as a player, you then got to own those values, don't you?

930
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:20,690
And I found a lot of players are reluctant to do that because it exposed them then have

931
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:21,329
to be accountable.

932
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:21,530
Yeah.

933
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,449
For their behaviors.

934
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,269
And I'm not surprised that that comes out really strongly in you.

935
00:44:25,369 --> 00:44:31,090
We think about leaders in this next generation, John, really thinking about how they positively

936
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:33,309
impact others in their environment.

937
00:44:33,489 --> 00:44:35,909
How do you go about positively impacting others?

938
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,690
Um, no, that's a good question.

939
00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:45,630
I think that, uh, look, you can show, you know, uh, the positive look, I like to, to

940
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,269
be positive most of the time anyway, with, with the playing group.

941
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:51,449
So you, you, you're trying to reinforce what you're.

942
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:55,329
Playing structure is, so you're trying to show them the positive moments because very

943
00:44:55,329 --> 00:44:59,269
easy to pick up negatives, but, uh, you know, the, the player then starts to get a little

944
00:44:59,269 --> 00:45:03,809
bit, you know, the, seeing a negative, uh, moment in, in training or in a game or, or

945
00:45:03,809 --> 00:45:06,449
whatever, and they, they start to self doubt themselves.

946
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:11,449
So if you had a percentage on, on that, are you trying to be, you know, 70% positive highlights,

947
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:14,630
30% areas to improve, or is it not as structured as that?

948
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:15,690
Oh, it's not as structured as that.

949
00:45:15,769 --> 00:45:21,409
It's just that, uh, it, it, it more or less that, um, you know, sometimes you will show,

950
00:45:21,409 --> 00:45:28,250
uh, a negative, but that's only because the player, um, hasn't, if a player miscontrols

951
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:33,510
a ball, I don't care, you know, if he, if he misses a chance, but he's trying to do

952
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,690
the right things, I don't care.

953
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:40,750
But if a player stops trying, that's, that's a negative that I'll show because, you know,

954
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:45,869
that, that I, I don't like, and I, and the group for us to be successful, we, we, you

955
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:50,030
know, you make a mistake, doesn't matter, you know, so let, let, let's, you know, fight

956
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:51,170
even harder for the next ball.

957
00:45:51,409 --> 00:45:53,190
Or, or don't shy away from it.

958
00:45:53,309 --> 00:45:55,349
And, and, you know, it's all about being brave.

959
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:59,190
And, and, and, and I talk a lot about being brave, being brave in the way that we're playing

960
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,329
with and without the ball.

961
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:04,590
Um, so, you know, a lot of that is, you know, the, the positive nature.

962
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:08,809
So, you know, sometimes when you lose, you, you, you have to show what we did well.

963
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:13,909
Um, and when we lose, uh, when we win sometimes is what we could improve on.

964
00:46:13,969 --> 00:46:16,369
And so it's always about the improvement.

965
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:21,050
I, I feel, you know, we're always improving and that, that's the positive reinforcement

966
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:21,389
that I'm talking about.

967
00:46:21,409 --> 00:46:25,769
We're trying to give the players results will come and, and, you know, but we're improving

968
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:27,070
as a group and as individuals.

969
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:27,530
Yeah.

970
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:31,429
I remember, you know, it felt like when, uh, the era that I played in, you'd win a game

971
00:46:31,429 --> 00:46:33,250
by a point and that it'd be fine.

972
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:38,090
No problems, celebration, really having made so many mistakes and you, you wouldn't really

973
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:38,869
think about that.

974
00:46:38,949 --> 00:46:39,769
I'm at such a.

975
00:46:39,789 --> 00:46:41,050
It's still like that to us.

976
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:41,329
Yeah.

977
00:46:41,429 --> 00:46:45,909
And, and, and I think that you have to be calm as, as a leader.

978
00:46:45,989 --> 00:46:48,110
I think you have to be calm in all situations.

979
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:51,309
You enjoy your victories because, you know, you have to.

980
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:56,010
Enjoy it, but also be calm in, in your losses and, and know where, you know, that you have

981
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,210
to improve and, and why you had that loss.

982
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:04,969
And, you know, I, I got told, you know, pretty early on in my career, especially the coaching

983
00:47:04,969 --> 00:47:09,070
careers that, you know, everyone turns to the, the, the manager or the head coach, you

984
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:10,889
know, when things aren't going so well.

985
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:15,869
So you have to like walk in with a, a, a sort of presence and saying, don't worry, you know,

986
00:47:15,889 --> 00:47:19,949
we've got this, you know, and, and then the players feed off of that.

987
00:47:19,949 --> 00:47:20,309
Yeah.

988
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:20,329
Yeah.

989
00:47:20,329 --> 00:47:20,349
Yeah.

990
00:47:20,349 --> 00:47:20,369
Yeah.

991
00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:20,389
Yeah.

992
00:47:20,389 --> 00:47:20,409
Yeah.

993
00:47:20,409 --> 00:47:20,429
Yeah.

994
00:47:20,429 --> 00:47:20,449
Yeah.

995
00:47:20,449 --> 00:47:20,469
Yeah.

996
00:47:20,469 --> 00:47:20,489
Yeah.

997
00:47:20,489 --> 00:47:20,510
Yeah.

998
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:20,530
Yeah.

999
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:20,550
Yeah.

1000
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:20,570
Yeah.

1001
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:20,590
Yeah.

1002
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:20,610
Yeah.

1003
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:20,630
Yeah.

1004
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:20,650
Yeah.

1005
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:25,750
Come in there and you're down and you're lost and, you know, sometimes you are a little

1006
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:31,230
bit, you know, a little bit, oh, I don't know why this went wrong, but you can't show that

1007
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:31,710
all the time.

1008
00:47:31,789 --> 00:47:35,409
You can talk about it and with your coaching staff, but with the players say, all right,

1009
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,590
come in, this is what we were working on.

1010
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:40,389
And I think that the players, you know, do go off of that a lot.

1011
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:46,269
So creating and sharing a vision is a, is a common thread we're seeing with, you know,

1012
00:47:46,269 --> 00:47:48,269
there's this group of leaders we're talking to regularly.

1013
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:50,269
How do you go about creating and sharing your vision?

1014
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:55,690
And I think that's pretty, pretty simple that, you know, everyone wants to win and

1015
00:47:55,690 --> 00:48:00,329
that, that has to be your goal, you know, that, uh, you know, it's, it's creating an

1016
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:02,670
environment that, uh, will allow you to win.

1017
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:04,550
And then, and I think that's important.

1018
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:09,389
You know, that was the biggest thing setting foot into the Western United that we had,

1019
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:13,190
uh, last season at the end of the last season, they had lost, uh, eight games in a row.

1020
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:17,809
And, um, then, you know, you can say, all right, it's, uh, you know, that's just football.

1021
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:20,369
Well, no, because there was a lot of things that culturally,

1022
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:21,309
it was going wrong.

1023
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:26,690
So you're trying to create this culture that people are all on the same, you know, same

1024
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:26,989
page.

1025
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:30,989
You're going to get some players that don't totally buy into it straight away, but you

1026
00:48:30,989 --> 00:48:36,469
have to try and show why it will help and how it will help and keep on reinforcing that,

1027
00:48:36,469 --> 00:48:37,710
uh, that culture.

1028
00:48:37,869 --> 00:48:43,050
And then, you know, the, the, the actual playing style is something that, you know, again,

1029
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:47,050
you know, you have to, you're, you're virtually a salesman, you know, because you're, you're

1030
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:50,630
trying to get them to believe in this playing style that will get you success.

1031
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:56,449
And bring you success and will, um, allow the players to really, uh, get to another

1032
00:48:56,449 --> 00:48:56,849
level.

1033
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:02,110
And, um, and so that's every day in training and, and everything that you do in training

1034
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:05,929
and, and the way that you, you conduct yourself and the way that, you know, you're, you're

1035
00:49:05,929 --> 00:49:06,750
driving the group.

1036
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:12,409
Um, and so, you know, the results, you know, everyone wants to win and that's our, our

1037
00:49:12,409 --> 00:49:14,989
final goal, but it's, it's the process of it.

1038
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:18,750
You mentioned, you know, being a salesman and I, and you're right at one level, but

1039
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,269
players are so smart, aren't they?

1040
00:49:20,269 --> 00:49:20,329
Yeah.

1041
00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:20,389
Yeah.

1042
00:49:20,389 --> 00:49:20,409
Yeah.

1043
00:49:20,409 --> 00:49:20,469
Yeah.

1044
00:49:20,469 --> 00:49:20,489
Yeah.

1045
00:49:20,489 --> 00:49:20,510
Yeah.

1046
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:20,530
Yeah.

1047
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:20,550
Yeah.

1048
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:21,030
Yeah.

1049
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:21,070
Yeah.

1050
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:21,130
Yeah.

1051
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:21,250
Yeah.

1052
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:21,309
Yeah.

1053
00:49:21,309 --> 00:49:21,389
Yeah.

1054
00:49:21,389 --> 00:49:21,489
Yeah.

1055
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:21,809
Yeah.

1056
00:49:21,809 --> 00:49:21,869
Yeah.

1057
00:49:21,869 --> 00:49:22,030
Yeah.

1058
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:22,050
Yeah.

1059
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:22,150
Yeah.

1060
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:22,210
Yeah.

1061
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:22,250
Yeah.

1062
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:27,989
If you don't see authenticity and you don't trust that as well, then it falls apart very

1063
00:49:27,989 --> 00:49:28,289
quickly.

1064
00:49:28,429 --> 00:49:28,530
Yeah.

1065
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,269
So here, I'm selling you this vision, but I'm also living it, breathing it.

1066
00:49:32,429 --> 00:49:35,489
And my values, as you said, are aligned to that all the time.

1067
00:49:35,489 --> 00:49:36,590
And you haven't got a lot of wiggle room.

1068
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:40,349
Maybe the players will pick you very quickly or in, you know, people listening to this

1069
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:43,789
in their own business, you know, if you haven't got the authenticity and you don't follow

1070
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:45,349
through, you get found out, don't you?

1071
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:46,070
It doesn't work.

1072
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:46,190
Yeah.

1073
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:46,329
Yeah.

1074
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:46,449
Yeah.

1075
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:46,849
I agree.

1076
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:50,610
And what I mean by salesman is that because I believe in it.

1077
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:56,489
I'm passionate about this is the way that I believe that we're going to win

1078
00:49:56,489 --> 00:50:00,730
and the way that we will get there in the end.

1079
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:05,670
And so if you're just saying it because you just feel it's the right thing to say,

1080
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:08,489
of course the players are going to, anyone will pick up on that.

1081
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,670
But if you're living it, breathing it every single day

1082
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:13,469
and that's something that you believe in,

1083
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:18,929
the playing style that I believe in is not only because I like it,

1084
00:50:18,929 --> 00:50:21,250
it's because I believe that's the way to success.

1085
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:24,369
And everyone has their different ways.

1086
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:26,969
I'm not saying that there's any right or wrong way of playing.

1087
00:50:28,269 --> 00:50:34,170
But yeah, it's something that I believe in and the players know it

1088
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,309
because they see the passion come out.

1089
00:50:36,389 --> 00:50:38,369
Not only myself, but the coaching staff as well.

1090
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:40,150
Yeah, and if you're listening to this, they'll see your history.

1091
00:50:40,289 --> 00:50:42,809
You've been able to manifest what you believe in and make it come.

1092
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:43,449
As you said, with upsets.

1093
00:50:43,469 --> 00:50:47,849
So I'm not surprised that you've got a strong path to follow

1094
00:50:47,849 --> 00:50:50,309
and on your way to making it happen.

1095
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:54,889
We're seeing curiosity, Johnny, as a trait of a lot of great leaders.

1096
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:57,570
I'm very curious about how to improve

1097
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:01,070
and then using that through their own improvement and learning and development.

1098
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:04,269
What do you think of when I talk about learning through curiosity?

1099
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:09,449
I think about what's happening around the world,

1100
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:13,449
not only in your own sport, which I always try,

1101
00:51:13,469 --> 00:51:16,210
and see the top managers and what they're doing.

1102
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:19,190
You watch a lot of the docos.

1103
00:51:19,289 --> 00:51:20,389
You read a lot of that stuff.

1104
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:24,389
You're trying to always improve, gain an edge, you can say.

1105
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:27,190
But it's also like, what's the new trend?

1106
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:30,829
In our game, there's always different trends that are happening

1107
00:51:30,829 --> 00:51:34,190
and what's successful in those trends.

1108
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:39,269
And can you implement it in your playing philosophy and coaching style?

1109
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:43,429
And then they're curious what other sports are doing.

1110
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:46,769
What other leaders are doing, how they're doing it, how they communicate.

1111
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:51,650
I've picked up a lot from visiting different coaches.

1112
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:56,050
I've sat down with Neil Craig years back now,

1113
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:58,989
going to visit different AFL coaches

1114
00:51:58,989 --> 00:52:02,530
because I just wanted to see how they would communicate with a playing group.

1115
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:06,070
It's a bit different, but I've picked up quite a bit

1116
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:10,869
that I actually have implemented now in my coaching style.

1117
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,070
So there's things.

1118
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:16,929
There's things that you're always curious about what are others doing

1119
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:18,809
because you don't want to copy them,

1120
00:52:18,889 --> 00:52:22,570
but you want to see if that can actually come into the way

1121
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:24,690
that you're believing coaching should be.

1122
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:26,030
You mentioned communicating.

1123
00:52:26,469 --> 00:52:30,110
We see communicating with clarity is a real dimension of leadership.

1124
00:52:30,429 --> 00:52:32,489
How do you go about communicating with clarity?

1125
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:35,570
Not confusing players as well.

1126
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,050
That's a big thing.

1127
00:52:37,329 --> 00:52:41,210
I got that a lot from – so when I first started coaching,

1128
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:42,989
it was like I knew all this stuff.

1129
00:52:43,469 --> 00:52:47,510
Sometimes I'd look back and I'd go,

1130
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:50,590
did I confuse them because I gave them too many instructions?

1131
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:55,590
So like I said about behavior guidelines, it's simple.

1132
00:52:56,489 --> 00:53:01,329
It's not too difficult to understand, and so the players understand that.

1133
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:03,630
The same with the tactical guidelines.

1134
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:07,110
Make it as simple as possible so the players know their role.

1135
00:53:08,849 --> 00:53:12,929
They know in a defensive moment what they should be doing,

1136
00:53:12,929 --> 00:53:15,889
and of course you have to practice it, but they sort of understand.

1137
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:22,590
I have clear – for a defensive moment, I'll have a clear word that someone can scream out

1138
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:24,409
so the players go, okay, I know what that means.

1139
00:53:25,449 --> 00:53:28,150
In an attacking sense, they know their movements.

1140
00:53:28,329 --> 00:53:29,170
They know their patterns.

1141
00:53:29,849 --> 00:53:32,409
So I try and make it very clear and concise.

1142
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:35,369
It's even when I'm speaking to them.

1143
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:40,349
It's just don't go on and speak for 20 minutes or 30 minutes or whatever

1144
00:53:40,349 --> 00:53:41,409
because players switch off.

1145
00:53:41,409 --> 00:53:42,769
Get them engaged.

1146
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:47,170
Listen to what you're talking about, and I got that from television.

1147
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:51,929
I got that from doing a bit of media because people don't want to just hear someone

1148
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:52,670
just rumble on.

1149
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,429
They want to hear what's the message.

1150
00:53:54,789 --> 00:53:55,849
What are you trying to get at?

1151
00:53:56,429 --> 00:53:59,289
And so I took that into coaching as well.

1152
00:53:59,389 --> 00:54:01,530
Yeah, expressing yourself in a succinct way.

1153
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:07,230
You're only 45 years of age, and there's this sort of – in some sport,

1154
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:08,710
it's this age thing for coaches.

1155
00:54:08,989 --> 00:54:10,909
Naturally, you're going to get better as you learn,

1156
00:54:10,909 --> 00:54:12,630
and particularly it's what we're passionate about.

1157
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:14,670
Leaders are like, you're always refining, always reflecting,

1158
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:15,510
always getting better.

1159
00:54:15,809 --> 00:54:17,309
You've got your principles and your values.

1160
00:54:17,489 --> 00:54:19,809
That's always who you're going to be, but you're learning constantly.

1161
00:54:20,409 --> 00:54:22,789
It's great to hear that coming out in the way you approach it.

1162
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,789
Collaboration we see now as being a real trait.

1163
00:54:25,909 --> 00:54:28,949
Great leaders are collaborating more than they ever did before in the past.

1164
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:31,670
There was a lot of hierarchy in leadership, whether it was in business and sport,

1165
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:34,630
and you would have seen – how do you approach collaboration?

1166
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:40,630
Yeah, I think it's important because that way there you're –

1167
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:42,630
someone might have dealt with a situation.

1168
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:46,630
It's a situation that you're dealing with now, a few years ago.

1169
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:51,250
That's collaborating with other leaders that have been in those situations.

1170
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,869
I've got – Ange has helped me a lot.

1171
00:54:54,949 --> 00:54:59,630
He's been a mentor, Ange Postacoglou, because he's been around for a long period.

1172
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:01,630
He's had his ups and downs as well in coaching.

1173
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:07,130
Just chatting away with him sometimes is just helpful.

1174
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:12,590
Like I said before about sitting down with different coaches from different sports,

1175
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:19,750
the way that they might deal with media, the way that they might deal with the hierarchy of a club.

1176
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:26,030
That's important because you don't have all the answers.

1177
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:31,469
It's impossible for – even though you're a leader of an organization or a playing group

1178
00:55:31,469 --> 00:55:35,829
or a coaching staff, you can't possibly have all the answers every day.

1179
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:39,829
So having the others that you can lean on is a big help.

1180
00:55:40,449 --> 00:55:42,110
Tony, I've been asking these two final questions.

1181
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:44,809
Of the leaders, I've had the great privilege to sit down,

1182
00:55:44,889 --> 00:55:46,690
and it's always great to spend time with you.

1183
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:48,510
I'm going to fire the first one.

1184
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:50,510
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1185
00:55:51,849 --> 00:56:01,570
I have to say my dad because just the way that he's gone about bringing up a family,

1186
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:08,570
first of all, and also running a business for so long and also finding time to coach in soccer.

1187
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:12,570
He probably regrets that he got us down that path because he said,

1188
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:17,010
I would have loved to have lived in Adelaide, back in Adelaide,

1189
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:19,510
but you left home at 16, you haven't come back.

1190
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:20,969
So it's nearly 30 years now.

1191
00:56:22,289 --> 00:56:30,710
So I would say my dad has been probably the best leader in terms of who I learned most off of

1192
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:32,530
and I'm still learning today.

1193
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:36,130
So you pick up the phone and ring Rocky, there's something going on in your life.

1194
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:36,389
Yeah.

1195
00:56:37,389 --> 00:56:42,369
And look, sometimes – because he can be pretty negative.

1196
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:43,309
He'll, you know.

1197
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,929
Have you had that conversation as you've got older?

1198
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,269
Have you said – because I remember talking to you as we would catch up along the journey

1199
00:56:50,269 --> 00:56:53,650
and if you're back in town playing for Australia and grab a coffee with you

1200
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:58,210
and you could have had an unbelievable year in the Premier League in the UK,

1201
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,730
but Rocky was on to you about a certain part of your game.

1202
00:57:00,829 --> 00:57:01,010
Yeah.

1203
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:02,789
And have you sort of said to him occasionally?

1204
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,250
Yeah, often.

1205
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:07,929
I always say to him – and look, he's negative.

1206
00:57:08,429 --> 00:57:10,110
By nature, I think he's negative.

1207
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:11,670
Does he laugh about that?

1208
00:57:11,969 --> 00:57:12,570
He does.

1209
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,969
But then he'll just like let it go.

1210
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:21,690
But sometimes it's not bad because you need sometimes a few home truths.

1211
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:26,750
So he might say something that you go back and you go, you know what, I think he's right.

1212
00:57:27,329 --> 00:57:28,090
I think he's right.

1213
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:29,949
So I need to have a good look at that.

1214
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:33,190
Or dad, like settle down.

1215
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:34,590
That's a one-off.

1216
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,090
It's not a constant.

1217
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:39,809
So you're negative because of just the result or something like that.

1218
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:42,469
But if it's something that you look at and you go,

1219
00:57:42,469 --> 00:57:45,289
no, that's happening on a regular basis, I think he's right there.

1220
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:48,550
But he was ruthless in terms of you're right.

1221
00:57:48,789 --> 00:57:52,409
Like when I was playing, I remember having the best season I've had with Portsmouth.

1222
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:56,050
It was in the championship in England and I was scoring game after game.

1223
00:57:56,110 --> 00:58:01,010
And he came to visit me and he goes, you've gone backwards.

1224
00:58:01,409 --> 00:58:02,610
I was like, what do you mean?

1225
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:05,409
He goes, your touch is not as good as what it used to be.

1226
00:58:06,829 --> 00:58:08,230
You're not playing the same way.

1227
00:58:08,309 --> 00:58:11,670
And I go, dad, I'm scoring every week and I'm a striker.

1228
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:11,710
Yeah.

1229
00:58:12,469 --> 00:58:18,150
But then I looked back and then after that, I started to work again on my basic skills

1230
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:19,530
because I was going, you know what?

1231
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:21,030
He's not too far off.

1232
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:21,789
He's right.

1233
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:24,730
But it hurt at the time.

1234
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:25,329
Yeah.

1235
00:58:25,389 --> 00:58:25,730
It's interesting.

1236
00:58:25,849 --> 00:58:29,510
I had a very similar but different relationship with my dad.

1237
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:30,670
Super, super close.

1238
00:58:31,389 --> 00:58:35,070
He played and I was a father-son in Australian rules football.

1239
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:37,289
And I'd ring him all the time.

1240
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:39,690
We lost him a little over a year ago.

1241
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:41,849
But it's funny, mate, because I could pick up the phone.

1242
00:58:42,469 --> 00:58:45,610
Two minutes or two hours, you know, depending on if there was something going on.

1243
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,110
But I can have those conversations with him in my head.

1244
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:49,929
And I could know exactly what he would say.

1245
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:51,150
He was less prescriptive.

1246
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:52,590
He wouldn't tell me what to do.

1247
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:56,110
But he'd ask me questions and then in that way sort of find out myself.

1248
00:58:56,489 --> 00:58:57,929
So you're lucky in life, aren't you?

1249
00:58:57,989 --> 00:59:01,789
If you had a father figure like you've had and I was incredibly lucky to have,

1250
00:59:01,889 --> 00:59:04,710
it's a gift, isn't it, to have that throughout your life

1251
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:06,369
and you can hear how close that relationship is.

1252
00:59:06,369 --> 00:59:07,269
Yeah, it is a gift.

1253
00:59:07,469 --> 00:59:09,750
Others need to look elsewhere, obviously.

1254
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,690
They might have an uncle.

1255
00:59:12,469 --> 00:59:16,170
A relative or a close mate or an older mentor.

1256
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:19,889
And I'm lucky that I've had my dad there.

1257
00:59:20,949 --> 00:59:25,409
Sometimes I don't call him after a game because I don't want to hear the negative side.

1258
00:59:25,769 --> 00:59:29,849
I'll leave her for a few hours and then maybe speak to him a few days later.

1259
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:37,190
But it is always good to have someone that you're close to

1260
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,429
that wants the best for you as well.

1261
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:41,449
Now, final question, Johnny.

1262
00:59:42,469 --> 00:59:45,030
The work we're doing, we're massive on collaboration

1263
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:47,889
and seeing where that's heading at a leader.

1264
00:59:48,289 --> 00:59:49,130
And I ask you this question.

1265
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:52,309
If you could collaborate with anyone in the world, it could be on anything.

1266
00:59:52,409 --> 00:59:53,130
It could be a coach.

1267
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:58,610
It could be outside interest from your coaching world or from professional football.

1268
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:01,750
Is there anyone you've ever thought you'd like to collaborate with someone?

1269
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:02,869
Question without notice for you.

1270
01:00:03,369 --> 01:00:05,909
Yeah, I would say that there's always coaches.

1271
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:08,210
I'm more about coaches because, you know, it's…

1272
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:08,670
That's your world.

1273
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:09,650
Yeah, that's my world.

1274
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:12,309
So there's a Spanish coach called…

1275
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:15,150
And I've had the privilege to meet him a couple of times

1276
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:18,630
and spend time at Barcelona when he was coaching Barcelona.

1277
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:21,750
But he's the current coach of the Spanish national team.

1278
01:00:21,889 --> 01:00:27,170
And he's been through, you know, a lot of ups and downs in his life in general.

1279
01:00:27,309 --> 01:00:30,349
But his daughter passed away a few years ago from cancer.

1280
01:00:30,889 --> 01:00:32,250
And she was only eight years old.

1281
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:35,710
And, you know, now he's back coaching the Spanish national team.

1282
01:00:35,929 --> 01:00:39,889
And just the way he leads the group and the way he's a leader of men

1283
01:00:39,889 --> 01:00:42,289
and the way he actually can adjust.

1284
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:44,590
You know, in certain environments.

1285
01:00:44,869 --> 01:00:49,769
Because, you know, he was coaching Barcelona when they had Lionel Messi, Suarez, Neymar.

1286
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:53,389
And they're a hard three to coach.

1287
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:58,349
Messi is actually the person that runs that football club, you know.

1288
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:04,750
And he had his moments with him because Luis Enrique, he can be a hothead at a time.

1289
01:01:04,889 --> 01:01:11,909
But he stepped away of being that and allowed others to control Messi in a different way.

1290
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:14,650
And then you see him with the Spanish national team.

1291
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:18,550
And he's got a really young group of players that they're just looking up to him.

1292
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:23,570
And he's sort of always joking around with them, you know,

1293
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:26,550
always being himself around them in a different sort of way.

1294
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:30,630
And I just find it fascinating how he can just, you know,

1295
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:34,210
move into a different environment and, you know, be a leader in a different way.

1296
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:35,789
Yeah, it's a great answer, Johnny.

1297
01:01:35,909 --> 01:01:41,409
And to me, that art of leadership that I love is very different to the experience.

1298
01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:44,050
I had playing sport where it was one size fits all.

1299
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:45,630
And you didn't fit into that box.

1300
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:47,829
You just went up to it and you moved on.

1301
01:01:47,869 --> 01:01:50,789
I felt like we lost a lot of good people because of that.

1302
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:54,789
So you're saying that ability to say you've got to treat Lionel Messi very differently

1303
01:01:54,789 --> 01:01:57,730
to, you know, a young guy coming through the Spanish national team.

1304
01:01:57,730 --> 01:02:00,349
And you think he does that as well as anyone you've seen?

1305
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,369
Yeah, he does it as well as anyone I've seen.

1306
01:02:02,489 --> 01:02:07,309
Look, with Barcelona, it's funny because he doesn't get the recognition, but he doesn't care.

1307
01:02:07,429 --> 01:02:09,670
Like he walks into a press conference and he goes,

1308
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:12,030
all right, you're going to ask me stupid questions, you know.

1309
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:16,230
But he knows that the media, you know, very powerful,

1310
01:02:16,389 --> 01:02:19,110
especially in a country like Spain where football is everything.

1311
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:21,409
But it doesn't bother him.

1312
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,909
He said, if I lose one or two games, I'm going to get the sack anyway.

1313
01:02:23,989 --> 01:02:24,829
So I don't need the media.

1314
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:27,510
So that's probably why he hasn't got the recognition of a Guadagnole

1315
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:30,090
because Guadagnole, he's got the full package.

1316
01:02:30,369 --> 01:02:32,869
You know, he can walk into a press conference and just, you know,

1317
01:02:32,929 --> 01:02:35,369
control the whole, you know, environment.

1318
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:38,650
He's half stand-up comedian these days, Guadagnole, isn't he?

1319
01:02:38,829 --> 01:02:39,170
Yeah, yeah.

1320
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:41,269
Do you think that's part of his arsenal as well?

1321
01:02:41,469 --> 01:02:41,769
Oh, yeah.

1322
01:02:41,769 --> 01:02:44,090
He can play that role really well.

1323
01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:47,349
And, you know, I talk about Luis Enrique because I, you know,

1324
01:02:47,949 --> 01:02:49,429
I met him a few times.

1325
01:02:49,469 --> 01:02:50,449
I've never met Guadagnole.

1326
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:50,769
Yeah.

1327
01:02:50,909 --> 01:02:54,469
But I love the way he's been able to go into different countries

1328
01:02:54,469 --> 01:02:58,309
and still be able to go in different cultures and control,

1329
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:01,110
not control in the sense that he's controlling,

1330
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:05,469
but able to get success and get his teams to play a certain style

1331
01:03:05,469 --> 01:03:08,130
of football and win playing that way.

1332
01:03:08,889 --> 01:03:11,190
And then you've got on the other side, you've got someone like a Klopp.

1333
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:13,730
I'm sticking with football here because that's the main thing

1334
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:16,349
that I follow and love.

1335
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:22,130
And Klopp is this energetic person that always seems to have a smile on his face.

1336
01:03:22,409 --> 01:03:25,050
But you know that he's going to get angry, but it's, you know,

1337
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:27,230
that he's a lovable character.

1338
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:31,090
He's walked into, you know, that Liverpool club,

1339
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:36,289
high expectations but have struggled to win anything or the Premier League

1340
01:03:36,289 --> 01:03:39,469
in 30-odd years, and he walks in there

1341
01:03:39,469 --> 01:03:41,170
and he just gives everyone a look.

1342
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:44,590
And to sustain that, it's been about seven years now

1343
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:47,570
that he's sustained that level, and they play with intensity

1344
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:49,949
and a passion, and that's him.

1345
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:51,269
You can just see it, you know.

1346
01:03:51,309 --> 01:03:53,630
He gets the crowd going when he walks out into the field.

1347
01:03:54,409 --> 01:03:58,429
And just, you know, to be around and see how they are every day

1348
01:03:58,429 --> 01:04:02,469
would be fascinating, and, you know, I would love to be able to, you know,

1349
01:04:02,849 --> 01:04:05,750
get in their inner circle and see how they, you know,

1350
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:08,110
they treat their players and treat the people around them.

1351
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:10,929
John, we were talking to you just before we started recording today,

1352
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:15,150
and I'm loving the fact that, and they're pretty popular now,

1353
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:17,429
the streaming services that are getting behind the scenes

1354
01:04:17,429 --> 01:04:20,989
with Pep Guardiola, and you're getting to see, you know,

1355
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:23,969
different elements of coaches that in the past were super private,

1356
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,250
didn't allow the guard down.

1357
01:04:25,369 --> 01:04:28,190
To me, it's a gift for the next generation, isn't it?

1358
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:30,369
You know, the legendary Vince Lombardi from the NFL,

1359
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:34,429
and there's been 100 books written, but there's very little real evidence

1360
01:04:34,429 --> 01:04:36,190
of what he actually was like behind the scenes.

1361
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:40,610
Are you open to that in your journey to sort of, yeah, to open the doors?

1362
01:04:40,909 --> 01:04:41,110
Yeah, yeah.

1363
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:41,550
Very open.

1364
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:44,710
We've got a documentary crew at the moment at Worcester United

1365
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:48,489
that come in, you know, on a daily basis and, you know,

1366
01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:52,110
have marked me up, you know, pre-match team talks and, you know,

1367
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:55,010
when I'm walking around, and they're fascinated by it themselves

1368
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:58,269
because we didn't realise that you'd go and have a chat with this player

1369
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:00,730
and, you know, talk about something completely different to football.

1370
01:05:00,949 --> 01:05:03,230
You know, you're talking about, you know, how's your family going,

1371
01:05:03,369 --> 01:05:06,090
you know, the kids and whatever else.

1372
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:07,570
Then you go over and chat with someone else.

1373
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:11,030
They just don't understand that that's part of, you know,

1374
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:14,289
being in an environment and, you know, you can't,

1375
01:05:14,389 --> 01:05:16,849
you have to connect with someone and you do.

1376
01:05:16,969 --> 01:05:19,369
You end up having a connection with someone through different ways.

1377
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:24,630
So, yeah, I think that's great because a lot of people have got a fixation

1378
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:29,889
that, you know, coaches, most coaches are dictators, which that's gone.

1379
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:31,670
You know, that definitely has gone.

1380
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:35,469
There still might be certain coaches that it's their way or no way,

1381
01:05:35,469 --> 01:05:40,130
but the majority of coaches now are pretty good in,

1382
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,150
are able to manage.

1383
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:46,150
A group of people and understand the environment that they're in.

1384
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:47,610
Johnny, I always love catching up with you.

1385
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:49,070
I really appreciate your time.

1386
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:51,750
I'm thinking we leave that time capsule where it was.

1387
01:05:51,809 --> 01:05:54,730
I don't want to ruin our thoughts that we, at that young age, mate,

1388
01:05:54,769 --> 01:05:56,530
knew exactly what life was going to turn out like.

1389
01:05:56,929 --> 01:06:00,469
If you had to pick what you'd achieved and what your family looks like

1390
01:06:00,469 --> 01:06:03,510
and the person you are, mate, you couldn't have picked a better path

1391
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:04,570
and I'm not surprised.

1392
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:06,190
And I'm excited for the next chapter for you, John.

1393
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:08,670
I can see that same intensity and that same passion when you hear you talk

1394
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:10,670
about managing and coaching.

1395
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:12,269
Coaching and leading others.

1396
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:14,170
It's going to be a brilliant next chapter.

1397
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,769
And thanks for joining me today, mate.

1398
01:06:15,769 --> 01:06:16,769
Always great to see you.

1399
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:17,369
Thanks.

1400
01:06:17,369 --> 01:06:17,949
It's been good.

1401
01:06:17,949 --> 01:06:22,210
I really enjoyed it and it is always great to see it, but I do want to dig up the time capsule.

1402
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:23,789
You want to go and see it then, mate?

1403
01:06:23,789 --> 01:06:25,789
Let's go back and do it then, mate.

1404
01:06:25,789 --> 01:06:27,090
I know where it is.

1405
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:27,550
Do you?

1406
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:28,710
I'm behind the chapel.

1407
01:06:28,809 --> 01:06:30,889
I reckon I could put my foot on it.

1408
01:06:30,889 --> 01:06:32,510
So we'll have to go and check it out.

1409
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:33,670
I wouldn't mind seeing it.

1410
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:35,050
It'll be interesting.

1411
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:38,670
I'd laugh if I wrote something different down.

1412
01:06:38,889 --> 01:06:40,610
But then, you know, you talk about it.

1413
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:41,010
You talk about it.

1414
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:41,110
You talk about it.

1415
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:41,130
You talk about it.

1416
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:41,150
You talk about it.

1417
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:42,150
You talk about year four.

1418
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:47,650
Year five, Mr. Sheridan, you know, at the end of the year, you know, I signed an autograph

1419
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:51,769
and I don't know if he remembers this and I gave it to him and I said, keep it because

1420
01:06:51,769 --> 01:06:55,230
one day, you know, he'll be famous and be important.

1421
01:06:55,230 --> 01:07:00,530
And I'm just thinking back, what was I thinking as a kid to actually have that courage to

1422
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:02,010
even hand that to a teacher?

1423
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:06,989
But that means that the teachers must have had that, you know, a connection with us that

1424
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:11,090
were able to do that and had the confidence and, you know.

1425
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:15,170
I find coaching's like teaching, you know, that you're there to help.

1426
01:07:15,269 --> 01:07:21,090
You're there to teach, you know, players and not only as, you know, and help them with

1427
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:23,110
their playing career, but help them with their life.

1428
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:29,090
And I got to meet Peter Muddy Waters, Johnny, a couple of years ago, 35 years since you

1429
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:30,150
and I were in year four.

1430
01:07:30,989 --> 01:07:34,630
And it was hilarious, mate, because he was saying, I didn't, we didn't understand.

1431
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,349
It was his first year out of teacher's college.

1432
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:37,590
And he had no idea what he was doing.

1433
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:38,269
He had no idea what he was doing.

1434
01:07:38,369 --> 01:07:40,070
He said, mate, I made it all up.

1435
01:07:40,449 --> 01:07:41,050
But he used to play.

1436
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:41,789
He played a bit of guitar.

1437
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:44,789
When we'd get a bit rowdy, you know, we'd go and run a couple of laps of the oval.

1438
01:07:44,889 --> 01:07:46,010
We thought he was a legend.

1439
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:47,869
But it's a lifelong impact, isn't it?

1440
01:07:47,909 --> 01:07:48,909
Leaders can have that impact.

1441
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:51,650
You know, from a year four teacher, you and I have spoken about him a lot.

1442
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:55,409
And it just shows, you know, you can really change the course of someone's life with that

1443
01:07:55,409 --> 01:07:56,269
sort of impact.

1444
