00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,900
This week's conversation is with one of Australia's greatest ever sports people,

2
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:16,059
John Bertrand, the yachtsman who skippered Australia to victory in the 1983 America's Cup.

3
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:21,920
For 133 years, the Americans had successfully defended against challenges from across the world.

4
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:24,879
They were dominant like no team had ever been.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,339
And the story of 1983 is one that is really hard to comprehend in some ways.

6
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:34,880
And you'll hear John's perspective of it in this chat, hearing him talk about trust

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,039
and understanding the way that he looks at leadership in the world of sport and collaboration.

8
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,560
It makes you really understand what happened in 1983 and their victory in a new light.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,240
I found it incredibly fascinating and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

10
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,200
John's perspective to me is similar to a few people we've been collaborating with at Alita.

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,780
It's a business founded with my great friend, Matt Waterwitz.

12
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,820
It's a place for bespoke collaboration with incredible leaders from around the world,

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,320
like Mikel Arteta from Arsenal.

14
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,619
Socceroo John Aloisi, Eddie Jones from English Rugby, just to name a few.

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,579
Now, if you're interested in this space, you can find it at alitacollective.com.

16
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:11,799
You don't have to be a world-renowned sports person or a leader,

17
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:15,599
but we would encourage you to check it out, our signature Alita Connect program.

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,500
It gives you a great perspective on how people like John are leading in their world.

19
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,670
John Bertrand is an official legend of the Sport Australia Hall of Fame.

20
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:38,650
He's the Australian who skippered the wing-keeled Australia 2 to victory over the Americans.

21
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:42,129
Dennis Connors' liberty to win the 1983 America's Cup,

22
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,250
breaking 132 years of American domination,

23
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,469
and in the process, breaking the longest running record in the history of modern sport.

24
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,489
After being 3-1 down in the best of seven races,

25
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,010
and considered by many as the race of the century,

26
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,909
on September 27th, 1983, off Newport, Rhode Island,

27
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,829
John Bertrand and his crew pulled off arguably the greatest upset in modern Australian sporting history.

28
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,490
The victory was voted by the Confederation of Australian Sport,

29
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,090
as the greatest team performance in 200 years of Australian sport.

30
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:14,849
John, it's always a great pleasure to see you,

31
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,689
and I really appreciate you spending the time today.

32
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,650
Great pleasure, Luke.

33
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:21,710
I have to go back, John, to that day, the 27th of September, 1983,

34
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,449
and I remember it as crystal clear.

35
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:23,930
How old are you?

36
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:24,789
I was eight at that stage.

37
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:26,750
And I think I've shared this with you before,

38
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:28,889
but I remember Dad getting me out of bed,

39
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:31,789
get up, son, this is history being made,

40
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,969
Australia are going to win the America's Cup.

41
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,669
And I was just thinking about it today,

42
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,189
I can picture myself where we were in the lounge room,

43
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:39,729
and this tiny little TV,

44
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:41,289
and the whole family's glued around,

45
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,189
and how many people share,

46
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:46,509
because it's a moment where you knew where you were if you were old enough.

47
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,490
Is that shared with you a lot?

48
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:48,110
Oh, yeah.

49
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,689
Not so much what I was doing.

50
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:51,810
Yeah, that's right.

51
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,870
You were busy at the time.

52
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,270
Well, I met a bloke the other day,

53
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:56,009
he was in Sydney,

54
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:57,810
driving across Sydney Harbour Bridge,

55
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,229
and the traffic,

56
00:02:59,490 --> 00:02:59,949
he told me,

57
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,789
the traffic stopped,

58
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:02,810
and people got out and hiking each other

59
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,409
on the bridge,

60
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,750
of the Sydney Harbour Bridge,

61
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:07,669
overlooking the Sydney Opera House.

62
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:07,870
It's like,

63
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,830
it just blows me away.

64
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,030
It's incredible, isn't it?

65
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,750
It is, isn't it?

66
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:14,729
So it stopped the Harbour Bridge at the time.

67
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:14,909
Yep.

68
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,370
Did you have a sense at the time,

69
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,050
John,

70
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:20,150
that this was as big as it was,

71
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,389
and that the whole world was watching?

72
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:21,870
No,

73
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,210
nor did we want to.

74
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:23,569
Yeah.

75
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:25,550
We got rid of all television sets,

76
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,050
all newspapers entering our compound in Newport,

77
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:28,810
Rhode Island,

78
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,830
and we went into our bubble.

79
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:32,729
Look,

80
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,530
we had a sense of it,

81
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,530
but we probably could visualise,

82
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:37,830
maybe,

83
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,789
a quarter of the,

84
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:39,669
really,

85
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:40,849
what was happening back home.

86
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:41,389
Yeah.

87
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:43,530
The crowds got big at the end,

88
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:43,810
didn't they?

89
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,389
And they came from everywhere around.

90
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:47,030
Australians came from everywhere,

91
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:47,370
didn't they,

92
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:48,270
for that final race,

93
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:48,930
when you look back.

94
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:49,389
That's right.

95
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:49,729
Yeah.

96
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,449
And the television,

97
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,150
you know,

98
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:51,509
crews,

99
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,090
they're flying stuff in from all around America.

100
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:55,009
You know,

101
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,050
the tower's going up,

102
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,009
the light's going on.

103
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:57,330
It was,

104
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:57,569
you know,

105
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,129
showtime.

106
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,270
And you have to go and watch Untold,

107
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,909
the race of the century,

108
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:03,949
Netflix documentary,

109
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:05,750
which has just been brought out recently.

110
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,150
It is brilliant.

111
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,229
John,

112
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,629
it brought it all back to life for me as an eight-year-old,

113
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:13,370
not really understanding the context.

114
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:18,269
And I love watching that documentary and seeing you in tears and your crew

115
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,589
and your great friends from that time reduced to tears looking at the

116
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:21,850
significance.

117
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:27,310
Can you explain for the next generation just how huge a challenge it was to

118
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,350
achieve what you did at that time?

119
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:32,930
The New York Club were ferocious defenders of the America's Cup.

120
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,310
They oozed style,

121
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:35,970
wealth,

122
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:36,930
this unbeatableness.

123
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:40,430
The U.S. had never lost.

124
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:45,149
It was the longest winning streak in sporting history for 132 years.

125
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:48,449
There's no question the emerging force was Dennis Conner.

126
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:50,569
It was the best sailor in the world.

127
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:53,730
He will do anything to win.

128
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,629
Are we floated on?

129
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,230
Three,

130
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:56,709
two,

131
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,189
one.

132
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,329
It was time that we had to do something radical.

133
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,810
It's a huge commitment.

134
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,649
We had to believe ourselves that we belong on the world stage.

135
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:12,209
I hadn't been the navigator on any of it,

136
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,889
but we were there for one reason,

137
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:14,629
to win.

138
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,949
All the work that we had done had paid huge dividends.

139
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:20,519
It was blazing.

140
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,060
What Australians really like is upsetting the upper echelon.

141
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,819
The whole of the world was watching this.

142
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,480
The greatest yacht race of the century.

143
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,839
I've never seen anything like this.

144
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,560
And a little country called Australia had the audacity to think that we could do it.

145
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:46,959
The American's Cup started off before the U.S. Civil War and the Americans successfully defended over 132 years.

146
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:54,899
So, you know, it's the longest running, you know, their domination was amazing for all different reasons,

147
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,699
but generally better organized.

148
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,319
But they had technology behind them.

149
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:03,899
You know, the U.S. surveyed the most powerful technical nation in the world and economically.

150
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:06,199
And it had never been done.

151
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,879
It was really, it was the Everest of sport.

152
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,560
It was a four minute mile.

153
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,139
You know, I remember reading about Bannister.

154
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,519
He was told, and he was, I think, a medical student at Oxford University at the time.

155
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:27,660
And the best advice that they could get at that stage is the human heart was not powerful enough to propel a man around the track in less than four minutes in a mile.

156
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,959
He didn't feel that that was the case.

157
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:37,319
But it was seen as an impossible barrier, a psychological, impossible, physical, medical barrier.

158
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,019
And at any rate, when he did that,

159
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:45,319
I think something in order of 10 different milers over the next six months broke through that invisible barrier.

160
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,720
All of a sudden it was gone.

161
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:51,439
So the psychology of it was huge.

162
00:06:51,779 --> 00:07:00,980
And I'd already been involved in three losing America's Cup challenges before, over a 12 year period.

163
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,560
So, you know, I could see, and having lived in the United States,

164
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,560
and interestingly enough, that Netflix thing, documentary actually,

165
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,180
he knows it pretty well.

166
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,079
It was a three year production coming out of LA and their research was amazing.

167
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,779
Most of the content I'd never seen before.

168
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:24,939
But having lived in the United States with my wife, Raza, and going to MIT and Boston and, you know,

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,079
worked with the Americans and the professors and so on, it became clear to me, you know,

170
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:38,439
clearly a very, very motivated people, the Americans, as I often say, the Americans will eat their

171
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:38,540
greens.

172
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:38,980
They'll eat their greens.

173
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,019
They'll eat their greens.

174
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:39,079
They'll eat their greens.

175
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:43,800
If required, you know, with great respect, but it's true, you know, highly competitive people.

176
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:51,579
So to knock the Yanks off was a big deal, both from a technical point of view, as well as a sounding ability.

177
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:58,600
And the fact that it had never been done, like so many nations had tried, and including Australia,

178
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,259
and no one was able to achieve it.

179
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:07,740
These projects are generally built very simply around administration, management has to be world class.

180
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,060
The technology has to be world class.

181
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,639
And ultimately, the team has to be world class, same as Formula One motor racing that we were just discussing.

182
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:18,759
Any of those links weak, and you can't play the game.

183
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:25,939
So ultimately, in that particular project, we got those three links to be absolutely world class, and we could play the game.

184
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:36,600
And John, to go into your time at MIT and to just, it gives a window into your mindset and of your commitment to success is next level.

185
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
And you're an engineer.

186
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,179
You did your thesis, and the title was The Optimum Angle of Attack for America's Cup Sales.

187
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:49,860
So you had a pretty specific focus, and then you won a scholarship to MIT, and that was, you know,

188
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:56,580
reading about you improving your engineering, but as you just described then, getting an understanding of the US psyche really, really deeply.

189
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:03,299
And so having lost the America's Cup three times, your fanaticism to go over and learn and better yourself.

190
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:07,460
Do you look back, and can you relate to what that was like at the time?

191
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:07,720
Well, yeah.

192
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:21,379
Well, I can now say it was very important, you know, to, best way to describe it in Australia, certainly in my era, and we're talking about a long time ago, when I was at Monash University, you know, the professor, everything was, you know, professor this and professor that.

193
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:24,480
At MIT, it was all first name with the professors.

194
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:33,419
And, you know, at Monash, you know, the people would have morning and afternoon tea and lunch, okay?

195
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,700
And at MIT, if you had to donate on the way through at lunch, you had to donate.

196
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,080
You were happy.

197
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:38,639
You were lucky.

198
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,080
You know, it was a different world.

199
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:45,860
The speed of, you know, speed of getting stuff done was just another world.

200
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:56,600
You know, MIT are basically funded by outside sponsorship, including the US military, whereas in Australia, a big chunk of the funding comes from government.

201
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,059
So it's a different mentality altogether.

202
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,399
You know, it's, you've got to make stuff happen.

203
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,379
And so, and we lived, you know, Raz and I, we lived in the States for probably eight years over different periods.

204
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:07,659
So about.

205
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:08,399
About time there.

206
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,539
And great respect.

207
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:13,940
You know, you don't, you don't back, you don't back against the Yanks.

208
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,440
They're a highly mobile community.

209
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,279
They'll move from one country, one, I should say, one city to another.

210
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:26,879
It's not like, you know, in Australia, moving from Melbourne to Sydney or Sydney to Perth is a big deal.

211
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:31,980
No, because it's all about increasing your net worth.

212
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,980
It's all about becoming millionaires and God bless them.

213
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:35,840
That's part of the deal.

214
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:36,980
And.

215
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:45,220
So having that sort of background and understanding and having empathy for the Americans was extremely important.

216
00:10:45,220 --> 00:11:06,620
And also their sense of self-confidence at the highest level, the high five thing, you know, in Australia, high five, you don't really see it, but we are highly competitive people, but it's under the cover, under the, under the radar a little bit below, you know, you know that in your world of Australian rules football, you know, you're a lovely man, but out on the field, you're a bloody mongrel.

217
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:28,379
Well, that's the reality that has to be the case, highly competitive individuals, no difference in the US, except it's, it's above the radar, you know, the high five, the louder voices, competitive environment, you to break through the noise, you've got to speak louder, you know, that's sort of not, you know, I just a broad brush approach.

218
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:36,159
So the net net is really not being put off by the US of A, you know, the US Navy and the Coast Guard.

219
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:58,639
The high fives and the pumped up chest, that's part of the deal that we had to overcome, you know, if we were to take on the Yanks, it was like the pool deck of, at the Olympic games, you know, the USA, USA, Australians up until Tokyo, you know, we're sort of, we were quivering people in a corner.

220
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:06,600
So overcoming that is all part of the psyche of getting stuff done at the highest level.

221
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,759
And you're dealing now on the world stage, there's no way to hide.

222
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:18,340
And in the US, you know, with the America's Cup, ultimately, there is no way to hide, you got to front up, and that's the competition, you can't change it.

223
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:31,120
And it's part of the deal, you know, it's a, so the, you know, this game of stuff between your ears, you know, all about being a highly competitive athlete in your former life, and still are.

224
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,580
It's the, you know, you do the so called 10,000 hours.

225
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:43,480
So preparation, in our case, is much more than that, driven by passion to become good at what you're doing.

226
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,120
But ultimately, between your ears is where the action is.

227
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:48,860
That's the difference between winning and losing.

228
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:56,620
And that was part of the mountain that we had to climb with this crazy thing called the America's Cup that had never been won by any nation for over a century.

229
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:06,539
I love hearing you talk about the psychology of sport, and I'll get to, you know, you imparting that on the culture of swimming in Australia with great success.

230
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:20,779
But to go into the detail a little bit, you know, you, legendary, even when you, the arch nemesis, Dennis Conner, and even the handshake, you wanted to make sure your handshake was over the top of his handshake, and you went to great lengths.

231
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:36,440
Am I correct in understanding the boxing kangaroo flag was a creation of you and your crew in lots of ways, and having that flying on the boat, because you wanted a powerful symbol, and even having men at work down there, having a music track that was a powerful, strong, that was the sort of detail you went into.

232
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah.

233
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,539
To create that psyche to overcome the Americans?

234
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:39,860
Yes.

235
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,500
Is that all correct?

236
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,940
Yes, it's totally correct.

237
00:13:41,940 --> 00:14:00,480
So when you study us humans, when we've gone to war over the last 1,000 years, typically we go to war, and I've never been to war, so, you know, I never want to, but we've gone to war typically with symbols, flags, and music.

238
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,259
So we created our own battle flag, and that was a boxing kangaroo flag, red gloves for aggression.

239
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Pumped up chest to take on the world.

240
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,279
When you look at the stance of the boxing kangaroo flag, it's ready to fight, and the gloves are all about aggression.

241
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,940
So that was part of the, you might say, you know, the thinking behind it.

242
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,720
And the men at work battle down under was our battle hymn.

243
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:35,500
We brought the biggest loudspeakers we could, and when we left the dock in Newport, Rhode Island, we had maximum volume on our tender, Black Swan, men at work down under, and the flag was broken out.

244
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
And we went, you know.

245
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,200
We're off to war in the world of sport.

246
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:48,519
It's brilliant, and as I said, I can't recommend highly enough to go and see it, you know, beautifully done via the Netflix forum, bring it all back to life.

247
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:55,940
They capture it incredibly well, and as you said at the start of this conversation, John, you don't just do it on your own.

248
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:05,059
You need it to have the whole organization, and there's some characters that I wanted to talk to you about that were instrumental in it, and get your reflections on it, again, if you don't mind.

249
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:06,259
Ben Lexen.

250
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:13,919
You described as the Leonardo da Vinci of Australia who designed that famous wind keel, which you weren't initially on board with at the start.

251
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,759
You had your reservations.

252
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,139
Can you tell us a bit about Ben and why that was so important?

253
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,980
Well, Benny, he was an orphan.

254
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:27,419
He went to school at nine and left at 12, and he was presumably unteachable.

255
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:36,240
So he's never, you know, I have two degrees in engineering, and I remember my professor at MIT saying, you know, involved advanced mathematics.

256
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:41,639
He said, until you put a problem into an equation, you can never solve it.

257
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:50,539
And it took me quite a long time working with people like Benny and Alan Bond to understand that that's not the case.

258
00:15:50,600 --> 00:16:02,799
This sense of intuition and gut feel, as well as, you know, being students of their area of activity, driven by passion, is really, really powerful.

259
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,399
And women have a great sense of intuitive feel, you know.

260
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:13,620
So us men, look, you know, we can meet someone, and we think they're a nice person, and the women can figure out straight away that they're dickheads or not.

261
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,659
It's so true, isn't it?

262
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,759
And any time I've got that wrong in my life, my wife's always been right.

263
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:19,019
Yep.

264
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,240
100% of the time.

265
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,419
That's right.

266
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:22,700
So why is it so?

267
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:23,980
Well, their brains are different.

268
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,399
They look at life differently.

269
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,559
Through their own prisms, you know, they have different.

270
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,480
So this is all the power of, in my opinion, sort of the lateral thinking or the intuitive feel.

271
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,960
Particularly, you know, women.

272
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,639
You know, Raza drives me nuts.

273
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:43,059
I give her a little bit of information, and she's straight on to it, and she's adding value before I can even finish what I'm talking about.

274
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,039
But the point is that Benny was a little bit like that, okay?

275
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,559
So he had this intuitive feel.

276
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:56,799
But for every 10 ideas, 8 would be crazy, but 2 of them were, gee, you know, really interesting.

277
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:04,119
Benny was a student of life, and he was a student of nature, and he was different.

278
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:04,759
For example.

279
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,299
And this is true.

280
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,839
To wash his clothes, he'd go into the shower and scrub with his clothes on, right?

281
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,799
And in some cases, up in Sydney, if the weather was warm enough, he'd just walk around until the clothes dried.

282
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,400
So we are talking about a different cat here.

283
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,140
That's a unique way to get the clothes clean.

284
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:23,579
Yeah.

285
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,480
He was the godfather of our son, Lucas, who's now 48 years old.

286
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:29,759
So we're talking about a long time ago.

287
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,740
And the man was brilliant.

288
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,359
You know, as I say, you know, he was, in my opinion, he was the Leonardo.

289
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,640
He was the Leonardo da Vinci of this country, in terms of his, you know, his ability to just be out there.

290
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,700
And so he was the creator of this thing called the Winged Keel.

291
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:50,880
And when we first, when I first saw it, you mentioned before, I had reservations, absolutely,

292
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,900
because I'd been involved with Ben's first project.

293
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:59,960
I was assistant designer straight out of MIT in 1974, Southern Cross, and it was a dog.

294
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,900
The boat was slow.

295
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,380
And I said, Benny, just give us something equal, and we can play the game.

296
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,779
But for God's sake, you know, what are we doing with this stuff?

297
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,119
But at any rate, I'm sure he manipulated the coefficients in the computer.

298
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,220
But he said that this boat's going to win the America's Cup by half an hour every race.

299
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,400
You've got to love that confidence.

300
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:28,079
But to get back to the psyche, John, you know, having the sheet around that Winged Keel and the mystique of what that created,

301
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,559
it was clearly a fast boat and had some advantages.

302
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,980
But playing back into you and getting the psychology,

303
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,960
it spooked the Americans a bit, didn't it?

304
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,460
The fact that there was something mysterious going on as well.

305
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,579
Was that a big part of?

306
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:41,859
It was, in the end.

307
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,099
We didn't realize how big a deal it was going to be.

308
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,259
But in looking back on their decision-making under extreme pressure,

309
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,579
the psychology of not knowing what they're racing against.

310
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:58,079
And Dennis Conner, my counterpart, skipper of the American Defender,

311
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,759
he wrote a book called No Excuses to Lose,

312
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:04,779
which is all about if you out-fundraise and out-research and out-train,

313
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,539
relative to the opposition, then there's no excuse.

314
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,339
And it's a damn good philosophy of life in many ways.

315
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,940
And so that was fine.

316
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:16,980
Our win-loss ratio, because we had to race against a whole bunch of other nations,

317
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:19,240
the Canadians and the Brits and the French and Italians,

318
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,460
before we won the right to challenge for the America's Cup.

319
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:31,240
In that period, I think we won 48 out of 56 races over a period of summer, five months of racing.

320
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,539
Our win-loss ratio is very, very high.

321
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,259
We had a terrific package.

322
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,099
Not only the win-kill, but the sale development, a whole bunch of stuff,

323
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:41,140
such that we were world-class, as it turns out.

324
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:49,019
And the net of it is that in that final race, which they called the race of the century,

325
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,400
they made more mistakes than we did.

326
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,019
Simple as that.

327
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,799
It's going to be Australia 2.

328
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:58,200
They are going to win it.

329
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,599
Stand up, Australia.

330
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,240
Stand up, Australia.

331
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:03,160
And give these boys a cheer.

332
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,380
We are looking for this bloke at any moment.

333
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,779
They're about to do it.

334
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:08,500
They're about to cross the line.

335
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,059
They make a final move.

336
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,759
There it goes.

337
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,579
Yeah.

338
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,480
And almost the perfect race that you sailed in that last leg.

339
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,640
You were down 51 seconds in the final race,

340
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,500
which was the second biggest lead of any time throughout the seven-race series.

341
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,500
And as you said, you didn't make a mistake.

342
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:31,960
And they did.

343
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:34,779
Can I ask you, I've got a couple more characters to come back to that,

344
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,299
you know, the Australian Prime Minister has won.

345
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:38,460
I don't want to talk to you about Alan Bond.

346
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,500
But what was your relationship like with Dennis Conner?

347
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:47,740
Afterwards and as life has gone on, was there a friendship or was there respect?

348
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,339
What was it like?

349
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:50,160
Well, respect, clearly.

350
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,220
Friendship, you know, us Australians have a different type of friendship than America.

351
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,039
Americans in a lot of cases is, and again, this is a broad brush.

352
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,119
In the US, it's maybe considered more transactional.

353
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:03,779
Okay.

354
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,900
Is there an opportunity?

355
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,140
There is a deal there or whatever business relationship.

356
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,059
In Australia, it transcends that.

357
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,299
I think it's just the way we are.

358
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,039
Which I love.

359
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,099
But so with Dennis, you know what?

360
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,559
We really haven't talked about the America's Cup since that final race.

361
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,400
Together, when you've caught up?

362
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:21,839
Correct.

363
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,700
And I've raced against Dennis quite a lot in the actual class.

364
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,400
And they were, you know, highly competitive.

365
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,619
It doesn't matter where we are in the fleet.

366
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,440
We always kind of understand where the other bloke is.

367
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:38,119
But, you know, this thing cuts deep.

368
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,299
You know, to lose.

369
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:44,440
You know, it was to be the first to lose was a big deal.

370
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:48,000
And I fully respect and understand that.

371
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,440
It's an amazing, amazing story.

372
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,099
And a character like him, it's sort of Shakespearean in some ways, isn't it?

373
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,279
You're very different, but clearly that's lasted a lifetime.

374
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,740
Speaking of extraordinary character, Alan Bond, you know, again,

375
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,240
for those younger, may not know, legendary Australian business figure.

376
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,900
And, you know, had some tragedy late in life.

377
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,460
And people have their own judgments on that.

378
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:11,319
But really, for him to fight.

379
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:14,759
And fund, you know, because it was the fourth boat that he'd funded, wasn't it?

380
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:15,400
America's Cup.

381
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,799
So tell us about Alan Bond, your relationship with him and how you view him.

382
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,700
Well, I first met Alan when I got involved with that America's Cup way back in 1974,

383
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:28,359
Southern Cross, and Benny was the designer.

384
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:36,220
So the way to describe Alan was he was a technically broke property developer out of Perth.

385
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,400
At that stage.

386
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,119
At that stage.

387
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,059
Having the audacity to challenge for the America's Cup.

388
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:44,660
When he was 34 years old, he had no idea what he was doing.

389
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,440
All right.

390
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:51,059
And nor did Benny and the boat, you know, was slow or whatever, but, you know,

391
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:54,539
not with great intent, but we just, we're not in the game.

392
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,539
But you know what?

393
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:58,579
He kept coming back and back and back.

394
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:01,099
So he lost, you know, we lost 74.

395
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,140
I didn't go back in 1977.

396
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:11,039
I said, I got involved with the, won a bronze medal at the Olympics in Montreal and then built our own

397
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:15,099
business here in Australia, 1980, beaten again.

398
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,000
I was involved then, as it turns out, and then 83.

399
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So you talk about resilience and, you know, Alan, and Alan's, his motivation was different.

400
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,019
Everyone has a different, you know, reason for being involved with this crazy event.

401
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:37,920
His business was to move from a local trader to a global trader.

402
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:41,000
So the best way to describe Alan is when we won.

403
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,259
He went straight to Wall Street.

404
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,220
He had every investment banker wanting to meet him and every Saudi Arabian prince,

405
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,019
most importantly, wanting to lend him money.

406
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,539
Show me the money.

407
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,519
And he had, so there was, there was method behind the, the, the alignment.

408
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:02,519
He was, he was clear on, and, and, and at a point in time, I mean, how big, for those who don't

409
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,900
understand, Alan Bond bought everything.

410
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:04,420
He did.

411
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,440
He was into Chile.

412
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:09,000
He, he controlled the telecommunications system in Chile.

413
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:09,960
Correct.

414
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:10,819
Not only Australia.

415
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:11,319
Not only in London.

416
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,680
And, and Rome.

417
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,779
He had major shopping centres outside of Rome that he was developing.

418
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:21,319
So give me a dollar and I'll make two dollars on it on the way through and borrow a whole

419
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:22,920
heap on the way as a result.

420
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:24,779
So he was an amazing entrepreneur.

421
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,019
Was it money in the end?

422
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:28,720
No, it, it was power.

423
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:30,579
It was influence for Alan.

424
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,299
There was no stopping him.

425
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:37,240
And it was like, ultimately the whole thing blew apart, you know, with the financial.

426
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:38,779
He went to jail, Alan Bond.

427
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:39,220
He did.

428
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:39,859
That's right.

429
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,720
How was that for you?

430
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,460
Then to have, there's such a piece of history that you're so connected to.

431
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,480
Was that a, was that challenging?

432
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,740
I mean, clearly I'm upsetting and challenging.

433
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,160
Yes.

434
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,720
Well, I communicated with Alan in jail, but typical of Bondy, God bless him.

435
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,640
He had the, uh, he had the inmates organised and he's giving them lessons on business.

436
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,740
So there's no podcast in those days.

437
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,019
It was just one-on-one and he had his own clientele.

438
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:07,940
Amazing.

439
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:08,259
Yeah.

440
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:08,500
Yeah.

441
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah.

442
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,099
Incredible part of the story.

443
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:14,140
We were, Bob Hawke's the prime minister at the time and, and, and this probably was

444
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,400
the thing that transcended his prime ministership in lots of ways.

445
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:20,119
I mean, Bob Hawke, uh, floated the dollar.

446
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,799
He did lots of things that strategically changed the course of Australian history, but he's

447
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,779
probably remembered for that famous quote more than anything.

448
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,579
I tell you what, any boss who sacks anyone for not turning up the day is a bum.

449
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,559
For an Australian prime minister to say that makes me smile still to think about it.

450
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,559
For anyone around the world.

451
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:39,440
The Yanks.

452
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,579
They couldn't believe that the prime minister of a country of Australia would be saying

453
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:44,839
such outrageous stuff.

454
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,460
But what I loved in the documentary, you shared a story for you, it was even more powerful

455
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:54,680
was that in the lead up to the final race, he got on the phone and you, I think you said

456
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,660
to him, we're going to do our best.

457
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,279
And his response was, what did he say back to you?

458
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:00,500
Well, it's actually in person.

459
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,940
So as it turns out, uh, uh, prime minister Hawke, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, the new

460
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,319
treasurer, newly elected.

461
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,720
Uh, you know, uh, in, uh, you know, the party, the labor party of Australia, they happened

462
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,099
to be at an international monetary conference in Washington, DC.

463
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,619
And, uh, as it turns out, they were down at the boat for the first race of the America's

464
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:24,819
cup.

465
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:32,519
And I remember, uh, you know, uh, Paul Keating in the background with his Australia to, you

466
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:34,400
know, Australian wool jersey on.

467
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,819
So Bondi comes down to the boat.

468
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,420
This is the first race of the America's cup.

469
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,900
So we'd gone through the trials, the Louis Vuitton cup and so on.

470
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,500
And we won that.

471
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,680
And, uh, you know, you can't practice this environments again, a little bit like the

472
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,000
MCG, a hundred thousand people.

473
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:52,880
You can't, you can't practice that environment and the, and the intensity of it.

474
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,279
Well, you can a little bit with Australian footy because you do get big crowds and you've

475
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,420
whatever, but this thing, there's every four years, it's a new world.

476
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,140
So you, anyway, so five minutes to nine, we'd leave the boat, leave the dock at nine o'clock

477
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,380
plus or minus 30 seconds a minute.

478
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:09,240
Again.

479
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,259
Military operation.

480
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,220
And, uh, so their new prime minister came down to the boat and I was on the stern of

481
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,220
the boat, the back of the boat.

482
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:21,400
And, uh, and we're just about to break out the boxing kangaroo flag and the music was

483
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,119
about to, uh, to arc up.

484
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,039
And he says, he said, I say to him, well, you know, what do you say?

485
00:27:27,099 --> 00:27:29,539
I said, uh, welcome Mr. Prime minister.

486
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,839
And he's in his gravelly voice.

487
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,740
He says, Johnny says, call me Bob.

488
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,200
I said, well, he said, uh, what are you going to do?

489
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,440
I said, well, Bob, we'll give it our best shot.

490
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,740
He says, bullshit.

491
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,599
He says, destroy the bastards.

492
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,559
So that's, you know, the prime minister of our country, you talk about a communication

493
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,220
ability.

494
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,400
He was unbelievable.

495
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:58,579
And when he actually said, and we, we weren't here at the time, we're half around the world,

496
00:27:58,579 --> 00:28:04,460
you know, Newport, but anyone who sacks anyway to today, anyone who sacks anyone for being

497
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,480
late today is a bum.

498
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,220
That was not pre-rehearsed.

499
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,140
I know that.

500
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:09,259
It was typical.

501
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,740
Bob Hawke in his ability to capture the essence of the moment and that's communication, you

502
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,519
know, that's leadership.

503
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,859
So what I learned from that, and I spent a little time with, you know, uh, with Bob Hawke,

504
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:27,400
you know, following over the years, uh, is his, his great sense of leadership through

505
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,640
being able to capture the essence of the time.

506
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And that is an eight year old going back.

507
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:33,319
That was the thing you heard.

508
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,660
This is the prime minister of our country.

509
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,900
He's, it's that big.

510
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,220
It made it big for you, as you said, by, you know,

511
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:44,039
an unrehearsed line that, that has stood the test of time, uh, it captured the moment.

512
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:49,720
And he, he, he, you know, he said, basically all the great things, floating the dollar

513
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,079
and deregulating the financial system in this country is unbelievable what they achieved.

514
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,099
He and Keating, the words that were remembered was that line.

515
00:28:59,559 --> 00:28:59,660
Yeah.

516
00:28:59,880 --> 00:28:59,900
Yeah.

517
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,839
It's, and he's proud of it too.

518
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,660
Yeah.

519
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,640
What a great chapter in our, in our history of our country and to have the prime minister

520
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,200
sum it up, uh, he's, uh, he's equally as proud.

521
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:15,279
You know, I could talk for, for, for days about what you achieved in 1983, but to see

522
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:20,180
you overlay your leadership into every other area of your life, I find equally fascinating.

523
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,259
The Australian, uh, swim team is probably from an Olympic point of view, the most prestigious

524
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:31,680
group that win medals lost its way, uh, only one, one gold in London and hadn't lots of

525
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,980
cultural and behavioral issues.

526
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:38,500
And John Bertrand steps up to the plate and, and, and you bring your psychology and your

527
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,200
leadership to swim.

528
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,240
Uh, swimming, uh, Australia with great success.

529
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,779
Tokyo's the most successful Olympics the Australian swim team's ever had.

530
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:48,000
Can you tell us about how you went about instilling that in the, in the swim team?

531
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:53,079
Well, uh, I was approached initially, uh, by one of the directors, Clem Doherty, former

532
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:56,720
partner of McKinsey's, uh, who I knew previously.

533
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:01,019
He asked me whether I'd consider taking on the chairmanship role of swimming Australia

534
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:04,279
because it, it was, you know, it, it had its issues.

535
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:09,200
And I initially said no, but anyway, he came back a few times and eventually I said, uh,

536
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,900
I said, there, let's give this a shot.

537
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:15,339
I didn't have any swimming background at all, which was, as it turns out, an advantage.

538
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,799
So I went in as a clean skin, you might say.

539
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,460
Lots of politics, you know, these, these, uh, amount of organizations, great intent,

540
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:28,660
but so much, so many people, so much passion or, you know, lots of blood on the water,

541
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,460
I can tell you.

542
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,299
And, um, primarily, uh, it was dysfunctional when I first sort of saw the whole thing.

543
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:38,039
It lacked trust.

544
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:43,400
Which is so important when your back's to the wall and it lacked, lacked a vision.

545
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:48,960
And, um, so as I came in as chair, I said, yeah, this is of national importance.

546
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,019
Let's give this a shot for better or worse.

547
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:58,440
So I embarked on the journey just after the London Olympics in 2013 and, uh, major, major

548
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,480
changes internally.

549
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:07,079
But primarily, I guess, if you talk about the major positions and change, it was, uh,

550
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:08,019
and again, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it

551
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:08,279
was complex.

552
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:08,559
And then at school I got mad.

553
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:08,680
It was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was so hard.

554
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,220
But overall, it was, it was, it was fantastic.

555
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:14,539
And I was proud of my full potential, um, you know, coming from the school of hard knocks

556
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,980
and losing as well as a bit of winning with the world of America's Cup.

557
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,079
Um, part of my sort of added value was this vision of what's this game going to look like

558
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,720
in 10 years' time.

559
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,599
Let's get there faster than anyone else in the world.

560
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,200
Okay?

561
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,339
So take the blinkers off.

562
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:30,960
And it was based on my own experience with the Olympics where you every, the Olympics

563
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,220
is really the cutting edge of human endeavor.

564
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:33,940
There's no confusion or either cut well out there from them.

565
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,940
And here is hard, going to win right there today, there is no confusion.

566
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,319
You either win or you're a bum.

567
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:38,059
There's no confusion out there.

568
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:42,740
You know, I won the leather medal at the German Olympics, fourth place.

569
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:43,619
It's worse than last.

570
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,559
And other than mum and the kids, nobody cares, okay?

571
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,740
Eventually I got on the platform, on the podium and won the bronze.

572
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,940
And, you know, in Montreal, thank goodness, you know, my God,

573
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
the difference between fourth and third is unbelievable.

574
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,740
So, you know, with no money, no coaching, no anything.

575
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:01,940
But at any rate, if you look at any four-year period,

576
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,900
you get improvement in performance, 100-meter sprint, throwing a javelin.

577
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:08,960
Interesting enough, any 10 or 20, particularly 20-year period

578
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,440
of the Olympic movement, a quantum leap in performance.

579
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:14,359
So the question is not why is it so.

580
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:18,039
It's just that history tells us that in 20 years' time,

581
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:22,339
playing the game of this thing called the America's Cup

582
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:24,420
will be much further progressed than what it is now.

583
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,279
AFL football, the industry of podcasting,

584
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,759
what we're doing now in 10 years' time, you know,

585
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,960
it's hard to imagine.

586
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,319
It's hard to imagine the way this thing will evolve,

587
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,079
but it's here, it's fast, it's growing.

588
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:41,079
Human endeavor, the human brain is amazing.

589
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:47,200
You know, the suggestion is that we use maybe 9% or 10% of the potential

590
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,759
of this incredible computer hanging between our ears, the brain,

591
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,539
the massive supercomputer, okay?

592
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:53,859
Yeah.

593
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:57,380
If we can move to 10 or 11, sorry, 11 or 12%,

594
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,980
you have major, major breakthrough.

595
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,660
So when we look at human endeavor, Olympics,

596
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,859
you get improvement in performance, there's no question.

597
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:07,880
Same analogy for this crazy thing called the America's Cup.

598
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,920
So part of my, and same with Swimming Australia,

599
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:16,420
we do not know what freestyle will look like in 10 years' time.

600
00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:17,619
That's got to be the mentality.

601
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:22,079
Freestyle, it was originally called the Australian Crawl

602
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:24,180
in the late 20s, 1920s.

603
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,980
Other than the head going down, the human body getting stronger,

604
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,960
okay, nutrition, whole bunch of stuff, nothing's changed.

605
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:33,940
So got to,

606
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,539
bring in the supercomputers, computational flow dynamics,

607
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,299
CFD from the World of America's Cup.

608
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:44,200
Let's start analyzing the human form going through this viscous fluid called water,

609
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,380
which is just drag.

610
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:47,799
How do you actually reduce your drag?

611
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:50,759
Forgetting about increasing the power with strokes and so on.

612
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,980
What's this game going to look like in 10 years' time?

613
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,079
So that was kind of my craziness that I brought to the table of, okay,

614
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:03,119
we think we understand what world best practice is, led particularly by the United States,

615
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:03,940
the U.S.

616
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,759
Swimming team, domination all the way through.

617
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,539
We think we understand that, but that's fine.

618
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:10,699
How do we get there faster than anyone else in the world?

619
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:15,659
You know, that we know will be much further progressed than what it is now.

620
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:16,500
So it was part of it.

621
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,179
The other way is this thing called trust.

622
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:24,389
Again, you know, from your experience, you understand that, you know,

623
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:28,849
in the backs to the wall, you're in the trenches, you're fighting for each other.

624
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:29,449
Okay.

625
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:31,670
At that stage, you're not fighting for your country.

626
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,570
You're fighting for your mates out on the field in their case.

627
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,250
You're fighting for America's Cup.

628
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,250
How do you build trust?

629
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:43,250
Well, trust comes from leadership, no question, and then people picking up on it.

630
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:47,250
It's based around integrity and honesty, basic stuff.

631
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,250
We're not talking about rocket science here.

632
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,250
We're talking about transparency.

633
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:54,250
Whatever you say you do, no bullshit.

634
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,250
We're talking about having fun.

635
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,250
You know, particularly us Aussies, we've got to have fun.

636
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:04,750
Because if you're asking people to be involved seven by 24, not nine to five,

637
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,750
you know, total commitment, then you're going to have fun.

638
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,750
It's got to be a blast to be involved with these like-minded people.

639
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,750
No dickheads, as the All Blacks say.

640
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,750
How good is that?

641
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,750
We understand what that means.

642
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:20,750
And when you start to bring a team together and leadership from, you know,

643
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:24,750
a crazy person like myself saying these sort of things repeatedly and just –

644
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,750
and you've got to say something at least three times before people can walk away thinking,

645
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,750
is that what he really said?

646
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,750
As long as you keep it simple as well.

647
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,750
You can't get too complicated.

648
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:38,750
And incidentally, the Americans are very good at storytelling.

649
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:42,750
They're very good at, in my opinion, communicating an idea.

650
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,750
That's one of their strengths.

651
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:50,750
So anyway, so once you start to build a team, a group of people where you are talking about trust

652
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:56,750
and you have a vision that this is what the game is we think now, but how – where do we go?

653
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,750
Let's take the blinkers off.

654
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,750
Let's back people like Benny Lexen and others.

655
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,750
Where is this game going?

656
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:06,750
Then you start to build – you can build something extremely formidable.

657
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,750
You know, we do not know where business will be in 20 years' time.

658
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:17,750
You know, this advent of this fantastic new development called the Internet, global communication,

659
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,750
the fact that this podcast is going global, you know,

660
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:24,750
and some of your business activities you're telling me, you know, that's a global vision.

661
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,750
It's not local.

662
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:31,750
And so we are now connected to the world and the speed of development.

663
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:38,750
You know, we're on an asymptotic curve going north in human endeavor.

664
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:43,750
So that's – so when we're talking about what do I bring to the table, Luke,

665
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:47,750
it was really this whole issue of taking the blinkers off.

666
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:52,750
I know with no swimming background at all and saying, okay, let's reach for the stars.

667
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:56,750
Let's – as we – as I used to say, let's release the beast.

668
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,750
Let's empower our young people in particular.

669
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,750
Yeah.

670
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:06,750
Who have no fear and no scar tissue which can hold people back.

671
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,750
And let's release the potential of what we've got here.

672
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,750
And that was really part of my – I guess, you know, my added value with this thing called

673
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,750
Swimming Australia Olympic Swim Team.

674
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,750
What a great success story too, John.

675
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:25,750
It's a masterclass this year and you talk about – you know, it sounds simple when you articulate it.

676
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:28,750
But as you said, with the politics and the powers that be, you know,

677
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,750
and you see it when great successes.

678
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,750
And organizations get that harmony.

679
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,750
And I love that idea, isn't it?

680
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:38,750
For all the endeavors that we've got, there's going to be quantum shifts, isn't there, every 10 years.

681
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:44,750
How do we think about, you know, what it's going to look like and then can we get there quicker is a worthwhile thing.

682
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,750
You can apply it to almost everything, can't you?

683
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,750
Everything.

684
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:48,750
Doesn't matter what.

685
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:57,750
Interesting enough, also through my relationship with the Chief of Army, General Rick Burr, wonderful man, former head of SAS operations,

686
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,750
and head of all NATO special forces in Europe.

687
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,750
And we did the Kokoda track together.

688
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:07,750
Wonderful man called Ron Barassi, number 31.

689
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,750
One of the all-time great people.

690
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:13,750
And I know a lot of people on that group that did the track with you.

691
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,750
Dipper.

692
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,750
The great Dipper.

693
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,750
And I think my father-in-law, David Shaw, might have been part of that group.

694
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,750
Yes.

695
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,750
And Rick was part of that.

696
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,750
Rick Burr.

697
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:25,750
He was then a Colonel, Rick Burr.

698
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,750
Yes.

699
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,750
This was probably 17 years ago.

700
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,750
His career has been remarkable.

701
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:34,750
At any rate, Rick has become a wonderful, wonderful friend.

702
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:42,750
And so, as a result, I was able to get the Australian Swim Program introduced into our special forces military,

703
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:47,750
which was a really, again, benchmarking world best practice.

704
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,750
And they are in the business of trust.

705
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,750
Okay.

706
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,750
Talking to Rick, we walked the Kokoda track through Rick's eyes.

707
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,750
Okay.

708
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,750
We had 19-year-old kids defending this country.

709
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,750
No military backup.

710
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,750
No nothing.

711
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,750
Okay.

712
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:07,750
Fighting a much more superior force, the Japanese coming through, highly trained,

713
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,750
you know, jungle fighters.

714
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:15,750
Our guys had World War III, sorry, World War I issue 303 rifles.

715
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,750
No camouflage uniforms.

716
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,750
Nothing.

717
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:19,750
Okay.

718
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:24,750
And I said, you know, I remember Rick saying, you know, at that stage, what are these people fighting for?

719
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,750
We're talking about trust here.

720
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,750
And he said, at that stage, it's not the country.

721
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,750
It's not even your family back home.

722
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:33,750
It's your mates in the trenches, in the water, up there and, you know, take the boots off.

723
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,750
The skin comes off on the boots.

724
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:39,750
Put the boots back on and go back to help your mates.

725
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:45,750
So they, when we talk about trust, they, Rick recommended a book, and I think, I'm not sure exactly the title,

726
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,750
but I think it's in the order of The Circle of Trust.

727
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:54,750
And that is, you cannot build an organization beyond the perimeter of trust.

728
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,750
The perimeter of trust that you have within your organization.

729
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:03,750
So special forces like SAS commandos, their operations can be halfway around the world.

730
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:08,750
If their perimeter doesn't extend to where their people are, you don't have trust.

731
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,750
You can't operate.

732
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,750
And I think that's a fascinating concept.

733
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:18,750
So they put, you know, they do their 10,000 hours plus plus in terms of preparation or whatever.

734
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,750
But it gets back to this very, very simple thing deep down in the gut.

735
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,750
In the gut of trust without, throughout an organization.

736
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,750
And it's not when the good times are on.

737
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,750
It's when the tough times, when your back's to the wall.

738
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:38,750
And can you, you know, do these, you know, can you, then you're starting to get into a world of one plus one equals three.

739
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,750
And that's what a beautiful thing that is.

740
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:45,750
The story of Kokoda is, you know, such a legend.

741
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,750
Mostly farm hands, as you said, ill-equipped.

742
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:51,750
The Japanese army at that stage hadn't ever been stopped in its tracks.

743
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,750
And, you know, against all odds.

744
00:40:53,750 --> 00:41:00,750
And then the thought if, you know, if a bit of Papua New Guinea was taken, then the ramifications were enormous, weren't they?

745
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,750
And so no wonder that's been a pilgrimage for Australians to walk that track.

746
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:14,750
And the original army, sorry, our main fighting force was over in the Middle East, okay, helping the Brits.

747
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:22,750
And our military people, kids sent to Port Moresby, they were called the Chocos.

748
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,750
They were all the rejects.

749
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,750
And the idea was put them under pressure and they'll melt like chocolate.

750
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,750
So there's no training.

751
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,750
They were sent over there to build an airport.

752
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:37,750
And then they realized that the Japanese were coming through the jungle, over the Kokoda track, through the mountains.

753
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,750
So there's just no training, no nothing.

754
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:43,750
But these, what these kids did for each other.

755
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,750
Incredible story, isn't it?

756
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,750
Incredible story, leadership.

757
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:50,750
And you bringing that into swimming and changing the culture and seeing that success, John.

758
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,750
I love you keep coming back to training.

759
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,750
I love you keep coming back to trust.

760
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:59,750
It's, you know, where we hear a lot of, but when you implement it properly and the trust of your crew in America's Cup,

761
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:04,750
the trust that you build in swimming that was dysfunctional at the time is a great story.

762
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:09,750
Well, a comment there is that when we're 3-1 down, okay, during the America's Cup, we had to get from,

763
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:13,750
so the Yanks got up to three all and all they had to do is win one more race.

764
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:19,750
So we came from 3-1 down to 3-2 to 3-3 and eventually won that final race.

765
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,750
Okay.

766
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:27,750
And the organization was extremely tight and, and, and trust was total.

767
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:34,750
So we were a hard organ, we were basically almost an impossible organization to kill off.

768
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:37,750
And the Yanks threw everything at us.

769
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:45,750
But, you know, this whole issue of we're pretty much impossible to kill off as a competing organization.

770
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,750
That's pretty formidable.

771
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,750
And part of it, the technology was there, et cetera.

772
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:56,750
But, you know, the guts, the glue was this thing called the trust throughout the organization for each other.

773
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:02,750
We're literally willing, and let's face it, it's only a sporting event, but we're willing to die for each other.

774
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:19,829
On the eve of that last race, the Americans went in and Dennis Connors got the ruling to be able to change the setup of their boat,

775
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:27,829
which it was a technicality that didn't feel like it was, you know, in keeping with, with the spirit,

776
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:28,829
but they were going to do anything, the Americans.

777
00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:33,829
They, you know, their refusal to, that would have unnerved a lot of crews at that stage,

778
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:35,829
knowing that they were going to be able to adjust their boat.

779
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:40,829
But as you said, the, the trust that your team had, you were unable to be killed.

780
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:41,829
Yeah.

781
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:42,829
Yeah.

782
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:48,829
Well, we're, we're, as it turns out, we're pretty, it was a, it was a very, very good team.

783
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:49,829
There's no question about it.

784
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:50,829
Yeah.

785
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:57,829
John, we've been talking to different leaders and your stories is profound in Australian history around what great leadership looks like in the current context.

786
00:43:57,829 --> 00:44:03,829
And it's a passion I was sharing with you before for the, the world of a leader of business we've created,

787
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:08,829
where we're connecting different leaders together from around the globe and trying to identify great leadership.

788
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:09,829
And we see these common traits.

789
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:11,829
I want to ask you about some of them.

790
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:15,829
We see all leaders really have a sense of self-leadership as, as a place where you start.

791
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:19,829
And does that term resonate with you, a sense of self-leadership?

792
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:20,829
What do you mean by that?

793
00:44:20,829 --> 00:44:26,829
For me, it means the idea that if I'm going to be able to lead anyone else, I really have to live those values.

794
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:30,829
And I need to live up to the same set of values that I want others to, to do.

795
00:44:30,829 --> 00:44:34,829
So for me, it's about the daily routines and the habits is what I think self-leadership.

796
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:36,829
It means different things to other people, but.

797
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:37,829
Yeah.

798
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:38,829
Well, it's interesting.

799
00:44:38,829 --> 00:44:42,829
I hadn't thought about it that way, but primarily we're talking about authenticity.

800
00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:45,829
This, this word authentic is used a lot.

801
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:54,829
But I think what you're saying, and I understand that, I think it's a, you know, less, you can't bullshit people, you know.

802
00:44:54,829 --> 00:44:55,829
You know, we talk about it.

803
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:56,829
Yeah.

804
00:44:56,829 --> 00:44:57,829
We talked about it before.

805
00:44:57,829 --> 00:45:01,829
Craig McRae, okay, the Collingwood coach.

806
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:06,829
Phenomenal story, this whole journey with, and of being a Collingwood supporter.

807
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,829
But what you see with Craig is what you get.

808
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:10,829
There's no confusion there.

809
00:45:10,829 --> 00:45:14,829
So it's not as if he's, you know, he's moving from one idea to another.

810
00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:16,829
It's, it's really, is, is it basic?

811
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:19,829
No, it's not basic because he's really, really, he's, you know, he's a student of life.

812
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:20,829
He's always learning.

813
00:45:20,829 --> 00:45:22,829
He's, he's inquisitive.

814
00:45:22,829 --> 00:45:23,829
He's curious.

815
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:24,829
It's wonderful stuff.

816
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:25,829
But authentic?

817
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:26,829
Authentic?

818
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:27,829
Absolutely.

819
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:28,829
The bloke is authentic.

820
00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:31,829
And people can figure that out real fast.

821
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:41,829
At Harvard Business School, they have a authentic leadership course, which has been extremely successful for, you know, some of our people.

822
00:45:41,829 --> 00:45:47,829
And, you know, this whole issue of living the values, yeah, I understand what you're saying.

823
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:48,829
Yeah, I love you.

824
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:54,829
You mentioned Craig, and for those who don't follow Australian Ross football, we took a team that was 17th, John's team.

825
00:45:54,829 --> 00:45:58,829
And I say to a lot of people, if you don't bear for Collingwood, people won't understand.

826
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:00,829
Everyone hates Collingwood, historically.

827
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:04,829
But he made everyone, I think, love and respect.

828
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:13,829
Just, as you said, purely with his authenticity and everything he did and all his language and whatever the circumstances were, you could just feel that pour out of him.

829
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:22,829
It was, and the playing group behind, who on paper, John, you look at and think sort of talent for talent at the moment, they're probably not at the level that they played at.

830
00:46:22,829 --> 00:46:23,829
Yeah.

831
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:24,829
But he's incredible authenticity.

832
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:27,829
I'm not surprised you referenced that.

833
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:36,829
Another dimension we see, John, leaders are really conscious around how they positively impact other people in their environments, you know, in real time.

834
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:39,829
Have you thought about that, that positive impact on people?

835
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:40,829
No question.

836
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:46,829
You know, I've never seen a successful leader who's naturally negative, you know, and a pessimist.

837
00:46:46,829 --> 00:46:51,829
Gee, you know, this whole issue of seeing the best of everyone.

838
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:52,829
Yeah.

839
00:46:52,829 --> 00:46:58,829
And the best of any situation and or figuring out how you get there, you know, natural inclination.

840
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:00,829
That's all part and parcel of leadership.

841
00:47:00,829 --> 00:47:05,829
So, you know, leadership, I think, very much into positive frame of mind, its ability to communicate.

842
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:07,829
No question about it.

843
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:10,829
It's a set of values that people can aspire to.

844
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:16,829
You know, this new, you know, the young people now, the values of leadership, extremely important.

845
00:47:16,829 --> 00:47:21,829
We see that in terms of the way the companies are and, you know, setting up their value propositions and so on.

846
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:23,829
But it has to come from leaders.

847
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:26,829
It can't be just with a whole bunch of words that mean nothing.

848
00:47:26,829 --> 00:47:39,829
And primarily it, you know, living, as I said, living the values and, you know, using this word called authentic, which is true, is part and parcel.

849
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:47,829
Yeah, it's what anyone, but particularly new generation of people now figure out real fast.

850
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:48,829
Yeah.

851
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:49,829
I love what you said.

852
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:50,829
You haven't seen anyone really lead.

853
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:51,829
No.

854
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:52,829
Successfully with a negative mindset.

855
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:53,829
No.

856
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:54,829
And as you get older in life, you sort of, there is, you know, you go, you gravitate towards the like, don't you?

857
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:55,829
That's right.

858
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:56,829
And negative people become hard to, you know, authentically, we all have negative moments, which being authentic, as you said, is a big part of it.

859
00:47:56,829 --> 00:47:57,829
Yeah.

860
00:47:57,829 --> 00:47:58,829
But I love the way you said it.

861
00:47:58,829 --> 00:47:59,829
We see leaders are really conscious around how they create and share their vision.

862
00:47:59,829 --> 00:48:00,829
And your examples are a legend in our lifetime in Australia around having this vision and, you know, having this vision.

863
00:48:00,829 --> 00:48:01,829
Yeah.

864
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:02,829
Yeah.

865
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:03,829
Yeah.

866
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:04,829
Yeah.

867
00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:05,829
Yeah.

868
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:06,829
Yeah.

869
00:48:06,829 --> 00:48:07,829
Yeah.

870
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:08,829
Yeah.

871
00:48:08,829 --> 00:48:09,829
Yeah.

872
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:10,829
Yeah.

873
00:48:10,829 --> 00:48:11,829
Yeah.

874
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:12,829
Yeah.

875
00:48:12,829 --> 00:48:13,829
Yeah.

876
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:14,829
Yeah.

877
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:15,829
Yeah.

878
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:16,829
Yeah.

879
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:17,829
Yeah.

880
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:25,329
You've arrived at the approach of how you İn our lifetime in Australia around having this vision and firstly creating and then sharing it, particularly America's Cup, but certainly swimming as well.

881
00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:31,329
Can you delve into sort of the micro, how you went about creating that vision and sharing it?

882
00:48:31,329 --> 00:48:32,329
Gee.

883
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:34,969
Well, first of all, let me tell you a, a little story.

884
00:48:34,969 --> 00:48:37,150
John Longely reminded me of a couple of years ago.

885
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:43,409
He was a grinder and assistant manager on the doc with Warren Jones, our America's Cup

886
00:48:43,409 --> 00:48:44,409
record.

887
00:48:44,409 --> 00:48:46,409
I've forgotten what I said.

888
00:48:46,409 --> 00:48:47,409
But anyway.

889
00:48:47,409 --> 00:48:47,610
Yeah.

890
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:47,730
Yeah.

891
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:47,829
Yeah.

892
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:51,489
He reminded me, he said that race where we're so far behind,

893
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:53,530
the final race, the race of the century,

894
00:48:53,989 --> 00:48:55,650
we can hardly read their bloody numbers.

895
00:48:55,789 --> 00:48:56,929
That's how far back we were.

896
00:48:59,349 --> 00:49:01,730
Apparently, I said to the guys, I said,

897
00:49:01,789 --> 00:49:04,650
if we don't keep concentrating, we may lose this race.

898
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:11,469
So you're talking about positive, crazy positive at that stage.

899
00:49:12,269 --> 00:49:14,869
And it looked like the impossible challenge at that stage.

900
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:19,489
Yeah, 99% of the world would say it's impossible, forget it,

901
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,710
turn the television set off or whatever, go home.

902
00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:25,090
So anyway, apparently that's what I said.

903
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:28,670
Well, that's the mindset of a skipper of a boat

904
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:30,630
that eventually we're able to be successful.

905
00:49:30,889 --> 00:49:31,889
And a supreme optimist.

906
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:33,190
A supreme optimist.

907
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:36,230
Ask Raza, my wife, you know, drives her nuts.

908
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:40,670
I've met the beautiful Raza before many times.

909
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:44,690
Is that just you can't help but pivot towards the glass half full in everything?

910
00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:45,670
That's right, yeah.

911
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:48,150
And I think that's, for goodness sake,

912
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,849
if you're going to pivot, let's go positive.

913
00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:52,210
Let's get serious.

914
00:49:52,309 --> 00:49:53,909
We're only here for three score and 10 or whatever.

915
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:56,250
That's a good life lesson there.

916
00:49:56,309 --> 00:49:57,550
You mentioned curiosity before.

917
00:49:57,929 --> 00:49:59,630
We see leaders are really,

918
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,210
curiosity is a word that comes up a lot in leadership.

919
00:50:02,389 --> 00:50:07,710
And that's how a lot of leaders approach their constant desire to learn and improve.

920
00:50:07,969 --> 00:50:09,530
And that comes out in everything you say.

921
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:11,349
Does curiosity resonate with you?

922
00:50:11,489 --> 00:50:12,170
Oh, no question.

923
00:50:12,829 --> 00:50:13,989
One thing I think,

924
00:50:14,869 --> 00:50:19,269
I am proud of is I'm a student of life.

925
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:20,610
I've always asked,

926
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:24,590
I naturally love asking questions to find out more about what people are doing,

927
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:25,690
what things are happening.

928
00:50:26,429 --> 00:50:28,010
Apparently, you know, on the average,

929
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,289
when kids are growing up,

930
00:50:29,769 --> 00:50:32,329
you know, we've got a five-year-old granddaughter.

931
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:35,349
And she said, Pop, so why is the sky blue?

932
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:35,989
Okay.

933
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:37,550
And look at those birds.

934
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:39,590
Why can't we fly like those birds?

935
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:43,610
Pretty beautiful questions, for goodness sake.

936
00:50:43,769 --> 00:50:44,829
You know, the curiosity.

937
00:50:44,869 --> 00:50:49,969
And, but when children get to about the age 14,

938
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:52,289
they stop asking multiple questions.

939
00:50:52,989 --> 00:50:55,849
And most people flatten off in their curve

940
00:50:55,849 --> 00:50:59,429
and become just part of the society

941
00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:02,170
where in a lot of cases they buy a house

942
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:04,130
and they sit there for the rest of their life,

943
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:05,889
in Australia or whatever,

944
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,769
compared to the curiosity of leaders

945
00:51:08,769 --> 00:51:10,530
who are constantly learning.

946
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:14,150
And I see life and leadership as a lifelong journey.

947
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:14,829
And I shouldn't say,

948
00:51:14,829 --> 00:51:16,929
leadership because I'm just saying life.

949
00:51:16,929 --> 00:51:17,329
Yeah.

950
00:51:17,329 --> 00:51:17,710
Okay.

951
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:20,050
It's a lifelong journey of learning.

952
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,929
And, you know, Benny was, you know,

953
00:51:22,929 --> 00:51:25,389
Benny Lexen, he was, he was curious.

954
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,550
Give you an example, sitting down,

955
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:33,130
sitting down on the beach at Manly up in Sydney,

956
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:36,769
when we, for the final America's Cup.

957
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:39,670
And we're watching birds, in this case,

958
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:42,210
seagulls, flock of seagulls landing and taking off.

959
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:44,809
A lot of wind, a lot of turbulence along the shore.

960
00:51:44,829 --> 00:51:48,969
And here's this man with supposedly no education,

961
00:51:48,969 --> 00:51:52,170
three years, went to school at nine and left at 12.

962
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:53,710
So, you know, for God's sake.

963
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,389
And here I am with, you know,

964
00:51:55,389 --> 00:51:57,889
double degree and MIT and all the, all the stuff.

965
00:51:57,889 --> 00:52:01,750
And he's saying, he's saying, John,

966
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:03,750
look at the way these birds land.

967
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,789
There's, there's no crash landings.

968
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:09,730
So we would have seen maybe the 20 or 30,

969
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:12,010
you know, seagulls in a lot of wind.

970
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:14,530
They land beautifully, beautifully every time.

971
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:16,929
And he said, look at the way they take off.

972
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:19,090
Their takeoffs are perfect.

973
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:22,230
So here I am looking through Benny's eyes of this.

974
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:26,809
And he says, their, their brains are smaller than a pea.

975
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:28,809
Our brains is this massive bloody thing

976
00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:32,570
weighing about six kilograms hanging between our ears.

977
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:33,730
Okay.

978
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:37,989
And he said that, that their flight control systems,

979
00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:40,769
first of all, there has to be a neuro nerve

980
00:52:40,769 --> 00:52:42,989
from every feather connecting to that tiny,

981
00:52:42,989 --> 00:52:44,289
tiny little brain.

982
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:47,150
That flight control system has to be more advanced

983
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:49,929
than any military jet aircraft known to mankind.

984
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:54,590
The way they land and take off every time,

985
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:57,269
every time, I just love watching birds now

986
00:52:57,269 --> 00:52:58,849
through Benny's eyes.

987
00:52:58,849 --> 00:52:59,949
And I just, so he said,

988
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:02,449
look at their feathers on the trailing edge of their wings.

989
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:03,710
They're feeling the vortices.

990
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:06,829
This is the bird coming into land in a lot of turbulence.

991
00:53:06,829 --> 00:53:09,750
And he said, they can just feel the air going across

992
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,469
the high, low pressure surface,

993
00:53:11,469 --> 00:53:14,050
which is the top surface of the wing.

994
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:16,409
And he said they can feel the turbulence just generating.

995
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:23,090
They trip the air and they drop to the surface, drop to Earth perfectly every time.

996
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:24,210
Okay?

997
00:53:24,889 --> 00:53:27,110
So you talk about curiosity.

998
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:33,489
Here's this bloke with supposedly no education thinking way out there in terms of studying nature

999
00:53:33,489 --> 00:53:40,610
and in awe of what a mingy little seagull can do compared to us humans who we think we're pretty good.

1000
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:48,690
And so there's no limitations for those types of people in terms of what's this game going to look like in 20 years' time.

1001
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:52,349
And I've got a refresher on curiosity for you.

1002
00:53:52,389 --> 00:53:56,469
When we first caught up, you know, I think you had me for 10 minutes and you're drilling in what's happening

1003
00:53:56,469 --> 00:53:59,590
and what's happening in life and what are you up to when you ask questions.

1004
00:53:59,789 --> 00:54:02,409
It's that constant wanting to learn.

1005
00:54:02,429 --> 00:54:03,650
Well, I was fascinated with what you're doing.

1006
00:54:03,929 --> 00:54:06,329
You're an interesting bloke and an interesting character.

1007
00:54:06,329 --> 00:54:10,269
And clearly the interest is off the charts with me.

1008
00:54:10,349 --> 00:54:10,590
But I was…

1009
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,989
I love that about, you know, and you're in, you know, people might not understand.

1010
00:54:14,489 --> 00:54:16,670
You won a world championship, you know, in 2016.

1011
00:54:17,409 --> 00:54:21,489
You were telling me earlier, asking you, you're back, you know, sailing again.

1012
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:25,510
And it's, you know, people talk about lifelong learning.

1013
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:29,190
That just embodies everything that you're about, isn't it?

1014
00:54:29,329 --> 00:54:29,610
Yeah.

1015
00:54:29,769 --> 00:54:35,150
Well, on the team, we'll do the national championships in the Edgfield class,

1016
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:39,150
best racing in the country by far, second week of January in Adelaide.

1017
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:40,449
So on the boat, I've got…

1018
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:45,809
Sailing with me is Tom Burton, Olympic gold medalist in Rio.

1019
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:52,369
And Jake Lilly, current representative in the fin class, sailing in the Tokyo Olympics.

1020
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:55,630
I'll learn a lot from them, heaps and heaps.

1021
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:57,230
And hopefully they'll learn a little bit from me.

1022
00:54:57,289 --> 00:55:00,210
But, you know, it'll be an MBA of sailing.

1023
00:55:00,469 --> 00:55:01,070
Isn't that brilliant?

1024
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:05,650
I love that about your sport, isn't it, John, that you can, you know, transcend generations, can't you?

1025
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:09,369
That you can, with this new current crop, and I know you're so connected to, you know,

1026
00:55:09,369 --> 00:55:10,570
sailing is world class.

1027
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:12,289
And you're so connected to the next generation.

1028
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,489
The fact they get to compete with you, I love.

1029
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:16,110
It's an amazing part of your sport.

1030
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:18,849
Communicating with clarity is a dimension of leadership.

1031
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:23,650
We know all leaders consider really strongly, and you've mentioned it a few times.

1032
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:27,909
How did you go about your communicating in the areas that you've been in?

1033
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:32,070
I think I'm naturally, I'm a natural teacher.

1034
00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:40,570
And I think I can condense complex ideas down into simple forms that can be communicated.

1035
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:47,150
And keep communicating that through my, this crazy thing called passion, okay, and commitment.

1036
00:55:48,570 --> 00:56:00,010
So, you know, I naturally like, one of the things I think is really key and is to empower people, okay, to empower people.

1037
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:03,190
So I've used this thing called one plus one equals three before.

1038
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:10,349
The intellectual horsepower within a group of people can be enormous if you can,

1039
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:11,610
if you can combine it.

1040
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:12,409
That's the point.

1041
00:56:12,889 --> 00:56:19,489
And that's the untapped potential of organizations or sailing teams or swimming programs where they're coaches and coaches

1042
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:23,829
and the coaching fraternity and relative to talking to each other relative to their teaching,

1043
00:56:23,969 --> 00:56:26,550
their working with their, you know, their athletes and so on.

1044
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:33,190
So this whole issue of being able to communicate in a simple manner such that ideas can get across.

1045
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:40,210
And indeed, as I mentioned before, repeating those, hopefully no more than three times,

1046
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:44,050
such that people really walk away and think, aha, the light bulb goes on.

1047
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:46,650
So that's all part and parcel of leadership.

1048
00:56:46,769 --> 00:56:47,409
There's no question.

1049
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:51,449
You can be full of ideas, but if you can't communicate it in a simple manner,

1050
00:56:51,989 --> 00:56:56,989
then can be communicated throughout the organization.

1051
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:58,010
That's the other thing.

1052
00:56:59,429 --> 00:57:02,769
Yeah, and I love you've mentioned empowering leadership a lot.

1053
00:57:02,769 --> 00:57:05,269
That's the title of the podcast, Empowering Leaders, John,

1054
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:09,590
because we see that as being ultimately, you know, a big shift now.

1055
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:16,250
And you captured it, you know, in the early 80s around empowering others around you to fulfill their roles.

1056
00:57:16,369 --> 00:57:21,130
And you can only achieve, you know, X amount doing it on your own

1057
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:22,869
and without empowering others in your environment.

1058
00:57:22,989 --> 00:57:24,530
We see that as being a real skill.

1059
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:25,670
Likewise, collaboration.

1060
00:57:25,869 --> 00:57:30,389
And we see leaders are now equally really strategic about their collaboration.

1061
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:34,769
And you've always been ahead of the curve, but your success was done with great collaboration.

1062
00:57:34,929 --> 00:57:36,170
How important was that to you?

1063
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:36,789
It's huge.

1064
00:57:38,469 --> 00:57:39,349
Ed Debono.

1065
00:57:39,349 --> 00:57:43,429
He coined the lateral thinking, the phrase lateral thinking.

1066
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:45,510
And we became good friends.

1067
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:48,809
He used the America's Cup as a case study with his teachings around the world.

1068
00:57:48,929 --> 00:57:51,750
Very interesting bloke, you know, lateral thinking, man.

1069
00:57:51,929 --> 00:57:56,750
I had his co-founder of the School of Thinking on this podcast, a guy called Michael Hewitt Gleeson,

1070
00:57:56,769 --> 00:58:03,630
and they ran the School of Thinking together and fascinated by how they were able to implement that in the school system in the Bay Area.

1071
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:08,969
And they really, the study believes that Silicon Valley's come out of really the alumni of,

1072
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:15,809
of the Bay Area of San Francisco, creating Silicon Valley on the back of Edward De Bono and Michael's thinking as well.

1073
00:58:15,949 --> 00:58:16,929
So sorry to interrupt.

1074
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:17,909
No, that's fine.

1075
00:58:17,989 --> 00:58:21,949
So Ed De Bono, he's basically says there's four streams of thinking.

1076
00:58:21,949 --> 00:58:28,329
There's the reading, there's writing, there's arithmetic, and thinking is the final core.

1077
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:33,170
And he said most people, school systems and whatever, don't really consider thinking.

1078
00:58:33,329 --> 00:58:38,750
But now we're talking about lateral thinking and going across from one idea to another to take it to the next level.

1079
00:58:38,869 --> 00:58:39,150
Like the transition.

1080
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:47,650
The Siberian Railway was developed, the major, major technical problems, massive, were not thousands of people.

1081
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:54,929
It was maybe half a dozen people who really just work with each other, okay, and, you know, with no limitations in many ways.

1082
00:58:55,610 --> 00:59:00,110
He wrote a book, one of the key books he wrote, which was very important for America's Cup Project.

1083
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,030
This is Edward De Bono?

1084
00:59:01,269 --> 00:59:08,309
Ed De Bono was the six hats of thinking, okay, which became very important with our swimming program as well.

1085
00:59:08,309 --> 00:59:16,989
And that is you primarily to do great things, you need, in my case, no more than six people.

1086
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:18,869
Then it becomes too complex.

1087
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:22,070
But a team of six people, which are all different.

1088
00:59:22,849 --> 00:59:23,769
That's the key.

1089
00:59:23,949 --> 00:59:24,929
Not all the same.

1090
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:27,590
So that you don't have a whole bunch of yes people.

1091
00:59:28,349 --> 00:59:30,670
So there's the, and the colors come from, okay.

1092
00:59:30,849 --> 00:59:37,309
So the white hat is the chairman, chairperson, who empowers the thinking, empowers the people.

1093
00:59:37,309 --> 00:59:43,349
There's, let's say, the green hat, who's the creative thinker, he's the marketeer, comes up with the crazy ideas.

1094
00:59:43,349 --> 00:59:46,869
And then there's the black hat, who's the negative person.

1095
00:59:46,869 --> 00:59:48,809
You've got to say, now, hang on, Harry.

1096
00:59:48,809 --> 00:59:52,750
That, you know, for this, this, and this reason, that doesn't make sense.

1097
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,309
And that's right.

1098
00:59:54,309 --> 00:59:55,710
You've got to have the checks and balances.

1099
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:57,309
Then you've got to have the complete a finisher.

1100
00:59:57,309 --> 00:59:59,590
Don't give me all the high-flying ideas.

1101
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:01,809
Just give me the project and I'll get the bloody thing done.

1102
01:00:01,809 --> 01:00:02,929
Okay.

1103
01:00:02,929 --> 01:00:07,090
So it's sort of a, you know, it's a very, it's a beautiful way of thinking.

1104
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:18,090
Thinking about teams, high-performance teams, up to say six people, and if you get to 10 or whatever, then, you know, it's too complex.

1105
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:30,389
So this whole empowering of people and, and being comfortable with different people, adding value to the mix, the six hats of thinking.

1106
01:00:30,389 --> 01:00:36,750
So, gee, when we were putting the team together for the America's Cup, and indeed, my thinking with Swimming Australia,

1107
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:41,829
obviously, is that you've got all these coaches, dedicated people, but they're all different.

1108
01:00:41,829 --> 01:00:43,690
And don't worry about it.

1109
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:47,909
That's how do we leverage off each other and how do we accept each other and how do we

1110
01:00:47,909 --> 01:00:51,409
get on with it so that we can create something that's very special.

1111
01:00:51,409 --> 01:00:55,090
It's a brilliant story, John, and it links right into that passion I was talking to you

1112
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:56,090
about before.

1113
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:59,769
A leader is the, the business and a leader connect is groups of six people, five or six

1114
01:00:59,769 --> 01:01:00,769
people.

1115
01:01:00,769 --> 01:01:04,750
And, you know, the diversity of thinking we see is the superpower to have exactly as you

1116
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:05,750
described.

1117
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:06,750
You don't know what you don't know.

1118
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:07,750
Do you?

1119
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:10,869
And if you, you, you, often we operate in the same sphere and when people come from

1120
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:14,909
outside, where the opportunity to, to, to grow and you're right, leadership sometimes

1121
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:18,690
almost the wrong word, I feel, because it seems to exclude people.

1122
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:22,869
We see everyone as being, you're a leader in your own family and you can, you don't

1123
01:01:22,869 --> 01:01:24,250
have to have a title to be a leader.

1124
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:28,750
In fact, the opposite of that, you can lead from whatever position in an organization

1125
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,610
or, or even in your own family.

1126
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:32,809
So I appreciate you, you sharing that.

1127
01:01:32,809 --> 01:01:35,690
What, can I ask you, what was the bono like if you had some time with him?

1128
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:36,690
Oh yeah.

1129
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:37,690
Absolutely crazy.

1130
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:38,690
Absolutely crazy.

1131
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:39,690
And brilliant.

1132
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:40,690
Yeah.

1133
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:41,690
Absolutely brilliant.

1134
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:42,690
You know?

1135
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:43,690
Yeah.

1136
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:50,269
And so each time he came to Australia, we'd invariably would, there, Rouse and I, and

1137
01:01:50,269 --> 01:01:56,690
he would have a dinner, you know, these long dinners and we'd, we'd, we'd discuss the world.

1138
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:57,690
Yeah.

1139
01:01:57,690 --> 01:01:59,030
We'd discuss the world.

1140
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:04,929
So the, I just, when you're talking about at least, you know, in terms of the teams,

1141
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:05,690
Jeff Harris, who's co-founder of.

1142
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:06,690
Yeah.

1143
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:07,690
He's co-founder of our flight center.

1144
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:08,690
Okay.

1145
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:12,190
He had the great pleasure of doing a podcast with Jeff recently.

1146
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:13,690
What a, what an incredible thinker Jeff is.

1147
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:14,690
Oh yes.

1148
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:15,690
That's right.

1149
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:16,690
Amazing.

1150
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:19,690
So we were talking about teams quite a few years ago and he, he would have told you,

1151
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:24,250
would have told the audience now, I'm sure, about the early days of flight center where

1152
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:27,190
they got four or five or six people together.

1153
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:31,690
And really studied around why, you know, tribes and organization work.

1154
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:32,690
Exactly.

1155
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:35,690
And through trial and error and that, that, that sort of six to eight people was about

1156
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:36,690
the max they felt.

1157
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:37,690
Yeah.

1158
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:38,690
And they built.

1159
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:39,690
Yeah.

1160
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:42,690
Well, what happens, they, based on early success, they went to 10 or 12 or 14.

1161
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:43,690
They thought this is cool.

1162
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:46,690
We just increased the size of the offices, but they, it didn't work.

1163
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:47,690
Yeah.

1164
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:51,530
They got to that level of, you know, six or eight max and that was it.

1165
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:54,690
So that's these, you know, tribes, that's what we're talking about here.

1166
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:55,690
Yeah.

1167
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:56,690
Families and tribes.

1168
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:01,690
And, uh, so De Bono, he sort of, that was his early thinking in many ways.

1169
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:02,690
Ed De Bono.

1170
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:03,690
I love that you've got an engineering.

1171
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:04,690
Yeah.

1172
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:09,190
You've got an engineering mindset and engineering brain, but some of the people you put closest

1173
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:11,690
to you were Ben Lexen and Edward De Bono.

1174
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:12,690
Oh, I love this.

1175
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:13,690
Love these people.

1176
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:14,690
Yeah.

1177
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:15,690
So lovely story.

1178
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:16,690
Okay.

1179
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:20,690
So one of the deals is that Ed De Bono was brought in to consult, uh, in New York City,

1180
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:24,690
a building which they couldn't really, couldn't rationalize putting faster lifts in.

1181
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:25,690
It was too expensive.

1182
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:27,690
It was a residential property.

1183
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:32,849
And, uh, but the lifts were too slow and they're losing income because people didn't like waiting

1184
01:03:32,849 --> 01:03:34,690
for a long, long time to get up to there.

1185
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:38,289
It was a 65th floor or whatever in New York City, downtown.

1186
01:03:38,289 --> 01:03:42,050
So he's brought in to help find a solution.

1187
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:46,250
So he looked at the whole thing and it was clearly too expensive to, you know, go the

1188
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:47,590
conventional route.

1189
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:51,690
So he suggested installing mirrors, full length mirrors in the foyer.

1190
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:52,690
Okay.

1191
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:53,690
Why?

1192
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:56,190
People like looking at each other.

1193
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:59,690
And if they like looking at each other, then the time goes much faster.

1194
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:04,190
And some people like looking at themselves as well too.

1195
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:04,690
Yeah.

1196
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:05,190
Yeah.

1197
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:06,690
Lateral thinking, you know, that's right.

1198
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:08,190
So, okay.

1199
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:10,190
So that's Ben Lexen.

1200
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:11,190
That's out there.

1201
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:16,190
You know, the breakthrough ideas aren't necessarily coming from a mathematical equation coming

1202
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:17,190
out of MIT.

1203
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:19,190
It's, uh, it's pure genius.

1204
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:23,190
Uh, and the genius to me is people putting people around them, like you, that compliment

1205
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:24,190
your skillset, isn't it?

1206
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:25,190
Yes.

1207
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:26,190
And that's, that's smart, isn't it?

1208
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:27,690
You know, your engineering, uh, brain.

1209
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:29,190
Well, all I know is I don't know.

1210
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:30,190
It's true.

1211
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:31,190
Yeah.

1212
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:32,090
If you go in with that type of mindset, you know.

1213
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:33,090
Yeah.

1214
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:39,090
And saying, okay, well, again, uh, you know, this environment in 20 years time would be

1215
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:41,090
much for, so different.

1216
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:42,090
Yeah.

1217
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:46,090
How do we get there faster than any other, other people in the world?

1218
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:49,590
That's the, that's the exciting part of human endeavor in my opinion.

1219
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:51,590
I love listening to it, uh, John.

1220
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:56,090
It's always inspiring to, to hear your thoughts on, uh, on how to get there and what you've

1221
01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:57,090
done in the, in the past.

1222
01:04:57,090 --> 01:05:01,090
I've been asking these two questions, uh, John, to all the leaders, um, that I've had

1223
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:02,590
the privilege of sitting down with.

1224
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:05,590
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1225
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:06,590
Gee.

1226
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:16,659
Uh, well, first of all, um, in terms of, of our family, uh, my wife Raza, I've been married

1227
01:05:16,659 --> 01:05:17,659
for 53 years.

1228
01:05:17,659 --> 01:05:22,159
Her leadership of the family blows me away.

1229
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:23,159
Unbelievable.

1230
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:26,159
In terms of her natural instinct of what's going on.

1231
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:32,159
You know, we've got kids in London, grandkids in London, Ibiza in Spain, in Melbourne, seven

1232
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:33,159
grandkids.

1233
01:05:33,159 --> 01:05:34,659
And all the stuff going on.

1234
01:05:34,659 --> 01:05:39,260
And so that little family unit and just, you know, the extension and her natural empathy

1235
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:44,159
for people around her and whatever, just, so that's leadership and it's pure, beautiful

1236
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:45,159
form.

1237
01:05:45,159 --> 01:05:46,159
Yeah.

1238
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:51,159
If we talk about high level, uh, you know, someone like the Bob Hawks of the world, um,

1239
01:05:51,159 --> 01:06:01,159
the, and spent time, you know, with, uh, with, with Bob, um, his natural instinct, um, yeah,

1240
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:02,159
those types of people.

1241
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:08,260
You know, we, we spent, spent some, I spent time with, um, Ted Kennedy in America, Jackie

1242
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:14,159
Onassis or Jackie Kennedy in the early days, small amounts of time, but, you know, again,

1243
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:19,159
people at, at this sort of a level, really intriguing.

1244
01:06:19,159 --> 01:06:25,360
Um, and, uh, you know, through Ted studying the John F. Kennedy era, the Cuban missile

1245
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:30,659
crisis has staying at with Ted and his home in Washington and looking at some of the sketchings

1246
01:06:30,659 --> 01:06:31,159
of, uh, that.

1247
01:06:31,159 --> 01:06:39,159
Uh, JFK had done during the, during the key crisis meetings and the, and the notes and

1248
01:06:39,159 --> 01:06:46,159
so on, and learning about, you know, intriguing about human history being put together.

1249
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:50,159
Um, those things fascinate me a lot, I must say.

1250
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:51,159
Yeah.

1251
01:06:51,159 --> 01:06:56,159
But, uh, you know, again, the, the Bob Hawk thing was quite remarkable.

1252
01:06:56,159 --> 01:07:00,960
Spent some, quite a lot of time with John Howard, fascinating man, you know, uh, each

1253
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,960
of these, all of these very, very strong values, you know, authentic, absolutely.

1254
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,960
What you see is what you get.

1255
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:07,960
Yeah.

1256
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:08,960
I love you.

1257
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,960
You started at home and then, um, you know, it's been an incredible life that you've,

1258
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:16,960
you've lived and, and, you know, um, clearly your respect on the home front to be married

1259
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:17,960
for 53 years.

1260
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:21,960
Something special is happening there, uh, John, which is, um, not surprising you went

1261
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:22,960
there first, but I loved it.

1262
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,960
Hey, it surprises me.

1263
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,960
I was 19 years yesterday actually.

1264
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:29,960
So I'm, I'm, uh, I'm happy.

1265
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:33,960
I'm, uh, I'm, I'm, you know, fair way to go to get to 53, John.

1266
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:38,960
But I, I say this a fair bit because, um, and I need to sit down and, and, uh, interview

1267
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,960
my wife because she's exactly the same, uh, superstar.

1268
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:45,960
It sounds very much like Ra in terms of her empathy and, and what she does for our family

1269
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:46,960
unit off the charts.

1270
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:51,960
But I'm always surprised on, you've got such a, you know, an incredible brain for how to

1271
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,960
succeed, but not many people apply that to their own home front.

1272
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:58,960
I find fascinating because, you know, if that breaks down, your life is on every measure,

1273
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,960
going to be, you know, immensely worse, isn't it?

1274
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,960
So, um, it's interesting, isn't it?

1275
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:04,960
Yeah.

1276
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,960
And I'm not proud of my early days as a father, you know, I was off everywhere doing this

1277
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,960
crazy thing, chasing the dream of whether Olympics or America's cups to the exclusion

1278
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,960
of family life.

1279
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,960
Do you look back with some regret for that?

1280
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:16,960
Oh, gotcha.

1281
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:17,960
Absolutely.

1282
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:18,960
Oh, no question.

1283
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,960
You know, looking back, you know, four days after our first, uh, was born, Lucas, you

1284
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,960
know, I went to Europe for three months.

1285
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:27,960
Because we're in the beginning.

1286
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:31,960
Because we're in the business of developing our new sailcloth to win the America's cup,

1287
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:34,960
you know, all of the stuff, you know, look back and you think, my God.

1288
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,960
So, uh, but anyway, we were able to get through all of that.

1289
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:44,960
Um, and, uh, so we've had plenty of, you know, uh, plenty of issues, you know, she rather

1290
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:53,960
only left me three times, but, but each time she left me with a kid and we came back pretty

1291
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,960
fast, but, uh, God bless her.

1292
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:57,960
God bless her.

1293
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:01,600
So she's seen more stuff than most girls who'd ever seen in a lifetime and traveling the

1294
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,960
world and on the smell of an oil rag following her crazy dreams.

1295
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:11,399
But, uh, you know, I, I've have, I've just so much respect for her and now as a grandmother,

1296
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:12,399
what she achieves.

1297
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:13,399
Yeah.

1298
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,399
And that's human.

1299
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:15,399
That's, that's people, isn't it?

1300
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:19,960
And it's family and it's, it's, hey, how important is family is?

1301
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:20,960
Yeah.

1302
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:21,960
Yeah.

1303
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:22,960
I love hearing you talk about that.

1304
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,960
Um, we, uh, obsessed with collaboration, John.

1305
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:25,960
And we see that.

1306
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:29,680
We see that that's where, you know, so much of the shift is and how we collaborate to

1307
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,680
do things better.

1308
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,680
Yeah.

1309
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:36,039
Ask you this question, John, if you could collaborate with anyone in the world on, on,

1310
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:38,060
on anything, there's so many passions in your life.

1311
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:42,760
Is there someone in your, in your mind that you think of that you would like to, to pursue

1312
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,960
in terms of collaboration?

1313
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:53,800
Gee, um, was, uh, I've got a, you know, depending on the areas of, of, uh, activity, uh, you

1314
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,960
know, some really, really interesting characters.

1315
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:00,819
Like, uh, Rod Eddington, Sir Rod, you know, go around the, around the town with him occasionally

1316
01:10:00,819 --> 01:10:05,819
when he's in Australia and, and, uh, people like John Wiley, you know, massive, amazing

1317
01:10:05,819 --> 01:10:11,680
intellect in terms of understanding what's going on in, in the, in the financial world.

1318
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:16,920
And for example, um, over in the, over in Europe, uh, Ben Ainslie, who's the head of

1319
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:23,680
the British America's Cup Challenge, Sir Ben now, um, you know, we're very good friends.

1320
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:24,680
We, uh, you know, we've raced with each other.

1321
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:25,680
Yeah.

1322
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,680
We've raced with each other in the Etchells and so on.

1323
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:35,640
Uh, it, you know, I, I love hanging out with really, you know, advanced people, um, so,

1324
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:42,100
and I have the, you know what, I have the privilege also, uh, to, to hang out with some

1325
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:47,180
really interesting cats as well, you know, so I'm very fortunate in that regard.

1326
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:52,439
Um, so it's, gee, there's so, there's people who just, there's so many different angles

1327
01:10:52,439 --> 01:10:53,439
of life, isn't there?

1328
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,439
That you, you know.

1329
01:10:54,439 --> 01:10:56,439
I love that your mind's going off in so many directions, John.

1330
01:10:56,439 --> 01:11:00,340
And I know that you have a huge amount of influence over so many people as well and

1331
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:04,460
what you give back and you're so generous with your time to, uh, to people across all

1332
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:08,960
the passions of your life from the Collingwood Football Club to, I mentioned, uh, the Alana

1333
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:13,579
and Madeleine Foundation and, and all of your work in everything is, uh, is profound and

1334
01:11:13,579 --> 01:11:15,939
it's, uh, it's been great fun, John.

1335
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:19,279
I've, uh, I've learned a lot again sitting along, um, from you today.

1336
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:20,279
So thanks so much.

1337
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:21,279
I appreciate you joining me.

1338
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:22,279
Let me just, a little correction.

1339
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:23,279
The Alana and Madeleine Foundation.

1340
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,279
I retired several years ago.

1341
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:28,159
But I was there, I was chair for 15 years with that.

1342
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:32,880
And we've helped, as it turns out, millions of kids in terms of cyber-bullying issues

1343
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,880
around that, so.

1344
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:34,880
Yeah.

1345
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,840
And people who don't, the background of that is, is, is incredible, isn't it?

1346
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:38,840
Yeah.

1347
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,720
One of the most tragic stories in Australian history.

1348
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:45,539
And on the back of that, to have such a profound influence on young people, that must feel

1349
01:11:45,539 --> 01:11:46,539
you enjoyed.

1350
01:11:46,539 --> 01:11:47,539
Oh yeah.

1351
01:11:47,539 --> 01:11:48,539
Yeah.

1352
01:11:48,539 --> 01:11:49,539
Very, yeah.

1353
01:11:49,539 --> 01:11:50,539
Very, very fulfilling.

1354
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:52,279
You can make a small difference to a lot of people's lives.

1355
01:11:52,279 --> 01:11:53,279
That's right.

1356
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:54,279
Bigger than a small difference.

1357
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:57,840
John, everything you do makes a massive difference and, uh, once again, thanks for your time.

1358
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,840
My pleasure.
