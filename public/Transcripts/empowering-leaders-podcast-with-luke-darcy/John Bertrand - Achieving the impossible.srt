00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,900
This week's conversation is with one of Australia's greatest ever sports people,

2
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:16,059
John Bertrand, the yachtsman who skippered Australia to victory in the 1983 America's Cup.

3
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:21,920
For 133 years, the Americans had successfully defended against challenges from across the world.

4
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:24,879
They were dominant like no team had ever been.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,339
And the story of 1983 is one that is really hard to comprehend in some ways.

6
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:34,880
And you'll hear John's perspective of it in this chat, hearing him talk about trust

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,039
and understanding the way that he looks at leadership in the world of sport and collaboration.

8
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,560
It makes you really understand what happened in 1983 and their victory in a new light.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,240
I found it incredibly fascinating and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

10
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,200
John's perspective to me is similar to a few people we've been collaborating with at Alita.

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,780
It's a business founded with my great friend, Matt Waterwitz.

12
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,820
It's a place for bespoke collaboration with incredible leaders from around the world,

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,320
like Mikel Arteta from Arsenal.

14
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,619
Socceroo John Aloisi, Eddie Jones from English Rugby, just to name a few.

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,579
Now, if you're interested in this space, you can find it at alitacollective.com.

16
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:11,799
You don't have to be a world-renowned sports person or a leader,

17
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:15,599
but we would encourage you to check it out, our signature Alita Connect program.

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,500
It gives you a great perspective on how people like John are leading in their world.

19
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,670
John Bertrand is an official legend of the Sport Australia Hall of Fame.

20
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:38,650
He's the Australian who skippered the wing-keeled Australia 2 to victory over the Americans.

21
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:42,129
Dennis Connors' liberty to win the 1983 America's Cup,

22
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,250
breaking 132 years of American domination,

23
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,469
and in the process, breaking the longest running record in the history of modern sport.

24
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,489
After being 3-1 down in the best of seven races,

25
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,010
and considered by many as the race of the century,

26
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,909
on September 27th, 1983, off Newport, Rhode Island,

27
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,829
John Bertrand and his crew pulled off arguably the greatest upset in modern Australian sporting history.

28
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,490
The victory was voted by the Confederation of Australian Sport,

29
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,090
as the greatest team performance in 200 years of Australian sport.

30
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:14,849
John, it's always a great pleasure to see you,

31
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,689
and I really appreciate you spending the time today.

32
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,650
Great pleasure, Luke.

33
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:21,710
I have to go back, John, to that day, the 27th of September, 1983,

34
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,449
and I remember it as crystal clear.

35
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:23,930
How old are you?

36
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:24,789
I was eight at that stage.

37
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:26,750
And I think I've shared this with you before,

38
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:28,889
but I remember Dad getting me out of bed,

39
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:31,789
get up, son, this is history being made,

40
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,969
Australia are going to win the America's Cup.

41
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,669
And I was just thinking about it today,

42
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,189
I can picture myself where we were in the lounge room,

43
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:39,729
and this tiny little TV,

44
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:41,289
and the whole family's glued around,

45
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,189
and how many people share,

46
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:46,509
because it's a moment where you knew where you were if you were old enough.

47
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,490
Is that shared with you a lot?

48
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:48,110
Oh, yeah.

49
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,689
Not so much what I was doing.

50
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:51,810
Yeah, that's right.

51
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,870
You were busy at the time.

52
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,270
Well, I met a bloke the other day,

53
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:56,009
he was in Sydney,

54
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:57,810
driving across Sydney Harbour Bridge,

55
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,229
and the traffic,

56
00:02:59,490 --> 00:02:59,949
he told me,

57
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,789
the traffic stopped,

58
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:02,810
and people got out and hiking each other

59
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,409
on the bridge,

60
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,750
of the Sydney Harbour Bridge,

61
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:07,669
overlooking the Sydney Opera House.

62
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:07,870
It's like,

63
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,830
it just blows me away.

64
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,030
It's incredible, isn't it?

65
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,750
It is, isn't it?

66
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:14,729
So it stopped the Harbour Bridge at the time.

67
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:14,909
Yep.

68
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,370
Did you have a sense at the time,

69
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,050
John,

70
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:20,150
that this was as big as it was,

71
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,389
and that the whole world was watching?

72
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:21,870
No,

73
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,210
nor did we want to.

74
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:23,569
Yeah.

75
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:25,550
We got rid of all television sets,

76
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,050
all newspapers entering our compound in Newport,

77
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:28,810
Rhode Island,

78
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,830
and we went into our bubble.

79
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:32,729
Look,

80
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,530
we had a sense of it,

81
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,530
but we probably could visualise,

82
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:37,830
maybe,

83
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,789
a quarter of the,

84
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:39,669
really,

85
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:40,849
what was happening back home.

86
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:41,389
Yeah.

87
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,530
The crowds got big at the end,

88
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:43,810
didn't they?

89
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,389
And they came from everywhere around.

90
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,030
Australians came from everywhere,

91
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:47,349
didn't they,

92
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,270
for that final race,

93
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:48,930
when you look back.

94
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:49,389
That's right.

95
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:49,729
Yeah.

96
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,449
And the television,

97
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,150
you know,

98
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:51,509
crews,

99
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,090
they're flying stuff in from all around America.

100
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:55,009
You know,

101
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,050
the tower's going up,

102
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,009
the light's going on.

103
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:57,330
It was,

104
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:57,569
you know,

105
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,129
showtime.

106
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,270
And you have to go and watch Untold,

107
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,909
the race of the century,

108
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:03,949
Netflix documentary,

109
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:05,750
which has just been brought out recently.

110
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,150
It is brilliant.

111
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,229
John,

112
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,629
it brought it all back to life for me as an eight-year-old,

113
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:13,370
not really understanding the context.

114
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:18,269
And I love watching that documentary and seeing you in tears and your crew

115
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,589
and your great friends from that time reduced to tears looking at the

116
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:21,829
significance.

117
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:27,310
Can you explain for the next generation just how huge a challenge it was to

118
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,350
achieve what you did at that time?

119
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:32,930
The New York Club were ferocious defenders of the America's Cup.

120
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:35,310
They oozed style,

121
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:35,970
wealth,

122
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:36,829
this unbeatableness.

123
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:40,430
The U.S. had never lost.

124
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:45,149
It was the longest winning streak in sporting history for 132 years.

125
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:48,449
There's no question the emerging force was Dennis Conner.

126
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:50,569
It was the best sailor in the world.

127
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:53,730
He will do anything to win.

128
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,629
Are we floated on?

129
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,230
Three,

130
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:56,709
two,

131
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,189
one.

132
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,329
It was time that we had to do something radical.

133
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,810
It's a huge commitment.

134
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,649
We had to believe ourselves that we belong on the world stage.

135
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:12,209
I hadn't been the navigator on any of it,

136
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,889
but we were there for one reason,

137
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:14,629
to win.

138
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,949
All the work that we had done had paid huge dividends.

139
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:20,519
It was blazing.

140
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,060
What Australians really like is upsetting the upper echelon.

141
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,819
The whole of the world was watching this.

142
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,480
The greatest yacht race of the century.

143
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,839
I've never seen anything like this.

144
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,560
And a little country called Australia had the audacity to think that we could do it.

145
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:46,959
The American's Cup started off before the U.S. Civil War and the Americans successfully defended over 132 years.

146
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:54,899
So, you know, it's the longest running, you know, their domination was amazing for all different reasons,

147
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,699
but generally better organized.

148
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,319
But they had technology behind them.

149
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:03,899
You know, the U.S. surveyed the most powerful technical nation in the world and economically.

150
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:06,199
And it had never been done.

151
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,879
It was really, it was the Everest of sport.

152
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,560
It was a four-minute mile.

153
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,139
You know, I remember reading about Bannister.

154
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,519
He was told, and he was, I think, a medical student at Oxford University at the time.

155
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,920
And the best advice that they could get at that stage is the human heart was not powerful enough

156
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,639
to propel a man around the track in less than four minutes in a mile.

157
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,959
He didn't feel that that was the case.

158
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:37,319
But it was seen as an impossible barrier, a psychological, impossible, physical, medical barrier.

159
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,019
And at any rate, when he did that,

160
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:43,959
I think something in order of 10 different milers over the next six months

161
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,319
broke through that invisible barrier.

162
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,699
All of a sudden, it was gone.

163
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:51,439
So the psychology of it was huge.

164
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:59,060
And I'd already been involved in three losing America's Cup challenges before,

165
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,980
over a 12-year period.

166
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,560
So, you know, I could see, and having lived in the United States,

167
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,560
and it's interesting that for that Netflix thing, a documentary, actually,

168
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,120
he knows it pretty well.

169
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,959
It was a three-year production coming out of L.A.

170
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:14,000
And their research was amazing.

171
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,639
Most of the content I'd never seen before.

172
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,399
But having lived in the United States with my wife, Raza,

173
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,860
and going to MIT and Boston and, you know,

174
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:27,759
worked with the Americans and the professors and so on,

175
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:31,439
it became clear to me, you know, clearly,

176
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,959
a very, very motivated people, the Americans.

177
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:38,439
As I often say, the Americans will eat their,

178
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:41,379
their grandmothers if required, you know, with great respect.

179
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:43,879
But it's true, you know, highly competitive people.

180
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,579
So to knock the Yanks off was a big deal,

181
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:51,699
both from a technical point of view, as well as a sailing ability.

182
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:56,019
And the fact that it had never been done, like so many nations had tried,

183
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,279
and including Australia, and no one was able to achieve it.

184
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:06,399
These projects are generally built very simply around administration.

185
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,839
Management has to be world class.

186
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,160
The technology has to be world class.

187
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,180
And ultimately, the team has to be world class.

188
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,779
Same as Formula One motor racing that we're just discussing.

189
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,860
Any of those links weak and you can't play the game.

190
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,579
So ultimately, in that particular project,

191
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:26,019
we got those three links to be absolutely world class and we could play the game.

192
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,500
And John, to go into your time at MIT and,

193
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:36,059
and to just, it gives a window into your mindset and of your commitment to success is next,

194
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:36,759
next level.

195
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,279
And you're,

196
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:37,779
you're an engineer.

197
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:43,179
You did your thesis on the title was the optimum angle of attack for America's Cup sales.

198
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:49,539
So you had a pretty specific focus and then you won a scholarship to MIT and that was,

199
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:52,120
you know, reading about you improving your engineering.

200
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,759
But as you just described, then getting an understanding of the US psyche really,

201
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,600
really deeply.

202
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,320
And so having lost the America's Cup three times,

203
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,299
your fanaticism to go over and learn and better yourself.

204
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:05,059
But do you look back and can you,

205
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:07,399
can you relate to what that was like at the time?

206
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:07,659
Well,

207
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:12,659
I can now say it was very important to best way to describe it in the,

208
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:13,419
in Australia,

209
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,879
certainly in my era,

210
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,620
and we're talking about a long time ago when I was at Monash University,

211
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:18,580
you know,

212
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,080
the professor,

213
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,779
everything was,

214
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:20,019
you know,

215
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:20,500
professor,

216
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,519
this and professor that in at MIT,

217
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,700
it was all first name with the professors.

218
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,799
Uh,

219
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,000
and you know,

220
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,519
at Monash,

221
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,019
you know,

222
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:33,019
the people would have morning and afternoon tea and lunch.

223
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,519
Okay.

224
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:34,720
And at,

225
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,679
at MIT,

226
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,559
if you had a donut on the way through at lunch,

227
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,120
you're happy,

228
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,759
you're lucky,

229
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:39,120
you know,

230
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,139
it was a different world.

231
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,899
The speed of speed of getting stuff done was just another world.

232
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:46,399
You know,

233
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,179
MIT basically funded by outside sponsorship,

234
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:52,740
including the US military.

235
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,480
Whereas in Australia,

236
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:56,679
the big chunk of the funding comes from government.

237
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,200
So it's a different mentality altogether.

238
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,379
You know,

239
00:09:58,379 --> 00:09:58,679
it's,

240
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,480
you've got to make stuff happen.

241
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,840
And so,

242
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,419
and we lived,

243
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:03,679
you know,

244
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,100
Raza and I,

245
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,360
we lived in the States for probably eight years over different periods.

246
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,659
So about time there and a great respect for,

247
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:10,899
you know,

248
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:11,399
you don't,

249
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,580
you don't back again,

250
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,139
you don't back against the Yanks.

251
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:17,600
They're highly mobile community.

252
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,940
They'll move from one country,

253
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,360
one,

254
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,399
I should say one city to another.

255
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:22,480
It's not like,

256
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,120
you know,

257
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,759
in Australia,

258
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:26,919
moving from Melbourne to Sydney or Sydney to Perth is a big deal.

259
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:28,039
Uh,

260
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:28,299
no,

261
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:30,580
because it's all about increasing your,

262
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,000
um,

263
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,299
your,

264
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:32,200
your net worth.

265
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,019
It's all about becoming millionaires and God bless them.

266
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:35,919
That's part of the deal.

267
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,039
And,

268
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:37,299
uh,

269
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:45,279
so having that sort of background and an understanding of having empathy for the Americans was extremely important.

270
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,240
And also their sense of self-confidence at the highest level,

271
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:50,480
the high five thing,

272
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,039
you know,

273
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:51,860
in Australia,

274
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,360
high five,

275
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,179
you don't really see it,

276
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:54,700
but we are highly competitive people,

277
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,080
but it's under the cover under the,

278
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,480
under the radar a little bit below,

279
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,480
you know,

280
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,440
you know that in your world of Australian rules football,

281
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:03,700
you know,

282
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,659
you're a lovely man,

283
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:05,539
but out on the field,

284
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,759
you're a bloody mongrel.

285
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:10,080
That's the reality that has to be the case.

286
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,159
Highly competitive individuals,

287
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,799
no difference in the U S except it's,

288
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,480
it's above the radar,

289
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:16,759
you know,

290
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,440
the high five,

291
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,120
the louder voices,

292
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,740
competitive environment.

293
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,019
You to break through the noise,

294
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:24,139
you've got to speak louder,

295
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:24,519
you know,

296
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,259
that's sort of not,

297
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:26,919
you know,

298
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,480
I just a broad brush approach.

299
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,620
So the net net is really not being put off by the U S of a,

300
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:33,919
you know,

301
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:36,200
the U S Navy and the coast guard.

302
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,580
Uh,

303
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:39,879
the high fives and the pumped up chest.

304
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:43,240
That's part of the deal that we had to overcome.

305
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,519
You know,

306
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,279
if we were to take on the Yanks,

307
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,519
it was like the pool deck of at the Olympic games,

308
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:48,700
you know,

309
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,559
the U S a U S a Australians up until Tokyo,

310
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,500
you know,

311
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,000
we're sort of,

312
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:58,840
we were quivering people in a corner.

313
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:06,759
So overcoming that is all part of the psyche of getting stuff done at the highest level.

314
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,860
And you're dealing now on the world stage.

315
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,840
There's no way to hide.

316
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,100
And in the U S you know,

317
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,899
with the America's cup,

318
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,039
ultimately there is no way to hide.

319
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:17,500
You've got to front up and that's the competition.

320
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,340
You can't change it.

321
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:18,580
And,

322
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,419
uh,

323
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:20,200
it's part of the deal.

324
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,379
You know,

325
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:21,379
it's a,

326
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:22,240
so the,

327
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,480
you know,

328
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,399
this game of stuff between your ears,

329
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:24,799
you know,

330
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,519
all about it being a highly competitive athlete in your former life.

331
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,279
Um,

332
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,240
and still are,

333
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,740
uh,

334
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,500
it's the,

335
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,200
um,

336
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,519
you know,

337
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:34,700
you,

338
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,659
you do the so-called 10,000 hours.

339
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:43,539
So preparation in our case is much more than that driven by passion to become good at what you're doing.

340
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:47,159
But ultimately between your ears is where the action is.

341
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,039
That's the difference between winning and losing.

342
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,659
And that was part of the mountain that we had to climb with this crazy thing called the America's cup.

343
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:56,759
That had never been won by any nation for over a century.

344
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:06,620
I love hearing you talk about the psychology of sport and I'll get to the way you imparting that on the culture of swimming in Australia with great success.

345
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,440
But to go into the detail a little bit,

346
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:09,679
you know,

347
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,360
you legendary,

348
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,139
even when you,

349
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,519
the arch nemesis,

350
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:13,700
uh,

351
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,620
Dennis Connor and,

352
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,039
and even the handshake,

353
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:20,899
you wanted to make sure your handshake was over the top of his handshake and you went to great lengths.

354
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:32,419
Am I correct in understanding the boxing kangaroo flag was a creation of you and your crew in lots of ways and having that flying on the boat because you wanted a powerful symbol and even having men at work down,

355
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:33,480
not having a music track.

356
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,240
That was a powerful,

357
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,740
strong tech.

358
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:34,879
That,

359
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,559
that was the sort of detail you went into.

360
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:36,980
Yeah.

361
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,620
To create that psyche to overcome the Americans.

362
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:39,919
Yes.

363
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,580
Is that all correct?

364
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:40,879
Yes,

365
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:41,960
it's totally correct.

366
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,620
So you,

367
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,740
when you study us humans,

368
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,320
when being,

369
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:48,740
when we've gone to war over the last 1000 years,

370
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:52,879
typically we go to war and I've never been to war,

371
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,379
so I never want to,

372
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:58,220
but we've gone to war typically with symbols,

373
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,179
uh,

374
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:00,679
flags and music.

375
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,220
So we create our own battle flag and that was a boxing kangaroo flag,

376
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,440
red gloves for aggression.

377
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:09,080
Pumped up chest to take on the world.

378
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,220
When you look at the stance of the boxing kangaroo flag,

379
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:11,720
it's a,

380
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,379
it's,

381
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:15,419
it's ready to fight and the gloves are all about aggression.

382
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:16,279
So that was part of the,

383
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,440
you might say,

384
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:17,899
you know,

385
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:18,980
the thinking behind it.

386
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,179
And,

387
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:20,480
uh,

388
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,419
the men at work battle down under was our battle.

389
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:23,919
Him.

390
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,659
We bought the biggest loudspeakers we could.

391
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,700
And when we left the dock in Newport,

392
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,299
Rhode Island,

393
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:31,039
we had maximum volume on the,

394
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,100
on our tender black Swan men at work down under,

395
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,080
and the flag was broken out and we went,

396
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:36,559
you know,

397
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,259
we're off to war in the world of sport.

398
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:40,559
It's a,

399
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,519
it's brilliant.

400
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,240
And as I said,

401
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,600
I can't recommend highly enough to go and see it beautifully done via the

402
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,500
Netflix forum,

403
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,559
bring it all back to life.

404
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,019
They capture it incredibly well.

405
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:53,840
And as you said at the start of this conversation,

406
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,059
John,

407
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,000
you don't just do it on your own.

408
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,860
You needed to have the whole organization.

409
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,059
And there's some characters that I wanted to talk to you about that were

410
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:04,519
instrumental in it and get your reflections on it again,

411
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,200
if you don't mind Ben Lex,

412
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,399
and you described as the Leonardo da Vinci of Australia who designed that

413
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,360
famous wind kill,

414
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,960
which you weren't initially on board with at the start,

415
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,940
you had your reservations.

416
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,320
Can you,

417
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,259
can you tell us a bit about Ben and why that was so important?

418
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:18,960
Well,

419
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,639
Benny,

420
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,139
he was an orphan.

421
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:25,580
He went to school at nine and left at 12 and he was both

422
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,740
presumably unteachable.

423
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,080
And so he's never,

424
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:29,500
you know,

425
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,039
I have two degrees in engineering and I remember my professor at MIT saying,

426
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,840
you know,

427
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,200
involved advanced mathematics,

428
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,740
he said,

429
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,159
until you put a problem into an into an equation,

430
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,179
you can never solve it.

431
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:45,179
And it took me quite a long time working with people like Benny and Alan Bond to

432
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:47,120
understand that that's not the case.

433
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,059
This sense of intuition and gut feel as well as,

434
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:50,539
you know,

435
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:52,039
being students of their,

436
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:55,700
of their act area of activity and with driven by passion is really,

437
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,700
really powerful.

438
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,240
And women have a great sense of intuitive feel,

439
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,840
you know,

440
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,740
asking questions,

441
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,340
you know,

442
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,240
asking questions,

443
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,840
you know,

444
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,440
you know,

445
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,159
you know,

446
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:04,759
you know,

447
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:05,440
you know,

448
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:05,960
you know,

449
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,360
us men look,

450
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:07,580
you know,

451
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,240
we can meet someone and we think they're a nice person and the women can figure it out

452
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,639
straight away that they're dickheads or not.

453
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,340
It's so true,

454
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:14,659
isn't it?

455
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:15,080
Yeah.

456
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,200
And anytime I've got that wrong in my life,

457
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:18,740
my wife's always been right.

458
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,039
Yep.

459
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,299
A hundred percent of the time.

460
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:20,659
Yep.

461
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:20,960
It's,

462
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,559
that's right.

463
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,700
So why is it so?

464
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:22,820
Well,

465
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,019
their brains are different.

466
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:25,460
They look at life differently.

467
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,259
They're through their own prisms.

468
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:27,559
They've,

469
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:27,840
you know,

470
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,639
they have different.

471
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,360
So this is all the power of my opinion,

472
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,500
sort of the lateral thinking or the intuitive field,

473
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,100
particularly,

474
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:34,720
you know,

475
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,299
women,

476
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:35,539
you know,

477
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:36,620
Raza drives me nuts.

478
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,179
She,

479
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:38,480
I give her a little bit information.

480
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,759
She's straight onto it and she's adding value before I can even finish what I'm talking

481
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:43,600
about.

482
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:44,600
And,

483
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,159
um,

484
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:45,960
but the point is,

485
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,440
is that Benny was a little bit like that.

486
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,100
Okay.

487
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,639
So he had this intuitive feel,

488
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,820
but for every 10 ideas,

489
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:53,840
eight would be crazy,

490
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,620
but two of them were,

491
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,419
gee,

492
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:55,919
you know,

493
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:56,960
really interesting.

494
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,559
Benny was a student of life and he was a student of nature.

495
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:01,940
Uh,

496
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,480
and,

497
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,379
uh,

498
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:04,220
he knew it was different.

499
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,059
For example,

500
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:08,059
and this is true to wash his clothes.

501
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:11,359
He'd go into the shower and scrub with his clothes on.

502
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:11,920
Right.

503
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,759
And in some cases up in Sydney,

504
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:15,680
if the weather was warm enough,

505
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,799
he'd just walk around until the clothes dry.

506
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,420
So we are talking about a different cat here.

507
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,440
That's a unique way to,

508
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,140
uh,

509
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,220
to get the clothes clean.

510
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:23,759
Yeah.

511
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,940
He was the godfather of our,

512
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,759
of our son,

513
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:27,259
Lucas.

514
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:28,519
He's now 48 years old.

515
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:30,980
So we're talking about a long time ago and he,

516
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:31,839
the man was brilliant.

517
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:32,079
You know,

518
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:32,480
the,

519
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,079
as I say,

520
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:33,259
you know,

521
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:34,279
he was my opinion.

522
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,480
He was the Leonardo,

523
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:38,180
Vinci of this country in terms of his,

524
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,480
uh,

525
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:38,779
you know,

526
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:40,700
his ability to just be out there.

527
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:41,740
And,

528
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,079
uh,

529
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,799
so he was the creator of this thing called the wing keel.

530
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:47,920
And when we first,

531
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,920
I first saw it,

532
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,519
you mentioned before I had reservations.

533
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:50,960
Absolutely.

534
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,000
Because I'd been involved with Ben's first project.

535
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,420
I was assistant designer straight out of MIT,

536
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,079
uh,

537
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,640
in 1974,

538
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,259
Southern cross.

539
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:00,039
And it was a dog.

540
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:00,980
The boat was slow.

541
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,059
And I,

542
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:02,660
I said,

543
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,339
Benny,

544
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:05,519
just give us something equal and we can play the game.

545
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:07,160
But for God's sake,

546
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,400
you know,

547
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,779
what are we doing with this stuff?

548
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:09,420
But at any rate,

549
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,039
I'm sure he manipulated the coefficients and the computer,

550
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:13,339
but he,

551
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:16,539
he said that this boat's going to be when the America's kept by half an hour,

552
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:17,059
every race,

553
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:20,980
you've got to love that confidence,

554
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,460
but to get back to the psyche,

555
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,359
John,

556
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,660
you know,

557
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,039
having the sheet around that wind kill and the mystique of what that created,

558
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:28,640
uh,

559
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,339
it was clearly a fast boat and,

560
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:31,539
and had some advantages,

561
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:34,880
but playing back into you and getting the psychology,

562
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,539
it spooked me.

563
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:36,619
The Americans a bit,

564
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:36,980
didn't it?

565
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,640
The fact that there was something mysterious going on as well.

566
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,920
Was that a big part of it was in the end,

567
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,140
we didn't realize how big a deal it was going to be,

568
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,480
but in looking back on their decision-making under extreme pressure,

569
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,579
the psychology,

570
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:54,160
the psychology of not knowing what they're racing against and Dennis Connor,

571
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,559
my,

572
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,000
my counterpart skipper,

573
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,220
the American defender,

574
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:00,859
he wrote a book called no excuses to lose,

575
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:04,940
which is all about if you're out fundraise and out research and out train,

576
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,740
relative to the opposition,

577
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,579
then there's no excuse.

578
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:07,940
And it's,

579
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,460
it's a damn good philosophy of life in many ways.

580
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:11,539
And,

581
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:11,900
uh,

582
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,019
so that was fine.

583
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:13,180
Now,

584
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,519
when loss ratio in,

585
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,059
cause we had to race against a whole bunch of other nations,

586
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:19,400
the Canadians and the Brits and the French Italians,

587
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,380
before we won the right to challenge for the,

588
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,099
for the America's cup in that period,

589
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:25,500
we,

590
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,900
I think we won a 48 out of 56 races over the period of summer,

591
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,059
five months of racing and wind loss ratio is very,

592
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:33,680
very high.

593
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:34,920
We had a terrific,

594
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,539
package,

595
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:36,460
not only the wing keel,

596
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,400
but the cell development,

597
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,180
a whole bunch of stuff such that we were world-class as it turns out.

598
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:42,180
And,

599
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:42,500
uh,

600
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,759
the net net of it is,

601
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:45,299
is that he,

602
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:45,460
you know,

603
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,759
in that final race,

604
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,359
uh,

605
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:49,160
which they call the race of the century,

606
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:50,319
um,

607
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,619
they made more mistakes than we did.

608
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,039
Simple as that.

609
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,940
It's going to be Australia too.

610
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,180
They are going to win it.

611
00:19:58,579 --> 00:19:59,779
Stand up Australia,

612
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:03,319
stand up Australia and give these boys a cheer.

613
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,519
We are looking for this.

614
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:04,920
Smoke it out.

615
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,779
They're about to do it.

616
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,500
They're about to cross the line.

617
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,059
They make a final move.

618
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,559
Yeah.

619
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,099
And,

620
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,279
uh,

621
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,119
almost the perfect,

622
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:20,740
uh,

623
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,480
race that you sailed in that last thing.

624
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:24,640
You were down 51 seconds in the final race,

625
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,519
which was the second biggest lead of any time throughout the seven race series.

626
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:28,859
And,

627
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,960
and as you said,

628
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:30,420
uh,

629
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,960
you didn't make a mistake and they did.

630
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:32,779
Can I ask you,

631
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:34,740
I've got a couple more characters to come back to that,

632
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,420
uh,

633
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:36,019
you know,

634
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:37,299
the Australian prime minister is one.

635
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,460
I don't want to talk to you about Alan Bond,

636
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,059
but what was your relationship like with Dennis?

637
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,079
Connor afterwards.

638
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:44,119
And as life has gone on,

639
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:45,099
uh,

640
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,380
was,

641
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,740
was there a friendship or was there respect?

642
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:48,359
What was it like?

643
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:49,000
Uh,

644
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,180
well,

645
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,160
respect clearly,

646
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,599
uh,

647
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:51,019
friendship,

648
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,579
you know,

649
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,259
us Australians have a different type of friendship than America.

650
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,059
Americans in a lot of cases is,

651
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,000
and again,

652
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,039
this is a broad brush,

653
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,039
uh,

654
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:01,339
in a U S it's more,

655
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,119
maybe considered more transactional.

656
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:03,779
Okay.

657
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,920
Is there an opportunity?

658
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:09,519
There was a deal there or whatever business relationship in Australia transcends that we,

659
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,000
uh,

660
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,019
it's just the way we,

661
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,180
we are and which I love.

662
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:13,759
Um,

663
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:14,619
but,

664
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:14,839
uh,

665
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:15,460
so with Dennis,

666
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,140
you know what,

667
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:21,420
we really haven't talked about the America's cup since that final race together when you've caught up.

668
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:22,059
Correct.

669
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:24,039
And I've raced against Dennis quite a lot,

670
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:24,740
uh,

671
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,440
in the actual class and they were,

672
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:26,680
you know,

673
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,640
highly competitive.

674
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:28,759
The,

675
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:29,200
the,

676
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,680
it doesn't matter where we are in the fleet.

677
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,539
We always kind of understand where the other bloke is.

678
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,140
Uh,

679
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,819
but you know,

680
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,180
this thing cuts deep,

681
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:39,279
you know,

682
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:39,579
it's a,

683
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:40,519
to lose,

684
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:41,079
uh,

685
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,920
you know,

686
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,180
it was to be the first to,

687
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,559
to lose was a big deal.

688
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,059
And,

689
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:45,480
uh,

690
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:45,980
and I,

691
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,039
and I fully respect and understand that.

692
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,299
It's an amazing,

693
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:49,720
uh,

694
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,799
amazing story and,

695
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,319
and a character like him.

696
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,299
It's sort of Shakespeare in,

697
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:53,859
in some ways,

698
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:54,500
isn't it?

699
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,319
You're very different,

700
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:55,819
but,

701
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:55,839
uh,

702
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,480
clearly that's lasted a lifetime.

703
00:21:57,819 --> 00:21:58,900
Speaking of extraordinary care,

704
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,839
Alan Bond,

705
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,359
um,

706
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:00,539
you know,

707
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:00,799
again,

708
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:06,079
for those younger may not know legendary Australian business figure and,

709
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:06,619
you know,

710
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:09,519
had some tragedy late in life and people have their own judgments on that.

711
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,259
But really,

712
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:12,059
for him to fund,

713
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:12,319
you know,

714
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,420
cause it was the fourth boat that he'd fund.

715
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,500
It wasn't an America's cup.

716
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,160
So tell us about Alan Bond,

717
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,079
your relationship with him and how you,

718
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:19,859
how you view him.

719
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,140
Well,

720
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,240
I first met Alan,

721
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:21,720
uh,

722
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,819
when I got involved with that foot,

723
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:26,819
that America's cup way back in 1974 Southern cross.

724
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:28,539
And Benny was the designer.

725
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:30,240
So the way to,

726
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,539
uh,

727
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,140
to describe Alan was he,

728
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:37,440
who was a technically broke property developer out of Perth at that stage,

729
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,619
at that stage challenge,

730
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,240
having the audacity to challenge,

731
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,640
for the America's cup when he was 34 years old,

732
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:44,680
he had no idea what he was doing.

733
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,480
All right.

734
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:46,480
Uh,

735
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,019
and,

736
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:49,259
and nor did Benny and the boat,

737
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:49,500
you know,

738
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,440
was slow or whatever,

739
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,059
but you know,

740
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:52,480
we're not with great intent,

741
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,079
but we just,

742
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,539
we were not in the game.

743
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,660
Uh,

744
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,559
but you know what?

745
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,599
He kept coming back and back and back.

746
00:22:58,599 --> 00:22:59,619
So he lost,

747
00:22:59,680 --> 00:22:59,920
you know,

748
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,119
we lost 74.

749
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,500
I didn't,

750
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,140
I didn't go back in 1977.

751
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,420
I said,

752
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:04,839
it's amateur.

753
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,940
I got involved with the one,

754
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,160
a bronze medal at the Olympics in Montreal.

755
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,180
And then,

756
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,759
and then built our own business here in Australia,

757
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,220
1980 beaten again.

758
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,359
I was involved in,

759
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:17,180
as it turns out,

760
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,160
uh,

761
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
and then 83.

762
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,240
So you're talking about resilience and,

763
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,779
uh,

764
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:23,039
you know,

765
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,359
Alan and Alan's,

766
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,700
his motivation was different.

767
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,079
Everyone has a different reason for being involved with this crazy event.

768
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:33,880
His business was to move from a,

769
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,079
a,

770
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:38,019
a local trader to a global trader.

771
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:39,859
So the best way to describe,

772
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:41,240
to describe Alan is when we won,

773
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,440
he went straight to wall street.

774
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:47,359
He had every investment banker wanting to meet him and every Saudi Arabian Prince,

775
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,259
most importantly,

776
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,180
wanting to lend him money.

777
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:51,680
Show me the money.

778
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:52,700
And he had,

779
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,359
so there was,

780
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,859
there was method behind the,

781
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,700
uh,

782
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:55,980
the,

783
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,660
the alignment.

784
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,160
He was,

785
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,019
he was clear on.

786
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:58,200
And,

787
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,759
and,

788
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:00,200
and at a point in time,

789
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:00,859
I mean,

790
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:03,980
how big for those who don't understand Alan Bond bought everything.

791
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:04,519
He did.

792
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:05,619
He was into Chile.

793
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,200
He,

794
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,200
he controlled the telecommunications system in Chile.

795
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,299
Yeah.

796
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:10,059
Correct.

797
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:11,539
Not only Australia and London,

798
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:13,079
um,

799
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:13,799
and Rome,

800
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,980
he had major shopping centers outside of Rome that he was developing.

801
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:23,019
So give me a dollar and I'll make $2 on it on the way through and borrow a whole heap on the way as a result.

802
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,119
So he was amazing entrepreneur.

803
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,039
Was it money in the end?

804
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:27,299
No,

805
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,799
it was power.

806
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,759
It was influence for Alan.

807
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:32,339
There was no stopping him.

808
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:33,119
And it was like,

809
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:33,660
uh,

810
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,039
ultimately the whole thing blew apart,

811
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:36,359
uh,

812
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:36,599
you know,

813
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:37,380
with the financial,

814
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,380
he went to jail,

815
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:38,839
Alan Bond.

816
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:39,140
He did.

817
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,240
Yeah.

818
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:39,900
That's right.

819
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:44,579
How was that for you then to have this such a piece of history that you're so connected to it?

820
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:44,880
Was that a,

821
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:46,559
was that challenging?

822
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,400
I've been clearly,

823
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,839
I'm upsetting and challenging.

824
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:49,200
Yes.

825
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,420
Well,

826
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,599
I communicated with Alan in jail,

827
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,160
but typical of Bondy,

828
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:54,779
God bless him.

829
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:55,859
He had the,

830
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:56,119
uh,

831
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,759
he had the inmates organized and he's giving them lessons on business.

832
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,799
So there's no podcast in those days.

833
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:07,079
It was just one on one and he had his own clientele.

834
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:08,059
Amazing.

835
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:08,279
Yeah.

836
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:08,579
Yeah.

837
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah.

838
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,500
That's an incredible part of the story.

839
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,180
Bob Hawke's the prime minister at the time.

840
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,079
And,

841
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:17,539
and this probably was the thing that transcended his prime ministership in lots of ways.

842
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:17,799
I mean,

843
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:18,640
Bob Hawke,

844
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,259
uh,

845
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:20,400
floated the dollar.

846
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,420
He did lots of things that strategically changed the course of Australian history,

847
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,900
but he's probably remembered for that famous quote more than anything.

848
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,599
I tell you what,

849
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:31,680
any boss who sacks anyone for not turning up the day is a bum.

850
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,599
For an Australian prime minister to say that makes me smile still to think about it.

851
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:36,900
Uh,

852
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,180
for,

853
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,640
for anyone around the world.

854
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,500
The Yanks,

855
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,559
they couldn't believe that the prime minister of a country of Australia would be saying

856
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,880
such outrageous stuff.

857
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,759
But what I loved in the documentary,

858
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:48,380
you shared a story for you.

859
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,380
It was even more powerful was that in the lead up to the final race,

860
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,059
he got on the phone and you,

861
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,059
I think you said to him,

862
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:56,680
we're going to do our best.

863
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,680
And,

864
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
and his response was,

865
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,680
what did he say back to you?

866
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
Well,

867
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
it was actually in person.

868
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,680
So as it turns out,

869
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,680
uh,

870
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
uh,

871
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,680
prime minister Hawke,

872
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,680
Bob Hawke and Paul Keating,

873
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
the tre the new treasurer,

874
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
newly,

875
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:08,839
uh,

876
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,839
elected,

877
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:10,839
uh,

878
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:11,839
you know,

879
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:12,839
uh,

880
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,839
in,

881
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:14,839
in,

882
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,839
in,

883
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:16,839
in the party,

884
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:17,839
the labor party of Australia,

885
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:18,839
they happened to be at an international monetary conference in Washington,

886
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:19,839
DC.

887
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:20,839
And,

888
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:21,839
uh,

889
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:22,839
as it turns out,

890
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:26,119
they were down at the boat for the first race of the America's cup.

891
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,119
And I remember,

892
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,119
uh,

893
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,119
you know,

894
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,119
uh,

895
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,119
uh,

896
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,119
Paul Keating in the background with his Australia to,

897
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,119
uh,

898
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:34,119
you know,

899
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,119
Australian wool jersey on.

900
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:38,019
So Bondi comes down to the boat.

901
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:38,839
This is the first race.

902
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:39,839
The America's cup.

903
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:40,839
So we'd gone through the trials,

904
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:41,839
the Louis Vuitton cup and so on.

905
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,839
And we won that.

906
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,839
And,

907
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,839
uh,

908
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,839
you know,

909
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:46,839
you can't practice this environments again,

910
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:47,839
a little bit like the MCG,

911
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:48,839
a hundred thousand people.

912
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:49,839
You can't,

913
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:51,839
you can't practice that environment and the,

914
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:52,839
and the intensity of it.

915
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:53,839
Well,

916
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,799
you can a little bit with Australian footy because you do get big crowds and you've whatever,

917
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:58,799
but this thing,

918
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,799
there's every four years,

919
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:00,799
it's a new world.

920
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,799
So you,

921
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:02,799
anyway,

922
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,960
so five minutes to nine,

923
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
we'd leave the boat,

924
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,839
leave the dock at nine o'clock plus or minus 30 seconds a minute.

925
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:08,839
Uh,

926
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:09,839
again,

927
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:10,839
a military operation.

928
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,839
And,

929
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,839
uh,

930
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,599
so their new prime minister came down to the boat and I was on the stern of the boat,

931
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:16,599
the back of the boat.

932
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:17,599
And,

933
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,599
uh,

934
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:22,079
and we're just about to break out the boxing kangaroo flag and the music was about to,

935
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,079
uh,

936
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,079
to arc up.

937
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,079
And he says,

938
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,079
he said,

939
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,079
I say to him,

940
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,079
well,

941
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,079
you know,

942
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,079
what do you say?

943
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,079
I said,

944
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,079
uh,

945
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,079
welcome Mr.

946
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,079
Prime minister.

947
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,079
And he's in his,

948
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,079
you know,

949
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,079
gravelly voice.

950
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,079
He says,

951
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,079
what do you say?

952
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,079
I said,

953
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,079
well,

954
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,079
Bob,

955
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,079
we'll give it our best shot.

956
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,079
He says,

957
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,079
bullshit.

958
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,079
He says,

959
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,079
destroy the bastards.

960
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,079
So that's,

961
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,079
you know,

962
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,079
the prime minister of our country,

963
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,079
you talk about a communication ability.

964
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:52,079
He was unbelievable.

965
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,079
And when he actually said,

966
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,079
and we,

967
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,079
we weren't here at the time,

968
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,079
we're half around the world,

969
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:57,079
you know,

970
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,079
Newport,

971
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,079
but anyone who sacks anyway to today,

972
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,079
anyone who sacks anyone for being late today is a bum.

973
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,079
That was not pre-rehearsed.

974
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,079
I know that.

975
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,079
And,

976
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,079
and,

977
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:05,079
and,

978
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,079
and,

979
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:07,079
and,

980
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:08,079
I know that.

981
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:13,079
It was typical of Hawke in his ability to capture the essence of the moment.

982
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:14,079
And that's communication.

983
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,079
You know,

984
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,079
that's leadership.

985
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:18,079
So what I learned from that,

986
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,079
I spent a little time with,

987
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,079
you know,

988
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,079
with Bob Hawke,

989
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:24,079
following over the years,

990
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,079
is his,

991
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:30,079
his great sense of leadership through being able to capture the essence of the time.

992
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:32,079
And that as an eight year old going back,

993
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,079
that was the thing you heard.

994
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,079
This is the prime minister of our country.

995
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,079
He's,

996
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,079
it's that big.

997
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:43,559
made it big for you, as you said, by an unrehearsed line that has stood the test of time, it captured

998
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:44,240
the moment, didn't it?

999
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:51,819
And he said, basically, all the great things, floating the dollar and deregulating the financial

1000
00:28:51,819 --> 00:28:57,380
system in this country, it's unbelievable what they achieved, he and Keating, the words

1001
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,839
that were remembered was that line, yeah, yeah, and he's proud of it too.

1002
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:06,619
Yeah, what a great chapter in our history of our country, and to have the Prime Minister

1003
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:13,480
sum it up is equally as special, you know, I could talk for days about what you achieved

1004
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,960
in 1983, but to see you overlay your leadership into every other area of your life, I find

1005
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,359
equally fascinating, the Australian swim team is probably, from an Olympic point of

1006
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:30,500
view, the most prestigious group that win medals, lost its way, only won gold in London

1007
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,819
and had lots of culture.

1008
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:38,779
And John Bertrand steps up to the plate, and you bring your psychology and your leadership

1009
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:44,059
to Swimming Australia with great success, Tokyo's the most successful Olympics the Australian

1010
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:47,619
swim team's ever had, can you tell us about how you went about instilling that in the

1011
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:47,980
swim team?

1012
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,700
Well, I was approached initially by one of the directors, Clem Doherty, former partner

1013
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:59,119
of McKinsey's, who I knew previously, he asked me whether I'd consider taking on the

1014
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:01,819
chairmanship role of Swimming Australia, because it was a very important role for me, and I

1015
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:07,940
was, you know, it had its issues, and I initially said no, but anyway, he came back a few times

1016
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,279
and eventually I said, I said, there, let's give this a shot, I didn't have any swimming

1017
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:16,900
background at all, which was, as it turns out, an advantage, so I went in as a clean

1018
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:24,460
skin, you might say, lots of politics, you know, these amateur organisations, great intent,

1019
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:29,500
but so much, so many people, so much passion, lots of blood on the water, I can tell you,

1020
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:31,460
and primarily...

1021
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:39,500
it was dysfunctional when I first saw the whole thing, it lacked trust, which is so

1022
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:47,140
important when your back's to the wall, and it lacked a vision, and so I came in as chair,

1023
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,000
I said, yeah, this is of national importance, let's give this a shot, for better or worse,

1024
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:58,440
so I embarked on the journey just after the London Olympics in 2013, and major, major

1025
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,819
changes internally, but primarily, I guess, if you talk about the fact that I was a swimmer,

1026
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:09,920
about the major positions and change, it was, and again, coming from the school of

1027
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:15,240
hard knocks, and losing as well as a bit of winning with the World of America's Cup, part

1028
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,220
of my sort of added value is this vision of, what's this game going to look like in 10

1029
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,680
years' time, let's get there faster than anyone else in the world, okay, so take the blinkers

1030
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,420
off, and it was based on my own experience with the Olympics, where you've every, the

1031
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,680
Olympics is really the cutting edge of everything.

1032
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:31,819
So, I was in the Olympics, I was in the Olympics, I was in the Olympics, I was in the Olympics,

1033
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:37,660
there's no confusion, you're either, you either win or you're a bum, there's no confusion

1034
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:42,960
out there, you know, I won the leather medal at the German Olympics, fourth place, it's

1035
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,259
worse than last, and other than mum and the kids, nobody cares, okay, eventually I got

1036
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:52,700
on the platform, on the podium, I won the bronze, you know, in Montreal, thank goodness,

1037
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:58,039
you know, my God, the difference between fourth and third is unbelievable, so, you know, with

1038
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:01,680
no money, no coaching, no anything, but at any rate, if you look at any four-year

1039
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,920
period, you get improvement in performance, 100-meter sprint, throwing a javelin, interesting

1040
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,700
enough, any 10 or 20, particularly 20-year period of the Olympic movement, a quantum

1041
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,680
leap in performance, so the question is not why is it so, it's just that history tells

1042
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:22,480
us that in 20 years' time, playing the game of this thing called the America's Cup will

1043
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,279
be much further progressed than what it is now, AFL football, the business, the industry

1044
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,480
of podcasting, what we're doing now, in 10 years' time.

1045
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,720
You know, it's hard to imagine the way this thing will evolve, but it's here, it's fast,

1046
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,880
it's growing.

1047
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,440
Human endeavor, the human brain is amazing, you know, the suggestions is that we use maybe

1048
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,240
nine or 10% of the potential of this incredible computer hanging between our ears, the brain,

1049
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,440
the massive supercomputer, okay.

1050
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,960
If we can move to 10 or 11, sorry, 11 or 12%, you have major, major breakthrough.

1051
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,960
So when we look at human endeavor, Olympics, you know, it's, you know, it's, it's, it's,

1052
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,240
it's a big endeavor.

1053
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,200
Olympics, you get an improvement in performance, there's no question, same analogy for this

1054
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,740
crazy thing called the America's Cup.

1055
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:15,019
So part of my, and, and same with swimming Australia, we do not know what freestyle will

1056
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:19,240
look like in 10 years' time, that's gotta be the mentality.

1057
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,240
Freestyle was originally called the Australian crawl.

1058
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,380
In the late 20s, 1920s, other than the head going down, the human body getting stronger,

1059
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,039
okay, nutrition, a whole bunch of stuff.

1060
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:30,920
Nothing's changed.

1061
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:38,119
so got to bring in the supercomputer computational flow dynamics cfd from the world of america's

1062
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:44,400
cup let's start analyzing the human form going through this viscous fluid called water which

1063
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,900
is just drag how do you actually reduce your drag forgetting about increasing the power with

1064
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,900
strokes and so on what's this game going to look like in 10 years time so that was kind of my

1065
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:00,640
craziness that i brought to the table of okay we think we we think we understand what world best

1066
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,500
practice is led particularly by the united states the u.s swimming team domination all the way

1067
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,300
through we think we understand that but that's fine how do we get there faster than anyone else

1068
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:15,659
in the world you know that we that we know will be much further progressed than what it is now

1069
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:23,210
so it was part of it the other way is this thing called trust again you know from your experience

1070
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:28,230
you understand that you know in the backs to the wall you you're in the trenches you're fighting

1071
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,929
for each other okay at that stage you're not fighting for your country you're fighting for

1072
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:36,050
for your mates out on the field, in our case, America's Cup.

1073
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:37,389
How do you build trust?

1074
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:40,690
Well, trust comes from leadership, no question,

1075
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,489
and then people picking up on it.

1076
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:47,110
It's based around integrity and honesty, basic stuff.

1077
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,550
We're not talking about rocket science here.

1078
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,570
We're talking about transparency.

1079
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:53,250
Whatever you say you do, no bullshit.

1080
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:57,809
We're talking about having fun, particularly us Aussies.

1081
00:34:57,809 --> 00:34:58,670
We've got to have fun.

1082
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:04,130
Because if you're asking people to be involved 7 by 24, not 9 to 5,

1083
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,670
total commitment, then you're going to have fun.

1084
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:10,969
It's got to be a blast to be involved with these like-minded people.

1085
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,590
No dickheads, as the All Blacks say.

1086
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:14,710
How good is that?

1087
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,610
We understand what that means.

1088
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:21,730
And when you start to bring a team together and leadership from a crazy person

1089
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:24,769
like myself saying these sort of things repeatedly,

1090
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:28,650
and you've got to say something at least three times before people can walk

1091
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,530
away thinking, is that what he really said?

1092
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,210
As long as you keep it simple as well, you can't get too complicated.

1093
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,070
And incidentally, the Americans are very good at storytelling.

1094
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:43,190
They're very good, in my opinion, communicating an idea.

1095
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:44,309
That's one of their strengths.

1096
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:49,250
So anyway, so once you start to build a team, a group of people,

1097
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:54,230
where you are talking about trust and you have a vision that this is what the

1098
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,889
game is, we think now, but where do we go?

1099
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:58,170
Let's take the blinkers off.

1100
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,409
Let's back people like Benny Lexen and others.

1101
00:36:01,969 --> 00:36:03,269
Where's this game going?

1102
00:36:03,449 --> 00:36:06,510
Then you start to build, you can build something extremely formidable.

1103
00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:11,250
You know, we do not know where business will be in 20 years' time.

1104
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:15,989
You know, this advent of this fantastic new development called the internet,

1105
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:21,469
global communication, the fact that this podcast is going global, you know,

1106
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:23,969
and some of your business activities you're telling me, you know,

1107
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:25,170
that's a global vision.

1108
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:26,289
It's not local.

1109
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,630
And so we're going to start to build a team.

1110
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:34,909
We are now connected to the world and the speed of development is, you know,

1111
00:36:34,969 --> 00:36:38,869
we're on an asyntopic curve going north in human endeavor.

1112
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:44,190
So when we're talking about what do I bring to the table, Luke,

1113
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:48,050
it was really this whole issue of taking the blinkers off,

1114
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:52,070
I know with no swimming background at all, and saying, okay,

1115
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,150
let's reach for the stars.

1116
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:56,889
As I used to say, let's release the beast.

1117
00:36:56,889 --> 00:37:05,190
Let's empower our young people in particular who have no fear and no scar tissue,

1118
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:10,170
which can hold people back, and let's release the potential of what we've got here.

1119
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,010
And that was really part of my, I guess, you know,

1120
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:17,150
my added value with this thing called Swimming Australia Olympic Swim Team.

1121
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:19,650
What a great success story too, John.

1122
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,949
It's a masterclass this year and you talk about, you know,

1123
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:26,329
it sounds simple when you articulate it, but as you said,

1124
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:28,849
with the politics and the powers that be, you know,

1125
00:37:28,889 --> 00:37:32,130
and you see it when great success is in it, when organizations get that harmony.

1126
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:33,570
And I love that idea, isn't it?

1127
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:37,170
For all the endeavors that we've got, there's going to be quantum shifts,

1128
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,630
isn't there, every 10 years.

1129
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:42,329
How do we think about, you know, what it's going to look like

1130
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:45,769
and then can we get there quicker is a worthwhile thing you can apply

1131
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:46,650
to almost everything, can't you?

1132
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,909
Everything, doesn't matter what.

1133
00:37:48,949 --> 00:37:52,150
Interesting enough, also through my relationship with the Chief of Army,

1134
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:56,269
General Rick Burr, wonderful man, former head of SAS,

1135
00:37:56,329 --> 00:38:00,090
SAS operations, then head of all NATO special forces in Europe.

1136
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:03,090
And we did the Kokoda track together.

1137
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:07,289
Wonderful man called Ron Barassi, number 31.

1138
00:38:07,469 --> 00:38:09,570
One of the all-time great people.

1139
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:13,690
And I know a lot of people on that group that did the track with you.

1140
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:17,650
The great dipper and I think my father-in-law, David Shaw,

1141
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,150
might have been part of that group.

1142
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,610
And Rick was part of that.

1143
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:25,269
He was then a colonel, Rick Burr.

1144
00:38:26,329 --> 00:38:28,369
And this was probably 17 years ago.

1145
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:30,610
His career has been remarkable.

1146
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:34,210
At any rate, Rick has become a wonderful, wonderful friend.

1147
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:39,510
And so as a result, I was able to get the Australian Swim Program

1148
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:42,050
introduced into our special forces military,

1149
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,869
which was a really, again, benchmarking world best practice.

1150
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:50,050
And they are in the business of trust.

1151
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:55,769
Okay, talking to Rick, we walked the Kokoda track through Rick's eyes.

1152
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,210
Okay.

1153
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:58,570
18, 19-year-old kids defending this country.

1154
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:00,050
No military backup.

1155
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:00,969
No nothing.

1156
00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:01,489
Okay.

1157
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:05,869
Fighting a much more superior force,

1158
00:39:05,869 --> 00:39:09,789
the Japanese coming through, highly trained, you know, jungled fighters.

1159
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:15,869
Our guys had World War III, sorry, World War I issue 303 rifles.

1160
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,250
No camouflage uniforms.

1161
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,010
Nothing.

1162
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:19,449
Okay.

1163
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,329
And I said, you know, I remember Rick saying, you know,

1164
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,289
at that stage, what are these people fighting for?

1165
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:26,309
We're talking about trust here.

1166
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:28,909
And he said, at that stage, it's not the country.

1167
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,429
It's not even your family back home.

1168
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,309
It's your mates in the trenches, in the water, you know,

1169
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:36,570
take the boots off, the skin comes off on the boots,

1170
00:39:36,989 --> 00:39:39,590
put the boots back on and go back to help your mates.

1171
00:39:40,389 --> 00:39:44,909
So they, when we talk about trust, they, Rick recommended a book,

1172
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,670
and I think, I'm not sure exactly the title,

1173
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:49,610
but I think it's in the order of The Circle of Trust.

1174
00:39:50,269 --> 00:39:55,869
And that is you cannot build an organization beyond the perimeter of trust

1175
00:39:55,869 --> 00:39:56,309
that you have.

1176
00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:57,429
That you have within your organization.

1177
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:01,489
So special forces like SAS commandos,

1178
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:03,869
their operations can be halfway around the world.

1179
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:08,150
If their perimeter doesn't extend to where their people are,

1180
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,949
you don't have trust, you can't operate.

1181
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:12,690
And I think that's a fascinating concept.

1182
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:17,369
So they put, you know, they do their 10,000 hours plus plus

1183
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:18,869
in terms of preparation or whatever.

1184
00:40:19,469 --> 00:40:22,889
But it gets back to this very, very simple thing,

1185
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:25,889
deep down in the gut of trust without threat,

1186
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:27,550
without an organization.

1187
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,710
And it's not when the good times are on,

1188
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,510
it's when the tough times, when your back's to the wall.

1189
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:35,809
And can you, you know, do these, you know, can you,

1190
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:38,809
then you're starting to get into a world of one plus one equals three.

1191
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:42,969
And that's what a beautiful thing that is.

1192
00:40:42,969 --> 00:40:46,170
The story of Kokoda is, is, you know, such a legend,

1193
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:48,409
mostly farm hands, as you said, ill-equipped,

1194
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:52,530
the Japanese army at that stage hadn't ever been stopped in its tracks

1195
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,429
and, you know, against all odds.

1196
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:56,210
And then the thought of, you know,

1197
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:58,710
if a bit of Papua New Guinea was taken,

1198
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:01,449
then the ramifications were enormous, weren't they?

1199
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:04,289
And so no wonder that's been a pilgrimage for Australians

1200
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:05,449
to walk that track.

1201
00:41:05,449 --> 00:41:08,510
And the original army, sorry,

1202
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:13,730
our main fighting force was over in the Middle East, okay?

1203
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:18,730
Helping the Brits and our military people,

1204
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:23,170
kids sent to Port Moresby, they were called the Chocos.

1205
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:25,550
They were all the rejects and the idea was,

1206
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:29,449
put them under pressure and they'll melt like chocolate. So there's no training.

1207
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:33,550
They were sent over there to build an airport and then realised that the

1208
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:37,469
Japanese were coming through the jungle over the Kokoda Track, through the

1209
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:41,530
mountains. So there's just no training, no nothing. But what these kids

1210
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:45,630
did for each other. Incredible story, isn't it? Incredible story

1211
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:49,449
of leadership and you bringing that into swimming and changing the

1212
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:53,010
culture and seeing that success, John. I love you keep coming back to trust.

1213
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,690
It's where we hear a lot of, but when you implement it properly and

1214
00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:00,889
the trust of your crew in America's Cup, the trust that you build

1215
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:05,090
in swimming that was dysfunctional at the time is a great story. Well, a comment

1216
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:09,030
there is that when we're 3-1 down, okay, during the America's Cup, we had

1217
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:13,010
to get from, so the Yanks got up to three all and all they had to do is win one

1218
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:16,929
more race. So we came from 3-1 down to 3-2 to 3-3

1219
00:42:16,929 --> 00:42:19,269
and eventually won that final race.

1220
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,769
The organisation was

1221
00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:26,130
extremely tight and trust was

1222
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:30,590
total. So we were a hard, we were basically almost an

1223
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:33,329
impossible organisation to kill off.

1224
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:38,250
And the Yanks threw everything at us. But

1225
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:42,929
this whole issue of we're pretty much impossible to kill off

1226
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:46,590
as a competing organisation. That's pretty

1227
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:50,789
formidable. And part of it, technology was there, etc.

1228
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,570
But the guts,

1229
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:57,329
the glue was this thing called the trust throughout the organisation for each

1230
00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:01,250
other. We're literally willing, and let's face it, it's only a sporting event,

1231
00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:02,849
but we're willing to die for each other.

1232
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:17,230
On the eve of that last race, the Americans went in and Dennis Connors got

1233
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:21,010
the ruling to be able to change the setup of their boat, which

1234
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:24,570
it was a technicality that didn't feel like it was

1235
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:29,190
in keeping with the spirit, but they were going to do anything

1236
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,769
to the Americans. Their refusal to look, that would have unnerved,

1237
00:43:32,769 --> 00:43:32,829
you know, the team. So, you know, I think that's a big thing.

1238
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:36,809
a lot of crews at that stage, knowing that they were going to be able to adjust their boat.

1239
00:43:36,909 --> 00:43:39,889
But as you said, the trust that your team had, you were

1240
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:44,349
unable to be killed. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we're

1241
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:48,670
as it turns out, we're pretty, it was a very, very good

1242
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:52,730
team. There's no question about it. Yeah. John, we've been talking to different leaders

1243
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:56,610
and your story is profound in Australian history

1244
00:43:56,610 --> 00:44:00,829
around what great leadership looks like in the current context. And it's a passion I was

1245
00:44:00,829 --> 00:44:02,829
sharing with you before for the world of a leader.

1246
00:44:02,829 --> 00:44:06,789
A leader, a business we've created where we're connecting different leaders together from around

1247
00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:10,750
the globe and trying to identify great leadership. And we see these common traits. I want to ask you

1248
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:14,570
about some of them. We see all leaders really have a sense of self-leadership as

1249
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:18,789
a place where you start. And does that term resonate with you, a

1250
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:22,730
sense of self-leadership? What do you mean by that? For me, it means the idea

1251
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:26,730
that if I'm going to be able to lead anyone else, I really have to live those values

1252
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:30,510
and I need to live up to the same set of values that I want others to

1253
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,809
do. So for me, it's about the daily routine.

1254
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:36,889
And the habits is what I think self-leadership. It means different things to other people.

1255
00:44:36,889 --> 00:44:41,190
Yeah. Well, it's interesting. I hadn't thought about it that way, but primarily

1256
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:45,230
we're talking about authenticity. This word authentic is

1257
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:49,110
used a lot. But I think what you're saying, and I understand

1258
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:53,329
that, I think it's, you know, you can't

1259
00:44:53,329 --> 00:44:57,210
bullshit people, you know. You know, we talked about

1260
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:00,469
before Craig McRae, okay, the Collingwood coach.

1261
00:45:00,469 --> 00:45:04,469
Phenomenal story, this whole journey with

1262
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:08,469
being a Collingwood supporter. But what you see with Craig is what you

1263
00:45:08,469 --> 00:45:12,550
get. There's no confusion there. It's not as if he's, you know,

1264
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:16,449
he's moving from one idea to another. It's really, is it basic?

1265
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:20,530
No, it's not basic because he's really, really, he's, you know, he's a student of life. He's always

1266
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:24,030
learning. He's inquisitive. He's curious. It's wonderful stuff.

1267
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:28,309
But authentic, absolutely. The bloke is authentic.

1268
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:29,929
And people,

1269
00:45:30,469 --> 00:45:33,969
can figure that out real fast. At Harvard Business School, they have

1270
00:45:33,969 --> 00:45:37,809
an authentic leadership course, which has been extremely successful for

1271
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:42,190
some of our people. And

1272
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:46,250
you know, this whole issue of living the

1273
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,630
values, yeah, I understand what you're saying. Yeah, I love you. You mentioned

1274
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:53,949
Craig, and for those who don't follow Australian Ross football, we took a team that was 17th,

1275
00:45:53,989 --> 00:45:58,190
John's team. And I say to a lot of people, if you don't bear for Collingwood,

1276
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:00,429
people won't understand. Everyone hates Collingwood, historically.

1277
00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:04,650
But he made everyone, I think, love and respect

1278
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:08,389
just, as you said, purely with his authenticity and everything

1279
00:46:08,389 --> 00:46:12,389
he did and all his language and whatever the circumstances were.

1280
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:16,389
You could just feel that pour out of him. And the playing group

1281
00:46:16,389 --> 00:46:20,469
behind, who on paper, John, you look at and think sort of talent for talent at the moment,

1282
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:23,969
they're probably not at the level that they played at. But just his

1283
00:46:23,969 --> 00:46:27,989
incredible authenticity, I'm not surprised you referenced that.

1284
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,150
Another dimension we see,

1285
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:34,010
John, leaders are really conscious around how they positively impact other people

1286
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:38,210
in their environments, you know, in real time. Have you thought

1287
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:41,610
about that, that positive impact on people? No question. You know,

1288
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:45,829
I've never seen a successful leader who's naturally negative,

1289
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:48,730
you know, and a pessimist. Gee,

1290
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:54,050
you know, this whole issue of seeing the best of any

1291
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:57,909
situation and or figuring out how you get there, you know, natural

1292
00:46:57,909 --> 00:47:00,130
inclination, that's all part and parcel.

1293
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:04,190
of leadership. So, you know, leadership, I think, very much into positive

1294
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:08,090
frame of mind, its ability to communicate. No question about it. It's a

1295
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:12,130
set of values that people can aspire to. You know, this new, you know,

1296
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:15,989
the young people now, the values of leadership

1297
00:47:15,989 --> 00:47:19,969
extremely important. We see that in terms of the way the companies are and

1298
00:47:19,969 --> 00:47:23,789
you know, setting up their value propositions and so on. But it has to come from leaders.

1299
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:28,070
Can't be just with a whole bunch of words that mean nothing. And

1300
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,869
primarily it

1301
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,789
you know, living, as I said, living the values

1302
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:37,989
and you know, using this word called authentic, which is true

1303
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:41,309
is part and parcel. Yeah, it's

1304
00:47:41,309 --> 00:47:46,170
what anyone, but particularly new generation

1305
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:50,170
of people now figure out real fast. Yeah. I love what you said. You haven't

1306
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:53,949
seen anyone really lead successfully with a negative mindset.

1307
00:47:53,949 --> 00:47:57,949
And as you get older in life, you sort of, there is, you go,

1308
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:00,130
you gravitate towards the like, don't you?

1309
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:03,889
And negative people become hard to, you know, authentically

1310
00:48:03,889 --> 00:48:08,250
we all have negative moments, which being authentic, as you said, is a big part of it. But I

1311
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:11,869
love the way you said it. We see leaders are really conscious around

1312
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:15,929
how they create and share their vision. And your examples

1313
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:20,050
are a legend in our lifetime in Australia around having this vision

1314
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:24,050
and firstly creating it and sharing it, particularly in America's Cup, but

1315
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:28,130
certainly in swimming as well. Can you delve into sort of the micro, how you

1316
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:29,989
went about creating that vision?

1317
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:34,070
Oh, gee. Well, first of all, let me tell you a little story.

1318
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:38,150
John Longley reminded me of a couple of years ago. He was a grinder

1319
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:42,389
and an assistant manager on the dock with Warren Jones,

1320
00:48:42,769 --> 00:48:46,210
our America's Cup heavy. I'd forgotten what I

1321
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:50,130
said, but anyway, he reminded me. He said that race

1322
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:53,550
where we're so far behind, the final race, the race of the century,

1323
00:48:53,989 --> 00:48:56,929
we can hardly read their bloody numbers. That's how far back we were.

1324
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,090
Apparently, I

1325
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:04,070
said to the guys, I said, if we don't keep concentrating, we may lose

1326
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:10,050
this race. So, you're talking about positive, crazy

1327
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:14,090
positive at that stage. And it looked like the impossible challenge

1328
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:17,949
at that stage. 99% of the world would

1329
00:49:17,949 --> 00:49:21,710
say it's impossible. Forget it. Turn the television set off or whatever. Go home.

1330
00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:25,949
So, anyway, apparently that's what I said. Well, that's

1331
00:49:25,949 --> 00:49:30,070
the mindset of a skipper of a boat that eventually we're able to be

1332
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:33,969
successful. And a supreme optimist. A supreme optimist. Ask

1333
00:49:33,969 --> 00:49:36,230
Raza, my wife, you know, drives her nuts.

1334
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:41,869
I've met the beautiful Raza before many times. Is that just, you can't help

1335
00:49:41,869 --> 00:49:45,389
but pivot towards the glass half full in everything? Yeah, that's right.

1336
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:49,650
Yeah. And I think that's, you know, for goodness sake, if you've got, if you're going to pivot,

1337
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:53,909
let's go positive. Let's get serious. We're only here for three score and ten or whatever.

1338
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:57,570
That's a good life lesson there. You mentioned curiosity before.

1339
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,670
We see leaders are really,

1340
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:03,750
curiosity is a word that comes up a lot in leadership. And that's how a lot of leaders

1341
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:07,710
approach their constant desire to learn and improve.

1342
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:11,329
And that comes out in everything you say. Does curiosity resonate with you?

1343
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:15,409
Oh, no question. One thing I think that I am

1344
00:50:15,409 --> 00:50:19,269
proud of is I'm a student of life.

1345
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:23,809
I've always asked, I naturally love asking questions to find out more about

1346
00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:28,010
what people are doing, what things are happening. Apparently, you know, on the average

1347
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,889
when kids are growing up, you know,

1348
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:35,349
we've got a five-year-old granddaughter. And she said, Pop, so why is the sky blue?

1349
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:39,570
Okay. And look at those birds. Why can't we fly like those birds?

1350
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:43,610
Pretty beautiful questions, for goodness sake.

1351
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:47,510
You know, the curiosity. And, but when

1352
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:51,690
children get to about the age 14, they stop asking multiple

1353
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:55,849
questions. And most people flatten off in their curve

1354
00:50:55,849 --> 00:50:59,409
and become just part of the society.

1355
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:04,110
Where in a lot of cases, they buy a house and they sit there for the rest of their life

1356
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:07,829
in Australia or whatever, compared to the curiosity

1357
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:11,789
of leaders who are constantly learning. And I see

1358
00:51:11,789 --> 00:51:15,570
life and leadership as a lifelong journey. And I shouldn't say leadership because

1359
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:19,889
I'm just saying life. Yeah. Okay. It's a lifelong journey of learning.

1360
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,650
And, you know, Benny was, you know, Benny Lexon,

1361
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:27,369
he was curious. Give you an example.

1362
00:51:27,369 --> 00:51:28,469
Sitting down,

1363
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:33,489
sitting down on the beach at Manly up in Sydney when we

1364
00:51:33,489 --> 00:51:37,909
for the final America's Cup. And we're watching

1365
00:51:37,909 --> 00:51:41,809
birds, in this case seagulls, flock of seagulls landing and taking

1366
00:51:41,809 --> 00:51:45,090
off. A lot of wind, a lot of turbulence along the shore there.

1367
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:48,789
And here's this man with supposedly no education,

1368
00:51:49,789 --> 00:51:53,690
three years, went to school at nine and left at 12. So, you know, for God's sake.

1369
00:51:54,429 --> 00:51:57,670
And here I am with, you know, a double degree and MIT and all the stuff.

1370
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:00,050
And he's saying,

1371
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:03,789
he's saying, John, look at the way these birds land.

1372
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:11,309
There's, there's no crash landings. So we would have seen maybe the 20 or 30 seagulls

1373
00:52:11,309 --> 00:52:15,929
in a lot of wind. They land beautifully, beautifully every time. And he said,

1374
00:52:15,929 --> 00:52:20,349
look at the way they take off. Their takeoffs are perfect. So here I am looking

1375
00:52:20,349 --> 00:52:26,829
through Benny's eyes of this. And he says, their, their brains are smaller than a pea.

1376
00:52:26,829 --> 00:52:30,050
Our brains is this massive bloody thing, weighing about six kilograms.

1377
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:37,949
Hanging between our ears. Okay. And he said that, that their flight control systems,

1378
00:52:37,949 --> 00:52:42,949
first of all, there has to be a neuro nerve from every feather connecting to that tiny,

1379
00:52:42,949 --> 00:52:48,309
tiny little brain. That flight control system has to be more advanced than any military jet

1380
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:49,869
aircraft known to mankind.

1381
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:57,250
The way they land and take off every time, like every time, I just love watching birds now

1382
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,789
through Benny's eyes and I just, so he said,

1383
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:02,250
look at their feathers on the trailing edge of their wings.

1384
00:53:02,489 --> 00:53:03,610
They're feeling the vortices.

1385
00:53:03,809 --> 00:53:06,309
This is the bird coming into land in a lot of turbulence.

1386
00:53:06,989 --> 00:53:11,429
And he said they can just feel the air going across the low-pressure surface,

1387
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:13,309
which is the top surface of the wing.

1388
00:53:13,869 --> 00:53:16,409
And he said they can feel the turbulence just generating.

1389
00:53:16,409 --> 00:53:19,530
They trip the air and they drop to the surface,

1390
00:53:20,269 --> 00:53:23,090
drop to Earth perfectly every time.

1391
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:24,210
Okay?

1392
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:27,110
So you talk about curiosity.

1393
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,869
Here's this bloke with supposedly no education.

1394
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:33,489
But thinking way out there in terms of studying nature

1395
00:53:33,489 --> 00:53:37,010
and in awe of what a mingy little seagull can do

1396
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:40,630
compared to us humans who we think we're pretty good.

1397
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:45,269
And so there's no limitations for those types of people

1398
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:48,690
in terms of what's this game going to look like in 20 years' time.

1399
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:52,349
And I've got a refresher on curiosity for you.

1400
00:53:52,389 --> 00:53:55,050
When we first caught up, you know, I think you had me for 10 minutes

1401
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:57,449
and you're drilling in what's happening and what's happening in life

1402
00:53:57,449 --> 00:53:59,570
and what are you up to when you ask questions.

1403
00:53:59,789 --> 00:54:00,050
It's...

1404
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:02,409
That constant wanting to learn.

1405
00:54:02,429 --> 00:54:03,650
Well, I was fascinated with what you're doing.

1406
00:54:03,929 --> 00:54:06,329
You know, you're an interesting bloke and, you know, interesting character.

1407
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:10,269
And clearly the interest is off the charts with me.

1408
00:54:10,329 --> 00:54:12,869
But I love that about, you know, and you're in, you know,

1409
00:54:12,869 --> 00:54:16,670
people might not understand you won a world championship, you know, in 2016.

1410
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:21,489
You were telling me earlier, asking you, you're back, you know, sailing again.

1411
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:25,510
And it's, you know, people talk about lifelong learning.

1412
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:29,190
That just embodies everything that you're about, isn't it?

1413
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:29,590
Yeah.

1414
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:35,150
Well, on the team for, you know, we'll do the national championships in the Edshall class,

1415
00:54:35,329 --> 00:54:39,170
best racing in the country by far, second week of January in Adelaide.

1416
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:45,809
So on the boat, I've got, signing with me is Tom Burton, Olympic gold medalist in Rio,

1417
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:52,369
and Jake Lilly, current representative for the, in the Finn class, sailing in the Tokyo Olympics.

1418
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:55,630
I'll learn a lot from them, heaps and heaps.

1419
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:59,570
And hopefully they'll learn a little bit from me, but, you know, it'll be, it'll be an MBA,

1420
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:00,230
of sailing.

1421
00:55:00,389 --> 00:55:01,090
Isn't that brilliant?

1422
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:05,230
I love that about your sport, isn't it, John, that you can, you know, transcend generations,

1423
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:05,650
can't you?

1424
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:09,369
That you can, with this new current crop, and I know you're so connected to, you know,

1425
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:12,289
our sailing is world-class and you're so connected to the next generation.

1426
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,630
The fact they get to compete with you, I love it.

1427
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,110
It's an amazing part of your sport.

1428
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:18,849
Communicating with clarity is a dimension of leadership.

1429
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:23,650
We know all leaders consider really strongly, and you've mentioned it a few times.

1430
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:27,909
How did you go about your communicating in the areas that you've been in?

1431
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:37,929
I think I'm, naturally, I'm a natural teacher, and I, I, and I think I can condense, I complexed

1432
00:55:37,929 --> 00:55:44,309
ideas down into simple forms that can be communicated, and keep communicating that through my, this

1433
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:47,150
crazy thing called passion, okay, and commitment.

1434
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:57,309
So, you know, I, I naturally like, one of the things I think is really key, and is to

1435
00:55:57,309 --> 00:55:57,889
empower people.

1436
00:55:58,610 --> 00:55:58,909
Okay?

1437
00:55:59,030 --> 00:55:59,989
To empower people.

1438
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:03,190
So, you, I've used this thing called one plus one equals three before.

1439
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:10,809
The intellectual horsepower within a group of people can be enormous if you can, if you

1440
00:56:10,809 --> 00:56:11,610
can combine it.

1441
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:12,409
That's the point.

1442
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:18,250
And that's the untapped potential of organizations, or sailing teams, or swimming programs where

1443
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:22,070
they're coaches, and coaches, and the coaching fraternity, and relative to talking to each

1444
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:26,230
other, relative to their teaching, their working with their, you know, their athletes, and

1445
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:26,550
so on.

1446
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:27,869
So, there's whole issues.

1447
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:32,769
There's a whole issue of being able to communicate in a simple manner, such that ideas can get

1448
00:56:32,769 --> 00:56:39,750
across, and indeed, as I mentioned before, repeating those, hopefully no more than three

1449
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:44,050
times, such that people really walk away and think, aha, the light bulb goes on.

1450
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:46,650
So, that's all part and parcel of leadership.

1451
00:56:46,769 --> 00:56:47,389
There's no question.

1452
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:53,130
You can be full of ideas, but if you can't communicate it in a simple manner, then can

1453
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:56,989
be, can be communicated throughout the organization.

1454
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:57,869
That's the other thing.

1455
00:56:57,869 --> 00:57:02,769
Yeah, and I love, you've mentioned empowering leadership a lot.

1456
00:57:02,829 --> 00:57:07,130
That's the title of the podcast, Empowering Leaders, John, because we see that as being

1457
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:12,670
ultimately, you know, a big shift now, and you captured it, you know, in the early 80s

1458
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:18,030
around empowering others around you to fulfill their roles, and you can only achieve, you

1459
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:22,869
know, X amount doing it on your own and without empowering others in your environment.

1460
00:57:22,969 --> 00:57:24,550
We see that as being a real, a real skill.

1461
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:27,809
Likewise, collaboration, and we see leaders are now equally.

1462
00:57:27,869 --> 00:57:31,710
Really strategic about their collaboration, and you were, they've always been ahead of

1463
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:34,809
the curve, but your success was done with great collaboration.

1464
00:57:34,929 --> 00:57:36,170
How important was that to you?

1465
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:36,789
It's huge.

1466
00:57:38,409 --> 00:57:44,989
Ed Debono, he coined the lateral thinking, the phrase lateral thinking, and Ed, we became

1467
00:57:44,989 --> 00:57:45,510
good friends.

1468
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:48,789
He used the America's Cup as a case study with his teachings around the world.

1469
00:57:48,929 --> 00:57:51,750
Very interesting bloke, you know, lateral thinking, man.

1470
00:57:51,929 --> 00:57:56,050
I had his, his co-founder of the School of Thinking on this podcast, a guy called Michael

1471
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:57,849
Hewitt Gleeson, and they ran the School of Thinking.

1472
00:57:57,869 --> 00:58:01,969
They ran the School of Thinking together and fascinated by how they were able to implement

1473
00:58:01,969 --> 00:58:05,849
that in the school system in the Bay Area, and they, they, they really, the study believes

1474
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:11,090
that Silicon Valley's come out of really the alumni of the, of the Bay Area of San Francisco

1475
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:15,809
creating Silicon Valley on the back of Edward Debono and, and Michael's thinking as well.

1476
00:58:15,949 --> 00:58:17,329
So, sorry to interrupt, but yeah.

1477
00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:17,909
No, that's fine.

1478
00:58:17,969 --> 00:58:21,949
So, Ed Debono, he's basically says there's four streams of thinking.

1479
00:58:21,949 --> 00:58:27,710
There's the reading, there's writing, there's arithmetic, and thinking is the final.

1480
00:58:27,869 --> 00:58:28,309
Core.

1481
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:33,190
And he said most people, schools, systems, and whatever, don't really consider thinking,

1482
00:58:33,329 --> 00:58:36,730
but now we're talking about lateral thinking and going across from one idea to another

1483
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:38,750
to take it to the next level.

1484
00:58:38,829 --> 00:58:45,849
Like the Trans-Siberian Railway was developed, the major, major technical problems, massive,

1485
00:58:46,409 --> 00:58:47,650
were not thousands of people.

1486
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:52,949
It was maybe half a dozen people who really just work with each other, okay, and, you

1487
00:58:52,949 --> 00:58:54,909
know, with no limitations in many ways.

1488
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:56,650
He, he wrote a book.

1489
00:58:56,650 --> 00:59:00,110
One of the key books he wrote, which was very important for America's Cup Project.

1490
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:01,030
This is Edward Debono?

1491
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:07,130
Ed, Ed Debono was the six hats of thinking, okay, which became very important with our

1492
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:08,329
swimming program as well.

1493
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:16,349
And that is you primarily to, to do great things, you need, in my case, no more than

1494
00:59:16,349 --> 00:59:16,989
six people.

1495
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:22,070
Then it becomes too complex, but a team of six people, which are all different.

1496
00:59:22,889 --> 00:59:23,789
That's the key.

1497
00:59:23,889 --> 00:59:24,949
Not all the same.

1498
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:26,630
So that you don't have a whole team.

1499
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:27,610
You've got to have a whole bunch of yes people.

1500
00:59:28,409 --> 00:59:30,670
So there's the, and the, the colors come from, okay.

1501
00:59:30,829 --> 00:59:37,369
So the white hat is the chairman, chairperson, who empowers the thinking, empowers the people.

1502
00:59:37,829 --> 00:59:40,349
There's, let's say the green hat, who's the creative thinker.

1503
00:59:40,449 --> 00:59:41,389
He's the marketeer.

1504
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:43,230
Comes up with the crazy ideas.

1505
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:46,829
And then there's a black hat, who's the negative person.

1506
00:59:47,329 --> 00:59:51,530
You've got to say, now, hang on, Harry, that, you know, for this, this, and this reason,

1507
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:52,670
that doesn't make sense.

1508
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:54,269
And that's right.

1509
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:55,550
You've got to have the checks and balances.

1510
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,550
Then you've got to have the complete.

1511
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:59,489
Don't give me all the high-flying ideas.

1512
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:01,789
Just give me the project and I'll get the bloody thing done.

1513
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:02,789
Okay.

1514
01:00:03,409 --> 01:00:08,510
So it's sort of a, you know, it's a very, it's a beautiful way of thinking about teams,

1515
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:09,670
high-performance teams.

1516
01:00:10,349 --> 01:00:12,050
They're up to, say, six people.

1517
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:17,610
And if you get to 10 or whatever, then, you know, it's too complex.

1518
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:25,489
So this whole empowering of people and, and being comfortable with different people,

1519
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:29,969
adding value to the mix, the six hats of thinking.

1520
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:35,469
So, gee, when we were putting the team together for the America's Cup, and indeed, my thinking

1521
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:40,150
with Swimming Australia is, is that you've got all these coaches, dedicated people, but

1522
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:40,809
they're all different.

1523
01:00:41,489 --> 01:00:42,789
And don't worry about it.

1524
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:45,210
That's how do we leverage off each other?

1525
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:46,630
And how do we accept each other?

1526
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:50,469
And how do we get on with it so that we can create something that's very special?

1527
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:52,590
It's a brilliant story, John.

1528
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:55,309
And it links right into that passion I was talking to you about.

1529
01:00:55,309 --> 01:00:59,769
A leader is the, the business and a leader connect is groups of six people, five or six

1530
01:00:59,769 --> 01:01:00,150
people.

1531
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:04,349
And, you know, the diversity of thinking we see is the superpower to have exactly as

1532
01:01:04,349 --> 01:01:07,090
you described, that you don't know what you don't know, do you?

1533
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:09,889
And if you're, you, you, often we operate the same sphere.

1534
01:01:09,889 --> 01:01:13,750
And when people come from outside, we're the opportunity to, to, to grow.

1535
01:01:13,829 --> 01:01:17,849
And you're right, leadership sometimes almost the wrong word, I feel, because it seems to

1536
01:01:17,849 --> 01:01:18,550
exclude people.

1537
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:21,610
We see everyone as being, you're a leader in your own family.

1538
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:24,110
You can, you don't have to have a title to be a leader.

1539
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:25,190
In fact, the opposite of that.

1540
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:29,949
You can, uh, lead from whatever position in an organization or, or even in your own

1541
01:01:29,949 --> 01:01:30,429
family.

1542
01:01:30,429 --> 01:01:32,690
So I appreciate you, you sharing that.

1543
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:35,309
What, can I ask you, what was the Bono like if you had some time with him?

1544
01:01:35,309 --> 01:01:44,030
Oh, yeah, crazy, absolutely crazy, uh, and brilliant, absolutely brilliant, you know?

1545
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:48,650
And, uh, so each time he came to Australia, we'd invariably, we'd, there, Rouse and I,

1546
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:54,949
and, uh, he, he would have a dinner, you know, these long dinners and we'd, we'd, we'd,

1547
01:01:54,949 --> 01:01:56,110
we'd discuss the world.

1548
01:01:57,449 --> 01:01:58,849
Yeah, we'd discuss the world.

1549
01:01:58,969 --> 01:02:03,789
So the, I just, uh, when you're talking about at least, uh, you know, in terms of the teams,

1550
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:08,809
uh, Jeff Harris, who's co-founder of our Flight Centre, okay?

1551
01:02:09,269 --> 01:02:11,969
I had the great pleasure of doing a podcast with Jeff recently.

1552
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:13,869
What a, what an incredible thinker Jeff is.

1553
01:02:13,889 --> 01:02:14,389
Oh, yes, that's right.

1554
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:14,750
Amazing.

1555
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:19,610
So we were talking about, uh, teams quite a few years ago and he, he would have told

1556
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:24,050
you, would have told the audience now, I'm sure, about the early days of Flight Centre

1557
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:24,750
where they...

1558
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,889
Got four or five or six people together.

1559
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:31,809
And really studied around why, you know, tribes and organisation work.

1560
01:02:31,829 --> 01:02:32,090
Exactly.

1561
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:35,789
And through trial and error and that, that, that sort of six to eight people was about

1562
01:02:35,789 --> 01:02:37,409
the max they felt and they built, yeah.

1563
01:02:37,409 --> 01:02:42,210
Well, what happens, they, based on early success, they went to 10 or 12 or 14.

1564
01:02:42,349 --> 01:02:44,769
They thought, this is cool, we just increase the size of the offices.

1565
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:46,250
But they, it didn't work.

1566
01:02:46,349 --> 01:02:46,530
Yeah.

1567
01:02:46,969 --> 01:02:51,369
They got to that level of, you know, six or eight max and that was it.

1568
01:02:51,429 --> 01:02:54,730
So that's these, you know, the tribes, that's what we're talking about.

1569
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:54,949
Yeah.

1570
01:02:54,949 --> 01:02:55,190
Yeah.

1571
01:02:55,469 --> 01:02:56,489
Families and tribes.

1572
01:02:57,050 --> 01:03:01,730
And, uh, so De Bono, he sort of, that was his early thinking in many ways.

1573
01:03:02,369 --> 01:03:03,090
Ed De Bono.

1574
01:03:03,849 --> 01:03:08,469
I love that you've got an engineering mindset and engineering brain, but some of the people

1575
01:03:08,469 --> 01:03:11,730
you put closest to you were Ben Lexen and Edward De Bono.

1576
01:03:11,969 --> 01:03:12,650
I love these people.

1577
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:13,010
Yeah.

1578
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:14,090
So a lovely story.

1579
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:14,389
Okay.

1580
01:03:14,489 --> 01:03:19,969
So one of the deals is that Ed De Bono was brought in to consult, uh, in New York City,

1581
01:03:19,969 --> 01:03:24,610
a building which they couldn't really, couldn't rationalise putting faster lifts in.

1582
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:25,269
It was too expensive.

1583
01:03:25,429 --> 01:03:26,489
It was a residential property.

1584
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:32,170
And, uh, but the lifts were too slow and they were losing income because people didn't like

1585
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:37,030
waiting for a long, long time to get up to their 65th floor or whatever in New York City,

1586
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:37,449
downtown.

1587
01:03:37,889 --> 01:03:41,090
So he's brought in to help, to find a solution.

1588
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:46,309
So he looked at the whole thing and it was clearly too expensive to, you know, go the

1589
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:46,949
conventional route.

1590
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:51,090
So he suggested installing mirrors, full length mirrors in the foyer.

1591
01:03:52,289 --> 01:03:52,730
Okay.

1592
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:53,190
Why?

1593
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:53,250
Why?

1594
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:54,590
People like looking at each other.

1595
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:59,130
And if they like looking at each other, then the time goes much faster.

1596
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:03,889
And some people like looking at themselves as well too.

1597
01:04:04,429 --> 01:04:04,829
Yeah.

1598
01:04:04,829 --> 01:04:05,809
That's, uh, yeah, lateral thinking.

1599
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:06,630
You know, that's right.

1600
01:04:06,869 --> 01:04:07,590
So, okay.

1601
01:04:08,309 --> 01:04:09,329
So that's Ben Lexen.

1602
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:11,030
That's out there.

1603
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:16,030
You know, the breakthrough ideas aren't necessarily coming from a mathematical equation coming

1604
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:16,590
out of MIT.

1605
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:18,530
It's, uh, it's pure genius.

1606
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:23,030
Uh, and the genius to me is people putting people around them like you that compliment

1607
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:24,110
your skill set, isn't it?

1608
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:24,130
Yes.

1609
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:24,190
Yeah.

1610
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:24,210
Yeah.

1611
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:24,269
Yeah.

1612
01:04:24,269 --> 01:04:24,289
Yeah.

1613
01:04:24,289 --> 01:04:24,309
Yeah.

1614
01:04:24,309 --> 01:04:24,329
Yeah.

1615
01:04:24,329 --> 01:04:24,349
Yeah.

1616
01:04:24,349 --> 01:04:24,369
Yeah.

1617
01:04:24,369 --> 01:04:24,550
Yeah.

1618
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:25,469
That's smart, isn't it?

1619
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,789
You know, your engineering brain.

1620
01:04:27,789 --> 01:04:29,329
All I know is I don't know.

1621
01:04:30,269 --> 01:04:31,230
It's true.

1622
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:37,389
If you go in with that type of mindset, you know, and saying, okay, well, again, you know,

1623
01:04:37,429 --> 01:04:40,489
this environment in 20 years' time would be so different.

1624
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:40,789
Yeah.

1625
01:04:41,929 --> 01:04:45,809
How do we get there faster than any other people in the world?

1626
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:49,309
That's the exciting part of human endeavor, in my opinion.

1627
01:04:49,789 --> 01:04:51,590
I love listening to it, John.

1628
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:57,170
It's always inspiring to hear your thoughts on how to get there and what you've done in the past.

1629
01:04:57,170 --> 01:05:02,570
I've been asking these two questions, John, to all the leaders that I've had the privilege of sitting down with.

1630
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:04,510
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1631
01:05:04,889 --> 01:05:05,090
Gee.

1632
01:05:09,579 --> 01:05:17,800
Well, first of all, in terms of our family, my wife, Raza, I've been married for 53 years.

1633
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:21,139
Her leadership of the family blows me away.

1634
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:22,940
Unbelievable.

1635
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:26,159
In terms of her natural instinct of what's going on.

1636
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:34,639
You know, we've got kids in London, grandkids in London, Ibiza in Spain, in Melbourne, seven grandkids, and all the stuff going on.

1637
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:40,820
And so that little family unit and just, you know, the extension of her natural empathy for people around her and whatever.

1638
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:44,139
So that's leadership in its pure, beautiful form.

1639
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:44,400
Yeah.

1640
01:05:44,539 --> 01:05:49,400
If we talk about high level, you know, someone like the Bob Hawks of the world,

1641
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:53,139
and spent.

1642
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:58,900
You know, spent a lot of time, you know, with Bob, his natural instinct.

1643
01:06:01,059 --> 01:06:02,519
Yeah, those types of people.

1644
01:06:02,739 --> 01:06:10,539
You know, we spent, I spent time with Ted Kennedy in America, Jackie Onassis or Jackie Kennedy in the early days.

1645
01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:12,559
Small amounts of time.

1646
01:06:12,659 --> 01:06:17,539
But, you know, again, people at this sort of level, really intriguing.

1647
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:22,719
And, you know, through Ted.

1648
01:06:23,159 --> 01:06:39,659
During the John F. Kennedy era, the Cuban Missile Crisis, staying with Ted in his home in Washington and looking at some of the sketchings that JFK had done during the key crisis meetings and the notes and so on.

1649
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:45,679
And learning about, you know, intriguing about human history being put together.

1650
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,099
Those things fascinate me a lot, I must say.

1651
01:06:50,099 --> 01:06:50,380
Yeah.

1652
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:53,139
But, you know, again.

1653
01:06:53,159 --> 01:06:55,400
The Bob Hawke thing was quite remarkable.

1654
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:57,820
Spent some, quite a lot of time with John Howard.

1655
01:06:58,539 --> 01:06:59,260
Fascinating man.

1656
01:06:59,719 --> 01:06:59,840
You know.

1657
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,019
Each of these, all of these, very, very strong values.

1658
01:07:03,639 --> 01:07:05,019
You know, authentic, absolutely.

1659
01:07:05,559 --> 01:07:06,699
What you see is what you get.

1660
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:08,139
Yeah, I love you.

1661
01:07:08,179 --> 01:07:17,860
You started at home and then, you know, it's been an incredible life that you've lived and, you know, clearly your respect on the home front to be married for 53 years.

1662
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,920
Something special is happening there, John, which is not surprising.

1663
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:22,559
You went there first.

1664
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:23,460
But I loved it.

1665
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:24,719
Hey, it surprises me.

1666
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:29,179
I was 19 years yesterday, actually.

1667
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:33,820
So I'm, you know, fair way to go to get to 53, John.

1668
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:42,039
But I say this a fair bit because, and I need to sit down and interview my wife because she's exactly the same superstar.

1669
01:07:42,199 --> 01:07:47,079
Sounds very much like her in terms of her empathy and what she does for our family unit off the charts.

1670
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:48,159
But I'm always surprised, John.

1671
01:07:48,739 --> 01:07:52,059
You've got such a, you know, incredible brain for how to succeed.

1672
01:07:52,179 --> 01:07:52,219
Yeah.

1673
01:07:52,219 --> 01:07:52,260
Yeah.

1674
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:52,280
Yeah.

1675
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:52,539
Yeah.

1676
01:07:52,539 --> 01:07:52,559
Yeah.

1677
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:54,099
And I think people apply that to their own home front.

1678
01:07:54,199 --> 01:08:02,619
I find fascinating because, you know, if that breaks down, your life is on every measure going to be, you know, immensely worse, isn't it?

1679
01:08:02,699 --> 01:08:04,739
So it's interesting, isn't it?

1680
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:05,119
Yeah.

1681
01:08:05,219 --> 01:08:07,420
And I'm not proud of my early days as a father.

1682
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:15,059
You know, I was off everywhere doing this crazy chasing the dream of whether Olympics or America's Cups to the exclusion of family life.

1683
01:08:15,079 --> 01:08:16,560
Do you look back with some regret for that, John?

1684
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:16,920
Oh, God, yeah.

1685
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:17,319
Absolutely.

1686
01:08:17,619 --> 01:08:18,500
Oh, no question.

1687
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:22,500
You know, looking back, you know, four days after our first marriage.

1688
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:33,359
I was born, Lucas, you know, I went to Europe for three months because we're in the business of developing our own new sailcloth to win the America's Cup, you know, all of the stuff.

1689
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:34,819
You look back and you think, my God, yeah.

1690
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:38,739
So, but anyway, we were able to get through all of that.

1691
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:44,420
And so we've had plenty of, you know, plenty of issues.

1692
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,300
You know, Raza only left me three times.

1693
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:49,439
But each time she left me with a kid.

1694
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:50,880
So I was bucked.

1695
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,859
And we came back pretty fast.

1696
01:08:55,159 --> 01:08:57,340
But God bless her.

1697
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:04,520
So she's seen more stuff than most girls who'd ever seen in a lifetime and traveling the world and on the smell of an oil rag following her crazy dreams.

1698
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,359
But, you know, I have just so much respect for her.

1699
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,300
And now as a grandmother, what she achieves, yeah.

1700
01:09:12,739 --> 01:09:13,380
And that's human.

1701
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:15,260
That's people, isn't it?

1702
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:15,899
And it's family.

1703
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:19,460
And it's, hey, how important is family?

1704
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:19,779
Yeah.

1705
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:20,239
Yeah.

1706
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:22,279
I love hearing you talk about that.

1707
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:25,539
We are obsessed with collaboration, John.

1708
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:30,560
And we see that that's where, you know, so much of the shift is and how we collaborate to do things better.

1709
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:32,279
I ask you this question, John.

1710
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:37,939
If you could collaborate with anyone in the world on anything, there's so many passions in your life.

1711
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:43,779
Is there someone in your mind that you think of that you would like to pursue in terms of collaboration?

1712
01:09:44,579 --> 01:09:44,859
Gee.

1713
01:09:44,859 --> 01:09:57,920
Well, I've got to, you know, depending on the areas of activity, you know, some really, really interesting characters like Rod Eddington, Sir Rod.

1714
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,699
You know, we go around the town with him occasionally when he's in Australia.

1715
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:11,520
And people like John Wiley, you know, massive, amazing intellect in terms of understanding what's going on in the financial world, for example.

1716
01:10:13,779 --> 01:10:14,739
Over in the...

1717
01:10:14,739 --> 01:10:14,779
Yeah.

1718
01:10:14,779 --> 01:10:14,840
Yeah.

1719
01:10:14,859 --> 01:10:19,399
Over in Europe, Ben Ainslie, who's the head of the British America's Cup Challenge, Sir Ben now.

1720
01:10:21,779 --> 01:10:23,100
You know, we're very good friends.

1721
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:26,739
You know, we've raced with each other in the Etchells and so on.

1722
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:32,779
You know, I love hanging out with really, you know, advanced people.

1723
01:10:34,279 --> 01:10:44,359
So, and I have the, you know what, I have the privilege also to hang out with some really interesting cats as well, you know.

1724
01:10:44,359 --> 01:10:44,739
Yeah.

1725
01:10:44,739 --> 01:10:46,319
I'm very fortunate in that regard.

1726
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:54,159
So, it's, gee, there's so, there's people who just, there's so many different angles of life, isn't there, that you, you know.

1727
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:56,520
I love that your mind's going off in so many directions, John.

1728
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:01,180
And I know that you have a huge amount of influence over so many people as well and what you give back.

1729
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:13,180
And you're so generous with your time to people across all the passions of your life from the Collingwood Football Club to, I mentioned the Alana and Madeline Foundation and all of your work in everything is profound.

1730
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:14,180
And it's...

1731
01:11:14,739 --> 01:11:15,739
It's been great fun, John.

1732
01:11:15,739 --> 01:11:19,100
I've learned a lot, again, sitting along from you today.

1733
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:19,819
So, thanks so much.

1734
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,560
I appreciate you joining me.

1735
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,920
Let me just, a little correction.

1736
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:27,420
The Alana and Madeline Foundation, I retired several years ago, but I was there, I was chair for 15 years with that.

1737
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:33,340
And we've helped, as it turns out, millions of kids in terms of cyberbullying issues around that.

1738
01:11:33,619 --> 01:11:33,960
So...

1739
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,619
And people who don't, the background of that is incredible, isn't it?

1740
01:11:37,619 --> 01:11:37,760
Yeah.

1741
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,260
It's one of the most tragic stories in Australian history.

1742
01:11:40,699 --> 01:11:44,659
And on the back of that, to have such a profound influence on young people.

1743
01:11:44,659 --> 01:11:44,680
Yeah.

1744
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:44,720
Yeah.

1745
01:11:44,739 --> 01:11:46,199
That must feel you enjoyed.

1746
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:46,800
Oh, yeah.

1747
01:11:46,899 --> 01:11:47,100
Yeah.

1748
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:47,979
Very, yeah.

1749
01:11:48,199 --> 01:11:49,060
Very fulfilling.

1750
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,220
You can make a small difference to a lot of people's lives.

1751
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:52,800
That's right.

1752
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,340
A bit bigger than a small difference, John.

1753
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:56,060
Everything you do makes a massive difference.

1754
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:57,680
And once again, thanks for your time.

1755
01:11:57,819 --> 01:11:58,260
My pleasure.
