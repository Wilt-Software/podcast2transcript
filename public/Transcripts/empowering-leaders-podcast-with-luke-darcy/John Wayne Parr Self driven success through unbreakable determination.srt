1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,679
There was a hashtag on Twitter.

2
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:08,599
Get John Wayne on Joe Rogan.

3
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:10,720
Then one day he replied, I'd love to get John Wayne on.

4
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:11,380
I'm a big fan.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,939
So I shot him a DM.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,199
Hey, my name's John Wayne.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,399
He goes, yeah, for sure.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,160
I'd love to have you on.

9
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,140
Let's pick a date.

10
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:18,820
So we picked a date.

11
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,300
Got my bag, jumped in a taxi, went straight to the studio.

12
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,859
Eddie Bravo, Brian Kellan, Brendan Shaw, Joe Rogan all sitting there talking about the fires.

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,359
It's like, whoa.

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,019
And Joe's like, oh, since we don't really know each other,

15
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:30,780
well, do you want to come to my house tomorrow morning?

16
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:31,559
And we'll do a session.

17
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,100
Then we'll have something to talk about on the podcast.

18
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,039
I'm like, whoa, yes.

19
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:36,759
So he goes to me in a dress.

20
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:38,079
We go back up to his house.

21
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,960
Yeah, it's just amazing.

22
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,780
And then what you see on TV is the same Joe you see in real life, too.

23
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,719
He's so nice and so humble, so funny.

24
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:46,420
He's the man.

25
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:47,159
He's so cool.

26
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,640
Hello and welcome to another episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,140
At Alita, we are passionate about inspiring connections and creating a world of collaboration.

28
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,979
Our signature program, Alita Connect, curates groups of five to six leaders

29
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:03,079
from diverse backgrounds in sport, industry, and business.

30
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,719
Social venture and the arts who come together to learn, to connect, and to collaborate.

31
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,659
Dr. Troy Flanagan, Vice President of Performance for the Milwaukee Bucks.

32
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,680
I've probably had some of the most radical changes out of that leadership group.

33
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:21,879
The significance of their work and how much it's really about helping others,

34
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,260
it made me think, what else could I be doing?

35
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,579
And I approached our owner, and within a few weeks,

36
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:33,040
we've raised $5 million to try and solve obesity in the underprivileged,

37
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:34,400
community in Milwaukee.

38
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,879
So that's one spark that that leadership course has caused to contribute

39
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:42,000
and leave the world as a better place.

40
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,280
Umrah Omer, founder of Safari Doctors.

41
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,379
It defines the word creativity for me.

42
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,040
The ability to see connections where none seem to exist.

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,359
And I think that's the magic of Alita.

44
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:02,239
Definitely not my usual workshop panels like humanitarian spaces,

45
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:02,959
but.

46
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,760
But more of an intentional, um, um,

47
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:07,900
dissection of leadership.

48
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,379
The Empowering Leaders podcast is proudly brought to you by Victoria University,

51
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,199
VU, uniquely you.

52
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,520
As always, a big thank you to Jason Nicholas and his team at Temper Bedding,

53
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,159
a mattress like no other.

54
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:31,280
Thank you.

55
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,300
Thank you.

56
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,319
Thank you.

57
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:31,340
Thank you.

58
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:31,360
Thank you.

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,419
Thank you.

60
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:31,439
Thank you.

61
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:31,460
Thank you.

62
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:31,479
Thank you.

63
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:31,500
Thank you.

64
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:31,520
Thank you.

65
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:31,539
Thank you.

66
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:31,560
Thank you.

67
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:31,620
Thank you.

68
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:31,639
Thank you.

69
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:31,659
Thank you.

70
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:31,719
Thank you.

71
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:31,740
Thank you.

72
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:31,819
Thank you.

73
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:31,860
Thank you.

74
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:31,919
Thank you.

75
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,939
Thank you.

76
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,060
Thank you.

77
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,460
Thank you.

78
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:34,740
Thank you.

79
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,099
Thank you.

80
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:35,180
Thank you.

81
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,199
Thank you.

82
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:35,560
Thank you.

83
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:35,580
Thank you.

84
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:35,620
Thank you.

85
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:35,659
Thank you.

86
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:39,900
And please, if you have a moment, we would love you to leave a review so we can reach

87
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,919
more listeners and empower more leaders.

88
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,340
John Wayne Parr is one of the world's most revered combat sport athletes, a 10-time world

89
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,979
champion and a legend of the world of Muay Thai and kickboxing.

90
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,960
Wayne's story is told brilliantly in his new book, The Fighter, The Legendary Life of an

91
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,780
Australian Champion, written by Jared Boyle.

92
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:01,400
Influential UFC commentator and podcast pioneer, Joe Rogan.

93
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,719
He's a huge fan of John Wayne Parr's

94
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,099
and describes him as one of the baddest dudes ever.

95
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,139
His skill level, his toughness,

96
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:10,460
his dedication to the sport are unparalleled.

97
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,300
He is an icon.

98
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:14,379
John Wayne Parr moved constantly around Australia as a kid.

99
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,120
His parents were racehorse trainers

100
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,439
and they were forced to regularly move towns

101
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,759
in search of work.

102
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,620
And the story of a young Australian boy

103
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,039
living in the brutal martial arts training camps in Thailand,

104
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,159
going on to arguably be the most revered Westerner ever

105
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,479
in the ancient sport of Mai Tai

106
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,000
is nothing short of remarkable.

107
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,340
Wayne, it's great to meet you.

108
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,879
It's an extraordinary life that you have lived

109
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,060
and it's captured brilliantly in the book

110
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,539
that's just been released about your life

111
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:41,620
called The Fighter.

112
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:45,340
The story of a legendary Australian champion

113
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,400
written by Jarrod Boyle.

114
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,360
Can you tell me, how does the boy that grew up

115
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,300
in the Gold Coast and moved house regularly

116
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,259
turn out to be a 10-time world champion?

117
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,800
How did it happen?

118
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:57,659
So my parents were horse trainers

119
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,280
and we moved a lot as kids.

120
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,379
So I was very isolated.

121
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,419
We lived on big property.

122
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,620
So I wasn't just an only child,

123
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,060
but the fact that our house would be here

124
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,120
and then our neighbor would be like 4Ks

125
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,780
on top of a hill,

126
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,479
like it was so, so bad.

127
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,439
And then my parents worked crazy hours

128
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,060
where they'd have to wake up at 3.30,

129
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,240
be at the track by 4.

130
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,399
So I'd wake up by myself.

131
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,139
There'd be $2 on the table,

132
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,379
I'd get my $2 and then I'd go to my tuck shop

133
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:25,540
and I'd come home and they'd be at work again

134
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,680
because the afternoon session starts from say 3 to say 6.30.

135
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
So by the time they get home,

136
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,319
so I spend a lot of time by myself.

137
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:34,699
And I was infatuated by martial arts movies.

138
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,480
All I wanted to do was be a martial artist.

139
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:37,339
I seen the kind of kid.

140
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,519
He's the kid that moves around.

141
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,160
He's the new kid.

142
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,180
I can understand exactly what he's going through.

143
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,540
So maybe if I find martial arts,

144
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,120
that'll help fill in a hole.

145
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:48,279
And then the moment I started martial arts

146
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:48,959
at the age of 11,

147
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,339
I haven't stopped since.

148
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,100
I'm 48.

149
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:53,220
And the only regret is that

150
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,759
we didn't start at five instead of 11.

151
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,720
Wayne, you ended up in the brutal training camps

152
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,259
of Thailand in the ancient sport of Mai Tai.

153
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,939
You're a legend in that part of the world

154
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:04,839
and accomplished things

155
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,480
that almost no other Westerner has been able to achieve.

156
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,660
Tell us about the path to living

157
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,680
in the most basic accommodation

158
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,560
and the brutal training regime you went through.

159
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,800
I'm very lucky to have a Thai sponsor named Richard.

160
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,540
He took me under his wing

161
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,680
at the age of approximately 17.

162
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,540
I fought my first Thai.

163
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,480
He seen my potential.

164
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,839
I got knocked out in 30 seconds.

165
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:26,040
But the fact that I fought a Thai,

166
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:27,560
he said, oh, you showed a big heart.

167
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,379
It's very important in Thailand,

168
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,339
the heart's everything.

169
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,379
So even the fact that I fought a Thai,

170
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:31,860
the fact that I lost,

171
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:32,980
but the fact that I fought him

172
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,040
was an accomplishment.

173
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,600
And then I lived approximately

174
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,480
a 10-minute walk away.

175
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,319
So during the day,

176
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,079
I'd sit in the kitchen.

177
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:43,040
And then as he's preparing the chicken skewers

178
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,779
and getting them ready,

179
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,759
I just listened to this mystical place

180
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,560
of this place of that,

181
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,500
that their national sport is Thai boxing.

182
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,899
And it's their heritage.

183
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,480
And it's there.

184
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,420
They're so proud.

185
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,399
And people spend their lives

186
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,399
from the eight years old

187
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,000
living in this camp.

188
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,139
It just sounded so amazing.

189
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,279
It sounded just exactly what I wanted.

190
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,360
And then I got the opportunity

191
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,379
at the age of 19

192
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:05,040
to move over there.

193
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,639
Originally just for six months.

194
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,259
Ended up having five fights,

195
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:08,800
five wins.

196
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,259
And then I came back to Australia.

197
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,779
A few months later,

198
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:12,759
the camp rang and said,

199
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,639
can you please send me back?

200
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,000
We believe there's a big future in the sport.

201
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,459
So Richard had a courtesy

202
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:18,279
to send me back.

203
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,300
But he said, instead of six months,

204
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,779
I'll just send you back for 12 months

205
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,800
so you make sure you get the techniques down perfect.

206
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,259
So I went for another 12 months,

207
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,180
had nine fights that year.

208
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,480
I won, I think, seven.

209
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,660
I'm pretty sure seven.

210
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:29,920
I fought in the stadiums

211
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,620
and the big things,

212
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,379
but that's 100,000 people.

213
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:32,220
for the first time.

214
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:33,680
And I just kept snowballing

215
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,879
and snowballing and snowballing.

216
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,100
And then once I started

217
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,959
making a name in Thailand,

218
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,560
and then the rest of the world

219
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,899
wanted getting offers

220
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:41,620
from every country,

221
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,560
Holland, France.

222
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:44,079
I've even fought in Jamaica.

223
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,060
I fought in Jamaica once.

224
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,040
That's pretty cool.

225
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,019
Jamaica, China, you name it,

226
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:48,720
I've fought there.

227
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,220
So I think I worked out,

228
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,439
I've had 149 fights

229
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,360
and approximately 85 of those fights

230
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,040
have been international

231
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,639
because I lived overseas for so long.

232
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,639
So yeah, I've had more fights overseas

233
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,100
than back home.

234
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:00,740
You fought some of

235
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,360
the most important

236
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,420
and the most dangerous people

237
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,639
you could possibly imagine.

238
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,959
And reading the book,

239
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,839
which I loved,

240
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:06,740
and I encourage people

241
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,800
to read your story.

242
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,240
It's an amazing story

243
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,000
of courage and resilience.

244
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,759
But the names are incredible.

245
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:15,120
Arono, the black Superman,

246
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:16,699
Break Hell with Punch,

247
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,000
the Deadly Kisser was a mentor,

248
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,199
the Thai called you

249
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,500
the dangerous kangaroo.

250
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:22,779
I'm fascinated.

251
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,600
So the Deadly Kisser,

252
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,399
Sengten Noi's fight name,

253
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,199
broken down,

254
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:26,920
his name means

255
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,180
the small candlelight flame.

256
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,740
So he used to put a candle

257
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,259
on his shorts

258
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:31,360
and then the name was

259
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:31,980
and the Deadly Kisser

260
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,620
was another name

261
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,639
that was preceded by him

262
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,139
after he showed the people

263
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:37,240
that are gambling in the crowd

264
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,339
that he gave his kisser

265
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:39,379
and then around two,

266
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,860
he believed that it was his fight

267
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,759
so they'd all bet on him.

268
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,240
So that was his way

269
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,600
of signaling,

270
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,199
I've got this.

271
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:44,980
And then,

272
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,879
yeah, and that sort of stuck.

273
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,839
But the Sengten Noi

274
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,259
actually means

275
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,439
the small candlelight flame.

276
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,560
And you're talking about

277
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,339
stepping into the ring

278
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,420
where you're fighting warriors

279
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,579
of the highest order.

280
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,500
How do you deal with fear?

281
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,240
For those of us

282
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,319
that have never done that,

283
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,800
what's your secret

284
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,360
to being able to fight?

285
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,300
Clearly,

286
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:04,199
you have some level of fear.

287
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:04,959
How did you deal with it?

288
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,240
So my thing is

289
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,879
I want to be best.

290
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,740
I want to be regarded

291
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,300
as a champion.

292
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:11,300
And the only way

293
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,240
to prove to be I'm a champion

294
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,100
is to cross the ropes.

295
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,339
So no matter

296
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:15,259
how scary they are,

297
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:15,759
I can say,

298
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,680
yeah, I can do this,

299
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,139
I can do that.

300
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,139
Here'd be nothing.

301
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,600
Unless I cross those ropes,

302
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:21,519
nothing matters.

303
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,860
So it's very important.

304
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,199
That's the hardest part.

305
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:25,860
Once you're in,

306
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,180
all the fear goes away

307
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:27,920
because you're already there.

308
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,199
It's just that block.

309
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,100
And then,

310
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,279
also the passion.

311
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,200
I told myself early,

312
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,399
I'm there for a reason.

313
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,080
I'm there to be successful.

314
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,820
I'm there to be great.

315
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,620
The only way to take

316
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,179
that next step

317
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,159
is to get in there

318
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,139
and the facial fears.

319
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,100
And then,

320
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:46,720
and then money.

321
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,200
So let's say,

322
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,340
I've had times

323
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,779
where I made $35,000

324
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:51,960
and then I was

325
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,620
rematching a gentleman.

326
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,799
He cut me four different times

327
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,759
in two different fights.

328
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,740
And then as I'm walking

329
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,159
to the ring,

330
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:57,679
I'm like,

331
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,000
oh man,

332
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
this is going to hurt so bad.

333
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,580
But listen,

334
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:00,379
I got $35,000.

335
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,259
So it's okay.

336
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:01,860
Wayne,

337
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,759
an incredible life

338
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,320
on so many levels.

339
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,919
I look at a great warrior

340
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,039
going on the ring

341
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,840
and when you win,

342
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,440
you celebrate as you should,

343
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,200
but the defeats are brutal.

344
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,600
And when you see a fighter

345
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,320
exit the ring having lost,

346
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,340
that looks as painful a loss

347
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,220
as you could imagine.

348
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,320
How did you deal with those?

349
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,480
Because every fighter,

350
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,820
almost every fighter

351
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,120
has to deal with defeat.

352
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,919
How did you handle that?

353
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,600
Oh, it's terrible.

354
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,360
I won my first live fight,

355
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,120
St. Thylian Street.

356
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,440
So I was very fortunate.

357
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,379
The ranking's really fast.

358
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,740
I got to number four

359
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,539
at Lumpini Stadium

360
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:38,460
in the rankings

361
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,740
and I was one fight away from,

362
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,299
actually the promoter

363
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:42,240
came into my changing room

364
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,919
and he said,

365
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:43,620
if you win today,

366
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,259
your next fight will be

367
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:45,960
for the Lumpini title.

368
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:49,059
And then I was so excited

369
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:50,279
and then I ended up

370
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,700
getting cut 21 stitches

371
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,700
and the fight ended up

372
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,340
stopping round three

373
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,419
from too much blood

374
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:55,840
and excess

375
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,899
and the whole business.

376
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:57,779
And then,

377
00:09:58,419 --> 00:09:58,620
yeah,

378
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,240
for the next week,

379
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,000
I just hid in the room

380
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,039
because I was so embarrassed.

381
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,720
Even though the guy was a legend

382
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,820
and the inclusion to him

383
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,820
is no big,

384
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,179
it's just the fact that I fought him,

385
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,379
but in my head,

386
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:07,919
I've lost.

387
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:08,899
And I was on TV,

388
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:09,659
through Thai TV

389
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:11,220
and every media outlets

390
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:11,720
and then,

391
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,039
oh,

392
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:13,320
Thylian's finally got their

393
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,960
their honor back

394
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,840
after the Australian

395
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,220
had won in the first nine fights

396
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,559
and everything.

397
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,980
And then I front page

398
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,059
of the magazine the next day

399
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:21,539
showing the suit.

400
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,159
But during the fights,

401
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,500
I knew I made my mistakes

402
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,960
and just having the pain of a loss,

403
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,379
you don't want to have that feeling again.

404
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,240
And then as soon as you come back

405
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,879
and you have another win,

406
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,340
all of a sudden,

407
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,080
you feel that rush

408
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,419
and that's the reason you're there

409
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:35,159
to get that endorphin drop.

410
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,860
Have you ever seen the movie Highlander

411
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,379
when the lightning comes down from the sky?

412
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,279
That's what I feel like

413
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,220
is when you're wounded by KO.

414
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:42,639
And then you can't sleep

415
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,940
for three, four, five days.

416
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:45,779
Yeah,

417
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,820
your skin's always,

418
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,100
you're just so happy.

419
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,080
Wayne,

420
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,639
the UFC's become

421
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,240
the fastest growing sport in the world

422
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,919
by almost every measure.

423
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,379
And,

424
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,539
you know,

425
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,480
it's a brutal world.

426
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,000
It's a world that you know really well.

427
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:58,320
I mean,

428
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,919
is it something that you admire?

429
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,379
Do you think

430
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:01,340
if you were born in the UFC,

431
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,440
born a generation earlier,

432
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,759
that would have been your path

433
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:04,379
into the UFC?

434
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:05,360
Oh, definitely.

435
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,960
The fact that these guys

436
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,379
are making hundreds of thousands of dollars

437
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:08,940
per fight,

438
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,759
getting pay-per-view points

439
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:13,460
and we're getting generational money,

440
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,820
not just retirement money,

441
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:15,860
generational wealth.

442
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:16,720
Yeah,

443
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,059
it's so exciting to see the sport

444
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:19,100
prosper

445
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,580
because it helps me as well

446
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,159
because people need more high schools

447
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,919
to get into the next level of UFC

448
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:25,500
and also,

449
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,159
I've started Jiu-Jitsu at my gym

450
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,019
the last five years also.

451
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:28,279
And so,

452
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,720
I was never sort of a Jiu-Jitsu guy

453
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,179
but since,

454
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,259
the last five years,

455
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,539
we have a Brazilian instructor

456
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:34,299
that comes to our gym

457
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:35,720
every day.

458
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:36,860
So,

459
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,600
I'm starting to steer into that world myself

460
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,340
with competing.

461
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,379
I want to start getting into Jiu-Jitsu competitions

462
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:45,039
to fill in a hole

463
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:47,620
for where my Muay Thai competition used to go.

464
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,120
Joe Rogan is an incredibly influential figure

465
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,220
in America now.

466
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:54,759
Maybe the most influential voice

467
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:55,419
in some ways

468
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:56,879
heading into the US election.

469
00:11:57,139 --> 00:11:59,580
He's a UFC commentator

470
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,179
and he loves John Wayne Parr.

471
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,919
He's a huge fan of yours.

472
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:04,320
I know you went to his house,

473
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:06,399
trained him in his private gym

474
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,379
and then you've been a guest

475
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:09,360
on the Joe Rogan show.

476
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,620
Tell me about your relationship

477
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,320
with Joe Rogan.

478
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:12,559
Yeah, Joe is amazing.

479
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,879
Our first time on the podcast,

480
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,759
there was a hashtag on Twitter.

481
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,700
Get John Wayne on Joe Rogan.

482
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,500
Get John Wayne.

483
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,600
And then one day he replied,

484
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,620
I'd love to get John Wayne on.

485
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,279
I'm a big fan.

486
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:22,919
I'm like,

487
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:23,379
whoa,

488
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,820
Joe Rogan replied to the tweet.

489
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:25,399
So,

490
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,480
I showed him a DM.

491
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:26,799
Hey,

492
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,700
my name's John Wayne.

493
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:29,620
I'm just wondering,

494
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,019
is it okay?

495
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:31,399
He goes,

496
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,100
yeah, for sure.

497
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,879
I'd love to have you on.

498
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:33,840
Let's pick a date.

499
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,519
So, we picked a date.

500
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,320
I got to the Brisbane airport

501
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,179
on a Saturday,

502
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:38,059
turned my phone off,

503
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,620
arrived in LA,

504
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,799
turned my phone back on

505
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:41,639
and I get a beep beep

506
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,059
and it's Joe.

507
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:43,480
He goes,

508
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:43,700
oh,

509
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,519
I know we're doing the podcast tomorrow

510
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,919
but is there any chance

511
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:47,840
you want to come and do

512
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,960
the fight campaign with us now?

513
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,720
So, I went straight from the,

514
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:51,559
got my bag,

515
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:52,159
jumped in a taxi,

516
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:53,059
went straight to the studio.

517
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,159
Eddie Bravo,

518
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:54,919
Brian Callen,

519
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:55,559
Brendan Shaw,

520
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:56,820
Joe Rogan are all sitting there

521
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,580
talking about the fight.

522
00:12:57,659 --> 00:12:57,840
It's like,

523
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,080
whoa.

524
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,080
And then we finished the podcast

525
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,779
and Joe's like,

526
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:01,039
oh,

527
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,559
since we don't really know each other,

528
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:02,820
well,

529
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,840
do you want to come to my house

530
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,320
tomorrow morning

531
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,100
and we'll do a session

532
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,580
and then we'll have something

533
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,639
to talk about on the podcast.

534
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,279
I'm like,

535
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:07,860
whoa,

536
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:08,559
yes.

537
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:10,299
So, he gave me a dress

538
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:10,960
and said we could rock up

539
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,620
to his house.

540
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:12,919
Yeah,

541
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,480
it's just amazing.

542
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,399
And then what you see on TV

543
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,659
is the same Joe you see

544
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:16,320
in real life too.

545
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,000
He's so nice

546
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,480
and so humble

547
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,259
and so funny

548
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:19,179
and he's just,

549
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,960
he's the man.

550
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,720
He's so cool.

551
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,399
Wayne,

552
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,759
you spent a huge amount

553
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,379
of time living

554
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:24,480
and training

555
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,720
with the Thai people

556
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,759
and understanding

557
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,340
their love of the sport.

558
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,000
Tell us about

559
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,700
your relationship

560
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,419
with the Thai people.

561
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:31,019
So,

562
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:31,820
my Thai trainer,

563
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:33,059
after the first three

564
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:33,940
or four days of being there,

565
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,200
he said,

566
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,379
I'm not going to teach you

567
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:35,799
Thai boxing.

568
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,360
I'm going to teach you

569
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,039
how to be a Thai.

570
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:38,940
So,

571
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:39,740
pretty much

572
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,159
from there,

573
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,240
learning how to sit on the floor

574
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,019
to eat every meal.

575
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,620
You have to sit cross-legged

576
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,379
and then you put

577
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:46,120
a plate of rice in front

578
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,659
so you've got to lean

579
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,179
over your hips,

580
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,480
which sounds easy

581
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,179
until you have to try and do it

582
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:51,299
and then let's bring your rice

583
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:52,740
and then sit on the floor

584
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,220
is the thing.

585
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,899
You spoke about their care

586
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,419
and their love

587
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,659
and their incredible people

588
00:13:57,659 --> 00:13:58,159
but also,

589
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,840
if you do the wrong thing,

590
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:00,759
they can be pretty brutal

591
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:01,100
as well.

592
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:01,820
Oh, yeah.

593
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:02,860
The life's so cheap.

594
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,379
So,

595
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,679
there's a thing over there

596
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,059
in Thailand

597
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:06,379
where fighters will get

598
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,340
persuaded by the mafia

599
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,139
to throw fights.

600
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,379
Let's say you're making

601
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:11,899
$20,000 a fight

602
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:13,159
and then the mafia

603
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:13,620
might come in

604
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:13,740
and say,

605
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,039
we'll give you $100,000

606
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,320
but if you happen to

607
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,240
fall over round two,

608
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:17,919
per se,

609
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:18,840
and then

610
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,419
all of a sudden

611
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:21,480
these fighters have money

612
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,399
and then they do it

613
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:22,860
so obviously

614
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,460
and it's obvious,

615
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:24,240
yes,

616
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,460
I've known Thai trainers

617
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,320
that have paid the police

618
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
to make their files go missing

619
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,179
for them to disappear

620
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:29,600
and no questions asked.

621
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:31,179
And then

622
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:32,340
there was one camp

623
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:32,960
where two guys

624
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,580
disappeared

625
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,879
and then the trainer's like,

626
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,259
alright, guy,

627
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,100
gym meeting.

628
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,139
Has anyone seen

629
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:37,879
Stephen Darren?

630
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:38,779
Stephen,

631
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,360
yeah,

632
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:40,519
either of you.

633
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,919
Maybe they shouldn't have

634
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,100
done it.

635
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,720
Anyone else want to

636
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,259
throw a fight?

637
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,860
And then, yeah,

638
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:44,659
no one wants to throw

639
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:45,120
one after that.

640
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,460
Oh, Stephen Dazza.

641
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:48,519
Steve-o.

642
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:53,080
We all are born different.

643
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,240
As we grow,

644
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,340
the experiences we have

645
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,519
develop into outlooks

646
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:01,899
uniquely our own.

647
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:05,179
Charting our life's course.

648
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:08,889
No one sees an idea,

649
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:09,750
opinion,

650
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:10,850
or opportunity

651
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,889
like you.

652
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,129
And no one sees you

653
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:15,210
like VU.

654
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:17,509
Victoria University.

655
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,490
Uniquely you.

656
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,190
My name's Gabrielle.

657
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:22,850
I'm studying law.

658
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,269
What made me want to get into law

659
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:26,649
is, I guess,

660
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,850
the reward you get after

661
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,250
the feelings that you get

662
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,350
for helping other people.

663
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,129
I'm really passionate

664
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:33,029
about making sure

665
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:34,309
that people have that voice,

666
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,129
especially for people

667
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:35,909
that don't feel like

668
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:36,669
they can be heard.

669
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:37,429
And that's something

670
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:38,549
that's really important to me.

671
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,929
I have quite deep

672
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:41,789
personal values,

673
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:42,730
so it was really important

674
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:43,950
to me to find a university

675
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,529
that aligns with those values

676
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,110
and VU's that for me.

677
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:48,669
At Alita,

678
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,350
our signature program,

679
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:50,629
Alita Connect,

680
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:51,590
is something we're really

681
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,730
passionate and proud of.

682
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:53,789
We bring together groups

683
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:54,830
of five to six people

684
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,970
around the globe

685
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,389
from diverse backgrounds,

686
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:58,370
sport, industry,

687
00:15:58,549 --> 00:15:59,090
social venture,

688
00:15:59,149 --> 00:15:59,610
and the arts.

689
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,289
We come together

690
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:00,950
to learn,

691
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:01,730
to connect,

692
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:02,429
and to collaborate.

693
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,769
Vanessa Ford,

694
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,190
Chief Operating Officer

695
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,090
at Kukua.

696
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,789
The Alita Connect experience

697
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:08,750
for me has been

698
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,289
transformational.

699
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:11,629
I met people

700
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:13,409
that I would never have met

701
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:15,110
from totally different spheres.

702
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:16,590
It's very basic.

703
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,289
It's all about relationships.

704
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,350
It's all about

705
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,289
how we communicate

706
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:22,590
and what the Alita Connect group does

707
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,610
that is so powerful

708
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,669
is when you bring two people

709
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:28,169
from two totally different worlds

710
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:28,750
together,

711
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:30,269
there's no ego.

712
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:31,850
It just leaves room

713
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,149
for the real you.

714
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:35,110
And I think

715
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,730
that's what Alita gave me

716
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,929
was bringing back

717
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:38,710
the real me

718
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,169
and really connecting

719
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:41,970
to my own leadership style.

720
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:44,600
You're married

721
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,340
a very accomplished fighter

722
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,460
and your daughter

723
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,659
has joined the family business

724
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:50,200
as well

725
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,539
and was a fighter

726
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:52,279
from a young age

727
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,779
and you're saluting

728
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:54,220
and cheering.

729
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:54,960
What's it like

730
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,559
watching at a young age

731
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:57,580
your daughter in the ring?

732
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,360
How do you feel?

733
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,320
Do you get nervous watching it?

734
00:16:59,639 --> 00:16:59,940
I know.

735
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,840
I'm so excited.

736
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,320
I hear it.

737
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,860
Archie trains

738
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,720
and I know how passionate

739
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,480
she is also.

740
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,960
If she was missing days

741
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
and she wasn't hitting hard

742
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,880
and she wasn't moving her head

743
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,400
and she was losing in sparring,

744
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:09,279
I'd be very nervous.

745
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:10,400
But because I see

746
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,500
how accomplished she is

747
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,599
and how passionate she was,

748
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,519
she has the same

749
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,220
stubbornness that I do.

750
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,319
So they're helping us

751
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:19,880
through in the weight

752
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,839
and she's so determined

753
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,599
to be successful.

754
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,400
She started at the age of eight,

755
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:26,799
which was very controversial

756
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,240
at the time

757
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,019
because people weren't

758
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:29,700
adjusted to martial arts then.

759
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:30,480
But now,

760
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,240
with the popularity,

761
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:31,900
of UFC

762
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,579
and martial arts culture

763
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:35,180
and everyone's a lot more educated,

764
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:37,059
it's now just the age.

765
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:38,400
Jiu-Jitsu competitions

766
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,380
are held every weekend.

767
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,420
No one cares anymore.

768
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:40,819
It's just,

769
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,380
I find it quite humbling

770
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,319
to have the kids training

771
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,240
in the gym with me every day.

772
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,980
So a lot of people,

773
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:48,460
they'll go to work,

774
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:49,500
have some beers,

775
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:50,299
sit on the couch

776
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:52,279
and that's their day

777
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,359
where I'm lucky

778
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,200
to spend all my time

779
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,980
with the kids in the gym,

780
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:56,619
holding pads,

781
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,359
sparring,

782
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:57,980
having fun.

783
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,720
And then I'm so happy

784
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,240
that we have

785
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,299
a lot of people

786
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,799
I bond through fighting

787
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,740
and then we're there

788
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,420
in each other's corner

789
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,059
when we fight

790
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:06,299
and then we have a thing

791
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:06,839
in our family

792
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:09,099
where if someone's fighting,

793
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:09,859
it's their day.

794
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,299
So you're not allowed

795
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,039
to swear at that person.

796
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:12,839
They're not allowed

797
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:13,259
to do dishes

798
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,180
or pick up rubbish

799
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,319
and then they can say,

800
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,619
hey, pick up my plate,

801
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,019
it's my day.

802
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,240
And then they've got

803
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,759
the right thing

804
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,500
because it's their day.

805
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,539
So yeah,

806
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,119
they're the special player

807
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,160
and after their day's done,

808
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:24,339
it's like,

809
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:24,779
you pick it up,

810
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,200
you've got to pick it up.

811
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,980
The only thing is

812
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,599
you've got to get in the ring

813
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,380
and fight an opponent

814
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,440
which for most families,

815
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,259
most people would be happy

816
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:32,440
to do the dishes, Wayne,

817
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,140
but it's a unique family

818
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,299
that you've got.

819
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:36,920
I love asking these questions,

820
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:38,380
John Wayne Parr,

821
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,359
of different people,

822
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,880
whether you're talking

823
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,740
to someone who's been

824
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,700
a conductor of an orchestra

825
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,619
or a legend of their sport

826
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:47,759
or an entrepreneur with success

827
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:48,740
and what great leadership

828
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,380
looks like

829
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,180
and yours is a brave story

830
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,819
to leave as a 16 or 17-year-old

831
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:53,579
to live in Thailand

832
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:55,500
and take on the world

833
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,940
and the courage

834
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,339
to be one of the world's

835
00:18:58,339 --> 00:18:59,960
great combat sports athletes.

836
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,240
I want to ask you

837
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:02,440
about this idea of

838
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,880
how do you make sure

839
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,680
you're at your best

840
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,039
so that you've been able

841
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:07,180
to lead others in your family

842
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,240
and have an impact on others?

843
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:09,059
What do you do

844
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:10,640
to fill your cup up, John,

845
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,299
before you can help

846
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:11,839
someone else?

847
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,000
Since 1999,

848
00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:15,019
I haven't had a trainer.

849
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:16,279
I've been self-driven.

850
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,319
I'll pay my friends

851
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,200
to come and I'll pass for me.

852
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,200
The promoter will call me

853
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,759
and say,

854
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:22,480
hey, we want you to fight

855
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,440
this guy in this country

856
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:23,859
at this weight

857
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:24,559
for this much money.

858
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,480
I'll study my own opponents.

859
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,559
I'll matchmake myself.

860
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:29,660
I'll make sure

861
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,599
that I get my weight down.

862
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,240
I've never,

863
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:31,799
I've never replied.

864
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,740
The only person I need

865
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,420
is someone to help pass for me

866
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,299
and their sparring partners.

867
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:37,279
Besides that,

868
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:38,079
I've never once

869
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,059
have I woke up in the morning

870
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:39,819
and not wanted to

871
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:40,519
put my shoes on

872
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:41,059
and go for a run.

873
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,599
And then,

874
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,900
all the fear

875
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,779
I face is all me.

876
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,140
And then,

877
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,420
you want to fight my dean?

878
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:48,960
Sure.

879
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,099
You want to fight this guy?

880
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,319
Sure.

881
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:51,720
Yeah.

882
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,819
The only way to prove

883
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:53,259
that I'm the best

884
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,259
is I have to fight him.

885
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:54,799
I have to beat him.

886
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:56,700
So,

887
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:59,059
the passion

888
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:00,200
of wanting to be

889
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:01,799
remembered.

890
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:02,980
I know

891
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,779
once you pass

892
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:04,220
it doesn't matter

893
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,299
but I want to leave

894
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:06,000
a legacy where

895
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,319
even when you look

896
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,160
at Muhammad Ali now

897
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,539
your skin crawls

898
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:10,059
because you know

899
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:10,799
how amazing he is.

900
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,680
Or there's a gentleman

901
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,039
who used to

902
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,200
Raymond Deckers

903
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,960
who was a famous

904
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,480
Muay Thai guy

905
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:14,980
back in the day.

906
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,539
And I think of those guys' names

907
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:17,200
and hopefully

908
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,059
I can be put in that

909
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:18,380
a tier

910
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,779
after I pass

911
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:20,519
and people can

912
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,940
hopefully still be inspired

913
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,740
by what I did

914
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,099
when I was younger.

915
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:24,660
Yeah,

916
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,240
if you read the book

917
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,660
The Fighter

918
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,200
you'll see

919
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,640
the incredible story

920
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,240
that is John Wayne Parr

921
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,920
and I love this idea

922
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,140
of what,

923
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,000
what leadership looks like

924
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,380
and yours is a unique story.

925
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,319
What advice

926
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,079
do you pass on

927
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:35,779
to others

928
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:37,200
who maybe want to

929
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,920
follow your path

930
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,440
from a leadership

931
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:38,940
point of view?

932
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,279
You have to want it

933
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:41,700
so bad.

934
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,500
You have to want it

935
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,099
more than you want

936
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:43,460
to breathe.

937
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:44,740
My thing since I've

938
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,640
been approximately

939
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,740
I don't know,

940
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:47,099
11,

941
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,460
is no one's going

942
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,000
to get in my way.

943
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:49,680
So yeah,

944
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,579
whether it be

945
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:51,019
work,

946
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,539
job,

947
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,500
location,

948
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:54,180
money,

949
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:54,980
nothing's going to

950
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,400
stop me from

951
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,019
achieving what I want

952
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:56,319
to achieve.

953
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:57,339
There might be hurdles

954
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,059
but they're not

955
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:58,940
going to stop me.

956
00:20:59,099 --> 00:20:59,579
So if the girlfriend

957
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:00,000
doesn't like me

958
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,440
training,

959
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,059
see ya.

960
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:01,839
New job,

961
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:02,559
alright,

962
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,220
I won't work.

963
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,099
I haven't worked

964
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:06,700
since I was 19.

965
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:07,440
My last retirement

966
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,500
job was 1996.

967
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:09,680
So yeah,

968
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:10,819
work's going to get

969
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:11,319
in the way of my

970
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:11,700
training.

971
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,579
I love it.

972
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:14,980
You've got to want it.

973
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,420
A bit of an

974
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,180
endurance bit.

975
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:16,740
Yeah,

976
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,599
you've got to want it

977
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:18,319
as much as you want

978
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:18,740
to breathe

979
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,480
is a pretty

980
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,660
amazing answer.

981
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,599
You had this vision

982
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,380
from a young age.

983
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,299
You wanted to be a champion.

984
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,339
It's the final words

985
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:25,779
of your book

986
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:27,519
and every waking

987
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,240
breath it seems

988
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,140
was about being

989
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,500
a world champion

990
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:30,920
and,

991
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,000
and,

992
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,119
and the very best.

993
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,660
It's a,

994
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,319
it's an incredible

995
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,380
vision from a young age.

996
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,599
How do you go about

997
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,019
working with a team

998
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:38,339
to allow that vision

999
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,039
to take place?

1000
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:39,900
What did you put in place

1001
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,579
to make that happen?

1002
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:42,339
Just being successful

1003
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:42,900
by my,

1004
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,859
by my fighting.

1005
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:45,119
I have to win.

1006
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,500
Every win is a new

1007
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,359
impression on a new

1008
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:47,740
person.

1009
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,859
And not just fight,

1010
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,579
but fight exciting.

1011
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:51,859
Everyone can fight,

1012
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:52,859
but I want to fight.

1013
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,319
So I mentioned

1014
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:54,680
in the book

1015
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,480
where it doesn't

1016
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:56,960
matter where you're

1017
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,619
on the card to be

1018
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:58,299
the first card,

1019
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,140
the first fight of the

1020
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,799
card or the middle,

1021
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,180
last,

1022
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:00,619
doesn't matter.

1023
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,079
I want you talking

1024
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:02,640
about my fight

1025
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,079
when you're walking

1026
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:03,579
to your car.

1027
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,559
The main event

1028
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,119
might be here,

1029
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,839
but if you're going,

1030
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,019
oh,

1031
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:07,819
how good was that

1032
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:08,660
young kid?

1033
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:08,900
Oh,

1034
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,039
I can't wait to watch him.

1035
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,059
And then all of a sudden

1036
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:11,900
you've got more money

1037
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,960
generating and then

1038
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,160
all of a sudden

1039
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,119
the promoters know

1040
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,000
that you're an asset

1041
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
and then your prize

1042
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,019
might go from $1,000

1043
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:18,420
and all of a sudden

1044
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,000
you're on $5,000

1045
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,299
and next minute

1046
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:19,740
you're on $10,000

1047
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,039
and next minute

1048
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:20,500
you're on $15,000.

1049
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,680
So important to fight

1050
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,720
exciting so people

1051
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,259
cancel their events

1052
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:24,960
to make sure they're

1053
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,640
coming to see you fight.

1054
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:27,039
When we see people

1055
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:27,839
who are successful

1056
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,819
like you in whatever

1057
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:29,339
area,

1058
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,500
I just heard you talk

1059
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,420
about adding jiu-jitsu

1060
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,180
to your gym

1061
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,519
or wanting to

1062
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:36,480
keep learning.

1063
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,440
Is that you?

1064
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:38,259
Do you relate to that?

1065
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,000
Do you go down

1066
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,980
different rabbit holes

1067
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,319
of where curiosity

1068
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:41,839
takes you?

1069
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,660
Can you tell us a story

1070
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,660
about how that works

1071
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:43,940
for you?

1072
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,339
Martial arts is amazing.

1073
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,299
Martial arts never ends.

1074
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,339
It just keeps going

1075
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:49,240
and going and going.

1076
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,119
Sure,

1077
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:50,880
there's the 10,000

1078
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,420
bad ones,

1079
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:52,579
but the good ones

1080
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,500
are so impactful

1081
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,579
and so addicting.

1082
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,440
You're going to have

1083
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,079
the worst day

1084
00:22:59,079 --> 00:22:59,980
and come into a session

1085
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,819
and then leave it here

1086
00:23:00,819 --> 00:23:00,980
with the worst day

1087
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,000
and then leave it here

1088
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,480
with the biggest smile

1089
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:01,900
on your face.

1090
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,359
The endorphin

1091
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:04,940
when you rush,

1092
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:05,779
it makes you forget

1093
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:06,779
about whatever problems

1094
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:07,160
you have.

1095
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:08,460
You walk in the door

1096
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,259
and then you just want

1097
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:11,319
to be successful

1098
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,220
in there for an hour.

1099
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,220
Once you walk out

1100
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,660
and you go back

1101
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,400
to thinking about

1102
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,119
whatever happened

1103
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:15,960
before you walked in,

1104
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,019
but while you're in there,

1105
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:17,779
it's just thinking

1106
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:18,420
about sweating,

1107
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:19,359
having fun,

1108
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,579
chatting with your partner,

1109
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:22,400
just having fun.

1110
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,319
That's the best part

1111
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:23,839
about my job

1112
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:24,619
is it's not a job,

1113
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:25,779
it's just fun.

1114
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,740
And you can see that

1115
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,759
in the smile on your face.

1116
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:29,839
Everything you say,

1117
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:30,980
you said you've

1118
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,359
lived this joyful life

1119
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:33,180
and it comes out.

1120
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,259
We love this quote

1121
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:35,259
that the cost

1122
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:35,920
of great leadership

1123
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,960
is time.

1124
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:38,420
You said before

1125
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,420
nothing gets in your way

1126
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,000
of your dream

1127
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,759
as it was

1128
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:41,559
to be a world champion,

1129
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,720
but how have you been able

1130
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,819
to manage that

1131
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:45,059
and be married

1132
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,140
and have two kids

1133
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,359
and be able

1134
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,220
to make all that work?

1135
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:49,059
What's your secret there?

1136
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
I'm not really a money guy.

1137
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,799
When it comes to money,

1138
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,279
if I can survive

1139
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,559
when I was competing anyway,

1140
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,539
if I can survive

1141
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:57,019
from this fight

1142
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:57,519
to that fight,

1143
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,039
I'm okay.

1144
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,059
So I have no

1145
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:00,920
long-term plans

1146
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:00,960
or anything like that.

1147
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,799
Because of being a millionaire,

1148
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,240
as long as I can get

1149
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,720
to my next fight,

1150
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,400
that's all I need.

1151
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:06,700
And that's all I did

1152
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,140
for 35 years

1153
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,140
is just trying to get by,

1154
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:09,839
get by, get by,

1155
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,579
get by, get by.

1156
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:11,940
But nothing,

1157
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:12,420
like I said,

1158
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:13,619
even when times were tough

1159
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:14,380
and I was below

1160
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,299
and I was in debt,

1161
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:15,799
it's like,

1162
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,720
I know,

1163
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:17,319
but my next fight

1164
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,380
will get me above water again.

1165
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,740
And then it just so happens

1166
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,759
every time I needed money,

1167
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,119
just as the bad,

1168
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:22,519
in Thai,

1169
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,400
the Thai used to call me

1170
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,279
John Wayne Never Dies

1171
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,440
because I'd be down

1172
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,359
to my last 10 baht

1173
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,000
and then boom,

1174
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:27,980
20,000 baht would come.

1175
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,740
I'd be down to my last 50 baht,

1176
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,940
another 20,000 baht.

1177
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:31,599
It would come or something.

1178
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:32,359
It was just,

1179
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:32,819
yeah,

1180
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,000
the Thais were astonished

1181
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,819
how I kept surviving.

1182
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,660
I live in there,

1183
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,160
I made all this money

1184
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,200
from competing professionally.

1185
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:39,940
So,

1186
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:40,660
yeah,

1187
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,980
that's how I got to live so long.

1188
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,140
I just survived

1189
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:43,839
off my prize money

1190
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:44,940
that whole time I was there.

1191
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,920
Which is amazing,

1192
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:46,220
isn't it?

1193
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,180
Most people can't cope

1194
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,240
with that level of stress

1195
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,380
of not being down

1196
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,180
to your last dollar

1197
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,660
and you read the book

1198
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,440
and that was you.

1199
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,559
You just seemed to find a way

1200
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,180
every time,

1201
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,900
even when you had,

1202
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,619
your daughter was born,

1203
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,480
you'd jump on a plane

1204
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,740
and you'd find a fight

1205
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,200
that would,

1206
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,819
you know,

1207
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,500
keep you going.

1208
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,980
It's an incredible story.

1209
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,559
This idea of people

1210
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,000
being able to communicate well

1211
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,160
to have success.

1212
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:07,980
You moved to a country

1213
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,640
where you didn't speak

1214
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,720
a word of the language

1215
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,720
and you didn't have

1216
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,660
any formal training.

1217
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:13,619
How were you able

1218
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:14,279
to communicate

1219
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,460
to build that respect

1220
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,279
with the people

1221
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:16,940
that you work with?

1222
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,140
And there was no iPhones

1223
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,759
back then either.

1224
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,759
There was no Google.

1225
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,480
There was no,

1226
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
then you had to read a book

1227
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,140
and then you'd read

1228
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,980
the words in the book.

1229
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:25,240
So,

1230
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:26,920
but the only thing

1231
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,680
was the pronunciation

1232
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,440
and the reading

1233
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,279
were two different things.

1234
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:29,720
It wasn't,

1235
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:30,480
that,

1236
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:30,640
that,

1237
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:30,880
that,

1238
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,500
what you said

1239
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,200
and what that writes

1240
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:32,740
is nothing.

1241
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,940
It's not even close.

1242
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:34,740
So yeah,

1243
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:35,819
it just had to be a fact of,

1244
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:36,440
oh,

1245
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,660
so where I lived,

1246
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,779
imagine you're the only

1247
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:39,279
white person

1248
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:39,940
in all of Sydney.

1249
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:41,339
So where I lived,

1250
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:41,940
I was it.

1251
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,480
And then I'd go to the shops

1252
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,440
and people would stare at me

1253
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:44,980
and point at me

1254
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,599
because I'd never seen

1255
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,339
a white person before

1256
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:46,839
in real life.

1257
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:48,200
So then I got to the stage

1258
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,279
where I can't do hand signals

1259
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,259
so I couldn't eat,

1260
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,920
sleepy,

1261
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,559
tired.

1262
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,119
I've got to learn.

1263
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:53,700
So every,

1264
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,559
every day I'd try

1265
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,500
and give myself five words.

1266
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:55,859
All right,

1267
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,380
hats this,

1268
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:56,759
all right,

1269
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:57,619
t-shirts this.

1270
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,579
And then the next day

1271
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:00,480
I'd start another

1272
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,400
and then I remember

1273
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,180
my first sentence.

1274
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,259
I want one bag of ice.

1275
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,079
Pom dong ga nam keng nung tung.

1276
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,539
Pom dong ga nam keng nung tung.

1277
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,480
That's it all.

1278
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:11,400
And then I got my first

1279
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,019
bag of ice.

1280
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:13,380
I got my first sentence.

1281
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:14,339
And then I could just

1282
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,059
change the last word

1283
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:15,940
I want now.

1284
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:17,200
I know I can ask for stuff.

1285
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,839
And then it slowly progressed.

1286
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,339
And then I got to the stage

1287
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:21,740
where I'd hear the Thai songs

1288
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,220
on the radio

1289
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,099
and I knew they were popular.

1290
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:24,680
So I'd go down to the radio,

1291
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,140
add the record store

1292
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:26,940
and buy that CD.

1293
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,299
And then I'd press play

1294
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:28,680
and pause.

1295
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:29,619
And then I'd write in English

1296
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:30,740
what I'd heard.

1297
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:31,940
Pom, P-O-M,

1298
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:32,420
dong ga nam,

1299
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:32,940
D-O-N-G.

1300
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,619
And then I remember the words

1301
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:35,720
that I'd go to the Thai karaoke

1302
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,019
and all the Thais would be there.

1303
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:38,680
I'd put in my suggestion.

1304
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,539
They'd look at me going,

1305
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,359
and then I'd start singing.

1306
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,339
And everyone would start

1307
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:43,819
standing up

1308
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:45,299
and start jiggling around.

1309
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,519
And then even the guy

1310
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:48,279
doing the karaoke goes,

1311
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:49,480
do you know any more songs?

1312
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:50,160
And I'd make,

1313
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:50,980
I know the whole album.

1314
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:51,500
He goes,

1315
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:52,359
oh, can you do us more?

1316
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,039
I can do heaps.

1317
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,200
And then I'd hear

1318
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,099
and it was so much fun

1319
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:56,119
being the only white guy.

1320
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,259
I didn't know if I was

1321
00:26:57,259 --> 00:26:58,220
saying the right stuff or not,

1322
00:26:58,299 --> 00:26:59,200
but at least the Thais

1323
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
were getting into it.

1324
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,619
That made me laugh

1325
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:02,279
at the party then.

1326
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,960
Learning Thai by karaoke.

1327
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:06,599
That's a unique way

1328
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:07,259
to go about it.

1329
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,299
John Wayne Parr,

1330
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:09,400
who's been the greatest leader

1331
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,059
in your life?

1332
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:12,200
Greatest leader.

1333
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,559
Probably Raymond Deckard

1334
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:14,059
is the gentleman

1335
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:14,920
that I mentioned from Holland.

1336
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,740
Just aspiring to be like him.

1337
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:17,799
He was the first Western

1338
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:18,420
to go to Thailand

1339
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,059
and beat the Thais

1340
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:19,799
and not only win,

1341
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:20,500
but knock them out.

1342
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,500
And before then,

1343
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:22,500
everyone just feared them

1344
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,579
because they were untouchable.

1345
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,460
So he inspired me.

1346
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,660
When I was living in Thailand

1347
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,319
for the long term,

1348
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,700
every time I went to the stage

1349
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,440
where I was homesick

1350
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,160
and I wanted to

1351
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,720
come home and say,

1352
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:31,759
what would Raymond do?

1353
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:32,940
All right, I'll stay.

1354
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,480
And that would just inspire me

1355
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,599
to say another six months,

1356
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,000
12 months,

1357
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,279
how long I ever was there.

1358
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,220
Wayne, you're revered

1359
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,000
in the fight game

1360
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,500
and around the world

1361
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,680
for your courage

1362
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,240
and your history

1363
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,640
and taking any fight

1364
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,880
anytime, anywhere

1365
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,640
and you've been able

1366
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,339
to connect with unique people

1367
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:47,880
around the globe.

1368
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,819
We're a bit obsessed

1369
00:27:48,819 --> 00:27:49,680
around this idea

1370
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,700
that collaborating

1371
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,599
with other people

1372
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,079
is how great things happen.

1373
00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:54,059
Is there someone

1374
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:54,660
that you've thought,

1375
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:55,740
whether it be in the fight game

1376
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,700
or another area of your life,

1377
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:57,819
God, I'd love to have

1378
00:27:57,819 --> 00:27:59,500
been with whoever,

1379
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,720
you know, Ali

1380
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,140
or another fighter

1381
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,079
or is there a story

1382
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,140
or a person

1383
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,799
that springs to mind?

1384
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:07,079
I actually had Raymond Deckers

1385
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:07,759
come to Australia

1386
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:09,160
and then he had

1387
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,859
one of these fighters

1388
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:10,660
competing against

1389
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,319
another gentleman

1390
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,140
called Nathan Corbett

1391
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,779
here in the Gold Coast

1392
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:14,339
and then the promoter

1393
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:14,779
rang me and said,

1394
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,220
oh, because it's my show,

1395
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,279
I can't have Raymond here.

1396
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:18,140
Is there any chance

1397
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:18,700
Raymond Deckers

1398
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,480
can train in your gym

1399
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,400
for the next seven days

1400
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,460
as they prepare for the fight?

1401
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:22,440
So Raymond brought

1402
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,099
his fighter here.

1403
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,000
Every day we'd hang out

1404
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,799
and after the session

1405
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:26,819
we'd go for lunch

1406
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:27,599
and I'd sit there

1407
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,180
like a little boy

1408
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:28,779
asking stories.

1409
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,480
What happened

1410
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,140
when you brought this guy?

1411
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:31,559
Well, I went for a vet class

1412
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,339
and then I was like

1413
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:33,859
his little puppy

1414
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:34,640
for seven days

1415
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,119
and then he got my shirt

1416
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,880
and we corresponded

1417
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,940
regularly after that

1418
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,920
and then unfortunately

1419
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,759
he passed away.

1420
00:28:42,339 --> 00:28:43,559
So I lost one of my heroes

1421
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,940
but he's still there

1422
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,420
every day.

1423
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,359
He's still always there.

1424
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,259
I'll still never forget

1425
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,119
how much he inspires me.

1426
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,059
There's an old saying

1427
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:51,759
that be careful

1428
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:52,539
meeting your heroes.

1429
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,759
You can be disappointed

1430
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:54,480
but it sounds like

1431
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,940
the opposite for you

1432
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,720
in that experience.

1433
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,259
I encourage everyone,

1434
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:58,940
the fighter,

1435
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,000
the legendary

1436
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,140
like-minded fighter

1437
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:00,359
and the life

1438
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,380
of an Australian champion.

1439
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:03,339
The story of John Wayne Parr

1440
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:05,160
is a remarkable story

1441
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,079
on any level.

1442
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,900
If you haven't had

1443
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,779
any exposure at all

1444
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:10,400
to his world,

1445
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:11,440
it will blow you away

1446
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,799
the life this man's lived

1447
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,619
and to see the smile

1448
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:14,180
on your face,

1449
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:14,859
still training,

1450
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,039
still loving life

1451
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:18,500
and with all the things

1452
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,079
that you've been through

1453
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:19,960
is a great story.

1454
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:20,980
It's written by Jared Boyle.

1455
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,039
It's a great book

1456
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:23,160
and Wayne,

1457
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:23,900
it's a great privilege

1458
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,740
to spend some time with you.

1459
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:25,480
Thanks for taking the time.

1460
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:26,019
Thank you so much

1461
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:26,960
for such a positive interview.

1462
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:27,839
I really appreciate it.

1463
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:28,200
Thank you.
