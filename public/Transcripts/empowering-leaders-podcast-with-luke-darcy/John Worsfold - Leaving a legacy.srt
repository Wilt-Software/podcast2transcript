1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:12,599
How do you leave a legacy and what do you impart on those around you

2
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,100
so that they can continuously have a positive impact for years to come?

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,120
G'day, it's Luke Darcy.

4
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,980
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,739
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,660
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,399
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

8
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,560
in education, sport, industry and the arts

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,520
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,000
where everyone has a voice.

11
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:45,579
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

12
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,480
I was joined by one of the greatest leaders in AFL history, John Worsfold,

13
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:09,280
to discuss preparing someone for succession, creating discipline

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,359
so that those around you ask the right questions

15
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,200
and having trust in yourself to stand up to whatever comes your way.

16
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,310
Our next guest is a two-time AFL Premiership captain

17
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,310
with the West Coast Eagles, 1992 and 1992.

18
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,689
In 1994, he coached the West Coast Eagles to a Premiership in 2006,

19
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:33,769
played over 200 AFL games, coached 387 AFL games

20
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:36,290
with the West Coast Eagles and the Essendon Football Clubs.

21
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:38,590
Twice, he was voted by his peers,

22
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:43,250
the AFL Coaches Association Coach of the Year in 2006 and 2011

23
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,069
as their outstanding coach.

24
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,450
And he's universally regarded as one of the game's most feared,

25
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,150
tough and courageous, as well as one of the game's greatest ever leaders.

26
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,569
I speak of John Worsfold.

27
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:54,290
Thank you.

28
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,230
Thanks for joining me today, Woosher.

29
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:56,049
Thanks, Dallas.

30
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,810
I wanted to start with 1987.

31
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:01,370
The West Coast Eagles joined the AFL.

32
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,010
And for those listening that perhaps aren't as familiar

33
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,269
with the world of Australian rules football,

34
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,590
West Australian football had a huge reputation,

35
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,830
South Australia as well, but it was the VFL,

36
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,409
the Victorian Football League, that always considered themselves

37
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:17,550
the heartland and the ultimate to get to the VFL.

38
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,270
Of course, when it expanded, and I'm told, Woosher,

39
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,610
and you can correct me if this is wrong,

40
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,270
that you always felt a little bit sluggishly,

41
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:26,389
that the Victorians looked down on the West Australians

42
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:29,229
as maybe not being as tough as they were,

43
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,990
and that you were going to make it your personal mission

44
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,289
to prove that that wasn't the case.

45
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:35,610
Is that a fair question?

46
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,449
It probably is a fair question.

47
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,710
It wasn't through me thinking that's what they thought.

48
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,750
It was from listening to people talking about it and reading.

49
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,389
You know, I've still got a small copy of a letter to the editor

50
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:51,030
of the West Australian over here.

51
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,030
I assume it's a Victorian.

52
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:58,590
A Victorian has just caned West Coast in our first year

53
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,210
about having no guts and, you know, just not being up to it

54
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,250
and not tough enough.

55
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:08,330
And, you know, I must admit, I did think at that stage that,

56
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,849
you know, I'm not really comfortable with that.

57
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,189
And for us to be really successful, we need to show people

58
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:18,090
that we can play pretty tough as well as be a great

59
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,090
outside running team.

60
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:21,069
Well, you certainly did that, Woosher.

61
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:24,069
The image I've got of you, and I think I mentioned this to you before,

62
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:28,110
is that it felt like you went after the opposition's toughest player.

63
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,069
And I can picture you cleaning up Glenn Archer from North Melbourne,

64
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:33,069
one of the hardest players of his year at Dermot Burton.

65
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,270
I think it was on the receiving end of a bit of John Worsford attention.

66
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,509
Even Tony Lockett, maybe the most feared player in the game at that time.

67
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,710
Was that something you did?

68
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,509
Did you think, you know, as a leader of my team,

69
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,909
if I go after the opposition's hardest player,

70
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:46,389
they're going to grow around me?

71
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:47,349
Is that what happened?

72
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:50,169
No, certainly not by planning it.

73
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:53,370
Just the way it happened, it unfolded.

74
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,270
So, yeah.

75
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:58,669
I wasn't that talented that I could pick a target and then time

76
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:01,330
an opportunity to try and put on a big hit.

77
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:05,250
But, yeah, it did pan out that way a little bit.

78
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,250
Or maybe it's just that they're the ones we remember more because,

79
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:13,189
you know, if I cleaned up a skinny Ben Hart or someone like that,

80
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:14,870
people don't remember it.

81
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:17,490
They more remember those big, tough names.

82
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,750
A very early shirt front I put on was on Rod Grinter,

83
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,529
who was renowned as a really tough player for the Ds.

84
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,850
And I must admit, he did have a few of our teammates a little bit aware of him

85
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,990
when we were playing them.

86
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:37,490
So, I think it was 1987 or 1988, so first or second year of West Coast.

87
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,829
And I put this really big hit on him and he was getting helped off the ground

88
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:44,610
by a couple of trainers in the first quarter.

89
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:47,810
And at quarter time, I had several teammates come over to me

90
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,470
and, like, almost give me a hug, ruffle my hair, pat me on the back,

91
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,589
like, they were just that happy that Grinter was no longer on the ground.

92
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,870
And that did make me walk a little bit taller and maybe that was one

93
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,269
of the early days when I thought, geez, if I can win my teammates' hearts

94
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:07,730
by just playing the game the way I play it, that's a pretty cool thing to do.

95
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:12,170
Now, I wish Rod Grinter was known and still is to this day as Balls

96
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:17,470
because he was as brave as they come and renowned for impacting

97
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:19,170
a bit of pain on others.

98
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,170
So, for a bit of context, that would have...

99
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,189
He's made an impact for sure.

100
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,930
I actually spoke to him a few weeks ago and he's head of the past players

101
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:27,850
at the Melbourne Football Club.

102
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:29,949
Now, you won't remember this because I would have been much more

103
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:34,089
low-hanging fruit, but I certainly do because we crossed over in 1997

104
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:36,389
and it was the last game at the Witten Oval.

105
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:39,629
So, it was a massive deal for the team I played for, the Bulldogs,

106
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:43,790
the historic ground that we were no longer going to have as our home ground.

107
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,189
And the West Coast Eagles and you and your teammates had been pretty good

108
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:49,149
at intimidating our younger players.

109
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,990
And so, we decided pre-game.

110
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,550
To target one of your young players, Michael Gardner.

111
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:55,290
Now, I'm not sure if...

112
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,310
You probably remember that incident and it erupted from there

113
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,870
and there was a punch on in the back line.

114
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,649
And I think it might have been the second quarter.

115
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,649
You ran past me and it was a cheap shot because there would have been

116
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:07,029
all the thing.

117
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:08,990
And I can remember just bowling you over from behind.

118
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,769
Without any context, the ball was a fair way away.

119
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,470
But I'll never forget your response.

120
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:15,670
And I don't know if you remember this, but by the time you looked up

121
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,430
and I don't think it had much impact on you,

122
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,889
but you just looked up very coldly and you said,

123
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,350
you're going to regret that.

124
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,069
And I remember being taken by just the calmness of it.

125
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,670
And it was more unnerving than someone going berserk at you

126
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,110
because you did it, but you did it in a pretty cold, calculated way.

127
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:33,670
It felt, was it?

128
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,509
I do remember the game, obviously.

129
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,149
And I remember being pretty riled up because I was down the opposite end

130
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,769
from where Gardner was targeted.

131
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:44,610
And I think I was walking down towards my position,

132
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:46,250
so I didn't actually see it all happen.

133
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,850
So, I don't know if I was disappointed that I missed out on some of the action

134
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,149
or whether I was upset.

135
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:51,250
I don't know.

136
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:51,290
I don't know.

137
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:51,310
I don't know.

138
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:51,329
I don't know.

139
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:51,449
I don't know.

140
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,490
I'm not a really targeted Gardner,

141
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,730
but I think I might have been playing on Stephen Colin York

142
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,790
or someone like that.

143
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:03,370
And I just thought, this guy is probably going to pay a prize

144
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,709
for what his teammates have done up the other end.

145
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,029
He may not know why, but at some point that may happen.

146
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:12,930
But look, I do always felt as though I was in control, Gar.

147
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,769
So, when someone had a crack at me,

148
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:18,310
I don't think I got too wound up that I was going to lose control

149
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,730
and whack them back straight away.

150
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,230
But I certainly did.

151
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,569
remember things and, you know, I would have brought it up

152
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,949
if the opportunity arose and I managed to put a good bump on.

153
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:32,550
I might have just had that raw smile looking down saying, you know,

154
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,449
I did suggest that that was going to come back to bite you.

155
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:39,370
And for context, you're not the most physically imposing

156
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,069
and you weren't really, 180 centimetres, so 5 foot 11 in the old

157
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:44,250
or 86 kilos.

158
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:48,370
So it wasn't as though, you know, Tony Lockett just through sheer mass

159
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,209
was terrifying really, wasn't he, for a lot of players.

160
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,009
I mean, he made that impact.

161
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:56,470
But for you, where did it come from?

162
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:59,329
You remember as a kid just that because it takes something special

163
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:02,430
to have that trust in yourself that you can stand up to whatever's coming?

164
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,129
I sort of just remember that I love the game.

165
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:07,329
I love the competitive nature of the game.

166
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,870
So going hard and win the ball.

167
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,209
But if the opposition have got it, it's fair game to try

168
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:14,089
and get it back off them.

169
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:18,730
But also in terms of, you know, in my era, protecting your teammate

170
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,449
was a big part of the game.

171
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,170
And it was legal.

172
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,269
We put on big shepherds, you know, within five metres

173
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:26,430
of your teammate carrying the ball.

174
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:29,610
But these days, you just don't see it happen because of risks

175
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,610
of clashing heads or maybe getting them high.

176
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,830
Or if you put a big shepherd on and they're not aware of it,

177
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,509
they hit their head on the ground, players are getting suspended.

178
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,929
So, you know, the old-fashioned run hard an opponent and shepherd

179
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,070
for your teammate doesn't happen.

180
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:50,029
But I did enjoy giving my teammates time and space.

181
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:50,769
Yeah.

182
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:50,809
Yeah.

183
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:50,850
Yeah.

184
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:50,889
Yeah.

185
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:50,950
Yeah.

186
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:50,970
Yeah.

187
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,009
Yeah.

188
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:51,029
Yeah.

189
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:51,049
Yeah.

190
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:51,090
Yeah.

191
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,269
And taking those opportunities, even as a young kid.

192
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:59,370
So, and I do, I just have one recollection as a junior footballer,

193
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:01,929
maybe at 14 years of age.

194
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,629
And you remember that the parents sat within a metre of the boundary line

195
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:11,090
in those days in their deck chairs and opposition parents,

196
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,450
like, really giving it to me, booing me.

197
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:16,929
And I'm thinking as a 14-year-old, they're having a crack at one guy

198
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:20,309
because I think I put on a big shepherd or something like that

199
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,169
right in front of them.

200
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:22,950
But, you know, that didn't rile me.

201
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,370
It was like, no, I get that.

202
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:26,129
I get that they're upset because that's their team,

203
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,309
but I'm doing this for my team and that's what counts.

204
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:28,909
Yeah.

205
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,110
And it certainly, yeah, stayed with you right throughout your career.

206
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,129
I wanted to jump, Woosha, to the coaching part of your life.

207
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:37,230
And you started your coaching career at the Carlton Football Club

208
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,169
as an assistant there.

209
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:42,210
And everyone I know that knows you talks about you being really consistent

210
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,509
and your values really consistent in the person that you are.

211
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:49,309
And I'm told that there was an old occasion,

212
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,389
that may be too strong a word,

213
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,149
but John Elliott was,

214
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:54,090
was the legendary president of Carlton,

215
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:56,730
who I think was pretty instrumental in getting you to the Carlton Football Club.

216
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:01,149
But he crossed paths with you and you had to explain to him where he stood.

217
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,129
Is that a true story?

218
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,169
And can you share that story with us?

219
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:07,610
Yeah, well, John was president of the Carlton Footy Club

220
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,710
and I was an assistant coach looking after the back line,

221
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,850
but I was also an assistant coach of the VFL team,

222
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:18,190
our reserves team as it was back then.

223
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:21,129
Often the reserves, the Carlton reserves,

224
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:25,669
were playing as the pre-game leading up to our seniors

225
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:27,389
at the old Prince's Park.

226
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,909
So the good old days, Dallas.

227
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,730
And so I was an assistant coach of the reserves too.

228
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:35,090
Ross Lyon was coaching them and I was an assistant to Ross.

229
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:38,169
So in short, John had asked me or John's,

230
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:42,409
the Carlton people had asked me if I'd be John's pre-game guest

231
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,210
at his luncheon, his president's luncheon

232
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,350
and have a few words before the seniors played,

233
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:48,110
which I agreed to.

234
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,750
It was going to be obviously after the reserves game,

235
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,049
leading into the league playing.

236
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,730
But the reserves game was whether we had,

237
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:58,769
I think we had a bad concussion or something like that

238
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:01,309
and the game extended out and went a little bit longer.

239
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:03,110
So I finished that game off.

240
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:04,850
It was a pretty tight game, but did my job

241
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,950
and then left and rushed around to the president's luncheon.

242
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:12,389
And when I got there, the guy on the door said,

243
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,830
no, you're too late.

244
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:15,149
John started, you can't go in.

245
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:16,909
So I thought, no problems.

246
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:19,490
I'll just go down and prepare the seniors ready to play.

247
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,149
So we did that.

248
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:23,250
And then after the seniors game, John came down into the rooms.

249
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,470
We must have won because he didn't come down the rooms if we lost.

250
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,750
And he bailed me up and just said,

251
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,070
you were late for my president's luncheon.

252
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,129
Don't ever let that happen.

253
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,090
And I just questioned him on, said, John, I was doing my job.

254
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:39,990
Where does that sit in regards of the values of the club?

255
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,470
And, you know, I saw my priority as to do my job

256
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,950
and help the reserves team and your lunch for the secondary.

257
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:48,610
I don't know if he saw it that way.

258
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,690
But anyway.

259
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:54,269
I don't think he was used to people actually giving him some feedback.

260
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,710
But, you know, I wasn't being offensive.

261
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,909
I just wanted him to let him know what my understanding and expectations were.

262
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,490
And, you know, we got on really well from then on.

263
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,610
Or before that, we still got on very well.

264
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,149
Well, it's interesting.

265
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:08,610
He was, for those that don't know John Elliott's history,

266
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:11,590
I think he was president of Carlton for maybe 27 years

267
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,370
through an incredibly powerful era.

268
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,990
There was talk of him being the prime minister of Australia,

269
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,029
he was the head of elders that at one stage were going to try and take over BH,

270
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:22,730
he was as big a high flyer in the corporate world

271
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,529
as Australia had ever had at that stage.

272
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:28,149
And perhaps in later life, you know, John's had some challenges.

273
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:32,870
But that to me, I mean, this podcast is about empowering leadership,

274
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,850
which I want to talk to you about.

275
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,889
But that was certainly the old school leadership, wasn't it?

276
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:36,549
I'm in control.

277
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,110
I'm the boss.

278
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,389
No one crosses John Elliott at Carlton.

279
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:41,610
You did because of your values.

280
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:44,389
And as you said, you felt like that was in the end pretty well received

281
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,730
if you stood up to that and he knew your values, that was a positive.

282
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:50,029
Yeah, look, I honestly didn't know how he was going to take it.

283
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:52,529
But it was what I believed in.

284
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,629
It was to let him know the background to it and that I valued my role

285
00:12:56,629 --> 00:13:00,870
and my job at Carlton and, you know, attending his lunches.

286
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,669
It was important, but it was secondary to actually, you know, doing my job.

287
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,889
So I was comfortable to let him know.

288
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,669
And I think he was a bit shocked.

289
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:10,870
Well, I've got no doubt he was.

290
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,350
But I was comfortable to do it because it felt right.

291
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:17,230
You know, to me it was right and I needed to let him know that.

292
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,370
Now, I wasn't necessarily thinking of going here,

293
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:24,629
but as we're talking, Wisher, I've got something in mind that I think of

294
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:27,590
when I think of you and Carlton had that great successful period

295
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,309
and you end up coaching the Essendon Football Club,

296
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,669
had a massive successful period.

297
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:33,470
But it was in an era where they were able to go and recruit

298
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,470
unbelievable players out of the other leagues, South Australia,

299
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,429
go and top up with these incredibly talented players,

300
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:43,750
the great Stephen Kernaghan and Mark Naley and Peter Motley,

301
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,669
this goes on Craig Bradley and likewise Essendon.

302
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:48,809
And I suppose this is, you know,

303
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,090
controversial, Wisher.

304
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,490
They also had, you know, their issues.

305
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:56,009
Both those clubs were found to have cheated on the salary cap

306
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:59,289
and played outside the rules, both Carlton and Essendon.

307
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,149
And you end up coaching Essendon many years later.

308
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:07,309
Did it feel like to you that sometimes those clubs hadn't transcended their past

309
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:10,830
and they're still looking to maybe take shortcuts because they've been out of

310
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,909
win in the past doing that?

311
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:15,429
I think you left a bit of a parting message when you left Essendon that I don't

312
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:16,470
think was picked up that well.

313
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,149
But is that a reasonable summation?

314
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:23,190
What I believe, and I was only at Carlton for a brief period,

315
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:26,009
two years, and then I had my five years at the Bombers.

316
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,669
But, you know, those clubs are unbelievably old,

317
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:34,509
traditional VFL community-based clubs is how they started.

318
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:37,230
You know, they were based right in the heart of Essendon and right

319
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,750
in the heart of Carlton and that's where their members came from.

320
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,730
And, you know, that was a really strong part of the culture.

321
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,009
And they were both obviously the two clubs that have won the most

322
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:49,350
VFL.

323
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,309
AFL Premierships in their history.

324
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:53,710
So very, very successful clubs.

325
00:14:53,710 --> 00:15:00,350
I feel as though they were the slowest to buy into the new era, the new AFL and

326
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:05,210
control of the era where everyone plays by the same rules in terms of a salary

327
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,870
cap and, you know, an equalisation system.

328
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:09,269
And I can understand that.

329
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:14,129
Well, why would Carlton and Essendon that are at the absolute top want to buy

330
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:19,169
into equalisation with St Kilda and North Melbourne and maybe back then the Western

331
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:24,409
Bulldogs and these clubs that didn't have the same sort of membership and and corporate

332
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:25,009
support.

333
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:30,090
So they try to hang on to the old ways as long as they could.

334
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:35,309
And it did, I believe, got them into trouble with some of the decision making around, you

335
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,990
know, we don't have to stick by these rules.

336
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,330
We'll do what's always been successful for us.

337
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:42,850
But they had signed over by staying in the AFL comp.

338
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:48,090
A lot of that decision making and power was owned by the AFL and they got punished pretty

339
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:48,710
severely.

340
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:54,870
So, you know, whereas I saw firsthand at West Coast that we said, we're in this, these are

341
00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:00,330
rules, we're going to play by these rules and and maximise how well we do it.

342
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:06,769
So set up really good list management recruiting systems because we're going to have to work

343
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:08,149
within these guidelines.

344
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:13,090
Whereas I get the feeling that those clubs may have said, let's just, you know, we know

345
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:13,950
where the good players are.

346
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:18,529
We'll just get them. We'll try and get them outside the rules of the draft or the salary cap.

347
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,669
Yeah. And I suppose your experience at Essendon in the Amwish, I always felt a little bit

348
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:28,049
embarrassed by mainstream media because I've worked in it since playing, you know, almost

349
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:29,629
full time or full time.

350
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:35,590
The way that we sometimes deal with legends, you know, like you finish up as coaches and

351
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:40,629
suddenly at the end we decide that we want to try and, you know, what's the word I'm

352
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:44,730
after, diminish great people in the industry because it suits a narrative that you're

353
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,549
leaving. And if, you know, you didn't win a premiership and you're unsuccessful and

354
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,029
not really looking at the facts.

355
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:53,889
And, you know, I think you did leave a little bit of a message that was went through the

356
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,330
keeper. A lot of people say, hey, there is a system here.

357
00:16:56,389 --> 00:17:00,509
If you're not prepared to do the hard work, planning and get good people in and proper

358
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:05,509
recruiting and you only want to go back to the old way, was that a little bit of a bit

359
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:10,150
of a warning shot back to say, hey, I can't work in this system because my values will

360
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,549
only allow me to do it this way?

361
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:13,670
Not really. I couldn't work in that system.

362
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:18,150
But just to understand that you have to build a premiership squad.

363
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,549
Yeah.

364
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,230
These days, so many things have to go right.

365
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,930
You can't just think, OK, we're missing this one piece.

366
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,910
Let's go and get it at the end of this season through having more money than everyone else

367
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,930
and being a big name club that everyone wants to come to.

368
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:33,250
It just doesn't work like that.

369
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:39,009
You've got to pay a price either by giving up high draft picks to trade or to recruit

370
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:40,690
in and say we're getting a young kid in.

371
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,349
That's just the way it works.

372
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:47,690
And the old days of saying we want Greg Williams, he'll add some value to us.

373
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,009
Let's just get him.

374
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,569
They don't exist anymore.

375
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:57,150
So, yeah, my point was Essendon in particular were just so focused on winning a final.

376
00:17:57,269 --> 00:17:59,109
It's been so long since we've won a final.

377
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:06,609
It's like, OK, just because of that and because you're a huge, respected old club doesn't

378
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:11,809
give you the right to win a final without doing the hard work and planning and sticking

379
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:14,190
to a plan over a period of time.

380
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:17,230
Just hoping next year is a good year and we win a final.

381
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,049
Whereas Essendon doesn't cut it anymore.

382
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:25,130
So, yeah, and, you know, what I've giggled at a little bit this year, Darce, is that

383
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,490
people are saying we've got a – Ben Runton's done a wonderful job this year.

384
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:33,230
He's taken Essendon into the finals, which was not really expected.

385
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,349
But people have been saying let's give him time, though.

386
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:40,769
They may go slightly backwards or maintain their position next year and the year after,

387
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,710
but everyone can see the pathway they're on.

388
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:47,150
I like the fact that they're saying let's give this guy time and stick to the path.

389
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,710
And work towards winning a premiership because that's what it's all about.

390
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:56,549
They're winning the premierships, not just winning a final to heading a list that you're

391
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:00,569
not comfortable heading, as in the longest team since winning a final.

392
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:02,650
Aim for another premiership.

393
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:06,369
To win a premiership, you'll win that final, so it'll take care of itself.

394
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:11,789
And I know you're not angling at this in any way, shape or form, but you were clearly part

395
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,009
of that succession plan.

396
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:15,349
You're too humble to do that with Ben Runton.

397
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:15,390
Yeah.

398
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:15,450
Yeah.

399
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:15,470
Yeah.

400
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:15,490
Yeah.

401
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:15,509
Yeah.

402
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:15,529
Yeah.

403
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:15,549
Yeah.

404
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:15,569
Yeah.

405
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:15,609
Yeah.

406
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:15,630
Yeah.

407
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:15,690
Yeah.

408
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:15,750
Yeah.

409
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:15,970
Yeah.

410
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:16,009
Yeah.

411
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:16,029
Yeah.

412
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:16,049
Yeah.

413
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:16,109
Yeah.

414
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:16,130
Yeah.

415
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:16,170
Yeah.

416
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:16,390
Yeah.

417
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:16,589
Yeah.

418
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:17,130
Yeah.

419
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:17,230
Yeah.

420
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:17,289
Yeah.

421
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:17,309
Yeah.

422
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:18,589
Yeah.

423
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:18,789
Yeah.

424
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,970
Yeah.

425
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:19,029
Yeah.

426
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:19,069
Yeah.

427
00:19:19,069 --> 00:19:19,089
Yeah.

428
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:19,109
Yeah.

429
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:24,170
They're done everywhere in the business world as a natural course of the way you do business.

430
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:30,529
But I understand Ben Runton is absolutely unequivocal and that the success he's had this

431
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:34,930
year is due to what you allowed him to do in that last year and give him incredible

432
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:38,769
guidance and leadership and a clear run to coach the side.

433
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:43,130
I mean, it's an incredible reflection on the person you are to make that happen.

434
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:46,470
I mean, was that – can you talk me through handing the reins over to someone when you

435
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:52,829
had 12 months to go yeah well i mean just knowing that you know i was leaving the bombers in in my

436
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:58,690
own terms uh as in to come home to perth to reunite with my family who i'd been working

437
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,549
remote from them for three years i knew i couldn't do it any longer than three years so

438
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:08,309
xavier campbell the ceo of essendon was well and truly aware of that we'd been really up front with

439
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:14,150
all our communication so we knew there was a change at the end of uh at the end of my time

440
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:20,190
there by five years they decided that they felt ben rutton was a great person to step in

441
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:27,529
um after i'd finished so it just made sense to help prep him and the squad best way we could

442
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:33,869
going forward so yeah it had to be it's that it wasn't about me and my last year at essendon and

443
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:39,069
whether we made finals or whatever we're obviously still striving to achieve the best we could but

444
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:44,130
in the end it became so clear to me that ben was was ready to take over

445
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:49,569
way earlier than maybe i we would initially thought we were planning on him coaching some

446
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:54,430
games in his own right in the back half of the year he ended up coaching every game yeah he

447
00:20:54,430 --> 00:21:01,029
led the pre-season and i said mate you're ready to go so you just coach the team so in effect

448
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:07,750
going into his first year this year he'd had a full year of having a look at his game plan

449
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,970
educating the players around it working out where he felt players would best fit within that game

450
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,049
plan so

451
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:19,009
it was like a research year for him as much as anything um and i was fully supportive of that

452
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:26,869
so yeah look i i suppose um if our measure of success of the actual coaching succession plan

453
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:33,849
was that we best prepared ben for a long successful coaching career not around where

454
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:40,309
we finished the latter the previous year as on the field so much of our succession plan the kpis

455
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:43,750
were around getting ben prepared for the all the

456
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:49,569
extra media commitments he'd have the extra coterie and sponsor commitments that he would

457
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:54,509
have with the club um having a better understanding about his playing list building those relationships

458
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:59,369
as as the man who's telling them if they're dropped you know at the start of the year we

459
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:03,470
did it together but by about round five i'd stepped away and ben did it all himself so

460
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:09,009
learning that building those relationships and just gave him a head start stepping in as senior

461
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:14,109
coach um i'm wrapped that he feels as though well i know he felt it was valuable because of the

462
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:20,069
because we've bounced ideas off each other all year and he was very you know thankful that when

463
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:25,650
the season finished and i and i headed back to perth so but the fact that the bombers um came

464
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:31,849
on so well this year i think was a bonus to watch that happen but ultimately i felt as though ben was

465
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:36,349
better prepared for coaching than if he was assistant coach at another club and got a job

466
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:42,809
on his own and stepped in cold i feel as though we prepared him well you almost feel like that's

467
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:44,109
the template right there

468
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:49,049
but it's interesting it takes uh you know from my observation someone like you who's prepared

469
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:53,990
and you wore all the heat you're all you wore all of the the bombs that were being thrown publicly

470
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:58,910
and um you know i suppose it's another great gift of leadership isn't it to to do that with uh

471
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:03,029
with uh humility it makes me think i'm not sure if you've read the book uh which uh

472
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:07,650
jim collins he calls uh it's a good to great famous book and you're nodding like you've read

473
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:13,390
and he talks about level five leaders as being that bracket that uh i think he quite a use i

474
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,109
think he's building endurance and he's building endurance and he's building endurance and he's

475
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:18,609
doing greatness through a paradoxical blend of personal humility and professional will and

476
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:24,250
you can get leaders below that who may be a bit more ego that can build a good organization but

477
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:29,130
not a great one and um you know does that resonate with you i think that the great leaders have that

478
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:35,569
extra sort of level of humility and will at the same stage uh yeah look i i mean it does resonate

479
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:43,970
very strongly it wasn't something i'd thought a lot about but to me um to you know my absolute

480
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:51,470
focus last year was to uh give ben as many opportunities to understand what he was

481
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:56,470
stepping into what what the senior coaching gig was going to be so he i mean it still would have

482
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:01,269
hit him in the face when he started but he was ready for it he understood what was going on so

483
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:05,250
i always communicate to him this is what i'm doing this is what's happening he he observed

484
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:10,170
my press conferences we pulled them apart afterwards good ones the bad ones we talked

485
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:13,930
about it so there was just so many opportunities for ben to learn and grow and

486
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:20,549
um yeah i know people sort of go well essendon called a uh a review an internal review post

487
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:27,309
season that uh to me was no reflection on the succession plan that was around we want to set

488
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:32,910
the club up and ben up for the next premiership so let's have a look now we've got a coaching

489
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:37,210
changeover what do we need to do where are the gaps what are we going to do it made absolute

490
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:42,450
sense to do that now i got pinned on the fact that we didn't have a successful year on the field but

491
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,109
you know ultimately you know we're going to have a successful year on the field but

492
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:51,009
i feel as though what the club did uh hopefully they agree or see that what my small role in

493
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:56,829
assisting ben has has helped them look like everyone's excited and you know to me that

494
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:02,329
means the succession plan was a success everyone's really excited and see where their club's going

495
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:09,230
they've got a really talented young coach in charge uh that performed exceptionally well in

496
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:14,109
his first year and hopefully part of that a small part was the

497
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:19,589
work we put in together last year the humility is there isn't it uh which all great leaders have

498
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:24,789
around not taking credit which i know um you won't do um everyone i know that's played under

499
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:29,890
you wish it talks about you this podcast we've we've titled empowering leaders that you are the

500
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:36,930
ultimate empowering leader in that you really almost uh so disciplined around not wanting to

501
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:41,910
just give instruction that you always ask questions of your players you want them to

502
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,109
learn and then come to the conclusions themselves

503
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:49,970
is that accurate and and can you explain why you you went down that path um yeah it's pretty

504
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,950
accurate i mean there's obviously times when a leader just has to make make quick decisions or

505
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:59,890
tell people that this is what we need to do and but uh you know through my experience personally

506
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:08,109
but also you know as a coach over a long period of time i found that uh if players players in

507
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:14,049
particular but it goes for assistant coaches etc if they work out the answer or the solution to an

508
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:21,109
issue they have themselves uh the outcome of their actions is so much stronger than me working it

509
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:26,630
out for them and telling them to go and do it this way so it's that uh you know intrinsic motivation

510
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,029
it comes from you know there's been a lot of studies done around that i've spent a fair bit

511
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:36,450
of time reading reading about what really what absolutely gets people to want to turn up and

512
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:42,410
do their job and do it well and you know knowing that they can do it well is one thing but having

513
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:50,990
i'm empowered to go away and find the way to do this the best drives that motivation and it goes

514
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,450
back and i don't mind i don't think you'll mind me sharing this story but josh kennedy who's been

515
00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:01,430
a wonderful footballer for west coast uh when he first started with us he he came to my office and

516
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:05,809
he said i've got a problem and so he'd only been at the club for a couple of months and he's a

517
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:12,250
young guy young 19 year old um i've got a problem um and i'm thinking oh we've just traded chris

518
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,109
one of the greatest players of all time

519
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,990
and replacing you and two months in tell me you've got a problem what's the issue then

520
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:22,829
and he said i love going out with the boys and having a drink i love it it's like

521
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:27,609
i just love it and if there's anything happening on there i'm gonna lead the way

522
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:33,109
i'm you know i'll set up the party games and it'll be a great night and i've got to be there

523
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:38,410
i said okay i can see why what's the problem with that he said i think it's holding me back from

524
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:43,369
achieving what i want to achieve i've been getting soft tissue injuries and so i said okay we'll go

525
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:43,950
away and

526
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,890
think about what it would look like if you achieve what you're telling me you want to achieve which

527
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:54,970
is play every game and and be a good goal kicker so he did that he came back to me with not only a

528
00:27:54,970 --> 00:28:01,869
report on curbing how many times he went out and had a drink uh but his pre-training plan

529
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:07,470
what he would do before every training session to prepare what he did after every training session

530
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:13,250
to improve his skills and that went i think it ended up being like 15 extra things per week

531
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,109
that he was doing and i think that's what he did and i think that's what he did and i think that's

532
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:18,769
what he was doing on top of just turning up and being told to train and you know it's just

533
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:25,589
obviously he then went on i think he said his early goals were to kick 20 play 25 or 22 games

534
00:28:25,589 --> 00:28:32,089
and kick 25 goals now he obviously just blew that out of the water and over over the terms of his

535
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:37,369
career but i never had to go back to him again and tell him to pull his head in or that he need

536
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:42,430
to be more professional because he just ran the program his program that he came up with and he

537
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,109
went out and did it and i would see him do it again and i would see him do it again and i would see

538
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,109
him doing it i didn't have to check in i could just go you know acknowledge and say it looks

539
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:51,970
like it's all working for you mate and he was like yeah no i'm on top of it it's going great

540
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:58,369
so you know it's just a wonderful example of me not saying to him how about you just go out once

541
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:04,970
every month uh and avoid all the other times and knock off your your nights out at midnight and

542
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:10,910
get home i don't know if that would have achieved the same as him designing his own program yeah

543
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:14,109
what a great story he's gone on you know to be the greatest goal kicker in the history of the

544
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:19,750
west coast eagles and uh you know an incredible story and i love the fact that he felt comfortable

545
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:24,730
enough to go to his senior coach and say hey this is my behavior you clearly set up the conditions

546
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:29,490
in the first place washer that allowed that to be the case yeah well that's self-awareness that

547
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:34,990
he wasn't where he wanted to be as a young footballer and he had some awareness of what

548
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:42,710
the issue was is was a great sign of a self-driven young man anyway um you know if i had to find out

549
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,990
that he was up to those things

550
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:49,930
through whispers of others and then confront him uh it probably sends another message that he's not

551
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:56,950
quite as driven and motivated as what he was so yeah it was uh some players aren't as driven as

552
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:00,390
that and you do have to push them a little bit harder there's no doubt about that that's part

553
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:07,589
of the art of coaching that not it's not one size fits all you do have to be aware of uh you know

554
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:13,329
some guys need more pushing but if you can push them a bit harder to still come up with their

555
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:19,670
um you're going to get a better outcome and we're sure you know again um you know reacting to what

556
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:23,529
you say i mean it was an incredible era that you had and you created an incredible vision for the

557
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:29,750
west coast eagles in 2006 but it wasn't a group without its challenges in the end and they're

558
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:34,190
well publicized a lot of them particularly you know ben cousins's struggle it's great to see in

559
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:40,069
recent times it feels as though ben's potentially turned the corner do you look back on any of that

560
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:44,089
and and wish you could change anything what's your reflection when you look back on

561
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,490
a the brilliant success but be some of the challenges that came out of that time

562
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:54,910
yeah but if you could change anything and this is just from my own personal values i wouldn't want

563
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:59,690
any players using any illicit drugs at any time i know they're dangerous and they're not helpful

564
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:05,910
in society so look i would i would hope across not only my foot my footy club every club and

565
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:11,509
and across community that there was no access to those illicit drugs that are so damaging and

566
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:13,750
dangerous but you know that's obviously uh

567
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:19,109
a bit of a pipe dream but um you can only deal with what's in front of you and you know it has

568
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:24,529
been pulled apart and assessed what happened through that period all i can say is that it

569
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:31,849
was extremely challenging period to still do your job and prepare an afl club to train hard

570
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:38,950
train professionally prepare to be a great team and uh have over a period of time and obviously

571
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:43,470
things that came to light had to be dealt with and uh and as they did

572
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,109
we talked about the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the

573
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:49,109
some actions and people will say it should have been harder should have acted earlier they don't

574
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:54,670
really know the full background but other than to say it was uh it was a pretty tough time that uh

575
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:59,730
that we worked through but we had to make some big calls and and readdress the culture that had

576
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:06,049
crept in at west coast we did that over a two or three year period and when i finished up at west

577
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:14,109
coast in 2013 i have no doubt that adam simpson walked into a culture that was a culture that was

578
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:20,609
was ready to to go and and he acknowledged that he's had no issues in the culture there

579
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:25,750
while he's been there and that wasn't just because of his values it was what we left him with and i

580
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:31,349
know he personally thanked me a couple of months in around the attitude of the players and what he

581
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:36,109
was coaching he felt really comfortable with it so you know that that was a great learning curve

582
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:43,549
for me for sure it was uh as a young coach it was a massive issue and uh yeah i really applaud

583
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:44,109
you know

584
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:49,670
everyone at west coast at the time we made a lot of tough calls um but through the board and uh and

585
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:55,150
the management and then the coaching staff and the players buying to address that culture and turn it

586
00:32:55,150 --> 00:33:00,589
around it took some tough decisions and you know you can't just do it overnight and a lot of people

587
00:33:00,589 --> 00:33:06,289
say just take these actions and you'll fix the problem it is a bit tougher than that um and you

588
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:12,250
know in the end uh the culture i left at west coast was way better than the culture i walked

589
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,910
into as coach

590
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:20,309
in in 2002 i've got no doubt about that and along the way we won a premiership uh we had some massive

591
00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:26,470
challenges but you know the fact that uh the culture was really uh strong when i left i'm proud

592
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:30,849
of that again i've got the good to great in in mind isn't it what you leave behind and what happens

593
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:36,910
afterwards is uh is uh you know an incredible part of uh of any legacy and uh in every organization

594
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:41,470
it seems that's what happens after after your time is there and you think of the complexity

595
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:44,109
in society of dealing with illicit drugs and to think that you know you're not going to be able to

596
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:49,950
a risk-taking group of 800 afl players and not going to be subjected to the same challenges is

597
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:54,390
is is naive in the extreme isn't it and and australian football dealt with it in the same

598
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:59,529
way that um well probably better and probably uh with more integrity because it's such a complex

599
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:12,239
issue i wanted to change gear with you because i know that uh you have been part of uh of a

600
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,840
collaboration that uh i'm really passionate about you and a number of your peers from different

601
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,679
coaching backgrounds justin langer from the australian cricket team ben rutten who you've

602
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:24,659
handed the reins over to at essendon trent robinson who's got a great history of success

603
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:29,440
with the sydney roosters matt king his assistant don pike your old premiership teammate and coach

604
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,539
of the adelaide uh crows for an extended period of time into into a grand final and uh and my

605
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:38,579
great friend matt waterwitz can you tell me about that australian coaching symposium what it's meant

606
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:42,739
to you to be able to catch up regularly with with your peers and what you've got out of it

607
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:49,639
it's it's been awesome you know i i'm a big believer in um actually being able to share

608
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,760
real life

609
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:57,940
examples case studies ideas um with peers across other sports is so valuable so

610
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:04,639
yeah there's various ways you can do that but to have uh and covet help that in terms of

611
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:10,500
everyone getting more on board with zoom meetings like this meant that we're all around australia

612
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,639
and at times around the world but we could at at one point each fortnight catch up and

613
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:19,860
and share those ideas on an ongoing basis so we actually got to know

614
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:26,659
a lot about each other's backgrounds uh other challenges we'd face and and share those with

615
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:32,139
each other the the amount of value in that over and above just going and listening to you know

616
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:38,380
they could they're often highly respected sporting or business uh people been been very very

617
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:43,059
successful and they tell their story but just to be in the audience and listen to that you can

618
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:48,920
pick up little bits and little nuggets but they you know there was a like a nugget a nugget every

619
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,840
10 minutes in and out of the room and i think that's a really important thing to do and i think

620
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:57,059
discussions and our dialogue um around all aspects of of being a leader so it's just been

621
00:35:57,059 --> 00:36:02,980
unbelievably invaluable and the fact that we've done it ongoing fortnightly for you know over

622
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:08,739
what coming up 18 months you can imagine how much we've grown and learned together and these are all

623
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:14,800
aren't all fresh coaches a couple of benny rutton and matt king are young assistant coaches and

624
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,460
you know i think for them uh it's just been enormous but

625
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:26,599
they've been around for a long time we just learned so much and it's uh it's hard to um

626
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:32,659
i couldn't be more glowing about it obviously um it's just one of those opportunities that came

627
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:39,539
about and uh i don't think i could have learned any more in any other way without maybe going and

628
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:44,420
living overseas for 12 months and embedding yourself in a different environment and and

629
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,760
doing it day in day out the way that this has rolled on as it's just been amazing yeah

630
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:54,360
wish that i'd understand um that you guys have been incredibly open and shared and there's

631
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:59,619
obviously a lot of stories that are private uh to that particular group but matt and i love the

632
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:04,159
concept and we'd love to expand on this wish and a bit to get your thoughts around the term i've

633
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:08,539
got in my mind is almost like your own personal board of directors and to meet people at your

634
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:13,840
level that you can be vulnerable with you can share the the great uh moments but also the

635
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,760
challenges you've got in real time that to me that would be an invaluable thing for anyone

636
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:26,780
whatever the background you come from is that how you've sort of seen it is that you know you had

637
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:31,099
some relationships existing within there but there were some new ones as well is it almost like a

638
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:35,820
you you tune in and you've got this this support group that you perhaps didn't have before yeah

639
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:41,679
absolutely that's how it works yeah it's um you know i was lucky enough to spend a little bit of

640
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:47,500
time with rick charlesworth the great successful one of one of if not the most successful australian

641
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,840
coach you know going around um and i think that's a great thing to do and i think that's a great

642
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:56,659
um with all his success in in hockey um and pick his brains a little bit over over a period of time

643
00:37:56,659 --> 00:38:02,639
and there's so much learning in in those opportunities and as i said with rick it

644
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:07,480
might have been three two-hour meetings over a six-month period i've been able to do that

645
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:15,340
fortnightly for 18 months with these guys with a group of guys so um yeah to me that's the greatest

646
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:19,840
learning on the job learning is is probably the most powerful when you're in charge and you're

647
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:24,300
you make decisions and you can assess did that work or not what did i learn from that that's

648
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:30,000
probably where you do learn the most but sharing ideas with people in very similar positions facing

649
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,440
basically the same challenges just in a different environment whether it's another sport or a

650
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,679
corporate um there's there's so much value to share you just pick bits out and you think wow

651
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:47,739
there that will fit with where i was heading so well and will make what i was planning to do

652
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:49,380
even more powerful

653
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:54,039
just from um something that you know another experienced person has shared with you

654
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:59,719
i will give a quick plug if you are interested in forming your own uh group uh we'd be interested in

655
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:04,000
uh in supporting you with that go to a leader collective and register some interest and uh and

656
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,099
we'll get back to you if you want to experience what john worsefold uh is talking about now i've

657
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:11,840
got a handful of questions i want to get to wish a bit there's one someone like you you don't get

658
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,619
the success consistently without having some pretty strong habits and routines is there anything you

659
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:19,280
still do today i think you're 52 years of age

660
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:25,219
you look strong and healthy and fit and dedicated what do you do daily to look after yourself

661
00:39:25,219 --> 00:39:33,619
i exercise pretty much every day um usually an hour's exercise uh every day um first thing in

662
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:41,159
the morning i get up early and i just really enjoy it that's one and feel great after i've exercised

663
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:46,559
so i really do notice that if it's a day i haven't exercised i don't feel as good throughout the day

664
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:49,219
now that maybe just have my mental models my mental mental health problems but i'm just going to go with it and i'll see you next time

665
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:49,340
bye

666
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:49,360
bye

667
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,800
The gap there, I've got a jean that's just a bit loose,

668
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,099
but I just love it, you know.

669
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,599
So I get up, it might be head down to the beach and run for an hour

670
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,599
and have a swim or get on a spin bike for an hour or get in the gym

671
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:07,639
and push the weights around, do a little bit of aerobic work.

672
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,059
So, you know, I'm pretty religious about that.

673
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:12,739
There's a funny story.

674
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,539
Actually, my youngest daughter, she's 17 and she's just getting

675
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,559
into the gym age and she's going to the gym and she's getting

676
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:22,440
on the treadmill and her boyfriend said to her the other day,

677
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:26,039
I'm going to put a little bit of an incline on the treadmill

678
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:26,619
while you're running.

679
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,179
And she said, no, don't do that.

680
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:29,360
It's hard enough as it is.

681
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:32,880
And he said, she said, no, look, I just don't like running,

682
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,139
so don't make it any harder.

683
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,000
And he said, no one likes running.

684
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
And she looked at him and said, my dad does.

685
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:46,500
She told me that story and I said, Grace, I don't like running.

686
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:47,380
I love it.

687
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,239
So, yeah, look, that's my day.

688
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:55,460
You know, I try to plan my day out so I'm well prepared

689
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,780
for whatever's coming up.

690
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,440
I don't like surprises and I like to be organised.

691
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:04,619
So I pride myself on that and try and be present in anything

692
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:08,800
I'm taking part in so I don't get distracted by my mobile phone.

693
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:11,900
If I'm talking to people in a meeting, that's always a way.

694
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,159
That's put away.

695
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:16,519
So they're little rules I go by.

696
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:20,480
Be present, give people respect of listening to them

697
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,699
and showing them that you're there, not that you booked me

698
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:27,320
into this meeting and I have to be there,

699
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,159
but I'd prefer to be doing other things.

700
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,960
I can't help but think what a brave young man that is,

701
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:34,760
knocking on the Worsfold House door of his 17-year-old daughter,

702
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,440
which he's going to have some resilience, that young man, for sure.

703
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:40,460
I've got a 16-year-old daughter as well,

704
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:44,460
so I might need to ring you at some stage for some advice there.

705
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:46,360
So these are the handful of questions,

706
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,380
we feel a bit consistent around leadership and the dimensions

707
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,619
that make great leaders and we're hoping to sort of see

708
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,800
if there are some patterns with people like you and others

709
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,159
that we've been talking to, particularly on this podcast.

710
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,420
I want to start with self-leadership, Bush.

711
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,980
When I ask you that, what does that mean to you?

712
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,800
Well, it just means being absolutely clear on who you are,

713
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,820
what your values are.

714
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:13,219
Our personal values are, I use the term mental models because our values

715
00:42:13,219 --> 00:42:15,300
but also the beliefs we live by.

716
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,699
They, according to where we grew up, they impact us so much.

717
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,219
Just being clear on what they are, being clear that what you believe

718
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:26,000
is not necessarily universal.

719
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:29,980
Not everyone will have the same view as you, so I just, I'm always,

720
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,719
I take that into account whenever I'm talking to someone,

721
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,559
that I might think I've got the best idea and this is going

722
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:38,360
to save the world, but you'll get some percentage of people

723
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,099
that look at you like you're just off the planet.

724
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:42,400
That's not going to work.

725
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,219
So I don't get frustrated if I get feedback.

726
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,920
Oh, no, that didn't resonate with that person or some people have suggested

727
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,480
it wasn't really valuable to them.

728
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:52,199
I go, that's fine.

729
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:56,820
They'll find their way in the world around what they value,

730
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,940
but it's really inauthentic to that.

731
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:05,599
I just think I've been challenged at times to do things that have maybe

732
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,380
challenged me on who I am, maybe to be a harder coach.

733
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:10,739
We want to coach this.

734
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:13,199
You need to really give it to the players.

735
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:15,000
They need to know that they let us down today.

736
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,039
And, you know, I found that that wasn't who I was.

737
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,980
So I wasn't going to do that even if that's what certain people thought

738
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,380
was going to be good.

739
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:27,820
And basically my belief was that it was going to be good for them

740
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,760
to hear a coach scream and rant and maybe punch the whiteboard.

741
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:34,239
I don't believe it was necessarily going to be good for my playing group

742
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:36,199
and it certainly wasn't going to be good for me.

743
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,300
So I would not do that.

744
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,539
I would do it my way.

745
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:42,599
And, you know, I like the fact that in my early days coaching,

746
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,639
there were a few players that were questioned by,

747
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:50,039
media around, does Woosha just scare you with when he really gets angry?

748
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:53,940
And they said, he never yells at us, but we look at his eyes and we're scared.

749
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:57,639
So, you know, that they knew when I was serious and when we needed

750
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:01,199
to knuckle down and improve without me screaming at them.

751
00:44:01,659 --> 00:44:04,199
Yeah, I've heard you say mental models a couple of times now, Woosha.

752
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,039
Have you got that written down?

753
00:44:06,139 --> 00:44:10,159
Have you got your values, your personal values or your mental model?

754
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,239
Or is it something that just intrinsically is you?

755
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:13,960
No, it is who we are.

756
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,139
You know, that's...

757
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,920
They're embedded in us over our lifetime.

758
00:44:18,139 --> 00:44:21,320
And they change or you pick up some new mental models along the way.

759
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,900
But generally, they're pretty strongly embedded in us

760
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,739
just through our life experiences.

761
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,099
But what I've learned over time is, you know,

762
00:44:30,139 --> 00:44:35,619
when we take over as a leader of maybe a business or a sporting team,

763
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:38,719
we say we're going to have a set of core values we're going to live by.

764
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:41,340
And you put a lot of work into getting everyone aligned to them.

765
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,460
We very rarely spend any time reflecting

766
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,400
on what our personal values are.

767
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:50,059
We just sort of know they're there unconsciously.

768
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:52,579
You know, we make decisions around what we value.

769
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,679
Do you rush and go through a red light or do you pull up and stop?

770
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:00,659
That's a value of mental model that you have.

771
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,900
If you're the person who's, no, I can make it through here

772
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,239
and it's a little bit red, but that's okay.

773
00:45:06,699 --> 00:45:09,599
Or you're someone that will not go through the red light at all.

774
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:13,059
You know, everyone will have a slightly different take on it.

775
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:14,019
And that's just across...

776
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,940
Every situation we're in every day, the way we parent,

777
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:20,539
the way we lead, the way we treat ourselves.

778
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,139
You know, most of my training sessions, I do it on my own.

779
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:24,519
I don't need to go...

780
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:25,719
I don't need to know...

781
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:28,380
If I don't go, I'm letting someone down because I'm meeting my mate

782
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,960
and I've said I'll go for a run with him.

783
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,699
You know, I don't miss a session because I want to do it for myself.

784
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,500
You know, it's just a strong mental model that I have.

785
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:42,219
So, yeah, I think if people can just spend some time in their situation,

786
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,320
so as a leader of an organisation,

787
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,760
or of a club, to think about what are my values

788
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,820
and how do they line up with what I want my corporation's values to be

789
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,960
or what they currently are.

790
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,820
Are they strongly aligned and how do they fit together?

791
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,699
It really helps.

792
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:59,639
Yeah, it's a pretty powerful, simple thing to do, isn't it?

793
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:00,440
What do I stand for?

794
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:00,960
What are my values?

795
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:03,739
What are the things I'm not really negotiable on?

796
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,179
And clearly that comes out in you.

797
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,300
You know, we understand the impact you had in the succession plan

798
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:13,900
with Ben Rutten and I think a fair sense of how you positively impact

799
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:14,800
the environment.

800
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:17,159
Have you consciously thought about that,

801
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:18,780
the impact you have on others in your environment?

802
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:22,460
I've always felt it's a strong responsibility I have.

803
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:25,019
And, you know, some of the things that resonated most

804
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:29,960
throughout my whole time coaching have been assistant coaches

805
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:34,179
that have really thanked me for what I've learnt from being in a program

806
00:46:34,179 --> 00:46:35,420
that I've been a leader of.

807
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:37,679
So, you know, that means a lot.

808
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:44,139
And players that – Matt Pritis, when I retired from coaching West Coast,

809
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:44,300
I think he was a great coach.

810
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,659
I think that year Matt Pritis had won the West Coast Best and Fairest

811
00:46:47,659 --> 00:46:50,000
and in his speech he thanked me.

812
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:54,460
But he thanked me for teaching him some values that he was going

813
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:55,420
to pass on to his family.

814
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:01,260
That's a pretty strong, powerful thing to have someone say to you,

815
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,719
that not just thanks for giving me a game and let me play in the guts

816
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:06,380
and I've won the Best and Fairest award.

817
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:11,360
He thanked me for giving him some tools and values that, you know,

818
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,019
hopefully we're going to shape his kids.

819
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,519
Values growing up.

820
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,340
You know, that meant more to me than anything.

821
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,840
So, you know, there's been a couple of examples where players have shared

822
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,320
that publicly but also personally with me which, you know,

823
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,639
that is really having an impact.

824
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:31,360
And, you know, I've said it several times in the past.

825
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,760
We're there to win games as a coach and be part of a club that's successful

826
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,760
and winning premierships.

827
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:39,260
But there's many, many other measures of success within that

828
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,460
that mean a lot to a lot of people as well.

829
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,119
One of the dimensions we talk about is,

830
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,300
is vision and how you create and share it.

831
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,579
I've always felt watching you from the outside that teams you're involved

832
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:51,119
with always had a pretty clear vision.

833
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,219
How did you go about it?

834
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:56,639
Yeah, look, generally they were developed together so that the players,

835
00:47:57,179 --> 00:48:02,000
everyone who worked really tightly within the football department had equal say

836
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,139
in developing the vision.

837
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:06,039
So it was around we're all there to win a premiership.

838
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,420
What do we need to be doing that will help us win a premiership, you know,

839
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,280
in terms of whether it's defensive game plan and attacking game plan,

840
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:19,139
being the most skilful team, being the strongest, most physical team,

841
00:48:19,139 --> 00:48:25,139
whatever it is, let's agree to it and then we will build the systems to get

842
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:26,179
at to achieve that.

843
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:29,440
At West Coast, they wanted to be the hardest running team in the comp.

844
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,260
The players agreed to it.

845
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,199
The coaches said that's what we'll do.

846
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:38,579
The weights coach had to develop his program around helping them be great

847
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:42,480
runners, not just big heavy guys that can win one-on-one contests

848
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,260
because that wasn't going to be the way we went about it.

849
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,739
The running program that those West Coast boys went through,

850
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:51,360
through 2004, 5, 6, 7, was gruelling.

851
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:56,699
You know, it was around building them into running machines and, you know,

852
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,900
other clubs talked about it.

853
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,960
They couldn't believe that, you know, don't think you've ever got West Coast beat.

854
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:06,599
They will keep running through the end of the game and we finished a lot

855
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:08,059
of games unbelievably strong.

856
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,320
So, yeah, I did the same with Essendon in my first year there.

857
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,119
We were building a...

858
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,840
We were building a vision for the next three years and then all the

859
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,760
suspensions happened.

860
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:18,900
So, we had to change it.

861
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:20,099
It wasn't going to hold up.

862
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:27,539
So, maybe in November 2015, we designed a shared vision.

863
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,360
Then we lost 12 players to suspension.

864
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:35,000
So, in February the next year, we did it with a new group once we'd

865
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,920
recruited in the replacement players.

866
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:39,380
We did a short-term one-year vision.

867
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,039
We're only going to be together one year, boys.

868
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:44,099
This is, you know, a really drastic situation.

869
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:44,460
We're in.

870
00:49:45,019 --> 00:49:46,539
What do we want to get out of the year?

871
00:49:46,739 --> 00:49:48,860
And we all got very clear on that.

872
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:54,380
And, you know, everything we did that year was around living up to that vision,

873
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:59,639
which was, you know, in a nutshell, getting better, improving individually

874
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:03,559
and as a team and having fun, which that was a challenging part because

875
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:06,420
people were saying we wouldn't win a game for the year.

876
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,860
How do you have fun if you're going to lose every week?

877
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,320
But we did it.

878
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:14,000
Players said they really enjoyed that year and hopefully they believe they're in a good place.

879
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,480
They improved and got better as well.

880
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:20,539
Yeah, I've got the image of your West Coast teams being on the field and coming off.

881
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:24,019
And our midfielders saying you just can't run with this group.

882
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:26,739
You know, they certainly bought into that.

883
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:33,340
It was, you know, a powerful running group, almost the likes of which we hadn't seen before.

884
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,400
So, clearly, that was bought into and worked from an outside point of view as well.

885
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,360
You strike me as someone incredibly curious, and we see that as a real important dimension of leadership

886
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,400
and a constant.

887
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,960
As a constant learner, that's come out in the chat already.

888
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,980
How do you think about that curiosity and learning and improvement?

889
00:50:49,739 --> 00:50:56,559
I just think, yeah, the amount of time you have to put into learning to find the bits that really resonate with you,

890
00:50:56,659 --> 00:51:00,119
it's a big commitment to make.

891
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:08,000
So, you know, I read a lot in the hope of learning small bits that I'll be able to use for when I'm in certain situations

892
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:13,380
or even ongoing or that challenge my own mental models or that reinforce.

893
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,440
Some of the mental models I have.

894
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:21,519
So, I don't always look for things that just reinforce me and tell me, oh, yeah, you're doing a good job

895
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:23,320
because this guy did it that way.

896
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,619
I do challenge myself as well.

897
00:51:26,139 --> 00:51:31,460
And that's where, you know, having the Australian Coach Symposium and bouncing ideas off other guys,

898
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:35,420
you can go, well, I would never have done it that way, but it worked for you in that situation.

899
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:42,900
That's now something that I've got up my sleeve that I can read the play and go to if I'm in a similar situation.

900
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:43,400
So.

901
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,599
Yeah, just learning, reading, listening to people non-stop.

902
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:53,739
And they don't have to always be the experts in industry.

903
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:55,920
They don't have to be the guys at the top of the game.

904
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,739
Sometimes talking to a young, fresh coach, even players,

905
00:52:01,099 --> 00:52:04,320
you can pick up some little nuggets from them about what's driven them.

906
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:11,219
I mean, I love talking to Zach Merritt, who's as driven a young man, young footballer as you would see.

907
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:13,900
Strong goals, strong focus on what he wants.

908
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:21,219
But, you know, I learned talking to him, some little nuggets around how he goes.

909
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,880
And when he would question me, why are we doing it that way?

910
00:52:24,219 --> 00:52:25,480
Well, that's an awesome question.

911
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,340
You know, I love the way you go about that.

912
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,500
So always learning in everything you do.

913
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,199
People are always sharing nuggets with you when you're talking to them.

914
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,219
So be open to it.

915
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,639
Sounds like you are a consistent, passionate reader.

916
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,300
What's your go-to?

917
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:42,940
What sort of books can you recommend?

918
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,900
Can you recommend a book?

919
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,119
Or two that you value?

920
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,420
Oh, look, I've read so many books over the time.

921
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:55,440
Going way back, Rod McQueen, former, you know, Rugby Union coach of Australia.

922
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:57,179
Can't remember what it was called.

923
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:00,300
It was like from the boardroom to the field, something like that.

924
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,639
I really enjoyed that as a young coach.

925
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:07,539
I think that may have even been before I got my first coaching job.

926
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,840
But tied in his experience from boardroom stuff to coaching as well.

927
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,159
But Rick Charlesworth's first book, you know, when you highlight pages

928
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:21,900
or you stick little sticky notes in to say there's a little nugget in there,

929
00:53:22,019 --> 00:53:26,699
like his book has the most pages marked out of any book I've ever read.

930
00:53:27,219 --> 00:53:32,940
We've got the luxury of scanning for articles in magazines,

931
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:35,619
sporting magazines, business magazines these days.

932
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:41,619
So I scan and have little notifications coming up and I just have a look

933
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:43,800
and I say, wow, that's an article.

934
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,760
That I'd like to read because of the heading of it.

935
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:52,239
So I'll have a read from business magazines to sporting journals.

936
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:55,059
So that's what I do a lot of my research on.

937
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,719
I was just looking up, I think Rod McQueen, One Step Ahead.

938
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:58,739
Yeah.

939
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:00,719
Might be the one that you're referring to.

940
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,539
So I'll put that on the list for sure.

941
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:07,840
Communicating with clarity, Woosha, what's your thoughts on that?

942
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,179
Clarity comes from knowing, being authentic.

943
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:13,119
That's the first part.

944
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,820
If you're trying to sell a message that you don't really believe in,

945
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,739
people are going to pick up on it.

946
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:18,880
So forget about clarity.

947
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:23,860
People aren't going to embrace an idea you're sharing with them, a message,

948
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,840
if they feel as though you're only half invested in it and they can tell,

949
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,300
you know, that's my experience.

950
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:34,199
You can call it a bullshit detector, whatever you want to call it,

951
00:54:34,219 --> 00:54:36,659
but especially elite athletes, they pick up on it.

952
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,480
A coach is not really selling this like he's 100% invested.

953
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,079
So be authentic, believe in what you're selling,

954
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:47,300
what your message is and the clarity, but also, you know,

955
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:53,320
understanding that no matter how clear and articulate we believe we are

956
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:57,539
as selling a message, if you're talking to 40 people,

957
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:00,400
there's going to be 40 different meanings made out of that message.

958
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,659
And if you understand that, that helps you.

959
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,119
You know, they may pick up the general idea of the meaning,

960
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:10,599
but everyone will latch on to something different and they'll twist it

961
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,380
in their mind about what it means to them.

962
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,099
You know?

963
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:16,159
If you're talking about being a very good defensive team

964
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:20,500
and you're selling it to an AFL team, the forwards are thinking,

965
00:55:20,679 --> 00:55:23,219
oh, yeah, we're going to play a man down every week because he's going

966
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:24,619
to put a spare man behind the ball.

967
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:29,360
So they're already going, oh, my career here at this club is going

968
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,659
to be harder because I'm going to be outnumbered.

969
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:34,000
And then I'll listen to the rest of the message, you know?

970
00:55:34,179 --> 00:55:35,940
So they'll jump to those conclusions.

971
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:39,460
The back line, they might be thinking, awesome, defence is number one,

972
00:55:39,699 --> 00:55:42,739
give us a spare man every time, we're going to rack up positions

973
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:42,940
and...

974
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:45,260
And smash the oppo and it'll be good for us.

975
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:49,880
But, you know, when you're sending that message out to a different crew

976
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,260
of people, they're all going to start twisting it around according

977
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:54,880
to how it's going to impact them.

978
00:55:55,639 --> 00:55:59,699
So make your messages as short as possible and then ask

979
00:55:59,699 --> 00:56:03,860
for understanding of the messages to a lot of individuals as opposed,

980
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:06,440
you know, don't just ask the whole group because the confident guy

981
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,460
will put his hand up and tell you what he understood by it

982
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:11,960
and you'll say, yeah, that was pretty close, thanks.

983
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:16,239
You need to get around to a number of individuals and say,

984
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,219
what did you, what was your, you know, the meaning you made

985
00:56:19,219 --> 00:56:21,699
out of that meeting, what did you understand by it?

986
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:24,500
And you'll get a better idea of how clear you were.

987
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:27,460
Yeah, great, great insight on that front.

988
00:56:27,619 --> 00:56:30,760
The word collaboration as a dimension of leadership,

989
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,619
we're passionate about.

990
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:33,639
You've already spoken about the Australian Coaching Symposium,

991
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:37,679
a fortnightly collaboration you do with a handful of your peers.

992
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,380
Have you always been a collaborator?

993
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:41,320
Because I sense that wasn't the world.

994
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,119
I played under or you played under.

995
00:56:43,219 --> 00:56:44,900
It was very much the old hierarchy.

996
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,920
Were you always sort of geared towards collaboration?

997
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:50,019
Yeah, I think I have been, yeah.

998
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:55,659
I definitely know that generally you're surrounded by people

999
00:56:55,659 --> 00:57:00,199
with a lot of knowledge and a lot of skills and often they are,

1000
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,500
there's different levels of knowledge than what you have.

1001
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,880
So to think that you know everything and the most about everything,

1002
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,460
even if it's in one specific thing like the way I want my AFL team to play,

1003
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:11,260
you know,

1004
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:11,980
you're kidding yourself.

1005
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:13,099
So, yeah,

1006
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:18,280
I've always wanted to have collaborative sessions where people feel safe to

1007
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,280
share their ideas and challenge things and to bring up new,

1008
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:21,820
you know,

1009
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,920
innovative ideas and I've been open to them.

1010
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:27,699
And if I've been more than comfortable to say to a coach,

1011
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:28,699
that's a great idea,

1012
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,360
you design the plan now,

1013
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:33,300
how we're going to implement it and you run it when we go out and train

1014
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,800
and let's go forward.

1015
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,239
And, you know,

1016
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,780
they walk out of the room, you know,

1017
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,920
eight foot tall because, geez,

1018
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,239
I just threw an idea up there.

1019
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,599
I've only been here for two years and the coach has given me ownership of

1020
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:45,679
bringing this to life.

1021
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:49,820
So you want to see the research they then do into it and the planning they do

1022
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:53,239
to make it successful when it's like theirs to run with.

1023
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:53,920
So, yeah,

1024
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:57,460
I've always been open to say let's share our ideas safely,

1025
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,679
challenge each other.

1026
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,219
And, but, you know,

1027
00:58:00,219 --> 00:58:02,440
when the decision's made, we're all in it together.

1028
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,079
Yeah.

1029
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,400
Incredible life of leadership that you've had,

1030
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:07,800
which I've enjoyed every minute of it.

1031
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:09,860
I've asked this question of everyone.

1032
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,260
I'm fascinated with,

1033
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,500
you because I've got no idea which way you're going to go with this,

1034
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,739
but who is the greatest leader in your life?

1035
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,119
Oh, gee, I don't know.

1036
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:21,500
That's a very tough one.

1037
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:26,300
I reckon there's a combination of my immediate family,

1038
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,460
my kids and my wife.

1039
00:58:28,139 --> 00:58:32,280
They show great leadership in holding me accountable to who I am.

1040
00:58:32,699 --> 00:58:37,980
You know, they know sometimes I'll go out of my way to maybe do the right

1041
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:41,219
thing by people as opposed to maybe what's right for,

1042
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:41,760
for me.

1043
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,960
And they challenge me on it.

1044
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:45,340
And you know what, when they do,

1045
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:48,179
it makes me sit up and take notice.

1046
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,179
I love the fact that, you know,

1047
00:58:50,219 --> 00:58:55,119
within your family environment to have a 17 year old girl tell their dad

1048
00:58:55,119 --> 00:59:01,619
that what he did there doesn't really fit with our values is pretty

1049
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:02,059
powerful.

1050
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,380
And I love that fact, but.

1051
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,400
Amazing.

1052
00:59:05,739 --> 00:59:05,900
Yeah.

1053
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,119
Look,

1054
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:10,079
I've had some wonderful leaders that I've been involved with over a long

1055
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:10,639
period of time.

1056
00:59:10,739 --> 00:59:11,199
Mick Malthouse,

1057
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:14,780
as my coach for 10 years was the longest tenure.

1058
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:19,139
I learned a massive amount from the way Mick went about it,

1059
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:19,760
setting up.

1060
00:59:20,179 --> 00:59:24,800
Mick had an unbelievably clear vision to be the best defensive team in the,

1061
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,599
in the AFL.

1062
00:59:25,739 --> 00:59:28,900
And he got us all to buy into that across the board.

1063
00:59:29,019 --> 00:59:33,000
Peter Matera wanted to help us be the best defensive team in the competition.

1064
00:59:33,539 --> 00:59:37,860
People may not realize that as attacking and as brilliant as he was.

1065
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:38,280
Yeah.

1066
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:39,820
We were all committed to it.

1067
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:40,860
So Mick,

1068
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:45,320
achieving that and achieving it for a number of years to help us win two

1069
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,039
premierships.

1070
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:47,000
You know,

1071
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:51,400
it certainly made it clear to me that having one person having a clear vision,

1072
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,559
but getting everyone to buy into it is,

1073
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:55,039
is the key thing.

1074
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,179
Thanks again,

1075
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:56,579
Wish.

1076
00:59:56,579 --> 00:59:58,400
I've got many more questions.

1077
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,980
Maybe love to do it again sometime.

1078
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:01,719
It's a,

1079
01:00:01,719 --> 01:00:03,800
it's a life full of great values,

1080
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:04,860
great discipline.

1081
01:00:06,139 --> 01:00:09,139
Certainly a fair amount of fear that you imparted on a few over the journey

1082
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:09,480
as well.

1083
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,059
Wish of it.

1084
01:00:10,059 --> 01:00:12,300
You're calm and calculated and,

1085
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,099
and brilliant in how you share it.

1086
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:15,760
It's been a great pleasure to chat to you.

1087
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:16,139
Thanks for,

1088
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,039
thanks for your time and always great to see you.

1089
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:18,719
Thanks,

Darcy.

1091

Very,

mate.
