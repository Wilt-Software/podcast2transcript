1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:07,980
Well, what a great privilege it was to catch up with Jordan Love, the quarterback for the

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,919
Green Bay Packers on the back of his extraordinary first up season in the chair as a Green Bay

3
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,359
quarterback and one of the most exciting athletes for me in US sport at the moment.

4
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,800
Found him to be an incredibly humble, respectful and brilliant young man.

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,539
You hear how Jordan's dream collaboration would be with his hero LeBron James.

6
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:34,020
Side note, he's wearing a Kobe Bryant t-shirt in this interview at the time and he references

7
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,920
that he's never met LeBron James, but I'm sure that is only a matter of time and you'd

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,960
love to see those two brilliant athletes spending some time together in the future.

9
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:48,560
He talks openly about the balance of taking over from Aaron Rodgers, the legendary future

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,679
Hall of Famer at Green Bay, the lessons that he learned from being his understudy and that

11
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,520
the two of them still have a great friendship and stay in touch to this day, even though

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,880
they're on opposing teams.

13
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:04,599
He also talks a lot about leaning on his more experienced teammates and empowering them

14
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,060
to be great leaders is a real part of the way he leads his team.

15
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,739
Jordan also shares a tragic story of the passing of his father, a respected police sergeant,

16
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,140
and how his dad is still the person who inspires him the most to this day.

17
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,799
We are really privileged and grateful to have Jordan Love as part of our Leader Connect

18
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,379
program.

19
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:28,500
Jordan's in a world captains group with Martin Odegaard from Arsenal, Pat Cummings,

20
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:32,400
from the Australian cricket team, Joe Ingle, Brianna Stewart, some of the great leaders

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,480
in sport around the globe get together in these forums.

22
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,560
We call a Leader Connect.

23
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:39,060
You don't have to be Jordan Love to be part of a Leader Connect.

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,900
We'd love to collaborate with you.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,379
Head to elitercollective.com.

26
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:46,900
Huge thanks to the team at Tempur, Australia and New Zealand for their great support of

27
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,599
bringing conversations like this to the table.

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,340
It's a mattress like no other.

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,200
Sleep is such an important success clue we see from the leaders that we speak to.

30
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,560
So huge thanks as always to the team at Tempur.

31
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,980
Jordan Love was picked 26 in the 2020 NFL Draft to the Green Bay Packers.

32
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,500
The Green Bay Packers have a unique place in American sporting landscape with their

33
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,580
fans known as some of the most passionate in world sport.

34
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:19,599
Jordan Love at just 25 years of age has just completed a remarkable first season as the

35
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,719
starting quarterback, throwing 37 touchdown passes and leading his team to a playoff win

36
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,219
over the Dallas Cowboys.

37
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,580
Jordan Love is without question one of the most exciting and talented athletes in US

38
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,319
sports today.

39
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,800
Congratulations on an incredible season, Jordan.

40
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,479
It's great to see you.

41
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,219
Thank you.

42
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
Thank you for that intro as well.

43
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,560
It's great to be here with you.

44
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,300
You've had a bit of time to reflect postseason.

45
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,280
You must be really proud of your first year in the main chair.

46
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:46,780
Yes, I am.

47
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:53,039
Definitely had a good amount of time to reflect after the season just on how it went throughout

48
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,180
the course of the season.

49
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,740
Once you're in the season, you get so wrapped up in week to week and it's harder to look

50
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,240
at the whole.

51
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,759
So just being able to reflect on that and it was definitely a very fun season.

52
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,219
Obviously, my first year starting, a lot of lessons learned and a lot of things to improve

53
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:16,000
on going forward, but it was definitely a very fun season.

54
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,139
So the quarterback role in American football to me is just about the most high pressure

55
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:21,479
role in world sport.

56
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,740
You've got 140 kilos, 300 pound defensive lineman trying to kill you effectively every

57
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,460
time you've got ball in hand.

58
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,419
And you've got this incredibly calm.

59
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,080
You've got some relaxed demeanor in those moments.

60
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,659
How do you handle that sort of pressure?

61
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,460
I believe that it's part of the territory.

62
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,819
It's part of what I signed up for.

63
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,879
I've been playing football for so many years, almost my whole life.

64
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,120
I started playing tackle in fifth grade.

65
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,520
So it's something that it definitely takes time getting used to, but my comfort level

66
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:01,419
has grown so much over the years and that comes with practice and just getting banged

67
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:02,419
on and all the reps.

68
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:05,539
But obviously, yes, it is a very stressful position playing quarterback.

69
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:11,439
Like you said, 300 pound guys all trying to come at you and tackle you and get the ball

70
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,339
in your hands while you're trying to make all these decisions so quickly and put the

71
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:22,259
ball right where you need to and be able to read the field of what the DBs and linebacker

72
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:23,699
and the whole defense is doing.

73
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,920
So it is a very stressful position.

74
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,519
But at the same time, you know, it's one of those things that that's just what I do and

75
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:33,959
that's what I've been doing for so long that you just, it's second nature almost and you

76
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,079
get comfortable, like I said, over the years doing things.

77
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,060
You look comfortable in everything you do.

78
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,939
And I want to reference the sort of Packers history, the two quarterbacks prior to you

79
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:47,620
at Green Bay are all-time greats of the game.

80
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,759
Bet Favre is a Super Bowl winning three-time MVP, he's a Hall of Famer.

81
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,120
And Aaron Rodgers, who you replaced, also a Super Bowl winner, a four-time MVP.

82
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,459
I mean, do you feel that level of expectations from Packer fans that Jordan loves?

83
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,540
Steps up and they're used to a lot of success?

84
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:03,819
Definitely.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,680
Especially from the fan base, you know, Packer fans.

86
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,259
I see it all the time.

87
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,199
People are saying we've been spoiled with really, really high-level quarterback play

88
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,779
over the years with Brett, obviously with Aaron.

89
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,079
So, you know, being able to be the next quarterback after Aaron is definitely a blessing,

90
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,899
something I'm very grateful for.

91
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:30,040
But there's definitely an added level of pressure that comes with it, just knowing,

92
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:35,639
who's been there before you and how much success they've had and just the level of play

93
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,300
they've played at.

94
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:41,620
So it's pressure, but it's also, you know, I've been able to sit behind Aaron for three

95
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:47,819
years and learn so much and see how he handles his business and how he's able to play so

96
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:48,180
well.

97
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:51,199
And obviously, he was able to learn from Brett.

98
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,220
So it's a lot of history and developing those quarterbacks and lessons, I feel like, that

99
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,980
have been passed down to, you know, help put me in the best position possible.

100
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:06,500
But there's definitely a certain level that you want to be able to play at to be, you

101
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,120
know, considered a Packer quarterback and then fall in line of those great guys right

102
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,339
there.

103
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,540
And Jordan, you mentioned sitting for three years behind Aaron Rodgers.

104
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,160
It's a unique place, isn't it?

105
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,259
Because he's your teammate.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,740
I'm assuming you have a friendship, but he's also your rival.

107
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,800
And for you to succeed, you really want to take Aaron Rodgers' spot on the team.

108
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,899
Tell us about your friendship with Aaron.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,620
How did that relationship play out?

110
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:28,620
Yeah, it's great.

111
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:28,660
It's great.

112
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,620
You know, when I...

113
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,639
When I first got drafted there, knowing Aaron Rodgers was the quarterback of the Packers

114
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,180
and has been for so long, and he's a legend.

115
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,459
So, you know, I knew right away that I was not going to be starting, and I knew I wasn't

116
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:44,259
going to be taking Aaron Rodgers' job, you know?

117
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,300
That's just a given.

118
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,000
You know, you've watched this guy play my whole life.

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,199
So, it was an honor, honestly, just to be able to be in the room with him and learn.

120
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,139
But it's one of those things I'm like, yeah.

121
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:59,160
And then you watch him in practice every day, you're like, yeah, I'm not bad to be starting

122
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,879
over this guy.

123
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,300
But at the same time, it's all motivation.

124
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,339
You know, it motivates me just to be able to see someone play at such a high level and

125
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:11,420
do the things he's able to do on a daily basis.

126
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,319
It motivated me to get better and to try new things and to, you know, improve my game and

127
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:19,019
try some of the things that I saw him doing.

128
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,199
But yeah, I mean, over the three years, we definitely developed a pretty good relationship.

129
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,240
And, you know, he was a guy that I was able to ask so many questions to and just see him

130
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,459
work and, you know, be able to pick his brain.

131
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,439
Same room as him was awesome.

132
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,120
It's something I'm very grateful for.

133
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:37,839
And, you know, even going into this year, me taking over this role, he's still been able

134
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,100
to keep in contact with me.

135
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,879
So, that's been very cool and something I'll definitely, you know, be grateful for for

136
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:49,879
my whole life and just embrace the opportunity to be around him and be his backup was special.

137
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,060
And he's been in touch, Jordan.

138
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,399
He's happy to still communicate.

139
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,800
He's obviously playing at a rival team, but you still stay in touch?

140
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,800
Yes, we do.

141
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,959
You know, we talk to each other throughout the year.

142
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:03,360
Throughout the course of the season, which is something that was, you know, pretty special

143
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,160
and pretty cool for me just to be able to, you know, hear from him and, you know, before

144
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,120
a game, after a game, have him give me some input and just some cool messages.

145
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,000
And then, you know, I was able to reach out to him throughout the season, too.

146
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,300
Obviously, he dealt with his injury first game of the season, which took him out for

147
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,199
the whole season, which was very tough.

148
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:26,019
But, yeah, I was able to reach out and just try and, you know, say I'm here for him and

149
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,079
that sort of thing.

150
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,860
But, yeah, it was cool to have that relationship, you know?

151
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:35,220
Jordan, we've been really privileged to have you join our Leader Connect community

152
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:40,139
where we love facilitating these groups of five or six people around the globe.

153
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:44,019
It was a business started with one of my oldest friends, a guy called Matt Wadowicz, who hosts

154
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:45,419
the group that you're in.

155
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,440
And can I share some of the group, some of the great legends of sport around the globe?

156
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,200
Martin Odegaard's the captain of the Arsenal team, doing great things.

157
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,580
Pat Cummings is a legend of Australian cricket and the captain.

158
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:59,639
Brianna Stewart is the captain of the U.S. basketball team.

159
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,740
Arguably the best player in U.S. basketball on the female side.

160
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:08,440
Joe Ingalls is a legend of Australian basketball and captain of the Australian basketball team

161
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:08,779
as well.

162
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,120
And Jordan Love, can you tell us about spending some time reflecting with these guys?

163
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:15,480
You get together on a monthly basis.

164
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,340
What's that meant to you?

165
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,559
Yeah, that's been awesome.

166
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,960
You know, that was something that, you know, I was approached by my head coach last off

167
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,820
season because he was a part of a group with some coaches.

168
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:29,539
And, you know, something that he said.

169
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,679
It helped him a lot.

170
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,759
And he thought it was pretty cool.

171
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,840
You know, he just put on my ear that that would be something that I should be interested

172
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,799
in doing and see what it's all about and was able to talk to Matt.

173
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,899
And, yeah, I got hooked up with that.

174
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,960
And honestly, coming into it, didn't know what to expect.

175
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:45,419
Didn't know how it would go.

176
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,480
You know, I didn't know what these conversations would be like, how it would be bringing people

177
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,340
from other sports.

178
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,399
And then obviously we started putting the group together and I was hearing some of the

179
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,940
names and just being able to get together with some of the best athletes in the world

180
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,480
in different sports.

181
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:04,120
It was pretty cool because, you know, in our world of football, I think we can get

182
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,519
so wrapped up in having different mentors that have played the same sport as us.

183
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,519
And, you know, you don't get to do a whole lot of talking to people in other sports,

184
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,039
whether unless it's, you know, training in the offseason, doing things like that.

185
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,820
So I think it was really cool.

186
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,399
And I was able to learn a lot about these guys and, you know, a little bit about their

187
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,980
personality, being in the classes with them and just share, you know, share inside and

188
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,080
techniques we use and things we might be struggling with.

189
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,299
And.

190
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:35,299
And I think it was really cool for me just to be able to see the personality of, you

191
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:37,220
know, these different leaders in different sports.

192
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:43,059
And, you know, I think throughout it, it gave me a lot of confidence in myself and definitely

193
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,259
improved my leadership skills.

194
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:46,500
So it was something I'm very grateful for.

195
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,679
And I thought it was very cool.

196
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,639
Jordan, we see athletes in different spaces.

197
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,320
As you said, cricket's a pretty foreign game to most people in the US, but they're dealing

198
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,440
with a billion fans in India and pressure at the same level.

199
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,899
And, you know, if you're the captain of Arsenal, there's an expectation you succeed and, and

200
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,600
Brandon Stewart's carving an amazing path.

201
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,639
Have you found there's been little sort of similarities in the way you guys have to deal

202
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,399
with certain things?

203
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,899
Can you give an example of something maybe you've applied to, to your world?

204
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,279
There were so many similarities that I thought that was the coolest part because, you know,

205
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,600
you, you hear about different sports and things like that.

206
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:25,019
And obviously just the teams are structured in different ways and different sports and

207
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:25,899
football.

208
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:28,840
I think, you know, we have the, one of the bigger teams.

209
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,440
Compared to these other sports, but yeah, like you said, like I didn't know about a lot about

210
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,360
cricket and then talking to these guys and hearing how many fans are, they have like in that

211
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,240
following and like you said, how much pressure they have.

212
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,059
And that's where it really, you know, all correlates is we're all playing these high level

213
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,399
sports where, you know, you got to, it's all performance based.

214
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,399
You have to show up every day.

215
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,059
You know, we're all professional athletes and you've got to be your best every day.

216
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,519
And you're getting evaluated on your performance.

217
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,360
Like we.

218
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,519
Talk about in these courses is another added step of that leadership level and, you know,

219
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,360
trying to be the best for your teammates and, you know, lead your team and build these

220
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,740
cultures and things like that.

221
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,779
But there were so many similarities that we're able to talk about and see in terms of just

222
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:18,980
talking to your teammates, you know, the struggles that teams go through and trying to

223
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,100
bring your whole team together as a whole.

224
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,740
And, you know, when things might not be going well through a season, you know, you have a

225
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,240
couple of bad losses and trying to keep everybody together, focus on, you know, the common goal

226
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,820
that we're all trying to obtain.

227
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:36,320
And then obviously when things are going well, trying to find ways to still improve and not just

228
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,120
get comfortable with a little bit of success.

229
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:45,620
But there were so many correlations that we would talk about that I can't pinpoint one right now,

230
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:50,440
but it was like every day we would come in and talk and somebody would say something that they're

231
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,120
going through and I'm like, wow, this is the same thing we're going through.

232
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,620
Maybe it might be a little bit different, but it's so similar.

233
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,000
So there were just so many.

234
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:05,240
Yeah, Jordan, we love that shared learning opportunity with people that take the time out to reflect.

235
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,820
And obviously you guys have got the sporting synergy in common, but we also see people from

236
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,399
different backgrounds join these groups, whether they be conducting an orchestra or running a small

237
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:17,080
business or a sports legend like Jordan Love.

238
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,120
You mentioned your coach, Matt LaFleur, was the one that introduced you into the Elite Connect world.

239
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,000
He said this about you, Jordan, he said, Jordan Love is such a great person, first and foremost.

240
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,659
I think of all the guys in the locker room.

241
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,200
They love him.

242
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,820
I can tell you the coaches love him.

243
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,399
It's just his approach.

244
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:36,659
He's so consistent in terms of what he does on a daily basis.

245
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:41,480
They're high praise, isn't it, from your leader and your coach of the Green Bay Packers.

246
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,279
Tell us about your relationship with Matt LaFleur.

247
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,779
Yeah, that is very high praise right there.

248
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:47,860
I appreciate hearing that.

249
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,039
But no, Matt is awesome.

250
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:59,200
You know, he's the coach that drafted me to the Packers and, you know, really wanted me throughout that whole

251
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,860
draft process.

252
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:04,500
So in my four years of being there, our relationship has grown so much.

253
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,980
But obviously, he's such a huge reason why I'm here and with the Green Bay Packers.

254
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,480
So I've always appreciated him for that.

255
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:19,879
But, you know, he's Matt is obviously the head coach of our team, but he's a he's a quarterback in his

256
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:20,860
background playing football.

257
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:25,620
So he's always in that quarterback room with us when we're doing all of our meetings and things like that.

258
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:29,179
So we get a definitely more of a relationship than I'd say.

259
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,399
Other players, because we're with them, you know, all the time in our meetings and things like that.

260
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,960
So, you know, it's awesome.

261
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,779
Our relationship is built so much just in terms of football and then obviously off the field.

262
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:48,399
But he's a great leader, you know, very smart coach, does things very well, I think, scheme wise on offense and things we do.

263
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:50,700
But he's awesome.

264
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:57,700
I can't say enough good things about him, obviously, you know, his record and things like that for his head coaching

265
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:58,779
start.

266
00:14:58,779 --> 00:14:59,120
He's been.

267
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,960
It's been awesome.

268
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,960
He's a very young coach, too.

269
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,659
So I think he has so much, you know, a very, very bright future ahead of him.

270
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:14,299
And, you know, we're all trying to do very good things for him and be our best and get him that Super Bowl ring that he deserves to get.

271
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:18,600
I wouldn't doubt that that is something that's that's in the future.

272
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,600
Everyone's had challenging things to deal with in their life.

273
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,639
And you've had your challenges off the field as well as the pressure on the field.

274
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,200
And you're only 14 years of age when your dad.

275
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,559
Passed away.

276
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,399
And he was a much loved and respected police star sergeant.

277
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:39,480
I read you described him as the happiest dude in the world, always smiling and understand the story.

278
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,460
They changed his blood pressure medication.

279
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,620
I had a terrible effect on him and his mental health.

280
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,539
And it led to him taking his own life.

281
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:52,000
I can't imagine how hard as a 14 year old that would have been to go through.

282
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:55,019
How has that shaped you as a young 25 year old man now?

283
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,320
Yeah, that I mean, that shaped so much of my life.

284
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,879
You know, like.

285
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:04,639
Like you mentioned, you know, my dad was an awesome person, you know, a great role model.

286
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:14,299
You know, I looked up to him and so many other people did because, like you said, police sergeant, he did so many great things in our community as being a being a police officer.

287
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:23,240
And and I would always see, you know, articles of people talking about him that he helped and would just say how happy he was, always smiling.

288
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,639
You know, one of those guys that you you never would think he was having a bad day.

289
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,019
Just his attitude in life and how he carried himself.

290
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:45,860
And then, you know, I was raised in the church and he was a youth pastor and he did a lot of great things in our community with the youth, always trying to better everybody's lives and put them in a, you know, just help their situation, whatever it might be.

291
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,740
So very inspired by him.

292
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,419
But obviously, like I said, it was a very tragic incident, losing him.

293
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:58,519
And, you know, it was one of the hardest days of my life, you know, finding that information out.

294
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,139
You know, knowing that my life would be different here on out and, you know, it would never be the same.

295
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:16,420
So I think going through that and with me and my family and just that kind of level of adversity that we we face and I face at a young age, you know, losing the only other man in my house was was very tough.

296
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:28,099
But, you know, I think just in terms of handling adversity in life, it's made other things a lot easier because I feel like I've gone through something that was very, very tough to deal with.

297
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,539
Very hard.

298
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:35,400
And, you know, I think it's helped me get over to make it through my family's that make it through and we've been better since then and, you know, seen better days.

299
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:42,920
But, you know, I think in terms of sports, it's helped me realize that, you know, everything's going to going to pass.

300
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:46,180
You know, nothing's going to be bad forever, last forever.

301
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,539
You know, everyone's going to go through some adversity, but it's how you, you know, move on.

302
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,640
Life's going to keep going on, you know, whether you want to be there or not.

303
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,380
And, you know, it's all about how you what your attitude is.

304
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,500
And how you carry yourself and move on from things.

305
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,440
But everyone's going to get hit with adversity at some point.

306
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:11,900
It's all about how you're able to overcome that and move forward and, you know, try and make the most out of any situation.

307
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:17,299
And but, yeah, like I said, that was definitely the hardest thing I've gone through in my life, me and my family.

308
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,180
But, yeah, it's definitely it's helped shape me to the man I am today.

309
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:27,720
And, you know, I have a lot of things that I still look up to in him and try and be the best person because of that.

310
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,799
Because I knew just how good of a person he was, how good of a man he was.

311
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,579
Definitely strive to, you know, be that every day.

312
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,980
And, Jordan, I understand he was an incredible believer in your athletic ability that he would tell.

313
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:46,160
Is it true you tell people my son's going to be a superstar quarterback from the youngest possible age?

314
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:46,640
Is that correct?

315
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,279
Oh, yeah, it is.

316
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:53,900
But, yeah, I mean, my dad is the one who, you know, put a ball in my hand at a young age.

317
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,640
You know, I remember, you know, growing up, he was the one we'd be outside.

318
00:18:57,819 --> 00:19:01,640
Shooting, shooting hoops in the front yard, throwing a football around.

319
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,779
He's the one who taught me how to throw, taught me how to shoot, you know, ride a bike, just do anything athletic.

320
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:12,740
He was the one teaching me how to do and always pushing me to to be better and try different sports as a young kid.

321
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,660
And, you know, he never really, you know, forced me to do anything.

322
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,900
It was always, you know, whatever I like to do.

323
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,160
And but he pushed me out of my comfort zone, I feel, to try new things.

324
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:27,299
And, you know, when I first started playing football, he'd have me doing every position, catching, running, playing running back,

325
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,059
quarterback. And, you know, I think all those little lessons and things we did as a kid, you know,

326
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,619
shaped me into becoming a good athlete and, you know, being able to play different sports.

327
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:39,539
And like I said, just be a well-versed athlete.

328
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,920
But he was always my biggest motivator as well.

329
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,940
You know, telling people that I was going to be a star one day and give me some confidence, even when, you know, I might not have believed it.

330
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,940
So, you know, I'm very grateful for that.

331
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:54,660
But he's definitely the one who's got me on my athletic journey.

332
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,700
And Jordan, at 25 years of age.

333
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:07,220
You don't have your level of success without some serious, consistent habits and routines and things that you do that allow you to be the athlete that you are.

334
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:13,220
And you hear from your coach about how consistent you are and your teammates, your relationships are incredible.

335
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,180
Can you share with us some of the things that you do that help you to be the best you can be?

336
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:27,680
Well, in terms of consistency, I think, you know, in my time that I was behind Aaron, that was the biggest lesson I feel like I was able to see, you know, from him was just how he showed up to the building.

337
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,299
Every day, how he was in meetings every day, how he was on the practice field every day.

338
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,559
And just his approach, it was very consistent.

339
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:36,339
He was the same person every day.

340
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:42,859
And I said, you know, that's the coolest thing I was able to see coming from college, obviously, a young 21 year old kid still.

341
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:46,279
So I was young and thinking that, you know, I had it all figured out.

342
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,059
But to be able to see that was cool.

343
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:54,359
It's something that I strive to model my game after and just be, you know, the most consistent person I could every day.

344
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:57,440
You know, be the story we all say.

345
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,799
Be the same person every day.

346
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:00,680
You know, don't try and change anything up.

347
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:14,779
But in terms of, you know, how I watch film every day, how I am in meetings, the questions I ask every day, how I get my mind right in terms of how much film I watch outside of the facility when I'm on my own.

348
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:19,759
What I do to take care of my body throughout the week in terms of PT and extra stuff I do.

349
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:27,500
And then obviously the things I do in practice every day, trying to be the same person, you know, grow from little mistakes.

350
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,440
But it's always trying to grow.

351
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:40,880
And then in the offseason, you know, how I train in the offseason when I start my workouts and just the things I'm doing on a daily basis, trying to be as consistent as possible and, you know, pick up where I might lack.

352
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:54,180
But I think consistency is the key and one of those big lessons that I was able to learn early in my career that, you know, I'm still trying to work on these consistent habits in terms of, you know, nutrition and things that's going to take my game to the next level.

353
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:57,180
But, you know, it's not easy, but it's something that I think you learn.

354
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:03,660
You know, have that constant thought of it, of trying to be consistent and striving to be as consistent as a person as possible.

355
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:09,740
And Jordan, this is a different offseason for you on the back of the extraordinary year that you've had, a breakout season.

356
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:11,180
Has life changed?

357
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:17,680
Everyone wants a piece of Jordan Love now and you're at the Super Bowl and there's some enormous opportunities coming your way.

358
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:20,180
Tell us about life now after the year you've had.

359
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,420
Life has definitely changed for sure.

360
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,380
You know, you go from being a backup in the NFL.

361
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,240
Where you're not as recognized and then now you're a starter.

362
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,859
So, you know, my face has been on TV a little bit more.

363
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,539
So more people are recognizing me, you know, around everywhere I'm going now.

364
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,319
So that's changed a lot.

365
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,119
So it's something I got to, you know, get used to.

366
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,559
But, yeah, and then obviously there's more opportunities with things like that.

367
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,420
Super Bowl opportunity, that was very cool.

368
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:55,940
Be able to go down there and do some cool marketing opportunities and partner with some pretty cool brands to do stuff down there.

369
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,299
But, yeah.

370
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:05,000
Just more opportunities, I feel like, and more people recognizing me, which is, you know, something that you got to, you know,

371
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:13,400
you don't get a playbook on how to navigate fans and people that, you know, want to take pictures and things like that.

372
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,099
So that part of my life has changed.

373
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,200
But it's in the better.

374
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:20,299
I feel like it's all part of the territory that comes with, you know, being an NFL quarterback.

375
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:27,319
And, you know, that's something you dream of your whole life to make it to the NFL and be the star that you see on TV.

376
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:34,819
And then now I'm here and it's like, OK, now I'm the person that kids are looking up to and wanting to be like.

377
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:39,500
And so it's definitely a very cool place to be in life.

378
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:47,259
And, you know, I always try to remind myself that it's a blessing and I got to be grateful for it because it's something that I dreamed of as a kid.

379
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:52,660
And, you know, it's easy, I feel like, to get annoyed sometimes, you know, when people are hounding you and things like that.

380
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,660
But at the same time, you know, I was that kid that, you know, it would be a once in a lifetime opportunity to meet.

381
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,660
Some of the stars that I, you know, grew up idolizing.

382
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,900
So it's a grateful opportunity for me.

383
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:11,160
And Patty Mahomes wins his third Super Bowl as a quarterback with the Kansas City Chiefs, a player that you've been compared to a lot in your style and your athleticism.

384
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,519
Is that a comparison you think about watching the Super Bowl again this year?

385
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:16,660
It's not.

386
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:17,839
I don't think about it too much.

387
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,819
I try not to compare myself to other players.

388
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:26,559
You know, we all talk about that because everyone at the end of the day is their own player and do things a little bit differently.

389
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:27,380
But...

390
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,240
Yeah, Patrick Mahomes is a phenomenal player.

391
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,599
Someone I've obviously got a lot of respect for and looked up to.

392
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:42,140
And just the way he plays the position and obviously the amount of success he's had so early in his career, winning another Super Bowl.

393
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:45,480
It feels like he's been there every year winning it.

394
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,799
He's an awesome player.

395
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:55,299
And, yeah, someone I, you know, coming out of the draft, I was a person that, you know, I got compared to a lot in terms of play style and things like that.

396
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,839
But, you know, it's hard.

397
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:03,200
It's so hard to compare, I feel like, players in the NFL because everyone's so unique and has their own play style.

398
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:09,319
And, you know, obviously people put up different stats and different numbers and are at different points in their career.

399
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,380
So it's hard to do that.

400
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:17,819
But I think the way he plays the position, you know, the creativity he has at the quarterback position is awesome.

401
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:25,539
The different arm angles and throws and no-look passes and just the crazy cool plays that he makes is something that, you know,

402
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:26,779
I look up to it and try.

403
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,880
And I try and add to my game and model it after.

404
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:34,519
But I think that is, you know, part of my game is something that obviously he's showcased a lot.

405
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,779
But it's different.

406
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:39,440
You know, I feel like not everybody has some of the playmaking ability that he has.

407
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,920
And, you know, I do feel like I have some of that playmaking ability.

408
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,019
So there are comparisons, things like that.

409
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:49,099
But I try not to get into that comparison world and things like that.

410
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:50,900
Being Jordan Love is pretty good.

411
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,359
I think you're treading your own path pretty well.

412
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,140
We get this great access across the globe.

413
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:56,819
We're seeing what?

414
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,940
Leaders do in different circumstances.

415
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:04,359
And as you've experienced in your own Elite Connect group, and we use the term a bit, success leaves clues.

416
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,740
And we think there's some patterns around great leadership.

417
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:13,599
So I want to ask you a handful of questions to finish around different dimensions of great leadership, starting with this idea of self-leadership,

418
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:19,759
that it's very hard for you to lead a team like you do without a sense of self and who you are as a leader yourself.

419
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:21,440
What does self-leadership mean to you?

420
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,640
That means a lot.

421
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,240
I mean, I feel like just your confidence and how you're able to do that.

422
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,660
Yeah.

423
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:26,779
Yeah.

424
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:29,460
Being able to handle yourself is huge to be a leader.

425
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:38,619
You've got to be able to be confident in who you are as a player, to be able to talk to others and ask others to do certain things and demand that from others.

426
00:26:38,619 --> 00:26:44,480
And then I think just the way you handle yourself, you can't be saying one thing and doing the other.

427
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,079
You've got to own what you do, your actions.

428
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,460
And if you're going to ask other people to do certain things, you've got to be willing to do it yourself.

429
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,599
So I believe everything starts with yourself and the approach to the game.

430
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,980
And things like that.

431
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:09,680
But leadership, I think, is something that you have to be very confident in, your own ability on the field, and then obviously the way you're able to communicate with your teammates, with your coaches, to try and get the most out of them.

432
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:17,980
Jordan, we see people with success like you having a really conscious of having a positive impact on others in their environment on a daily basis.

433
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,279
And they think about, what am I doing to affect others in a positive way?

434
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:25,279
How have you gone about that impact on others in your world?

435
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:25,839
Yeah.

436
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,920
I think that is very huge.

437
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:35,500
Being playing the position I play at quarterback, I'm impacted by, obviously, the play of others as well.

438
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,700
I can't do it all by myself.

439
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:49,079
It takes everybody on the football team, starting with the O-line, being able to give me enough time to block, the receivers being able to make spectacular catches when you're able to put the ball up for them, tight ends, and running back.

440
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:54,900
So I always am a big believer in positive reinforcement.

441
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,400
Yeah.

442
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:55,839
Yeah.

443
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,500
I try to be as positive as possible.

444
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:07,839
I'm somebody who always, when somebody makes a good play, does something really well, I'm trying to be the guy to bring them up and say, hey, that was awesome, that was really cool.

445
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:22,880
When a guy messes up, I try and be the guy to be like, hey, make the next play, and not harp on the negatives and things like that, just because I feel like that's what I like to hear.

446
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,759
I like people to be positive with me.

447
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:25,720
Yeah.

448
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,960
I like to give out the negativity.

449
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:34,460
Because I feel like when you focus on negative things, that's all your brain is focused on is the negative, the negative, the negative.

450
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:39,839
And it's hard to find the good plays in the midst of a couple bad plays.

451
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:54,099
So I try and always be positive and uplift guys and never focus on the negatives, and even just find the beauty in the small things, even when we have a loss, just try and find a couple of the positive plays.

452
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:54,200
Yeah.

453
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,259
Yeah.

454
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:54,299
Yeah.

455
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:54,319
Yeah.

456
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:54,339
Yeah.

457
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:54,380
Yeah.

458
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:54,440
Yeah.

459
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:54,460
Yeah.

460
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:54,720
Yeah.

461
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:54,740
Yeah.

462
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:54,779
Yeah.

463
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:55,000
Yeah.

464
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,059
Yeah.

465
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:55,079
Yeah.

466
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:55,099
Yeah.

467
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:55,119
Yeah.

468
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:55,140
Yeah.

469
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,160
Yeah.

470
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,220
Yeah.

471
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:55,579
Yeah.

472
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:55,640
Yeah.

473
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:55,700
Yeah.

474
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,200
Yeah.

475
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,240
Yeah.

476
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,299
Yeah.

477
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:57,380
Yeah.

478
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:57,539
Yeah.

479
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:57,599
Yeah.

480
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:57,619
Yeah.

481
00:28:57,619 --> 00:28:57,680
Yeah.

482
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:57,819
Yeah.

483
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:57,880
Yeah.

484
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:57,920
Yeah.

485
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:57,980
Yeah.

486
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,480
Yeah.

487
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:58,500
Yeah.

488
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:58,559
Yeah.

489
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:58,599
Yeah.

490
00:28:58,599 --> 00:28:58,619
Yeah.

491
00:28:58,619 --> 00:28:58,660
Yeah.

492
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:58,700
Yeah.

493
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:58,720
Yeah.

494
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:58,779
Yeah.

495
00:28:58,779 --> 00:28:58,799
Yeah.

496
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:58,859
Yeah.

497
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:03,559
I just believe when you focus on positive things, positive things will end up happening in the future.

498
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,480
It's a good way to live your life, Jordan.

499
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:09,059
And that's what you hear from the locker room is that everyone loves being around Jordan Love

500
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:13,180
because there is that energy that flows from you in a positive way.

501
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:17,079
It's a consistent message you hear when you read about the work that you're doing.

502
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,059
Creating and sharing a vision, obviously it's pretty clear what the Green Bay Packers are

503
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:25,640
trying to achieve, but you come in with your own vision of how to achieve that as the quarterback

504
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,519
and the key playmaker. How do you go about sharing that with your teammates in a clear way?

505
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,099
That's an area that I've definitely grown in my leadership style because I've definitely been

506
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:43,519
more of a quiet, reserved person, someone who worked really hard, but I was never that rah-rah,

507
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,180
always talking to guys, things like that. So that's an area that I've definitely improved on

508
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:56,079
and tried to focus on. We all come into the season with individual goals and things everyone's

509
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:00,220
trying to achieve. Obviously, the goal of a team sport is to be able to bring everybody together

510
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:05,160
and get all those heading in a collective direction to get better and win as many games

511
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:10,299
as possible. Obviously, get to the goal of winning a Super Bowl. I don't think it's very hard to get

512
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:14,940
guys moving in the right direction, but I think it's just little reminders of the positive

513
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,500
reinforcement. Hey, this is what we're doing. We're doing it really well. This is what we

514
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,160
continue to do.

515
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:25,240
We continue to build on. I think for our team, we had a lot of new pieces this year,

516
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:31,900
a lot of rookies that were playing big roles for us, which was different than the teams I've been

517
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,539
on in the past. There was a lot of just question marks around our team and what we were going to

518
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:43,059
be about this year. Me being a guy that obviously hasn't played, hasn't started, but I've been on

519
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:47,579
the teams for the past three years, been in the background, been able to see just the different

520
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,359
leadership styles.

521
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:53,559
The guys that I've brought to the table and how they've impacted the team has been awesome. I was

522
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:58,880
trying to evolve my leadership style and take some of that good stuff that I've seen over the years

523
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,279
and bring that to the table and just get everybody on the same page that even though we're a young

524
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:09,660
team, we've got some really good players. Obviously, the media hype around our season was

525
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,980
we were going to be this rebuild team that wasn't going to be any good, but just getting guys to

526
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:18,339
believe that we're good. Obviously, we got off to a slower start than we would have wanted, but we're

527
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:25,720
just keeping guys in that right mindset to believe that we're still a good team. We just have to find

528
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:32,079
those ways to win, limit the mistakes, but just become a more consistent team in our execution, but

529
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:37,940
we're right there. I've been able to see my first year in the NFL. We were one of the best teams in

530
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:42,539
the league. We were the number one seed going into the playoffs and went to the NFC Championship game

531
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:47,059
and obviously lost it, but I was able to see some really good players and a really good team and what

532
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:47,640
it looked like.

533
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:53,660
Trying to bring that to the table and continue to show guys that this is what really good teams do,

534
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:57,559
this is how they practice. Obviously, there's other guys on our team, other leaders that have

535
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:01,519
been there too that helped me out in that, but just trying to get everybody on the same page.

536
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,019
John, we see curiosity is a common word around people have great success and through being

537
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:12,279
curious, that's how they continue to learn and grow. Does that resonate with you, the curiosity

538
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:13,140
edge?

539
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,359
Curiosity factor is what got me even in the

540
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,220
elite group.

541
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:25,200
To be able to be around these other great athletes and leaders and learn so much. The big thing is

542
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,519
never thinking you've got it all figured out. Always being open to grow and change how you do

543
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,619
things and your approach to things and being able to see other people do things and take bits and

544
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:40,640
pieces of what you like, what you don't like, and being able to add that to your game, to your

545
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,920
leadership style, to who you are as a person. I always think it's going to give you that edge that

546
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,579
you're looking for.

547
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:53,339
It's never thinking you have it all figured out. Always trying to find ways to get better,

548
00:32:53,980 --> 00:33:00,720
improve yourself. That's what helps me. I've seen it help other people. Curiosity factor is a big

549
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,519
part for sure.

550
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:06,099
You're saying that that was really what sparked your interest in connecting with the elite group

551
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:09,000
and others around the world, that curiosity to see how other people do it?

552
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:15,559
Definitely. When I heard it from Matt, he was saying how good of a program he thought it was.

553
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:25,240
And like I said, I had so many questions on what it would be like, obviously not even knowing, you know, I was so focused on going into my first year as a starter and just trying to focus on football.

554
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,539
I was a little hesitant to even do it because I was like, I want to try and just focus on this.

555
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:39,799
And but I think that curiosity like, OK, well, well, if this if Matt thinks it's something that's pretty cool and has helped him, you know, and there's other great professional athletes that are doing it.

556
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:44,660
Like, let me let me try this out and see if it's something that will help me.

557
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,640
And, you know, something that I'm glad I did because it did help me.

558
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:54,480
And just being curious on how other people in these other other sport worlds are able to lead.

559
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,039
And like I said, they have so many we have different team styles.

560
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,039
You know, we have a team of 70 people.

561
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:04,859
So it's a little bit different than when you talk to an NBA player who's on a team of 15 ish people.

562
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,099
You know how you're able to talk to your teammates and just get everybody on the same page.

563
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:09,320
So.

564
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,380
I think that curiosity is definitely what sparked me to get into it and to stick with it.

565
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,519
And Jordan, communicating with clarity is a dimension of leadership we see.

566
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,559
And that's crucial to your world, isn't it?

567
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:23,960
How you get your message across in real time.

568
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:26,400
Have you gone about communicating with clarity?

569
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:31,639
That's that's an area as well that, you know, I've definitely had to improve on.

570
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:34,679
I feel like I've struggled with being able to communicate to others.

571
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:39,019
But, you know, over the course of years and obviously just this year being in the group.

572
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:53,340
One of the cool things I was able to learn is, you know, I was I was a little always a little nervous on what to say and felt like I might be saying the wrong thing and didn't want to sound stupid or dumb in front of, you know, your teammates and have them be like, what is this guy talking about?

573
00:34:53,340 --> 00:35:02,320
You know, so just being able to hear, you know, our group and the way they put it was just talk to your teammates like you're talking to yourself.

574
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:09,679
Tell them exactly what you would tell yourself and what you're going over in your mind, because we're all pretty much in the same position.

575
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,760
We're probably all thinking the same thing during practice and games.

576
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,980
You know, if it's a bad practice, we're probably all right there.

577
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:17,340
Like, man, this is this is a rough practice for us.

578
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:21,119
Or if it was a great practice, like, OK, well, what are the little things we can work on and improve on?

579
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,519
That's one thing I learned.

580
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:34,900
Just say what I might be thinking, how I'm feeling and don't, you know, try to put added pressure on myself to always be trying to say, you know, the the right thing or the perfect thing, because, you know, we're all in the same position.

581
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:37,000
We're all probably thinking the same thing.

582
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,679
And I think a lot of it is just, you know, trying not to be perfect.

583
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,539
You know, we're all human.

584
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:47,079
Things might not come off the way you think about it or intend in your head or might offend somebody when you say something.

585
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:55,780
But at the end of the day, being a leader, you got to be that person that says the hard things that, you know, some people might not be wanting to hear, that you yourself might not be wanting to hear.

586
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,300
But, you know, something that you got to be honest with yourself and honest to others.

587
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:02,280
So that's an area of my leadership that I've improved.

588
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:04,519
I'm going to continue to try and improve on.

589
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:09,400
Definitely an area I can grow in is just, you know, talk in front of others, be confident in what I'm saying.

590
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:15,219
But I think the coolest thing I learned from the class was just hearing guys talk about, yeah, everyone's going through the same thing.

591
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,760
Like, just just be honest and say what you feel.

592
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:20,199
No one's going to judge you when I'm sitting there.

593
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,500
You know, I've been a guy that's, you know, I'm easy to to be led by others.

594
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,679
I like being able to hear other leaders on our team talk.

595
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:36,280
And whenever I feel guys are speaking from the heart, it always resonates with me because, like I said, I'm going through the same situation that they are, the same battle, seeing the same things they are.

596
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,179
So it's not like they're saying this magical speech or.

597
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,679
Something that no one's ever said before.

598
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:47,440
They're just speaking real, speaking the facts and speaking from the heart and being open and honest.

599
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,280
And that's something that I've always thought was pretty cool.

600
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,900
And I'm going to, like I said, continue to model my leadership and grow that going forward.

601
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:56,739
It's a really powerful message to hear.

602
00:36:56,739 --> 00:36:59,199
You know, Jordan Love is, you know, the top of his game.

603
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:03,599
You still there's some nervousness about how you express yourself in front of your teammates.

604
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,300
And I know a lot of it.

605
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,519
We all feel that, don't we?

606
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,360
Whether it's with our friends or whatever role we're in.

607
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,400
It's a it's a powerful thing.

608
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,239
Thing for you to share.

609
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:13,239
How important is collaboration been for you and your success, Jordan?

610
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:15,280
Very important.

611
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:23,159
Being on a team with so many different players and you have so many different opinions and the way people handle things are so different.

612
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:29,860
So being able to collaborate with your teammates and be, you know, we have different leadership groups that we have on our team.

613
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:35,340
And, you know, you have guys from every other position that might be a leader in that room that come together.

614
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:39,280
It's huge because, you know, not everyone can not one person can do it on their own.

615
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,139
Not one person has all the answers.

616
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,219
So you got to be able to collaborate with your teammates and come together.

617
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:51,019
And, you know, obviously playing a team sport collaboration on the field is a very important part to being successful.

618
00:37:51,019 --> 00:38:03,760
So obviously in the leadership aspect and how we go about day to day stuff and handle problems we might have on the team or adversity we might have as a team and being able to get over those humps are huge.

619
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,139
You got to be able to lean on others.

620
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:09,340
And I think that's been something that I also learned throughout the group was.

621
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,900
You know, as a leader, you don't always have to be the one to say something.

622
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,119
That's something I learned as well.

623
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:21,460
You know, lean on your other teammates, your other leaders to, you know, maybe I've said something a couple of times and I don't want to be the guy saying the same thing.

624
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,260
Sound like a broken record over and over again.

625
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:29,860
You know, lean on your teammates to to step in and say something and, you know, have a day to lead, lean on another player to have a day to lead.

626
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,619
And, you know, I think at the end of the day, it brings everybody together more.

627
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:35,380
It elevates other players in better leadership roles.

628
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,300
So that's another important lesson I learned is that collaboration part.

629
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,900
And to lean on your teammates and coaches and things like that.

630
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,360
It's a great shift that we're seeing, isn't it?

631
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:52,900
In the past, probably the quarterback had to be the person every single time to say everything at every team meeting and run the whole program every day.

632
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,300
And that's tiring, isn't it?

633
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,739
And you've got all these great resources around you that you can tap into.

634
00:38:57,739 --> 00:39:00,420
And it sounds like you're doing that beautifully.

635
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,280
A final two questions, Jordan.

636
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,820
I love asking these two questions of different people.

637
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,559
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

638
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:09,239
The greatest leader in my life?

639
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,039
Hmm.

640
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:11,380
Great question.

641
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:26,159
I mean, I think for me, as I said before, my dad just growing up, you know, being able to see the way he handled business and carried himself as a person was awesome to see and has shaped the way I try to live my life and do certain things.

642
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:32,639
But then also my mom, you know, when when we went through that adversity, you know, my mom was our rock.

643
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:39,000
She was one who got us through it and was the one that was strong for us when, you know,

644
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,340
we were all going through the same adversity, her just as much as us losing her husband and her partner.

645
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:52,380
So her being that rock and being that strong person for us to get through has shaped, you know, how like I said, how I handle adversity.

646
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,880
So both my parents for sure.

647
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,500
And then football world, I mean, coaches I've had along the way.

648
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:06,719
My high school football coach was a very important person in my life in terms of, you know, giving me confidence and gave me an opportunity.

649
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:08,800
And he's really one of the reasons why I'm here.

650
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:18,579
And I felt a day and just the way he's able to, you know, bring a bunch of high school kids together, you know, have us going towards all one common goal.

651
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:28,239
And, you know, he got our team a lot better in a course of a couple of months when, you know, obviously you probably don't know, but he got there.

652
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:38,179
I think my freshman or sophomore year, he got to our school and was able to turn our program around and get it to one of the best programs in the whole state of California.

653
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:38,679
So he's.

654
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,340
Very successful.

655
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,739
What's his name, Jordan?

656
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:50,820
Brian Nixon, because he actually just retired this year from Liberty, but very successful coach has put a lot of great athletes to the next level.

657
00:40:50,820 --> 00:41:00,920
But someone that he's always stayed in touch and always been someone who I can, you know, fall back on and ask questions to and, you know, just be there to support me through it all.

658
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,920
I'm sure he'd be incredibly proud to hear you say that.

659
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,880
I love asking that.

660
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,579
And obviously, you know, to have your, your mom and your dad have that start in life.

661
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,000
What a gift that is.

662
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,679
And then those people on the way can change your life.

663
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,400
Can you a coach like that when you're maybe working things out?

664
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:26,380
And so nice to hear that shout out for coach Nixon final, where we're a bit obsessed with collaboration in the work we do at a leader and collaborating with unbelievable people like Jordan love and the work you do.

665
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:36,260
Is there someone you thought in any of your interests in life playing NFL is right at the top of the tree, but someone you thought I'd love to collaborate with them on something, or is there any person that springs to mind?

666
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:36,840
Oh, man.

667
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,179
LeBron James.

668
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,900
That's, you know, that's growing up.

669
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,480
That's my favorite athlete.

670
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:58,539
You know, someone that I've just watched my whole life and been enamored with, you know, the athlete he is, how he carries himself, obviously outside of basketball, you know, the kind of leader he is, but, and obviously just, you know, how good of a player he is on the court.

671
00:41:58,539 --> 00:42:01,440
But that's, that's my favorite player of all time.

672
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,059
And obviously I'm wearing the Kobe shirt, but LeBron, that's, that's my guy.

673
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:08,559
So I, you know.

674
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:21,380
Going forward, I'd be someone who I'd love to, you know, collaborate with and be able to pick his brain and, you know, be around and just ask questions too, because he's definitely been a role model in my life and someone I've definitely looked up to.

675
00:42:21,699 --> 00:42:22,460
Have you met him?

676
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,280
I have not, no.

677
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,579
It seems like only a matter of.

678
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:28,760
Looking forward to the day I do though, you know.

679
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:34,699
Well, there's no doubt he'll be listening to this, Jordan, and I'm sure he'd be equally thrilled.

680
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,739
And I love it, isn't it?

681
00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:38,780
When someone has had a 20-year professional career and you're starting.

682
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,860
Out at 25 to see that role model is, is remarkable.

683
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:43,980
It'd be a nice conversation.

684
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,179
I'd love to sit in on Jordan Love and LeBron getting together.

685
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:48,519
I'm sure that'll happen in the future.

686
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:49,280
Thanks for your time.

687
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,599
I know there's an enormous amount of demands on your time.
