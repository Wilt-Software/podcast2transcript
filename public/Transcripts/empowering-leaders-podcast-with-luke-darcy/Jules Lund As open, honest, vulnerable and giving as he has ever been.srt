1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:10,630
This next episode is with the one and only Jules Lunn, and it's fair to say he puts me

2
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:16,230
right on the back foot off the start of our conversation today, sharing a fairly disturbing

3
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,030
story about the last time we caught up.

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,850
Jules was a massive media success before founding his own innovative business called Tribe,

5
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:25,890
which you'll hear about throughout the podcast.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,289
I can't think of anyone I know that is more open, vulnerable, and self-reflective than

7
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:31,870
Jules Lunn.

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:36,390
And to be honest with you, his pure honesty will blow you away at times in his conversation.

9
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:41,490
And in the coming weeks, Jules is actually returning to radio as the Drive host on Disrupt

10
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:41,810
Radio.

11
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:46,250
It's an Australian-first audio network specifically built for leaders and entrepreneurs.

12
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:47,810
He will be brilliant.

13
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:48,369
He's funny.

14
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,070
He's entertaining.

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,130
Couldn't think of a better host.

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,429
4 to 6 p.m. weekdays.

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,310

19
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:01,850
Jules is also part of one of our Leader Connect signature programs.

20
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:06,590
We love having him involved, where we bring together diverse leaders from different backgrounds

And whether you be running your own business as an entrepreneur like Jules Lunn, or simply

28
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,390
to connect.

29
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,930
Huge thanks also to the team at Temper.

30
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,090
It is a mattress like no other, and leaders like Jules Lunn, who have a successful, happy,

31
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:45,329
and joyful life, they all value sleep, and they all know the benefit of sleeping well.

32
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:50,469
So to invest in a mattress like Temper, I promise you that's a life-changing experience.

33
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,930
There is no better mattress in the world.

34
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:55,549
NASA-approved, life-changing experience.

35
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:59,590
Thanks to Jason and the team from Temper for their support of the Empowering Leaders podcast.

36
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,240
Jules Lunn is one of the most passionate and positive people you will ever meet.

37
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,259
His television career saw him host close to 400 episodes of Getaway, The Logies Red Carpet,

38
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,340
game shows, reality TV, live events, and much more.

39
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,400
On radio, Jules was the National Drive host on Fox FM alongside Fifi Box, and co-hosted

40
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,180
Sydney Breakfast Radio with Sophie Monk, Mel B, and Merrick Watts.

41
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:38,159
In 2010, Jules produced an extraordinary documentary, Every Heart Beats True, The Jim Stein Story,

42
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,000
all about Jules' great friend and mentor, Jim Stein's, for those who don't know,

43
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,319
the legendary Irish-Australian rules champion and Brownlow medalist,

44
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,060
the story passionately sharing the incredible friendship, and ultimately Jim's life-ending battle with cancer.

45
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:59,319
In 2015, Jules founded his business, Tribe, a marketplace for social influencers and the brands that need them.

46
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,259
Tribe has expanded into the US and UK, and has worked with over 7,500 brands,

47
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,159
including the likes of Disney, Amazon, L'Oreal, McDonald's, and many, many more.

48
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,979
Jules, it's always a great pleasure to catch up with you. Thanks, mate.

49
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,379
Thanks, Das. Last time I saw you, you hit a baby in the face.

50
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:21,219
Are we going to start there, are we? It's true, mate, and I've had some regret over that.

51
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:25,180
I was going to get to dodgeball, which to me, let's jump straight in, because that sums...

52
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:35,360
I can't have a serious conversation with you until we acknowledge the vicious elephant in the room,

53
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,400
which is Luke Darcy.

54
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:46,699
He comes in to a kids' community social game of dodgeball.

55
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,699
He doesn't break a sweat.

56
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,340
He just marches around, picks up these supposedly soft dodgeballs,

57
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:04,800
and somehow launches them at such velocity that they don't dip.

58
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
You know, you throw something, and it just...

59
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,020
It just slowly, with gravity, starts to dip, and you hurl these things,

60
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,379
and they stay at the same height that it left your hand for 30 metres,

61
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:23,639
and hits a little baby right in the head.

62
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:30,920
Now, I'd like to deny that, but the problem is you've got video footage to prove exactly what you're saying,

63
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:33,500
so I can't even go the deny, deny, deny.

64
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,360
But I remember talking to my wife.

65
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:36,220
I said, we're going over.

66
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,199
We're going to catch up with...

67
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,300
We're going to catch up with Jules and some mutual friends.

68
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,180
We're playing dodgeball.

69
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,240
And Bette was like, what, hey, are you 10 years old?

70
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,620
And I said, look, it'll be a little bit of fun.

71
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,600
And then, mate, I've got to say, white-line fever kicked in slightly.

72
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,439
And then, as I threw that ball, man, it connected with that beautiful little kid.

73
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,620
And I can remember, you know, little Finn Tunnicliffe saying, he's hit a baby.

74
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,920
And I thought...

75
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,959
And God rest his soul.

76
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,079
Rupert, such a sweet young boy, didn't see it coming.

77
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,279
I'm more than a touch embarrassed about it.

78
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:16,959
But to me, it sums up you, because who else can pull together groups of people with something

79
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,660
as inane as dodgeball and make it so much fun?

80
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,000
And it's a credit to you, because you're trying to get off...

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,459
You're saying, I'm not drinking anymore, and I don't catch up with my mates at the pub,

82
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,480
so I'm going to invent a game of dodgeball.

83
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,199
Is that where it started?

84
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,600
Yeah, I was trying to get away from violence, Luke.

85
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,600
No, mate.

86
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,040
Look, I...

87
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:45,040
I have the tendency to be very honest, especially with someone like you.

88
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,819
No, I haven't filtered any of my thoughts here.

89
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:53,040
But I sat down with my therapist one day, and I said,

90
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,680
when I drink, I'm a bit antagonistic.

91
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,000
Like, I want to bait people.

92
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,540
And almost like, you know, like fencing, but verbally.

93
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,540
Which is exactly what...

94
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,740
Which is exactly what I loved about radio.

95
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,560
It was like this challenge at the front of, you know, tripping each other up and having...

96
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,220
You know, it's just...

97
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,939
It's solid banter.

98
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:20,000
And I said, when I drink, I sort of...

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,319
I do it hoping that they come back at me, right?

100
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:24,660
So it's a contest.

101
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:33,720
But, you know, many people just look at this six foot three loud mouth and just think I'm

102
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,180
bullying, which is fair, because in effect, I am.

103
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,360
And so I found myself, when I drink, trying to do this.

104
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:44,560
And my favorite people are those people that sledge me back, et cetera.

105
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,639
But it doesn't always go well.

106
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,959
And so, inadvertently, what happens is I wake up the next morning just self-loathing, going,

107
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,939
what did I say?

108
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,120
Why did I upset them?

109
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,959
Et cetera, et cetera.

110
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:58,519
And so I said this to them, my therapist.

111
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,759
And she said, so what is it that you like?

112
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:03,160
And I said, I like the competition.

113
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,240
And I said...

114
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,620
And she said, what are you trying to achieve?

115
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,180
And I said, I'm trying to achieve.

116
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,420
I'm trying to wrestle with them.

117
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,360
I'm trying to throw things at them and dodge things.

118
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,339
How do I replicate this?

119
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,079
And literally, in the same session, we just came up with that.

120
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,319
It's like, all right, you know, how do I achieve that same feeling without alcohol?

121
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,560
And how do I do it in a really fun, welcomed way?

122
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,160
So I'm just not walking around verbally throwing balls in people's faces.

123
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,319
And so I said, look, I want to catch up with all of my friends.

124
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,779
And I want to have relationships and, you know, connect with their kids who are now

125
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:37,420
getting older.

126
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,480
What's a really fun way to do that?

127
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,279
And, you know, I was acknowledging the fact that I wasn't going to be going necessarily

128
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,560
to pubs and all of that.

129
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,879
So I need to just create something.

130
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:50,480
So Elstermick Primary School is the gym across the road.

131
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,600
And they've been amazing.

132
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,860
And so three o'clock every Sunday, I just put the word out in a WhatsApp thread and

133
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,300
invite people along.

134
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,980
Unless, of course, they injure kids, in which case they never come back.

135
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,100
And, mate, I was surprised by how much fun it was.

136
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,839
I was doing this the whole time.

137
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,720
You're laughing and, you know, I went along with it.

138
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,139
I'd be good to catch up, but I'll dial in and dial out of that one.

139
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,720
It was just genuinely laughed at the whole time.

140
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:24,819
And I can relate to the footy environment very similar to me, where you're doing exactly

141
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:26,899
as you said, maybe not articulating it quite.

142
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:31,360
The verbal jousting and the sledging, man, it always came back with interest.

143
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,860
And then you worked out after you'd finished.

144
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,139
I did when you finished retiring.

145
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,740
You're saying these incredibly offensive things to people that they hadn't had any

146
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,460
context with.

147
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,980
And they were like, you're just a dick, you know.

148
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:48,080
And so I sort of got the sort of the intro into radio as well.

149
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,320
And I enjoyed that because for me, I was on air with guys like Mick Malloy and Will Anderson,

150
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,700
who that's their world champions.

151
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:03,120
And so I just love being cannon fodder because it was like, have a go and then watch it come

152
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,779
back with interest.

153
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,879
And that was the most enjoyable part about it for me because I love it.

154
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:08,360
I love it.

155
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:12,200
But I realize I love it when it comes your way because I find it incredibly funny, particularly

156
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,480
when it's guys like that who are highly intelligent.

157
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,019
And Eddie McGuire, by the way, world class, who I did radio with, world class.

158
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,120
If you get in a verbal battle with Ed, he's as good as anyone has ever seen before.

159
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:23,820
Unbelievable.

160
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:29,960
So I suddenly found myself as the lightweight of all time, just getting them back.

161
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,500
But you're right.

162
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,820
If you're then around people who don't feel that.

163
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,820
You can actually.

164
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,100
You can genuinely upset people.

165
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,639
So I totally get where you're coming from.

166
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,399
But dodgeball is such an amazing way to find a way.

167
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,059
Well, look, it was my leadership 101.

168
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:57,159
The first subject for running Tribe, my business, was watching my mouth in exactly that capacity

169
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:02,120
because, you know, we have 75 staff in five cities across the globe.

170
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,960
And not only is every.

171
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:11,100
One diverse in ages, but cultures like there is dramatic differences.

172
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:17,639
And, you know, we've got teams, we've got 25 people in the Philippines, in India, you

173
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,480
know, as well as obviously America and the UK and, but they're pretty similar.

174
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,000
But then, you know, I, uh, they don't give a shit about my past.

175
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,240
They don't understand that I was getting paid a lot of money for shock value.

176
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:32,000
And I'm actually in that moment destabilizing.

177
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:33,679
It's just highly offensive.

178
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:33,919
And.

179
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:40,539
It's inappropriate, you know, the biggest, the biggest journey for me is unlearning everything

180
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,620
up until that point, which was, where is that actual line?

181
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,320
Because we were paid well, you weren't, you were always the, you know, the good cop, the

182
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
nice one.

183
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:56,399
And you always the, oh, wouldn't have thought so, Ed, you know, wouldn't have thought so

184
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,159
Mick, you know, you, you always the one who was, um, playing a straight bat, which is

185
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,740
a critical piece in that sandwich.

186
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:13,240
You know, uh, for me, I, I was affirmed and, and, and, and being sleazy, offensive, um, you

187
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,139
know, like all of these themes, um, a bit sexist, a bit racist, a bit, you know, just

188
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:21,840
right up into that line where they can't really put a finger on it, but, oh, it's naughty.

189
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:27,980
That was seen as what gripped, even if people hated listening to you saying that it was

190
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,960
still seen as compelling, which is the point of radio.

191
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:33,720
And do you look back?

192
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,740
Do you look back now and think, God, I, I regret any of that at all?

193
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:41,679
Or do you think, nah, that was the role I played at the time and I'm totally comfortable

194
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,600
with, with it?

195
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,940
Nah, not comfortable with any of it.

196
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:50,080
I mean, you know, I've got a 13 year old and a 10 year old, both girls and no, you

197
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:57,980
know, this hard generation as parents right now, it's the, it's the toughest, I think

198
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:03,580
it's the toughest 180 any generation has had to do in such a short amount of time in

199
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,940
terms of how the world is evolving to what is and is not appropriate well i never saw you jill

200
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:14,120
sorry i never saw you you know we we always crossed over in the halls and but you you are

201
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:21,480
mr nice guy of media and and always full of energy and and a smile and you know we know how um

202
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,419
competitive that industry can be but i never saw your reputation as being the sort of combative

203
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:32,279
sleazy nasty guy at all on here i mean is that is that a you may be being a bit harsh on yourself

204
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:37,840
possibly but there was definitely you know when you're on air sort of 10 hours a week there's

205
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:44,600
there's a bit of everything and my point being there doesn't need to be and you know that's

206
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:54,360
that's our role as much as it's it's it's tough for for parents now to unlearn what their parents

207
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,340
um the environment i mean you know in primary school can you remember the jokes used to say

208
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,259
in primary school like there was like

209
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:08,539
there was blonde jokes irish jokes aboriginal jokes um you know people with mental you know

210
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:14,299
disabilities like it was just that was called humor right that's how it sounded it was a setup

211
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:18,580
and then a punch line and you just heard it from your uncles and and all these parties

212
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:24,899
now when i sit at the footy and i got my dad on one side right and i got my 13 year old on the

213
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:31,799
other my daughter mate like that's a whole world difference there's a lot of stuff that comes up

214
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:37,659
now that i never want her to hear and she would be absolutely fall off the chair if she ever heard

215
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:44,980
it and she never has and it's my job in that sort of bridge to unlearn and become aware of all that

216
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:52,279
to know that that's inappropriate and then ensure and shelter this next generation um and that's

217
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:58,139
bloody tough i mean it's taking a you know all you do is step over the line constantly not knowing

218
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:02,159
where it's moving and how it's moving even with the best intention yeah and is that

219
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:06,519
part of you know you had this incredible career in media and you look back and i you know you read

220
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:11,519
the highlights out in the opening paragraph but a national drive is an enormously high profile

221
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:18,240
shift in uh in australian media hosting getaways is you know it's hugely high profile and then you

222
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,960
do sydney breakfast radio uh albeit you come after hamish and andy and kyle and jackie so your timing

223
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:30,480
was was courageous if i could if i could put it that way but did that sort of did you maybe not

224
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,259
feeling overly comfortable with that was that part of it that was part of it that was part of it that

225
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:36,299
was that why you then went and said you know what i'm going into business was that a conscious thing

226
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:42,460
or did it did it just happen in terms of leaving radio was it conscious because i felt like it

227
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,980
wasn't appropriate it was more the fact that i was axed luke

228
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:51,080
they didn't want me bro

229
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:59,779
no no it's not it's none of that um it's none of that but uh a little bit of some um

230
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:02,259
no i you know i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i

231
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:07,740
i was signed for a three-year contract to replace kyle and jackie when they were retiring when i

232
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,679
turned up turns out they were just going around the corner and and then they posted the new address

233
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,259
and all their friends went well we'll go over there instead and that was where the listeners

234
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:19,620
went so we did a year of that and that was brilliant radio but we were sort of talking

235
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:25,559
into an echo chamber i think there was only about 30 of the listeners left um and then the year

236
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:30,159
after i worked with emma friedman we did a brilliant sort of afternoon show and then the

237
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,200
next year of the contract

238
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:39,059
because you know kudos to them they they uh they you know they even though i wasn't on air

239
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:44,960
in the third year i was out there working um with the brands and the clients of the radio

240
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,840
network because i've just always loved marketing right i love the sales part of it and how you

241
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,259
integrate those marketing messages in through radio so i was always liking those sort of behind

242
00:15:55,259 --> 00:16:01,220
the scenes meetings and so in the third year that's exactly what i did i would help brands like

243
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,019
i don't know

244
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:08,740
jetstar or mcdonald's or disney you know come up with these ideas that they've got to promote a

245
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:14,940
film or how do we layer that through our radio shows across the network and so i loved that and

246
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:22,200
then i had some ideas of my own and uh since i was still getting paid uh i invested i invested

247
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:28,360
in starting them and did you do that sales role because you had a contract and you you know

248
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,000
guaranteed money which out of the felt that you needed to do that did you do that because you had

249
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:37,799
to justify that money or was that something that the network said hey hey jules we got to pay you

250
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:42,799
we need you to do another role how did that work that's a good point well look they were going to

251
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:47,759
pay me regardless so they may as well give me something to do but um it was awesome i mean it

252
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,419
was absolutely brilliant i loved it uh flying around the country and running sort of jam

253
00:16:52,419 --> 00:17:01,240
sessions with wade kingsley who's just a brilliant um creative who is working you know between um

254
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:09,359
fans that came to our big radio network and the on-air teams and so it was about sort of finding

255
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:15,019
that common ground which if you look at tribe is not dissimilar you know one side you've got all

256
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:20,279
these brands like disney and jet star and and and the like and then on the other side you've got

257
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:26,279
creators and the creators in radio are obviously on-air announcers like you know the background

258
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:31,799
that i've had but in my world i loved visual i've always loved the visual expression

259
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:41,599
uh pics and clips and it was through my radio time that i actually got as excited about um

260
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:48,140
the social brand and and the social expression of all of our content and our personalities like

261
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:54,920
sophie and fifi box doing that visually um through our socials that actually was able to build

262
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:01,480
a really close and an intimate relationship with our fans

263
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,000
and i think that's a really good point and i think that's a really good point and i think that's a really good point

264
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,980
And this is that moment where we were starting to discover in the industry that people that

265
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,380
liked our radio shows weren't just listeners, they were fans.

266
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:20,019
So you could give them content via any medium, whether it was a pic of Sophie doing something

267
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:25,380
crazy and she's caught mid-action and I write caption this and you get 10,000 comments,

268
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,200
none of those people might not have listened to that show that day.

269
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:31,680
So they're not listeners, they're fans of the brand.

270
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:38,079
And so that's when I sort of saw this opportunity to be able to, I suppose, connect brands with

271
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,279
all types of content creators, just not radio creators.

272
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,279
That's an incredibly innovative thing that you've done, Jules, to transition your skill

273
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:53,500
set in that way and try to be a founder and a CEO of a business now for a decade and owners

274
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,759
employing over 70 people in countries all around the world.

275
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,660
You've had some of the biggest brands in the world connect and collaborate.

276
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,599
Tell us about that story.

277
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,579
And that's a huge shift of gear, isn't it?

278
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:08,599
From what you're doing day to day.

279
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:10,720
What's that been like the last decade?

280
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,869
Oh, terrifying and sloppy and bad and embarrassing.

281
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:23,690
And I mean, that's the nature, you know, I set out to create a marketing tech company

282
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:28,349
and I'd never studied marketing and you F all about tech and I'd never run a company.

283
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:30,730
So that's the nature.

284
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,769
I've always sort of been.

285
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:40,589
Okay, sort of tackling things that are terrifying and then I don't mind being a bit shit, you

286
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:47,789
know, not that embarrassed being there asking stupid questions because I'm like, well, you

287
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:55,890
know, you don't know until you know, so tell me and it's just like that for 10 years, but

288
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,009
it's one of the things that's so endearing and we all love about you.

289
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:02,569
Anyone that comes in, you just are completely transparent.

290
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:02,609
Yeah.

291
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:02,630
Yeah.

292
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:02,690
Yeah.

293
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:02,710
Yeah.

294
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:02,730
Yeah.

295
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:02,750
Yeah.

296
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:02,769
Yeah.

297
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:02,789
Yeah.

298
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:02,809
Yeah.

299
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,430
And there's nothing that is a no-go zone for you.

300
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,609
Is that you from a young age or is it something that you've worked on?

301
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,450
I mean, you mentioned you work with a therapist.

302
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,009
Again, not many people start the conversation of a podcast with that.

303
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,309
Everything's on the table with you.

304
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,329
Is that just you?

305
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:24,299
Let me think.

306
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:31,019
I probably lack the skill to be able to repackage it, really.

307
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:33,740
I mean, I probably maybe I have.

308
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:39,900
I'm on the spectrum at that point where I can't filter it like I just it's an inability.

309
00:20:40,240 --> 00:21:03,079
But look, I do believe through the work so early on in the REACH Foundation and being around Jim and Paul Curry, who directed and was the brains behind Jim's documentary and also founded REACH Foundation with Jim is to, you know, they were 25 and 27 at the time when I met them.

310
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:11,359
At the very first course, you know, one of the things, yeah, they they just pressed upon us constantly.

311
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:16,079
This is a safe space to share whatever your thoughts are.

312
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:26,039
And so I didn't I reckon from probably 14, 15, I learned very quickly I didn't have to practice on repackaging too much.

313
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:32,920
In fact, I was affirmed and and and I was rewarded for.

314
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:35,119
Being brutally honest and authentic.

315
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:47,539
And I saw the benefits and no real need to, you know, like if I I'll cry anywhere, I'll just fall in a heap and cry like that's an example.

316
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,380
Like we were that was a good thing.

317
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,400
We saw that always as a good thing in REACH.

318
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,980
Like if you were just don't hold on to it, doesn't matter where you are, just let it all go and ugly cry.

319
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,680
And so that's just sort of an example where in that environment, if you're feeling emotional or whatever.

320
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:03,759
You're struggling.

321
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:07,039
You would just say that quickly because people could help you quickly.

322
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:13,220
And and the same with, I suppose, me that vulnerability doesn't scare me is my point.

323
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,839
There was always rewards to vulnerability.

324
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:24,619
So me telling you, you know, that I see a therapist or, you know, I struggle with, you know, the black dog at times or, you know, you can't really use that against me.

325
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:29,599
It's only a superpower to be able to lay that on the table because only good things usually come from it.

326
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,500
Yeah.

327
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,599
And that's not an easy thing for it.

328
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:41,119
For a lot of people, Jules, that's why I love you sharing it, because for a lot of people spend their whole life with a mask on and their whole life repackaging to use your your terms.

329
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:57,039
And, you know, to go back to to that day, you walk into REACH and you're a kid with a fair bit of attitude, from what I understand, for those who don't really understand the legacy of, you know, Paul Currie, maybe Jim Stines, perhaps more in this conversation.

330
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:02,380
Can you describe Jim to people that didn't have the privilege of meeting him and what that impact has been on you?

331
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:03,920
Absolutely.

332
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:26,660
I mean, the REACH Foundation for those, you know, maybe interstate is, you know, it exists and it's thriving today, you know, without the leaders that that that gave birth to it in the early days and even the the rung of leaders that followed them, which was myself and, as you know, Sammy Cav, who was also in that room at the first session.

333
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:32,279
Sammy Cav is a brilliant, probably the best brain in audio, in my opinion, in the country.

334
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:41,420
You know, worked behind the scenes with Hamish and Andy for 16 years and he's worked with you plenty, Darcy, you know him extremely well.

335
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:49,720
Well, he and I were in the very first course at Presentation College, Windsor, in some sort of small room at the back of a convent.

336
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:52,900
So this was the very first presentation Jim and Paul had ever done.

337
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,019
You're in the very first class.

338
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:54,960
Oh, yeah.

339
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:55,720
Yeah, absolutely.

340
00:23:56,059 --> 00:24:02,140
I walked up to Sam and he was wearing a turtleneck that his mum had knitted.

341
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,579
And I said...

342
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,440
Nice turtleneck.

343
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:09,200
And I meant it because it was grunge in those days and ugly shit was cool.

344
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:10,960
The verbal jousting started.

345
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,619
Had you not met him before?

346
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:13,920
Did you not know him at all at that stage?

347
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:14,440
No.

348
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,400
No, no, no.

349
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:25,319
And all my best friends right now are from, mainly from Reach, from those early days because we went through such an experience together.

350
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,720
It was like...

351
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,779
So that was the first...

352
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:30,539
So basically what Jim and Paul did was...

353
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:31,880
Jim was a teacher.

354
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:32,940
Right.

355
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:33,900
Just innately.

356
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,799
But he also did teaching rounds at my high school, De La Salle.

357
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:43,799
And so he also used to run leadership sessions for young people through sport.

358
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:44,960
Sport camps.

359
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:50,359
And then you had Paul Curry, who was the other end of the spectrum, who did it through drama.

360
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:58,960
So he worked with teenagers and talked about leadership and overcoming adversity and all this really, really...

361
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,200
I mean, it was groundbreaking.

362
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,539
It was groundbreaking work at the time because all you had is sort of, I suppose, scouts or church groups.

363
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,140
But, you know, to talk about your feelings and all this sort of stuff was really innovative.

364
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,460
And whereas now, you know, it's almost part of the curriculum.

365
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:24,819
But so they sort of met each other and did a course together and said, we should work with teenagers together and combine a bit of sport and drama.

366
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,059
And it was phenomenal.

367
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:31,059
So they went out and, you know, to promote this five-week course.

368
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,599
And because he had been doing teaching rounds at De La Salle, he came there to do a session.

369
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,019
And I just tore the session apart and tried to sabotage it.

370
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:46,240
And, you know, Jim sort of pulled me up, slapped me across the face verbally, but also with a bit of a pat on the back.

371
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:51,140
And I thought, this guy's, you know, these guys are actually pretty cool.

372
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,099
And I couldn't make him cry.

373
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,799
So they've got some grit.

374
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:57,299
And I turned up to the course.

375
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,980
And as I say, that was the very first course.

376
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,019
And Sam was there.

377
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,000
And, you know, that was 2014.

378
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,119
That was 25 years ago.

379
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:12,500
And what sort of ended up happening from there was I just became so infatuated with Jim.

380
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,000
I was just like, far out.

381
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:16,359
This guy's like connected.

382
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,099
He's positive.

383
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:24,619
He's and also Paul Curry as well is, you know, still one of my best mates.

384
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,500
I just loved what Jim was doing, how he could command a room.

385
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,960
And so I would wag.

386
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,299
Wednesday sport and ring him up and say, you know, I have a day off.

387
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,079
Can I come and follow you around to some rotary club or whatever?

388
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:45,859
So, you know, I'd just go with him to teacher sessions or he would be talking out at psychiatric units.

389
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:54,380
He would be going to schools and I'd be sitting at the back, just scribbling everything, just wanting to be exactly like him until I could write these scripts that he would say.

390
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:59,880
And then I would sort of run a bit of my own sessions until after a while, you know, I was traveling.

391
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:09,240
I was in Australia or mainly Victoria with my own valiant Chrysler and a speaker and running these workshops for 18 year olds when I was about 17.

392
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:21,960
So the nose ring and bleach blonde hair and I was a bogan and I'd go out to these things and crack open the group and, you know, there'd be 150 kids crying and we'd all be sort of having this really powerful experience together.

393
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,079
And I went, fuck, this stuff is this is revolutionary.

394
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:27,039
And it's actually in its simplicity.

395
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,839
In its simplicity.

396
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,740
So powerful.

397
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:44,200
Powerful, you know, create a safe space, give them the permission to say and be positive and then have people that are just a little bit older than them be cool and positive.

398
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:53,460
And just that, which the scouts have done and church groups and people have done for millennia, that is so good and positive.

399
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:57,119
Whereas the flip is people are a little bit older than you that are negative.

400
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,880
Well, you'll just go that way.

401
00:27:59,480 --> 00:27:59,599
Yeah.

402
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,640
It's incredible to hear you describe it that way, Jules.

403
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,359
And I know the story, but to hear the words come out of your mouth.

404
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,019
And I also had the great part.

405
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:15,359
I don't know Paul Curry, but I had the great pleasure of playing footy against Jim Stines and knowing Jim for many, many years.

406
00:28:15,579 --> 00:28:16,880
And we're all a bit the same.

407
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,599
We all just were completely full of admiration for Jim.

408
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:29,440
To come from Ireland, you know, play our game as a pioneer in that space, but not only play it, to play it better than anyone else at a point in time.

409
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:32,000
And do that just out of pure grit.

410
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:33,119
Like you said, he's got a bit of grit.

411
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:36,559
He had grit on the footy field that you couldn't possibly imagine.

412
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,640
Like he played the same role I play, but he was like an elite, elite marathon runner.

413
00:28:42,339 --> 00:28:43,579
So he was as hard.

414
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:47,099
It was the same role as you played, but you just played a bit better.

415
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:48,119
Played a bit better.

416
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:49,220
Correct.

417
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,519
And you know what's fun?

418
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,519
Every time I saw him, we played in this one Friday night game in the MCG, Bulldogs against Melbourne.

419
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,039
I'd only been two or three years in.

420
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,339
And I'm playing on Jimmy.

421
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,519
And I'm absolutely reeling.

422
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,299
Because what he would look at you and go, you can't run with me.

423
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,259
There's no way you're going to run.

424
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:04,700
And he sort of had this smile on his face.

425
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,920
And that Irish accent would come out.

426
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,660
But in the last quarter, got to a boundary throw in.

427
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:13,640
And he sort of half nudged me in the back.

428
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,900
But in fairness, I took a dive.

429
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,519
I've never conceded this to Jim ever.

430
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,500
But I took a dive.

431
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:18,980
And I got this free kick.

432
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,980
And I kicked the winning goal.

433
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,460
And he went ballistic.

434
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,500
He went off his brain.

435
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,819
And every time I saw him, no matter how many, it would have been 50 times, you're fucking cheated.

436
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,000
You're fucking cheated.

437
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:29,500
He'd said it every time.

438
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,720
Every single time I saw him.

439
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:32,380
And with a smile on his face.

440
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:35,559
But he revolutionized the game and the way it was played.

441
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:39,539
And you thought, God, if I could ever have that ability to run like Jim,

442
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,460
imagine how good you could play the game.

443
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:47,700
And he played 260-plus games, still a record, Jules, in a row.

444
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:49,819
And he had broken ribs.

445
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:54,599
The Melbourne players always talk about Jimmy to have this injury that would keep someone out for eight weeks.

446
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,140
And he'd have all the Irish healers in and the Gaelics.

447
00:29:58,579 --> 00:29:59,519
Incense would be going.

448
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,619
And he'd have all these things.

449
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,000
And he'd get out and play.

450
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,640
And play every single week.

451
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:12,400
And so I can imagine that in a room of young teenagers, that presence would have been picked up pretty quickly, I suspect.

452
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,440
You're right in what you say.

453
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,119
It's the presence.

454
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,599
Because none of us knew what the hell he was doing in between reach sessions.

455
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:22,200
I don't follow footy and I never followed it then, right?

456
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,839
I didn't even have a concept.

457
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:29,579
I mean, I turned up to all of his award things and they said, all right, he's played 12 years of football.

458
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:31,599
Without missing a game as a ruck.

459
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,440
And I'm like, oh, yeah.

460
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,839
So do I get on the TV?

461
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,200
Like, it was like, I didn't even really know.

462
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:38,619
I just knew we were going to the Elephant and Wheelbarrow afterwards.

463
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,680
An Irish pub and celebrating.

464
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,900
But no concept.

465
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,799
But two stories about him running.

466
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,500
One of them is, can you remember who told me this?

467
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:49,839
I was out on the, the old days, on the beer.

468
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:57,960
And someone said that the day after you won the Brownlow medal, you know, the highest individual honour in AFL,

469
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,680
they were driving to work at like 6am and he was out running.

470
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:04,200
The day after?

471
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:04,940
Yeah.

472
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,619
So he's down in St Kilda, Beacon Sealed Parade.

473
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,980
He's out training.

474
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:13,460
Like, he's on track running the day after.

475
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,900
So, and then the other one is what he used to do, because I'd, you know, when I was backpacking,

476
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:25,720
I went over and visited his family and, you know, he'd get like Craggy Stone, Dublin,

477
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,839
like, you know, these mountains.

478
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,839
And he'd just go up into this drizzle and just disappear.

479
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:37,259
And he would say to his mum, Mum, I need you to pick me up at the top of that road at like 11am.

480
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:38,460
Like, do not be late.

481
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:44,339
And so he'd be running up this hill, hoping that his mum's going to, you know, plod along and save him.

482
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:48,119
And she'd be like, lose track of time.

483
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:53,339
And he'd be like, think about what he's running in, like, you know, crappy shorts or whatever.

484
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:56,160
And he's just running uphill as high as he can.

485
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,640
And it's just blowing.

486
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,880
A gale, you know, waiting for his mum.

487
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,980
And he would just keep going and going and going.

488
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:09,960
Like, he was just trying to find the most painful, you know, hurt locker, end of the road wall.

489
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:16,319
And he would always just whinge because she wouldn't be there and he'd have to either keep running or turn around and run back.

490
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:19,160
But he was massively hardcore.

491
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,019
But phenomenal.

492
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,000
And a real boy.

493
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,339
You know, there was a great playfulness to him.

494
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:25,980
Funnily enough, towards the...

495
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,839
Before he even found out.

496
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,240
That he had cancer.

497
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,900
And he would have been...

498
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,299
So he passed away at 45.

499
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:36,039
So he's not dissimilar to our age.

500
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,940
But he found out at about 42.

501
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:39,579
So it was about three years.

502
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,980
But up until that point, he really had, I think, lost a little bit of...

503
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:50,319
Lost a bit of perspective, you know.

504
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,180
And he's the first to admit this.

505
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,180
But, you know, he really...

506
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,180
He really had got caught...

507
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,579
He was caught and addicted to the busyness of life.

508
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:06,680
You know, the gift and curse of Jim Stines was that he could see potential in everything.

509
00:33:07,099 --> 00:33:10,000
The problem was as soon as he saw it, he had to realise it.

510
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:16,900
So he'd have an idea for a primary school or his own high school that was, you know, alternative teaching and education.

511
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,900
And then it'd be like, right, that's my project.

512
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:21,960
And then the next day he'd see someone and go, you should be this.

513
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:23,220
I'm going to invest in you.

514
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,140
And then before you know it, he just was overrun and stressed.

515
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:27,720
And he was...

516
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,299
He was the chairman of the Melbourne Footy Club trying to save that, which he did.

517
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,799
And he was running reach.

518
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,059
And, you know, he's a father and a husband.

519
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,019
And it was just...

520
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:37,039
It was spread too thin.

521
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:38,119
Yeah.

522
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:38,759
And that's interesting.

523
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:41,539
You know, I crossed over him a fair bit in that period.

524
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:48,160
And you could just see how, as you said, all worthwhile, you know, to go back and save his footy club when it was about to go under.

525
00:33:48,579 --> 00:33:50,299
Because everyone turned and went, Jim will do it.

526
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,700
Jim will have the capacity.

527
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:57,059
And he's the one person that can unite everyone when, you know, the factions are going at each other.

528
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,519
I didn't quite understand that, you know, you would have, just what toll that was taking.

529
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:06,019
It has been just beautiful to see Matisse and Tien and his two beautiful kids.

530
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:09,579
Just to see the spectacular people they've become.

531
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:14,420
And Sam, his wife, is just a super person and a great part of that.

532
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:22,159
So then, Jules, your great friend and your great mentor, he gets ill and you saw him through that period.

533
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,619
And you imagine the grit.

534
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,079
I remember chatting to him one day.

535
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:27,500
He'd had his 36th operation or something.

536
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,579
And I remember him saying, I'll fix this.

537
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:33,280
Once I know what it is, I can find a way.

538
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,260
I can fix it.

539
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,599
Just that determination.

540
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:41,159
But if you haven't seen Every Heart Beats True, the Jim Stine story that Jules, you need to go and see it.

541
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,059
Even if you've never had any context around Jim Stine.

542
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:49,840
And now I look back, Jules, and I didn't realise with your film background, it is just a brilliant, brilliant piece of work.

543
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,679
Tell us about what that was like.

544
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,840
Well, look, you know, we're not…

545
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:07,679
When he told us that he had a really big lump and it was cancerous, his schedule cleared pretty quick.

546
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,440
Because I wasn't able to get very close to him.

547
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:14,619
Like, I remember he was the best man at my wedding and trying to get him for a fitting for the suit.

548
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:15,639
He made me feel like shit.

549
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:17,920
He was like, fuck, you know, this is…

550
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,940
I'm busy and I'm like, this is really special, mate, you know.

551
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,019
But as I say, he lost perspective.

552
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:27,699
He got busy and, you know, there were really meaningful things around him.

553
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:35,940
And he was not acknowledging them or soaking them up, if I was to be brutally honest.

554
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:41,059
So I, you know, I came back from my honeymoon and the next day straight into his house and he told me.

555
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:47,159
And so, yeah, I said, all right, how are you getting to that appointment?

556
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,099
How are you getting from that appointment, et cetera?

557
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,760
And so, you know, I was able to just…

558
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,079
I had the capacity to spend a bit of time.

559
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,480
And then in doing that, you know…

560
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:59,760
I'm a content creator, you know.

561
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,699
What I do now in my business is, you know, there was no iPhones or smartphones.

562
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:07,840
It was like I had a little Casio in my pocket which filmed digital video.

563
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,059
But no one, you know, like I was doing selfie videos, right, blogs or vlogs, you know.

564
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:24,079
And I would just film funny shit that was happening with him, you know, coming out, being drugged by the, you know, by the anesthetist, getting to say weird shit.

565
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,239
You know, his bum hanging out of those horrible doctor's gowns.

566
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:27,639
Like…

567
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:32,780
It was just a couple of idiots behind the scenes of that.

568
00:36:33,139 --> 00:36:34,219
Did he appreciate it?

569
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,500
Did he know that this was…

570
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,900
He knew what was going on, do you think?

571
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:38,780
No, no, no.

572
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,980
I didn't have an outcome.

573
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:41,579
Yeah.

574
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,900
No, I was just shooting it like I shoot everything.

575
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,420
I've never looked at any of the video back.

576
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:55,420
It's just that after a while, after a while, Paul Curry, who's a film director, you know, who created all these amazing drama workshops for teenagers.

577
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,619
He's been, you know, creating films.

578
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:00,260
And he's highly successful.

579
00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:04,539
He's doing the biopic for Robbie Williams, you know, at the moment.

580
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:11,579
And so, yeah, he was like, let's pull together some of your content with some interviews.

581
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,099
And that's how it began.

582
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:14,639
I mean, obviously, Jim was still around.

583
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:17,059
So then we could actually hire a proper cameraman.

584
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:23,619
And it was a combination of sort of my behind the scenes interviews and us actually filming some stuff.

585
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:25,619
And we decided to start to…

586
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:30,360
What's that word?

587
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:32,079
Chronicle.

588
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:32,320
Chronicle.

589
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:32,900
Yeah.

590
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:43,539
Chronicle his battle, which was just getting more and more absurd, you know, when he started to drink his own urine.

591
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,300
And, like, he was trying everything.

592
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,619
I mean, this is the beauty of him.

593
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,800
He tried everything.

594
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:55,599
I've got footage that's never seen the light of day where he's over in Jakarta with, you know, people like weird, weird.

595
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,639
Alternative shit.

596
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,659
And anyway, we followed this.

597
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:07,159
And when we packaged the movie together, we all believed that he was going to win and fight this.

598
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:14,719
And so when he sat down to watch, what in the end became his funeral celebration that he was able to witness.

599
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,099
I mean, who gets to experience that?

600
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:24,380
They're sitting there, getting to watch all of the beautiful people and, you know, celebration of their life, their impact.

601
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:25,380
It was amazing.

602
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,699
It was a really beautiful thing.

603
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,539
And then, you know, he passed away in the end.

604
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:31,119
And we never believed it.

605
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,059
You know, we were going to keep filming.

606
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,760
And, yeah, so it was…

607
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,300
I mean, it is a really powerful story.

608
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:42,099
You know, we played it again on Stan.

609
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,360
It's on Stan at the moment.

610
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:49,699
We played it again a couple of days after the Melbourne Footy Club won the premiership.

611
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,360
And I just rang the guys and said, mate, you guys are allowed to play this again.

612
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:55,480
The Melbourne people will love.

613
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,599
They'll love seeing this, especially how far it's come.

614
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:58,980
Because it means so much to Jim.

615
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,619
You know, he did the debt demolition where they raised money to save the club.

616
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:04,940
And now they're winning a premiership.

617
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,739
Brutal for Jim never to be able to see it.

618
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,360
But obviously he's up there and he is.

619
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:14,460
And you think of his legacy, Jules, you know, alive and well in the person you are and Sam Kavanagh.

620
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,960
And the Reach alumni are everywhere.

621
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:20,840
And they're these incredible people that have got that same spirit that you've got.

622
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:25,079
I watched that two nights after, you know, Melbourne won that grand final again.

623
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:27,800
And, you know, I'm a bit the opposite of you, Jules.

624
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,420
My wife always says, you went to boarding school.

625
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,260
And I think they removed your tear ducts at boarding school.

626
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,179
They don't work that well.

627
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,360
But that gets me.

628
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,920
That one, the older I get, perhaps I'm getting more like you, Jules.

629
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:43,019
And you sit down and just what a special person he was.

630
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:48,440
And then I see the legacy, him giving Max Gorney's first jumper, who was the captain of that side.

631
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:51,480
And Max, you know, his first couple of years was all at sea.

632
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:55,059
But Jim saw something special in Max that perhaps others didn't at that stage.

633
00:39:55,139 --> 00:40:02,480
And the Reach, you know, no pun intended, of that person and the legacy that lives on through his own kids and so many others.

634
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:04,659
It's just a special, special thing.

635
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:10,380
And I love hearing, as I said, you know, if it's on Stan, which you just told me it is, you know, have a look at it.

636
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,260
Because it will inspire you in a really profound way, for sure.

637
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:15,079
Well done, mate.

638
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,119
Yeah.

639
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:17,900
It is a beautiful story.

640
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,699
But kudos to Paul Curry.

641
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,900
He's the thematic genius in threat.

642
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:26,179
Reading that story together.

643
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,980
But you're right about the alumni, about Reach.

644
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:32,539
And it's in such incredible shape at the moment.

645
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,519
You know, I listened to Fergus Watts on this very podcast.

646
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,900
You know, Fergus's story is very similar to mine in a sense.

647
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,679
He came a little bit further on.

648
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,000
And, you know, I was able to spend some time with Fergus at Reach when we were younger.

649
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:45,860
He's now the CEO.

650
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,880
But, you know, same thing.

651
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,219
You know, he was a bit of a smartass.

652
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,000
He's at school and Jim's come out.

653
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:52,099
He's tried to challenge him.

654
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:54,880
And before you know it, you know, you're young.

655
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:00,599
And it's the old switcheroo where all of a sudden you're the biggest supporter of the presenters

656
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,380
as opposed to the one pulling them down.

657
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:05,260
Jim was just the master at that flip.

658
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:06,500
Hey, Jules.

659
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:12,300
It's been a great pleasure in recent times to connect with you in a space that I really love

660
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:17,059
and am passionate about, Let It Connect, where we're forming these bespoke groups.

661
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:19,619
And, you know, your name just kept coming up.

662
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:22,239
People kept saying, I want to connect with Jules Lahn.

663
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,099
And I know what you're like.

664
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,000
It was great to pick up the phone.

665
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:24,519
You said, I'm in.

666
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:26,300
No need to sell any further.

667
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:26,820
I'm in.

668
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:30,159
I did say, how much is it going to, how much damage?

669
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:31,820
I got no money.

670
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,139
Actually, you did say that.

671
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:34,440
Yeah.

672
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:36,840
In fairness, I love your brutal honesty.

673
00:41:37,139 --> 00:41:38,360
I'm in, but I'm not paying anything.

674
00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:43,420
But I love the group that you're in.

675
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,679
And if you don't mind me sharing, I'm keen to get your thoughts.

676
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,519
Mike Mansfield, who played a couple hundred games for Geelong, is a great story.

677
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,980
Great human being, Mike, in every sense.

678
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:53,840
Hunter Johnson.

679
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,000
Johnson, who's, you know, I see in a similar way.

680
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:58,099
What Hunter's doing with the Man Cave is just brilliant.

681
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:00,260
I had the great pleasure to talk to Hunter in this space.

682
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:05,659
Michelle Nolan is an extraordinary individual who's at the MCC in HR.

683
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,599
Mim Bartlett is just a champion.

684
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:10,739
And, again, I've spoken to Mim in this space before.

685
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,780
And she's just an incredible person in her own right.

686
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,780
I need another hour to sum her up.

687
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:20,079
And Jason Nichols was a great friend who actually helps me bring this together

688
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,940
through his work as the CEO of Tampa Betting.

689
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,340
So I love the diversity.

690
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,019
You're bringing people together, Jules.

691
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:25,960
How have you found it?

692
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,840
It's extraordinary.

693
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:34,269
And, again, it's so powerful in its simplicity.

694
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:40,170
I mean, what you've done is you've assembled, you know, like-minded, hungry,

695
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:48,309
open-minded individuals who don't have a fixed mindset.

696
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:53,610
And then you've got an incredible facilitator in Stacey Moorlang.

697
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,170
And Stacey...

698
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:56,989
I've known for many years.

699
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:59,849
She is, you know, a superstar lacrosse player.

700
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,969
Like, played in the World Cups.

701
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:05,050
And how did you connect with Stacey?

702
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:06,889
Stacey was in one of our groups.

703
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:10,110
She was signed up and joined one of the groups.

704
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,889
And everyone who meets Stacey falls in love with Stacey.

705
00:43:12,969 --> 00:43:14,090
She's just incredible.

706
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:15,869
And we convinced her.

707
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,230
And we just every day we go, are you happy?

708
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:19,969
Can we make sure you're happy?

709
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,789
Because we want you to stay around.

710
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,070
And she's doing a great...

711
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:23,849
I'm glad to hear that.

712
00:43:23,889 --> 00:43:24,889
It's nice to get that feedback of...

713
00:43:25,789 --> 00:43:26,670
And we get it everywhere.

714
00:43:26,889 --> 00:43:29,969
She's remarkable, isn't she, in the person she is.

715
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:32,110
So, yeah, she's facilitating the group.

716
00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:33,570
And so, yeah.

717
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:38,550
And, you know, in essence, we have a number of themes that we touch on each week.

718
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,449
You know, we get together every couple of weeks for about an hour and a half.

719
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:46,849
And it might be, you know, one week on vision or today was curiosity.

720
00:43:46,849 --> 00:43:49,889
And I had a session just before this chat today.

721
00:43:49,889 --> 00:43:55,550
And we had a guest, Dr. Michael Hewitt-Gleeson, who has co-founded the...

722
00:43:55,789 --> 00:43:57,230
The School of Thinking.

723
00:43:57,929 --> 00:44:03,269
And, you know, ordinarily what we might do is we might take turns.

724
00:44:03,269 --> 00:44:10,269
So, last week I sort of battered up a hurdle that I was struggling with.

725
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:13,510
Like, what's a challenge in my life when it comes to leadership?

726
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:15,409
It's all under the theme of leadership.

727
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,530
And, you know, you're able to unpack that.

728
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:22,250
And for me it was, you know, I've done tribe for 10 years now.

729
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:25,269
I usually change...

730
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:27,090
Careers every five or 10.

731
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,409
This one's taking this sort of...

732
00:44:29,409 --> 00:44:32,070
This adventure is taking a little bit longer.

733
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,530
It hasn't worked out exactly as I thought it would.

734
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:43,070
And each time I sort of feel like I'm getting to the finish line, the ribbon moves again.

735
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:43,690
And I'm just...

736
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:49,110
I'm fatigued, you know, despite the fact that we've never been in a better position

737
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,489
and I've never been more excited.

738
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:54,730
So, I almost need to just, you know, reconcile some of the past

739
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:55,730
and then take a deep...

740
00:44:55,789 --> 00:44:57,889
Take a deep breath and then start the next leg of this journey,

741
00:44:57,989 --> 00:44:59,750
which is exactly what this has helped me do.

742
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,050
You know, get that...

743
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,269
Ignite that fire in my belly.

744
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:04,409
So, that was what I would bat up and say,

745
00:45:04,489 --> 00:45:05,409
has anyone got advice?

746
00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:08,570
And then these brilliant diverse minds will start to, you know,

747
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:12,510
offer thoughts and feelings and, you know, have you tried this?

748
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,289
And someone, you know, once told me this.

749
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:18,329
And so, you've got all these practical tools that you can take out,

750
00:45:18,429 --> 00:45:20,550
start to implement and then come back in the next session.

751
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:24,050
Yeah, mate, thanks for that brilliant description.

752
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,750
I've always wrestled with trying to...

753
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:27,849
I tell you, you did as good a job as possible.

754
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:30,630
And have you found that that's got real-life applications for you

755
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:34,150
where you genuinely go, I can take that and use it in my day-to-day?

756
00:45:34,829 --> 00:45:36,449
Yeah, it's practical stuff.

757
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:37,250
It's not...

758
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,630
I mean, yes, there's a bit of...

759
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,190
I suppose there's a bit of theory there.

760
00:45:40,289 --> 00:45:44,230
Like today, we did some brilliant thing with Dr. Michael, you know,

761
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:49,449
a guest speaker who's sort of breaking down GBB, which is...

762
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:52,769
Actually, is it BGG?

763
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:53,849
GBB.

764
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:55,130
No, it's GBB.

765
00:45:55,789 --> 00:45:57,010
Good, better.

766
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:00,250
Yeah, good, bad, better.

767
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:00,750
Yeah.

768
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:05,369
And I won't do it justice, but, you know, in leadership

769
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:10,489
and in coming up with ideas, the toughest thing is trying

770
00:46:10,489 --> 00:46:12,590
to escape your own point of view.

771
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:16,789
And it's just a very simple process that rather than you coming

772
00:46:16,789 --> 00:46:18,550
up with preconceived ideas.

773
00:46:18,929 --> 00:46:21,889
And so, the concept today was like, you know, someone's come up

774
00:46:21,889 --> 00:46:25,510
with the idea to take all seats out of buses, right?

775
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:28,289
And so, what you do is we went around the group and talked about,

776
00:46:28,409 --> 00:46:30,010
like, what are the good things about that?

777
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:32,449
Oh, okay, well, there's less plastic in the seats.

778
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:33,889
Oh, people can stand up.

779
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,369
You know, you can get more people, so the prices are down.

780
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:38,829
And, you know, you go through all the good things, right?

781
00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:40,409
And you scrape the bottom of the barrel.

782
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:43,610
And even at the bottom, you start to realise there's more good things

783
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:44,409
that I wouldn't have thought of.

784
00:46:44,449 --> 00:46:48,349
And you've got different people's, you know, mindset and suggestions.

785
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,170
They're things that you would never think of.

786
00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:53,309
So, that just shows that there's no hierarchy of ideas.

787
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,489
And then you go, what are the bad things about?

788
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:57,630
And you go through the bad things, right?

789
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,329
What about people who have disabilities or people that are old?

790
00:47:00,369 --> 00:47:01,550
And you smash it that way.

791
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:04,110
And then you go, better, all right?

792
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:09,349
What is a better idea than that, encompassing a bit of the good and the bad?

793
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,849
And where that thinking takes you is phenomenal.

794
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:14,329
Like, it's amazing.

795
00:47:14,449 --> 00:47:16,670
So, you start to go, oh, okay, well, you know,

796
00:47:16,769 --> 00:47:19,329
saving money is a really good thing, but some people need to sit down.

797
00:47:19,409 --> 00:47:23,829
So, maybe some buses don't have them and some buses do have seats.

798
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:25,489
Or maybe the bus is broken.

799
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:32,309
And that's just a really simple, you know, archaic or crude example.

800
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:34,570
But if you apply that to so many other things,

801
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:36,230
rather than jumping in with the negatives

802
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:43,150
and then annihilating the spirit of the discussion,

803
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:46,230
because, you know, if the CEO goes, that's a bad idea,

804
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:48,409
like, brainstorm over.

805
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:51,630
So, it just forces a discipline there.

806
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,369
And I just think it's remarkably powerful.

807
00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:55,489
And I look forward to,

808
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,630
you know, using that more and more to get out of my own way.

809
00:47:58,269 --> 00:48:01,730
Yeah, and what an incredible person, you know, Michael Hewitt Gleeson is.

810
00:48:01,769 --> 00:48:03,829
And you go back in his history on the school of thinking.

811
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:06,929
And it's what we're loving, Jules, as that community is growing,

812
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:09,510
that shared life hacks, that shared opportunity.

813
00:48:10,269 --> 00:48:13,489
As you said, it's a gift now, isn't it, to be able to –

814
00:48:13,489 --> 00:48:16,230
it's an uncommon thing to be able to share and debate.

815
00:48:16,489 --> 00:48:18,969
And, you know, cancel culture has become so prevalent now.

816
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:22,789
We don't even take the time off to think of walking in someone else's shoes.

817
00:48:22,789 --> 00:48:24,929
And so, yeah, we love – you know,

818
00:48:24,929 --> 00:48:26,309
it can be lonely, can't it?

819
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:27,789
You're CEO of Tribe.

820
00:48:27,889 --> 00:48:28,630
You're the decision-maker.

821
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:29,329
A lot of people –

822
00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:29,389
Well, I'm not.

823
00:48:29,969 --> 00:48:30,570
I'm not.

824
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:34,690
I mean, I'm the founder, but I do have a CEO.

825
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:35,369
Okay.

826
00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:39,170
And I should probably acknowledge him.

827
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:42,130
I let the first one go past, Luke, because I really like the sound of it.

828
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:45,070
And then your honesty kicked in, didn't it?

829
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,369
You couldn't help yourself.

830
00:48:47,409 --> 00:48:49,530
Mandatory disclosure, Anthony Skurskas.

831
00:48:49,789 --> 00:48:51,489
Join me right at the start.

832
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,369
And he is absolute – he's a phenomenal leader.

833
00:48:54,929 --> 00:48:58,690
And he and I, our partnership through Tribe over the years

834
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:02,190
has been probably the greatest reward from this whole venture.

835
00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:05,329
It's been amazing, but not easy, you know.

836
00:49:06,389 --> 00:49:08,929
As everyone will say, a marriage is tough.

837
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:15,570
But, you know, running a business together is incredibly challenging

838
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:20,789
and takes a lot of communication, more investment than my marriage, I reckon.

839
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:22,050
Were you friends beforehand?

840
00:49:22,969 --> 00:49:23,309
No.

841
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:24,750
No, we won't be afterwards.

842
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:25,070
We'll be there.

843
00:49:27,909 --> 00:49:30,530
Hey, Jules, I love it.

844
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:31,789
No, joke, joke.

845
00:49:31,789 --> 00:49:32,789
Yeah, we fair.

846
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:37,030
He just drove into a pole listening to this podcast.

847
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:41,590
But so many people have had partnerships before that go off a cliff.

848
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:45,829
And, you know, I've been in that situation before, and it's awful.

849
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:49,190
But when it's good – and when it's good, you still have – as you said,

850
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:51,570
you have to work on hundreds of things, you know,

851
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:53,969
maybe more than, as you said, your own relationship.

852
00:49:54,269 --> 00:49:54,730
But the reward –

853
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:56,329
The rewards in it are spectacular.

854
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:59,050
I mean, you can share a passion and build it together.

855
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:02,710
That's as much joy for me as doing anything in that space.

856
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:03,349
It's brilliant.

857
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:04,389
Yeah.

858
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:05,829
Yeah, absolutely.

859
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:07,829
But like everything, it takes investment,

860
00:50:07,969 --> 00:50:11,269
and it takes a lot of courage to be vulnerable, you know.

861
00:50:11,369 --> 00:50:15,269
We've had plenty of really highly awkward conversations over the years,

862
00:50:15,309 --> 00:50:17,750
and it's the only way through, you know.

863
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:19,829
If you don't, you don't get to the other side,

864
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:23,590
and you can become pretty stagnant pretty quickly,

865
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:24,710
like in any relationship.

866
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:28,409
No one could be more comfortable in the awkward than you, I reckon, Jules.

867
00:50:28,409 --> 00:50:31,429
You would be world-class.

868
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,909
I just – I know you've put them all out there.

869
00:50:34,929 --> 00:50:39,590
As you've heard in this conversation, it's as brutal an honesty as you ever get.

870
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:43,289
We love – I love sitting down with people like you

871
00:50:43,289 --> 00:50:45,630
and tapping into your thinking and the diversity of thinking

872
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:47,250
and learnt so much in doing this.

873
00:50:47,309 --> 00:50:51,010
It's been my favourite thing ever in media to learn from people like you,

874
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:52,550
and we're seeing these traits that are coming through,

875
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,090
starting with self-leadership, Jules.

876
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:55,050
What does that mean to you?

877
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:05,340
Look, I think I'm a better self-leader than I am a group leader.

878
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:16,480
I think I'm quite judgmental when it comes to group leadership.

879
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:25,320
The things I expect from myself, you know, I can control and deliver,

880
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:26,480
although I am…

881
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:28,179
I am pretty hard on myself.

882
00:51:30,619 --> 00:51:34,280
But I do struggle, you know, with judging team members.

883
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:41,380
I think I'm good from a lead-by-example group leader.

884
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:48,739
And when I'm excited, I think I can sell a vision.

885
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:56,739
However, if I'm not aligned and I'm not in line,

886
00:51:57,039 --> 00:51:59,940
I can flow, I can have that opposite effect.

887
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:04,420
And that's one of the things I'm challenging myself on at the moment

888
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:08,840
through A Leader Connect, your program, which is, you know,

889
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,280
I'm a good natural leader, but when the going gets tough for me

890
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,800
or the company, if I'm not in a good space,

891
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:21,019
I struggle to have the discipline or the rigour or the framework.

892
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,500
I'm just very emotional.

893
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,000
But in self-leadership,

894
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,800
I'm really…

895
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,039
I've had some tough years.

896
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:31,760
I had tough years, obviously, through COVID, like many of us.

897
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:37,239
But I've come out far stronger from Melbourne lockdown.

898
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:42,460
And I have a, you know, insatiable appetite to experience things.

899
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:47,860
And so I'm really leaning into scary stuff that, you know,

900
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:51,659
I find is the quickest way I can access pride.

901
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,539
You know, pride for me is my drug.

902
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:55,980
You know, I want to be proud of myself.

903
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,260
Guilt for me can just…

904
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,559
Or self-loathing, which is why drinking booze.

905
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:03,880
You know, I just would…

906
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,400
After a while, I'd just be mouthing off or just, you know,

907
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,619
I just didn't like that version of myself.

908
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,739
And I couldn't actually cut back.

909
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,880
I was not finding the balance there.

910
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,619
So I just, you know, as Sammy Cav said, you know,

911
00:53:15,639 --> 00:53:19,900
it's a lot easier making one decision than lots of hard ones.

912
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:23,159
So rather than trying to go tonight do I drink or tomorrow night,

913
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,219
just like one decision and commit to it.

914
00:53:25,219 --> 00:53:25,940
How long is it?

915
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:26,119
How long has it been?

916
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:28,159
Over six months.

917
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:30,480
You coping all right?

918
00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:31,539
Yeah, yeah.

919
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:34,260
I mean, there's nights like I'm getting frustrated and pent up

920
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,840
that I want to sort of blow off some steam

921
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,679
and just sort of have that escapism.

922
00:53:39,579 --> 00:53:41,559
But crystal meth is, you know…

923
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:46,139
You'll have to cut that out.

924
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:47,480
Surely not.

925
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,099
Is it a lifetime choice, do you think?

926
00:53:50,179 --> 00:53:51,360
Do you think you just give it up?

927
00:53:52,219 --> 00:53:52,880
I don't know.

928
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,179
I know it seems stupid,

929
00:53:55,179 --> 00:53:58,480
but having mid-strengths and light beers actually sort of made it worse

930
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,559
because then when I couldn't get them, I'd have heavies

931
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,159
and I wasn't match fit.

932
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,340
So I'd end up getting a little bit more piss

933
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,480
than if I was just always drinking heavies.

934
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,079
I know it seems silly.

935
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,619
So I think I just struggle with that.

936
00:54:12,139 --> 00:54:15,840
And no, I immediately felt better.

937
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,820
A lot of fear, anxiety of like, oh, what could I say?

938
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,079
Or, you know, what would happen?

939
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,900
You know, that lack of control, all of that lifted

940
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:24,900
and I immediately…

941
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:26,099
I immediately felt more control.

942
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:29,159
And then I had a greater capacity, you know, in my life.

943
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:32,239
So I've been, you know, I'm really scaring myself with,

944
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:37,960
like I want to do a ultra event in Catherine Gorge,

945
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:41,199
which is like 2K swim, 4.8K kayak,

946
00:54:41,539 --> 00:54:47,820
then there's a 10K, you know, run up a cliff,

947
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:51,300
then 40K on a bike, 18K mountain bike, and then a 10K run.

948
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:53,039
And I'm nowhere near that.

949
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,639
So I've run marathons,

950
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:56,880
and I do that regularly, but I've never swum.

951
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,500
So I've started with Johnny Van Wees.

952
00:54:58,699 --> 00:54:59,400
You know, I remember…

953
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,619
I remember Johnny for sure.

954
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,599
He's a great guy.

955
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,480
And Tammy, his sister's the legendary swimmer as well.

956
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:06,980
So Johnny's going to…

957
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,099
That's a fair training partner, mate.

958
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:09,320
That's a high bar to start with.

959
00:55:09,579 --> 00:55:10,300
He's amazing.

960
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,320
Well, I've just…

961
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,619
I haven't swum since I was 14.

962
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,059
And so I'm swimming and then starting spin classes

963
00:55:17,059 --> 00:55:19,679
and, you know, soon I'll be shopping for Lycra.

964
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,639
Well, mate, it's a great…

965
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:24,619
That is a great answer to self-leadership.

966
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:28,579
And I love hearing you talk because it's just…

967
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:30,519
Not many people can have the thought and then action

968
00:55:30,519 --> 00:55:32,719
and say, this is not helping me.

969
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,480
Very few have got the discipline to follow through

970
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,940
and answer it the way you did.

971
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:39,500
It's a pretty profound thing.

972
00:55:40,059 --> 00:55:41,519
We see leaders are really conscious, Jules,

973
00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:43,659
around their impact on people positively.

974
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:45,039
And that links into what you just said.

975
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:46,920
You felt like, you know,

976
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,460
your lifestyle wasn't helping you impact people positively

977
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,320
and you're waking up the next day with regret.

978
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,159
When you walk into Tribe or you're at home

979
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:54,480
or you're…

980
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:54,539
Yeah.

981
00:55:55,099 --> 00:55:55,840
Whatever event,

982
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:58,139
how do you go about impacting people positively?

983
00:55:59,079 --> 00:55:59,559
It's funny.

984
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:00,559
All I…

985
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,619
My brain just takes me to all the negative impact.

986
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,760
Like, I just, you know, being harsh on myself,

987
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,699
I just think, God, I could be better there and better there.

988
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,920
How do I positively impact?

989
00:56:12,579 --> 00:56:16,480
Well, I genuinely believe that people should have a big swing.

990
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,500
You know, I get super excited by speaking to people

991
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,960
who are a bit hungry.

992
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,480
Like, that to me is…

993
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,760
That to me is something I'm super passionate about,

994
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,420
which is that sort of 18 to 22-year-old, you know,

995
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:34,340
where you're out of school

996
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,719
and you're trying to look at the big wide world.

997
00:56:37,059 --> 00:56:43,800
For me, I love that innate coaching, you know,

998
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:44,980
when I speak to them and I'm like,

999
00:56:45,019 --> 00:56:45,559
what are you going to do?

1000
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:46,840
Are you going to travel overseas or I do…

1001
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,280
You know, like, I just love that coaching.

1002
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:52,460
And so I think when I speak to friends who are like,

1003
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:52,880
you know,

1004
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,059
what do I do next?

1005
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:55,920
I get…

1006
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,099
I think I positively impact them by, you know,

1007
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:03,039
helping them strategise, you know, write up a plan,

1008
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:08,460
be clear on their vision to confront limiting beliefs

1009
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:11,159
and then start.

1010
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,260
See, I see you just in the times that, you know,

1011
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,699
we've encountered each other, you have that impact on everyone

1012
00:57:19,699 --> 00:57:22,760
just instantaneously in my mind because of,

1013
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:22,860
you know,

1014
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,820
and people will hear that comes through in this today,

1015
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:27,340
that the humour and the fun and the authenticity,

1016
00:57:27,659 --> 00:57:29,659
like there's nothing fake about you ever.

1017
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,659
And in particularly crossing in the corridors of media,

1018
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,599
which can be incredibly fake,

1019
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:39,440
it's refreshing or fronting up to a game of dodgeball

1020
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,059
and seeing the joy on your face.

1021
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:43,159
I mean, that to me is just,

1022
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,300
I don't think you even understand the impact you have

1023
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,039
because you're unique.

1024
00:57:47,179 --> 00:57:50,440
You know, not many people have your attitude to life.

1025
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,739
I think it comes out of you whether you like it or not.

1026
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,219
But creating and sharing a vision,

1027
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,280
Tribe's a huge vision when you think about

1028
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,400
what you've done with that.

1029
00:57:59,019 --> 00:58:02,099
How have you gone about trying to share that

1030
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:04,480
and bring that to fruition with other people?

1031
00:58:07,389 --> 00:58:09,469
Well, it's been a long journey, to be honest.

1032
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:13,869
You know, originally the concept was to build

1033
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:19,090
a self-serve technology platform.

1034
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:24,550
The brands could jump online and write up briefs.

1035
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:25,130
And then,

1036
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:27,710
the creators of all walks of life,

1037
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:30,090
whether they had followers on social or not,

1038
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:34,090
could respond to these briefs via an app.

1039
00:58:34,769 --> 00:58:39,809
And so, the original vision was that at scale.

1040
00:58:41,289 --> 00:58:43,949
And, you know, it was difficult because, you know,

1041
00:58:43,989 --> 00:58:45,610
that world didn't exist yet.

1042
00:58:45,849 --> 00:58:49,670
And, you know, I could imagine how all of those

1043
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:54,849
fundamental forces could interact and create

1044
00:58:54,849 --> 00:58:55,130
both different types of content.

1045
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:56,250
And, you know, I think that's a real challenge.

1046
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:56,289
And I think that's an opportunity.

1047
00:58:56,289 --> 00:59:00,630
And a problem which we could help solve

1048
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:01,909
for brands and creators.

1049
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:04,750
So, I think that sounded like yoga babble bullshit.

1050
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:06,210
But my point is...

1051
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,769
And does it still, does that still form part of Tribe?

1052
00:59:08,889 --> 00:59:09,730
So, do people still...

1053
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:11,210
Because the concept is brilliant.

1054
00:59:11,409 --> 00:59:12,989
It absolutely is brilliant, isn't it?

1055
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:17,050
Everyone who's got any business wants to try and market

1056
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:18,730
and wants to influence in a way.

1057
00:59:18,849 --> 00:59:21,789
And it's hard at any level, even if you are Unilever

1058
00:59:21,789 --> 00:59:24,349
or Amazon, different scale.

1059
00:59:24,349 --> 00:59:24,750
But...

1060
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:26,309
Is that still what happens?

1061
00:59:26,389 --> 00:59:28,030
People write up briefs and...

1062
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:29,030
Yeah, it is.

1063
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:30,369
With one key difference.

1064
00:59:30,449 --> 00:59:32,989
And this is where I'm...

1065
00:59:32,989 --> 00:59:36,730
My vision is evolving right at this moment.

1066
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:37,730
Like, I'm...

1067
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:41,869
Anthony, our CEO and CFO and myself are going with

1068
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:44,809
Oscar Trimboli, who is an amazing executive coach,

1069
00:59:44,829 --> 00:59:45,769
one of the best in the country.

1070
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:47,409
And we're doing a session in a couple of days.

1071
00:59:47,849 --> 00:59:50,510
And it really is about that recalibration of vision.

1072
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:52,469
And it's sort of what I was talking about with that hurdle

1073
00:59:52,469 --> 00:59:53,989
at Alita Connect.

1074
00:59:54,369 --> 00:59:54,730
But...

1075
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:58,190
It is exactly that, except that we're moving

1076
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:00,429
and have moved away from self-serve.

1077
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:03,750
In other words, it was meant to be a technology platform,

1078
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:06,590
I suppose, like an Airbnb or an Uber,

1079
01:00:07,389 --> 01:00:08,610
where people...

1080
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:11,210
And there was a volume play of everyone interacting

1081
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:14,730
and technology was the only facilitator.

1082
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:19,389
But what we've realised is, unlike Uber,

1083
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:24,070
where you have one rider and one driver

1084
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:24,429
and...

1085
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:30,050
And it is a success if that driver gets that rider

1086
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:30,989
to where they want to go.

1087
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:31,929
So that's complete.

1088
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:37,289
What we have is Nutella putting a brief in,

1089
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:41,750
asking to celebrate Nutella through desserts.

1090
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:46,949
And then you have, you know, thousands of creators

1091
01:00:46,949 --> 01:00:50,730
that come up with their ideas of how they want to do that

1092
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,869
through TikTok or Instagram or Pinterest.

1093
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:55,030
Someone's...

1094
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:57,550
So photos and carousels, someone's through a video

1095
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:59,730
and there's all these variables

1096
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:00,889
and they've got different prices

1097
01:01:00,889 --> 01:01:02,190
and they've got different engagement.

1098
01:01:02,829 --> 01:01:05,309
And so it's not just one-to-one

1099
01:01:05,309 --> 01:01:07,889
and you're connecting them and it's a success.

1100
01:01:07,989 --> 01:01:11,110
In our world, there's a huge amount of variables,

1101
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,110
like thousands.

1102
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:14,969
And we were trying to achieve that purely through tech.

1103
01:01:15,269 --> 01:01:17,030
And what we've come to realise is,

1104
01:01:17,389 --> 01:01:19,789
in order for both of those parties to get what they want,

1105
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,570
they need a layer of support.

1106
01:01:21,909 --> 01:01:23,590
They need some human interaction.

1107
01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:24,969
And so now we're a combination.

1108
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:27,130
We're a combination of both tech plus team.

1109
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:29,670
And when you start to work with team,

1110
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:32,690
then you start to work with enterprise clients.

1111
01:01:32,849 --> 01:01:33,730
And so the point is,

1112
01:01:33,949 --> 01:01:36,889
when we used to work with just anyone who could jump on,

1113
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:40,050
now we've invested nearly $20 million in our technology.

1114
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:42,630
We are working with enterprise clients.

1115
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:45,030
So we're working with Mars Pet Care, for instance,

1116
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:49,389
and the contracts are, you know, a lot higher than what they were.

1117
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:51,309
So that vision has changed

1118
01:01:51,309 --> 01:01:54,150
because I said, let's unlock the world's creativity.

1119
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:54,869
And it was better than that.

1120
01:01:54,869 --> 01:01:56,170
It was about a broad play.

1121
01:01:56,369 --> 01:01:58,530
And now what we're doing is we're working

1122
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:01,230
with a smaller amount of companies,

1123
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:03,929
but it's on a far greater scale

1124
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:06,429
for their global creative transformation,

1125
01:02:06,429 --> 01:02:08,489
which is still phenomenal and exciting.

1126
01:02:08,869 --> 01:02:11,909
I'm just in that recalibration of exactly what you said,

1127
01:02:11,949 --> 01:02:12,909
which is that vision.

1128
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:15,150
And that's where it's interesting

1129
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:19,309
because, you know, you've got to move with the market.

1130
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,489
Yeah, great answer.

1131
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:24,590
And, you know, I can see, you know,

1132
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:26,530
where you started and like most things, don't they?

1133
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:28,730
I think almost every one of these stories you tell,

1134
01:02:28,969 --> 01:02:31,989
there's genuinely a fork in the road moment, isn't there?

1135
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:32,929
Or a few of them.

1136
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,630
And, you know, you find the solutions

1137
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:37,550
and it sounds like you're well on the path to doing that.

1138
01:02:37,949 --> 01:02:38,690
Thoughts on curiosity.

1139
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:41,090
I know you've been discussing this with Alita Connect.

1140
01:02:41,489 --> 01:02:43,409
Does that resonate with you,

1141
01:02:43,489 --> 01:02:44,849
the idea of being curious

1142
01:02:44,849 --> 01:02:47,030
and approaching your learning through that curiosity?

1143
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:51,250
Yeah, look, curiosity is a fun one.

1144
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:54,550
And this is where I give an example.

1145
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:59,769
I've been disappointed with myself the last couple of days

1146
01:02:59,769 --> 01:03:01,349
because we had a conversation with our board

1147
01:03:01,349 --> 01:03:06,630
and they brought up AI and chat GPT

1148
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:09,369
and all of this stuff that we're seeing around the globe

1149
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,849
and how many businesses are integrating that.

1150
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:18,269
And we think it's going to be phenomenally valuable for our world

1151
01:03:18,269 --> 01:03:20,389
because there'll be content that's generated,

1152
01:03:20,489 --> 01:03:22,510
which makes human content even more valuable.

1153
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:29,090
However, when my board brought that to me,

1154
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:32,429
I found myself having cynical thoughts

1155
01:03:32,429 --> 01:03:35,889
and wanting to wait a little bit longer until the dust settles

1156
01:03:35,889 --> 01:03:40,670
because we've just spent a few years on Web 3.0 and NFTs

1157
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:44,690
and NFTs, non-fungible tokens,

1158
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,889
I still call a bit of bullshit on.

1159
01:03:48,289 --> 01:03:50,610
And, you know, some of your listeners will understand them,

1160
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:51,190
some won't.

1161
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:52,190
But it was the concept,

1162
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:55,889
that all of a sudden content was going to be verified

1163
01:03:55,889 --> 01:03:57,969
using blockchain in a very different way

1164
01:03:57,969 --> 01:04:00,010
and you could have a board ape image

1165
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:01,409
that's now worth millions of dollars.

1166
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:03,389
And then everything just tanked.

1167
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:04,929
And I was just sitting back going,

1168
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:06,690
everyone's going, we need to have a position on this.

1169
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:09,269
And I'm like, it doesn't make rational sense to me yet.

1170
01:04:09,489 --> 01:04:11,250
I just want to let this thing go.

1171
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:13,550
And I didn't want to invent...

1172
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:14,389
Sorry to interrupt you.

1173
01:04:14,469 --> 01:04:16,429
There were some extraordinary things, weren't there?

1174
01:04:16,449 --> 01:04:17,989
Like a piece of a digital photo,

1175
01:04:17,989 --> 01:04:21,090
effectively like a screenshot of, you know,

1176
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:22,489
of whatever it is.

1177
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,750
It was going for tens of millions of dollars

1178
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:26,489
as an original...

1179
01:04:26,489 --> 01:04:28,469
Yeah, that was a non-fungible token, wasn't it?

1180
01:04:28,909 --> 01:04:31,349
And that world has sort of gone off a cliff, hasn't it?

1181
01:04:31,429 --> 01:04:31,929
Is that...

1182
01:04:31,929 --> 01:04:33,309
Well, it was just going to be the next big thing.

1183
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:35,230
And it may be, you get a bit of a touch,

1184
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:37,809
but I just find myself quite cynical, you know.

1185
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:39,650
There was a few years ago, it was voice assistants,

1186
01:04:39,829 --> 01:04:41,389
the Amazon, the Google Homes.

1187
01:04:41,889 --> 01:04:43,449
You know, it was just all of a sudden,

1188
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,590
we weren't going to be...

1189
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:46,030
It wasn't going to be visual advertising.

1190
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:48,190
Now everything was going to be done sonically.

1191
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:51,190
And I just, my gut sort of...

1192
01:04:51,849 --> 01:04:52,349
I sometimes just...

1193
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:53,789
I just go, nah, this is a whole bit of bullshit,

1194
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:54,969
but I don't want to say it out loud

1195
01:04:54,969 --> 01:04:57,150
because you don't want to be the idiot that's the sceptic

1196
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:59,190
and you put it in a tweet and everyone shows you

1197
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:01,110
you were shit-canning the internet

1198
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:02,530
and it became a real thing.

1199
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:07,309
So, but I sit there and now I found myself,

1200
01:05:07,409 --> 01:05:08,369
when it comes to curiosity,

1201
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:10,849
less curious around chat, GPT and AI.

1202
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:12,289
And I'm like, oh, I'm exhausted.

1203
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,789
I have to get across this again and everything,

1204
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:17,789
which is a really bad attitude, is my point.

1205
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:18,829
It's not a...

1206
01:05:18,829 --> 01:05:21,849
It's that cynicism isn't...

1207
01:05:21,849 --> 01:05:22,690
Isn't great.

1208
01:05:22,769 --> 01:05:24,469
It certainly isn't a good innovator.

1209
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:26,610
And my title is Chief Innovation Officer.

1210
01:05:26,969 --> 01:05:28,789
So I'd want to be innovative.

1211
01:05:28,969 --> 01:05:32,070
So when you ask about curiosity, I find myself,

1212
01:05:32,269 --> 01:05:34,269
I am curious about certain things.

1213
01:05:34,449 --> 01:05:40,010
I'm certainly turned off when it's the hot, cool, new buzz term.

1214
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:43,010
I find myself almost gagging on that.

1215
01:05:43,269 --> 01:05:45,829
But I've got to set my judgment aside

1216
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:50,889
and love the exploration and imagination of what could be.

1217
01:05:51,349 --> 01:05:51,829
And so...

1218
01:05:51,849 --> 01:05:55,630
So that's my interpretation today of curiosity, Luke.

1219
01:05:55,949 --> 01:05:57,389
Thank you, Jules.

1220
01:05:57,510 --> 01:06:00,469
I read with interest today, the chief,

1221
01:06:00,829 --> 01:06:02,570
known as the godfather of AI,

1222
01:06:02,949 --> 01:06:04,849
or so termed anyway in the mainstream media.

1223
01:06:04,969 --> 01:06:07,110
So he may have been at it for a couple of weeks.

1224
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:07,630
Who knows?

1225
01:06:07,769 --> 01:06:10,969
But it sounded like he had an instrumental

1226
01:06:10,969 --> 01:06:13,449
in Google's use of AI.

1227
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:15,730
And there'll be stories like this.

1228
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:17,170
He quit saying,

1229
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:18,829
this is the journey out of the bottle

1230
01:06:18,829 --> 01:06:20,429
that will never come back in that space

1231
01:06:20,429 --> 01:06:21,730
and started...

1232
01:06:21,849 --> 01:06:25,489
Talking really, real examples around the nefarious use of AI

1233
01:06:25,489 --> 01:06:28,909
when it's put in wrong hands and what it can mean.

1234
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:30,429
That is going to...

1235
01:06:30,429 --> 01:06:31,070
I'm curious.

1236
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:34,130
I haven't jumped in and learned anything about it at all,

1237
01:06:34,269 --> 01:06:36,369
but it's something we're going to speak a lot about,

1238
01:06:36,429 --> 01:06:38,090
I'm sure, going forward.

1239
01:06:38,809 --> 01:06:40,510
You're an incredible communicator.

1240
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:42,710
It's a gift that you've got

1241
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:45,130
and it's sort of formed a fair part of your life.

1242
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:46,510
Do you think about it?

1243
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:48,070
Have you been strategic about it

1244
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:49,829
in the way that you communicate?

1245
01:06:55,139 --> 01:07:00,599
I feel like I'm wearing a dress.

1246
01:07:00,699 --> 01:07:02,360
I'm about to say, do I look fat in this?

1247
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:05,920
But I'm not fishing here,

1248
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,559
but I hate the way I communicate.

1249
01:07:08,139 --> 01:07:13,980
I mean, I'm so encouraged by Mark Burris,

1250
01:07:14,019 --> 01:07:18,760
who is very scrappy and a bit messy in his delivery,

1251
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:21,860
but I find him incredibly captivating.

1252
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:23,480
So why do you hate the way you communicate?

1253
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,360
I've got to cut you off there.

1254
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:24,980
I mean...

1255
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:26,159
Why would you sub in it?

1256
01:07:26,619 --> 01:07:26,760
Yeah.

1257
01:07:27,019 --> 01:07:29,500
I listen to communicators, you know,

1258
01:07:29,539 --> 01:07:32,219
even my CEO and yourself.

1259
01:07:32,599 --> 01:07:35,000
And when I actually listen to how people articulate,

1260
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,079
they're just so efficient, right?

1261
01:07:37,179 --> 01:07:37,960
They're succinct.

1262
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:41,360
And like when I used to present TV,

1263
01:07:41,659 --> 01:07:43,699
I would write my stuff and recite it.

1264
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:45,940
Like, yes, there were off-the-cuff moments,

1265
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:48,320
but for me to turn to a camera and just start talking,

1266
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,199
oh my God, it'd be three minutes of absolute mess.

1267
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:54,099
So hosting Getaway,

1268
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:54,960
you'd hand-writen...

1269
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:57,659
You'd write your throws and memorise them, would you?

1270
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:00,380
Oh, mate, the Logie's red carpet,

1271
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,739
you have no idea how hard I worked

1272
01:08:02,739 --> 01:08:04,320
to make it look like I didn't work at all.

1273
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,079
I'd be...

1274
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:09,980
So I'd know there was 14 celebrities I had to interview

1275
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:12,159
and I had about 30, 40 seconds each.

1276
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,659
And what I would do is my research,

1277
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,539
I would write down their questions

1278
01:08:18,539 --> 01:08:23,600
and then I would interview my wife with a hairbrush

1279
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,819
and I would...

1280
01:08:24,819 --> 01:08:27,880
I would tell her to mess with me

1281
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,399
because I knew that I had to somehow follow up

1282
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:33,800
to that next question off whatever she gave me.

1283
01:08:34,579 --> 01:08:39,460
And I would go through every interview 10 times

1284
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:41,039
and then I'd have an open art,

1285
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:42,579
which a big crane would come down,

1286
01:08:42,659 --> 01:08:43,560
there's people screaming

1287
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,659
and it's like being in a washing machine trying to present.

1288
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:49,560
So I would learn that days ahead.

1289
01:08:49,779 --> 01:08:50,979
I'd write it, script it,

1290
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,180
every off-the-cuff was bullshit.

1291
01:08:53,739 --> 01:08:54,180
Like I would...

1292
01:08:54,819 --> 01:08:56,840
All of it.

1293
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,560
And then I would be so confident and relaxed on the day

1294
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,520
because I literally have already hosted it 20 times

1295
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,899
that I'd turn up and I was so relaxed

1296
01:09:05,899 --> 01:09:07,479
that I had the presence of mind

1297
01:09:07,479 --> 01:09:11,319
to be unbelievably spontaneous and off-the-cuff.

1298
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:14,020
And so there was a combination of all this magic

1299
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:15,640
of like how the hell did he...

1300
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:16,520
He was so relaxed.

1301
01:09:16,699 --> 01:09:18,619
He thought of that thing that happened in the moment

1302
01:09:18,619 --> 01:09:21,439
that you could never plan for

1303
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:24,619
combined with all of this shit that I totally planned for.

1304
01:09:24,819 --> 01:09:26,699
And that was the magic, apparently.

1305
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,319
Well, there's genius in that

1306
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,220
because I don't see that as, you know,

1307
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:34,079
watching and working alongside, you know, comedians,

1308
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:35,880
they are so prepared.

1309
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:37,579
And to be consistently good,

1310
01:09:38,079 --> 01:09:39,359
you have to be prepared, really.

1311
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:41,060
And the amount of writing that goes on

1312
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,640
to make a joke look funny and look spontaneous

1313
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,920
is the gift, really, isn't it?

1314
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,039
And no one, you know, you listen to Seinfeld,

1315
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:49,640
I know those guys,

1316
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:53,159
it's the amount of effort and work that goes,

1317
01:09:53,539 --> 01:09:54,680
even at my very, very,

1318
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,460
very low level,

1319
01:09:55,539 --> 01:09:57,859
I talk to myself all the time

1320
01:09:57,859 --> 01:09:58,939
and don't realise the kids say,

1321
01:09:59,000 --> 01:09:59,819
Dad, you're doing it again.

1322
01:10:00,439 --> 01:10:02,899
And what I'm doing is, you know,

1323
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:05,079
something's coming up I've got to talk about

1324
01:10:05,079 --> 01:10:08,100
and I am rehearsing it in my brain.

1325
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:11,840
But the words start coming out loud more often than not,

1326
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,180
which may be a sign of insanity.

1327
01:10:14,439 --> 01:10:15,859
But I think it's hard.

1328
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,819
I mean, I'm not sure anyone's good enough, are they,

1329
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,859
to do it all with that preparation.

1330
01:10:19,899 --> 01:10:23,319
I used to watch Ed and he'd be down the barrel

1331
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:24,659
and able to have a thought,

1332
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:28,199
and deliver it, and then thought, and deliver it,

1333
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:29,479
and have a thought, and deliver it.

1334
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,819
And I know he's well rehearsed.

1335
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,699
Like, I know he's one of the great masters of, like,

1336
01:10:33,739 --> 01:10:35,640
do your preparation and, you know,

1337
01:10:35,659 --> 01:10:37,579
don't leave anything to chance and all of that.

1338
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:41,460
But, you know, it's like my leadership.

1339
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,560
You know, when it's natural and I'm chatting to you,

1340
01:10:43,819 --> 01:10:47,399
it feels, you know, you say I'm a good communicator.

1341
01:10:47,779 --> 01:10:51,060
When I'm sort of, when I have to deliver,

1342
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:54,619
I find myself sloppy and I get,

1343
01:10:54,659 --> 01:10:57,460
you know, disappointed in having to use so,

1344
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,520
like, my vocab is so minimal.

1345
01:10:59,899 --> 01:11:03,239
Like, I would feel, I wish I read for 30 years

1346
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:06,340
to have vocab-like people around me where I just go,

1347
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:08,180
holy shit, that was crystal.

1348
01:11:08,779 --> 01:11:10,159
Like, bang, bullseye.

1349
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,420
And I'm, like, talking about warm and fuzzies

1350
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:14,600
until someone just nods and goes, yeah, I get it.

1351
01:11:16,779 --> 01:11:19,739
You're incredibly harsh on yourself, mate,

1352
01:11:19,739 --> 01:11:23,779
is what I'm hearing come through the airwaves big time today.

1353
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:25,680
Like, the sense of collaboration we see

1354
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,880
is a superpower now for the leaders.

1355
01:11:27,939 --> 01:11:29,239
How important has that been for you

1356
01:11:29,239 --> 01:11:31,159
in your work life, collaborating?

1357
01:11:32,859 --> 01:11:35,159
Well, I was really bad at it in radio.

1358
01:11:35,579 --> 01:11:38,800
I mean, I came from Getaway and Getaway was,

1359
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:42,380
I was the host, you had a cameraman, sounder and a producer

1360
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:44,140
and the four of us would go away.

1361
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:46,319
And for 10 years, I would do that.

1362
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:49,920
And, you know, I was in control of my particular piece.

1363
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,619
It was very clear defined roles.

1364
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:53,319
Before that, yes,

1365
01:11:53,319 --> 01:11:57,380
I was working with workshops with Reach for 15 years,

1366
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,920
but I didn't really like working with other people

1367
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,039
because I felt like I couldn't rely on them

1368
01:12:02,039 --> 01:12:03,659
as much as I could rely on myself.

1369
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:06,000
And so that's why I chose,

1370
01:12:06,199 --> 01:12:08,399
rather than running courses and camps and stuff,

1371
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:15,000
that I would just go lone wolf, stereo, car, run a workshop,

1372
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:17,479
rely on myself, stand up there.

1373
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:20,100
And I loved that.

1374
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:22,960
So when I got into radio, Sammy Kev, you know,

1375
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27,819
this is the circles around life.

1376
01:12:29,399 --> 01:12:33,840
When I got into radio, he was my executive producer.

1377
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:38,939
And, you know, so he's known me since Reach, since we were 15.

1378
01:12:39,619 --> 01:12:44,460
And so he was able to just keep bashing it out of me,

1379
01:12:44,539 --> 01:12:49,060
like stop being a lone wolf because you've got other people on air.

1380
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,199
And it was very difficult.

1381
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,840
So I only achieved so much.

1382
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,720
But then when I started Tribe, I really got it.

1383
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,119
Like I went, oh, shit.

1384
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:01,579
Because even in radio, I still had to protect myself.

1385
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:04,199
Whereas in Tribe, Tribe was myself.

1386
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:08,840
You know, if the 75 didn't work and it failed,

1387
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:10,500
then that was a reflection of me.

1388
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:14,920
So it really genuinely felt like I had to get out of my own way.

1389
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:20,539
And I still struggle at times with that because, as I said,

1390
01:13:20,539 --> 01:13:21,960
I can be judgmental.

1391
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:27,020
And I have high standards, but it's bashed the shit out of me

1392
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:29,140
in terms of getting me out, you know,

1393
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:34,659
just making me realise that being right is just so toxic.

1394
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:36,800
You know, you've got to be kind.

1395
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:39,699
You've got to, you know, and understanding all of that,

1396
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:43,579
the beauty in diversity, that it's not like what you think.

1397
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,520
And that's the point.

1398
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:48,220
Whereas I always was affirmed everything I thought and did

1399
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:50,479
has worked really well for me in the past.

1400
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:51,840
And then I come into this and go,

1401
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,939
well, I'm just going to keep doing that because I'm right,

1402
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:55,539
because it's worked and I've done well.

1403
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,520
But really, what got me there is not the same person

1404
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,000
that would get me to the next stage.

1405
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:03,479
And that was exactly all around collaboration.

1406
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:06,800
And you say that, but yet at the same time, you know,

1407
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,779
you pick up the phone and you're up for this collaborative

1408
01:14:08,779 --> 01:14:10,399
leadership group we're into called Leader Connect.

1409
01:14:10,539 --> 01:14:12,960
I mean, so it's not as though you're not prepared

1410
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,260
to put yourself into that situation.

1411
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:15,920
No, I know it now.

1412
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:16,659
I do.

1413
01:14:16,779 --> 01:14:17,199
I do.

1414
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:18,960
I know the value of it.

1415
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,640
I just get in my own way.

1416
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:25,239
But it's, you know, that example that I used before about like,

1417
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:28,840
all right, what are the, what's good about taking all the seats

1418
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,340
out of a bus?

1419
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:30,579
What's bad about that?

1420
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:31,020
Yeah.

1421
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:36,579
That was really, it was a real penny that dropped during that

1422
01:14:36,579 --> 01:14:40,960
because, as I said, I came up with my ways and then I heard

1423
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,619
all these others and it was undeniable.

1424
01:14:42,859 --> 01:14:44,039
I'd never even thought of that.

1425
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,859
I didn't even come from that perspective.

1426
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:50,779
And it was just like shit, just in that simple thing, you know.

1427
01:14:50,779 --> 01:14:57,239
And the more simple it is, the more overt it is, was, holy shit,

1428
01:14:57,319 --> 01:14:58,239
you can't do it by yourself.

1429
01:14:58,279 --> 01:15:00,899
If I had just done that by myself, I would have stopped there.

1430
01:15:00,979 --> 01:15:03,520
Whereas with them, it was just so much broader and better.

1431
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:04,979
So it's amazing.

1432
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:06,739
Yeah, it's a profound thing, isn't it?

1433
01:15:06,739 --> 01:15:09,640
I love hearing you talk about it because it's that gift, isn't it,

1434
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:12,899
of having different ways and different minds and different backgrounds.

1435
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:16,979
And, you know, diversity is one of those words at the moment, isn't it?

1436
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:19,800
You know, for a lot of people, it's just tick that box because I have to.

1437
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:19,899
Yeah.

1438
01:15:19,899 --> 01:15:19,920
Yeah.

1439
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:19,939
Yeah.

1440
01:15:19,939 --> 01:15:19,960
Yeah.

1441
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:19,979
Yeah.

1442
01:15:19,979 --> 01:15:20,000
Yeah.

1443
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:20,020
Yeah.

1444
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:20,039
Yeah.

1445
01:15:20,039 --> 01:15:20,060
Yeah.

1446
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:20,079
Yeah.

1447
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:20,119
Yeah.

1448
01:15:20,119 --> 01:15:20,140
Yeah.

1449
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:20,159
Yeah.

1450
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:20,180
Yeah.

1451
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:20,199
Yeah.

1452
01:15:20,199 --> 01:15:20,239
Yeah.

1453
01:15:20,779 --> 01:15:21,239
Yeah.

1454
01:15:21,239 --> 01:15:21,279
Yeah.

1455
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:21,300
Yeah.

1456
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:21,340
Yeah.

1457
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:21,399
Yeah.

1458
01:15:21,399 --> 01:15:21,420
Yeah.

1459
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:21,439
Yeah.

1460
01:15:21,439 --> 01:15:21,680
Yeah.

1461
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:21,739
Yeah.

1462
01:15:21,739 --> 01:15:21,760
Yeah.

1463
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:22,079
Yeah.

1464
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:22,140
Yeah.

1465
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:22,180
Yeah.

1466
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:22,279
Yeah.

1467
01:15:22,279 --> 01:15:22,300
Yeah.

1468
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:22,500
Yeah.

1469
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:22,819
Yeah.

1470
01:15:22,819 --> 01:15:22,840
Yeah.

1471
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:23,319
Yeah.

1472
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:23,380
Yeah.

1473
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:23,439
Yeah.

1474
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:23,500
Yeah.

1475
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:23,520
Yeah.

1476
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,739
You mentioned Stacey in our space.

1477
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:30,859
She brings a perspective I could never, ever think of or an amazing way about her that

1478
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:34,300
is so far removed from anything I could ever create and think.

1479
01:15:34,619 --> 01:15:39,760
So, you know, getting better and better at understanding it as you get older.

1480
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:44,439
But asking these two final questions to everyone, Jules, starting with an answer I think I might

1481
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:44,640
know.

1482
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,340
Who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1483
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:49,619
Mick Malloy.

1484
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:52,020
That one.

1485
01:15:52,819 --> 01:15:54,600
That was not what I was expecting.

1486
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:55,300
I know.

1487
01:15:55,399 --> 01:15:56,600
That's the only reason I did it.

1488
01:15:58,119 --> 01:15:59,220
He's the best, though.

1489
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:00,779
Oh, Mick Malloy is the best.

1490
01:16:00,899 --> 01:16:01,479
He's the greatest.

1491
01:16:02,439 --> 01:16:05,739
Can I, because, you know, I had the great pleasure of working with Mick

1492
01:16:05,739 --> 01:16:09,100
for eight years of Breakfast Radio, which anyone who knows Mick,

1493
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:13,899
that is a miracle because no one lives, you know, can I just tell,

1494
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:16,720
I've got to get Mick on, I've got to get him on this podcast

1495
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:17,720
because it'll be brilliant.

1496
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:24,520
And just this is a man, Jules, who, you know, had in his contract

1497
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:30,560
that if he got pissed and had a big night, he could just play a gold card

1498
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,119
and have the day off the next day.

1499
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:37,800
So he had six or so and his brother, you know, the great Richard Malloy,

1500
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:39,420
they just negotiated.

1501
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:44,399
And the only person I've met, the more that he fucked up,

1502
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:46,500
the better and more people loved him.

1503
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:47,500
It was like, what a genius.

1504
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:50,720
You know, and he could just negotiate whatever he wanted to,

1505
01:16:51,479 --> 01:16:53,140
which is probably why we had him for eight years.

1506
01:16:53,239 --> 01:16:54,119
But he is a genius.

1507
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:55,899
He is unique.

1508
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:57,119
So you mentioned him because.

1509
01:16:57,979 --> 01:17:04,079
I just, I mentioned him because, you know, he's the most authentic,

1510
01:17:04,359 --> 01:17:08,699
colourful character and he has just created an amazing brand

1511
01:17:08,699 --> 01:17:10,180
and also a great world for him.

1512
01:17:10,279 --> 01:17:13,640
But in terms of leadership, Jim was phenomenal.

1513
01:17:13,939 --> 01:17:16,800
And, you know, I miss the big fella.

1514
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:17,079
Yeah.

1515
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:21,760
He would have been doing so much, so much more.

1516
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:25,699
You know, he, by now he would have been, already have been the Lord Mayor

1517
01:17:25,699 --> 01:17:27,859
of Melbourne and off it again, no doubt.

1518
01:17:28,199 --> 01:17:32,979
You know, he'd be doing something in politics, but he was only halfway.

1519
01:17:33,619 --> 01:17:37,420
And although he lived a full life in only half,

1520
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:41,979
he would have just done so much more and, you know, I miss him.

1521
01:17:41,979 --> 01:17:47,399
So I am very much thankful for him, but also so many people like yourself, Luke.

1522
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:51,479
You know, that really have unbelievable emotional intelligence

1523
01:17:51,479 --> 01:17:54,340
and create environments that I still can benefit from.

1524
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,479
Very kind of you, mate.

1525
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:00,680
If you could collaborate with anyone and any particular one of your passions

1526
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:03,079
and you're full of passion in many spaces,

1527
01:18:03,239 --> 01:18:06,539
have you ever thought of, I'd love to get hold of that person?

1528
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:07,720
Is it anyone springs to mind?

1529
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:13,579
Scott Galloway is a marketing professor.

1530
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:19,579
And yeah, I have a non-sexual crush on him.

1531
01:18:20,539 --> 01:18:24,859
But specifically on his brain, I just think he's, you know,

1532
01:18:24,899 --> 01:18:26,039
he's in his fifties.

1533
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:28,560
He's just a, he's a very cool guy.

1534
01:18:28,979 --> 01:18:30,600
He's super smart.

1535
01:18:30,779 --> 01:18:31,739
He's ballsy.

1536
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:33,520
He's articulate.

1537
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:37,579
And, you know, I just love his opinions on the world.

1538
01:18:38,279 --> 01:18:39,659
Got his own podcast, Jules?

1539
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:41,260
Yeah, called Pivot.

1540
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:46,840
And then he has section four, but you can Google Scott Galloway

1541
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,899
and he has a weekly newsletter.

1542
01:18:48,899 --> 01:18:50,220
And whether you're in,

1543
01:18:50,539 --> 01:18:53,960
whether you're in marketing or in tech or in business,

1544
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:57,979
regardless, you will just absolutely fall in love with his writing.

1545
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:01,939
And so every Saturday you'll get, you'll get an email and,

1546
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:04,180
and it'll be something fascinating.

1547
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:07,800
It'll be about AI this week or it'll be about Elon Musk last week.

1548
01:19:07,859 --> 01:19:12,159
And I just find him to be absolutely captivating

1549
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:13,779
and would love to collaborate with him.

1550
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:15,840
Yeah. Thanks for, for sharing that.

1551
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,119
I have on your recommendation, listen to an incredible thinker,

1552
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:20,380
isn't it?

1553
01:19:20,539 --> 01:19:24,140
Incredible, clear and smart and, and, and articulate Jules.

1554
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:29,279
I've loved every minute of sitting down with you and I'm up for round two of dodgeball,

1555
01:19:29,399 --> 01:19:29,560
mate.

1556
01:19:29,579 --> 01:19:31,359
I need to redeem myself.

1557
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:33,140
I've been ruled out, have I?

1558
01:19:33,619 --> 01:19:33,840
Yeah.

1559
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:35,420
It's just a bit full this week.

1560
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:36,079
Really?

1561
01:19:36,539 --> 01:19:37,500
Maybe the week after.

1562
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:42,640
Maybe, maybe Max, you can come, maybe Bec, but yeah,

1563
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,800
I just think, you know, I would love to have you.

1564
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,739
We'd love to have you.

1565
01:19:46,739 --> 01:19:48,680
There's a lot of people that want to get you back.

1566
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:53,680
I think there's a return to, I might have to share your,

1567
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:56,899
your vision just to, to, to actually tell people it did happen.

1568
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,039
It wasn't a great moment.

1569
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:04,000
Hey, Jules, I've fully appreciated you and thank you so much for being open-minded as you are to,

1570
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:07,500
to join a leader connect and sharing with us the benefits of it.

1571
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,880
Really appreciate it.

1572
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,300
I know a lot of people listen to this and think, well,

1573
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:16,439
it's a profound life that you've lived, mate, with so much more in the tank to give and always enjoy catching up with you.

1574
01:20:16,439 --> 01:20:16,859
Thanks again.

1575
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:18,119
Don't be stupid.

1576
01:20:18,119 --> 01:20:18,479
People like,

1577
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:19,859
still aren't listening at this time.

1578
01:20:22,199 --> 01:20:23,819
They lived ages ago.

1579
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:27,239
No one gives a shit that much about what I have to say.

1580
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:30,060
I promise you mate, no one has left at all.

1581
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:33,359
All right, here's a tip, pineapple, pineapple.

1582
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:34,319
That's the code word.

1583
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:38,039
If you're still listening, tweet pineapple at Jules Lund.

1584
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:41,279
Done, done.

1585
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:42,479
You watch, you watch.

1586
01:20:42,659 --> 01:20:43,159
Thanks mate.

1587
