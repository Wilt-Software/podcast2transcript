1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,740
What does it take to lead the Australian cricket team?

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,720
And how do you change the way you coach

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,560
to deal with the different personalities

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,779
that you need to connect with?

5
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,010
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

6
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:21,489
The idea of self-improvement and leadership

7
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:22,910
both on and off the field

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,670
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,289
With one of my oldest friends,

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,570
we created a leader collective

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,190
and have had the privilege of working

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,309
with thousands of leaders in education,

13
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:33,490
sport, industry and the arts

14
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,409
that have helped shift to what we see

15
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:37,450
as the 21st century style of leadership

16
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,929
where everyone has a voice.

17
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,049
In this podcast,

18
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:43,490
we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

19
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,090
I was lucky enough to speak

20
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,270
with Australian sporting legend

21
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,969
and the current Australian cricket coach,

22
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:03,630
Justin Langer,

23
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,870
about how he leads an elite sporting team

24
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,849
full of players with different personalities

25
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:10,209
and how he takes that leadership off the field.

26
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:13,450
Well, this is a great honour to speak

27
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,569
to one of the finest sportsmen

28
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:17,069
that Australia has ever produced

29
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:18,549
at any sport at any level

30
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:20,049
and who has now gone

31
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:21,510
on to be an incredible coach

32
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,049
of the Australian cricket team.

33
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,989
Our speaker, Justin Langer,

34
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:25,609
whose record speaks for itself.

35
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,049
But the thing that stands out to me,

36
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:28,310
scoring more first-class runs

37
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,969
than anyone in cricket history

38
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:31,390
is just a remarkable achievement.

39
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:32,609
JL, it's a great pleasure

40
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:33,310
to chat to you today.

41
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,010
Thanks, Luke.

42
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,469
Let me put it in perspective, though.

43
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:38,129
It took Don Bradman about 100 games

44
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:40,150
and it took me about 1,000 games.

45
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,069
So they'll keep that one in perspective, OK?

46
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:43,689
Not many people have a list

47
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:44,950
where Don Bradman's number two

48
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,310
and they're number one, though, JL.

49
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,090
So it doesn't matter

50
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,370
how long it took to get there.

51
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,590
It's a remarkable,

52
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,310
a remarkable achievement.

53
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,010
Perhaps I want to jump to,

54
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,069
you know, you debuted,

55
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:55,489
I think you're 22 years of age,

56
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,829
1993, the West Indies in Adelaide.

57
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:00,189
And you go on to play

58
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:02,829
in one of the greatest teams of all time

59
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:03,790
with just extraordinary

60
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,590
once-in-a-generation type players.

61
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,129
We're talking about leadership today

62
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:09,229
in a world of collaboration.

63
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,729
What was the leadership like

64
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:11,689
for you as a young man

65
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:13,069
walking into that environment?

66
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:14,870
I remember Johnny Wilkinson,

67
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:17,169
the great rugby union player.

68
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:18,969
And he was once interviewed

69
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:20,409
by Michael Parkinson.

70
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:22,150
Michael Parkinson asked him

71
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,310
a similar question.

72
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,650
He said,

73
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:25,289
why did you become a great player?

74
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,669
And I remember Johnny Wilkinson saying,

75
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:29,889
he sort of thought about it for a while.

76
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,270
He goes,

77
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:30,770
Michael,

78
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:32,710
you are the changing room

79
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,669
that you walk into.

80
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:36,889
And what a great way to sum it up.

81
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,330
I mean, I,

82
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,669
and I think that's why

83
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:40,590
I'm so passionate about leadership now.

84
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,909
I walked into a change room

85
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:44,949
where Alan Borda was the captain.

86
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:48,669
Mate, tough, tough, tough.

87
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,189
And Bob Simpson was the coach.

88
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,389
And whoa, he was tough as well.

89
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,830
And then you talk about David Boone,

90
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:57,210
who's become a lifelong friend.

91
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,830
I was actually rooming with Boone

92
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,909
when his father died

93
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:01,349
of a sudden heart attack.

94
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,129
So these lifelong,

95
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,050
you know, friendships that come,

96
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:06,949
but just leadership, leadership.

97
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:08,250
And then we had Mark Taylor,

98
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,050
who was the captain.

99
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,110
And then Steve Waugh, of course.

100
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:11,949
I mean, Steve Waugh,

101
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:12,889
if he asked me to run

102
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:14,270
through a brick wall right now,

103
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:15,669
I'd run as hard as I could.

104
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:18,590
That such was my respect for him as a coach.

105
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,250
As a leader.

106
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:21,569
Then, of course, Ricky Ponting.

107
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:23,189
You know, great leaders.

108
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,030
And John Buchanan, the great coach.

109
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,689
That's why I was so passionate.

110
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,569
I love leadership

111
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:28,909
because I was so fortunate

112
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,409
to learn from some of the great leaders

113
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:32,270
in my sport.

114
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,490
And, you know,

115
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,330
to be in that change room was unbelievable.

116
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,349
I remember talking to Paul Roos

117
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:39,590
and he had, as a player,

118
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:40,870
he had a list of things

119
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,889
that annoyed him about

120
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,330
the way AFL footballers,

121
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:46,310
a legendary AFL footballer, Paul Roos,

122
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,409
played 350 games,

123
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:48,330
one of the all-time greats.

124
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:48,569
But there was a lot of things

125
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,409
that were done

126
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,009
that he just didn't think

127
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:52,189
were the right way.

128
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:53,750
And when he went on to become a coach,

129
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:54,370
he had that list

130
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,210
and he kept it with him

131
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,810
that he would never do as a coach.

132
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:57,449
Was there anything

133
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:58,909
that you thought

134
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:00,169
you could do better as a player

135
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:01,449
now that you're a coach?

136
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,669
Oh, I think

137
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:04,289
what happens as a player

138
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:05,050
is you learn.

139
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:05,710
I mean, that's where

140
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,729
and you learn from success.

141
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:09,009
You learn from failure.

142
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:10,469
You learn from watching champions.

143
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:11,569
You learn from watching

144
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:13,110
the people who don't quite make it,

145
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,229
who have got great talent.

146
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:15,250
So you learn.

147
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:16,350
You just learn and learn.

148
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,889
And then I think what happens, Luke,

149
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:18,329
is that

150
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,189
and my main advice

151
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:22,129
for any aspiring leader

152
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:22,790
or any leader

153
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,550
and they'd understand

154
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,329
is you've got to know

155
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:25,149
what you stand for.

156
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,230
So I guess in my learnings

157
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,350
from the people I dealt with

158
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,629
and what I experienced as a player

159
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:32,829
and what I'd read

160
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:34,970
and people away from the game

161
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,170
is what I stood for.

162
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:37,889
And like Paul,

163
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:39,230
I spoke to Paul yesterday

164
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,370
as well,

165
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,269
just as a mentor

166
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:43,829
or for some advice

167
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:45,089
and a few things about our team.

168
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,389
But I know exactly

169
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:47,670
and I often say to people,

170
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,250
you should be able

171
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,569
to write on a table napkin

172
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:52,709
what you stand for as a leader.

173
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:54,850
And when you do that,

174
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,250
then you know

175
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,569
what you don't compromise on.

176
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:59,029
You know what your players

177
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:00,189
know what is expected.

178
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:01,490
And then from there,

179
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,689
you've got a good foundation

180
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:03,529
to move forward.

181
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,790
So have you actually got that, JL,

182
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:06,550
like your purpose

183
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,350
and who you are?

184
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:09,089
You can see that

185
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:09,870
and visualise that

186
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,529
and write that down.

187
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:11,970
This is Justin Langer as a leader

188
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,610
and this is what I stand for.

189
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:15,310
Is that something that you look at?

190
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:16,670
I can tell you right now.

191
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,189
It's like,

192
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:18,209
if I look back,

193
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:19,370
back on my playing days,

194
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,170
I knew exactly what I meant.

195
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,209
And I think what I've learned

196
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:24,730
is the champions in life,

197
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,769
whatever they do,

198
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:27,449
their great art

199
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:28,850
is to simplify things.

200
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:30,389
So if you had asked me

201
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,050
what my philosophy on coaching is,

202
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,029
currently with the Australian cricket team,

203
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,250
our main goal

204
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,870
is to make Australians proud of us.

205
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,189
After what happened in South Africa

206
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:40,870
a few years ago,

207
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:42,329
and I say to our players,

208
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,170
if you wake up every single day

209
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,189
with thinking of nothing else,

210
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,009
make Australians proud.

211
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:48,949
Because that includes your mum

212
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:49,449
and your dad

213
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,110
and your grandparents

214
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,069
and your mates

215
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:52,509
and the wider public.

216
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:54,910
So one,

217
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,250
we make Australians proud.

218
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,949
We develop great cricketers

219
00:05:57,949 --> 00:05:59,009
and great people.

220
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,529
Because it's one thing

221
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:01,449
to be a great cricketer,

222
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,430
but it's very, very hard

223
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,850
to make Australians proud

224
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,329
if you're not a great person as well.

225
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,370
And the other thing is about in sport,

226
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:11,089
your career finishes

227
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:12,550
at quite a young age.

228
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:15,430
So developing as a great person

229
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,370
is important as well.

230
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,370
And I say,

231
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,209
we do that by the values

232
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,870
or the behaviours of professionalism,

233
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,230
of humility,

234
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:24,129
of honesty,

235
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:25,870
of learning

236
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,750
and of mateship.

237
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,990
And that's what we're about.

238
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,170
And that's, you know,

239
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,970
and I talk about it all the time.

240
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:32,350
And, you know,

241
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:34,829
I can go into a lot more detail

242
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,670
on all those behaviours or values.

243
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,069
I can go into more detail

244
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:39,290
and make Australians proud

245
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,790
of great cricketers and great people.

246
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,389
But that's what I stand for.

247
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,310
And that's what I don't compromise on.

248
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,930
And that's the foundation

249
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,310
for my leadership.

250
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,670
In this current team.

251
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:50,910
Yeah, that's such a, you know,

252
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,930
an amazing thing to hear you share that.

253
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:54,069
And it just sounds so clear.

254
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,910
And you can hear the passion

255
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,550
come out in your voice.

256
00:06:56,769 --> 00:06:58,810
And you mentioned that Alan Borders

257
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,209
and then you played with the Shane Warnes

258
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:02,930
and, you know, Glenn McGraths

259
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:03,829
and Gilchrist.

260
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:04,990
And the list goes on

261
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,370
of just these remarkable players.

262
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:08,069
And you probably would think

263
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,370
that's just an environment

264
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,269
you can't lose

265
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:11,610
and everything's happy.

266
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,990
But those teams still have

267
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,709
their great challenges

268
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:15,269
and there's factions within teams

269
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,389
and there's, you know,

270
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:17,069
certain people,

271
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,410
have better relationships

272
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:18,889
than others.

273
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:20,529
How did great teams

274
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:21,610
with great players

275
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,350
deal with that sort of adversity

276
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,889
along the way?

277
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:25,050
Well, yeah, I mean,

278
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:25,889
there's no doubt.

279
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,910
I mean, we have challenges

280
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,629
every single,

281
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,730
because we're all human

282
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,029
and humans are complex, right?

283
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:33,149
We can get complacent.

284
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,110
We can get flat.

285
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,009
We can, you know,

286
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,569
that goes on.

287
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:38,649
There's a couple of things

288
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:39,310
to this question.

289
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:39,970
One is,

290
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:42,209
I've learned as a coach

291
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:44,529
is that every single person's different.

292
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:46,009
So you gotta treat everyone differently.

293
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,350
So, and I,

294
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:47,689
I've learned that

295
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:48,870
and like you got four kids,

296
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:49,990
like I've got four kids

297
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,850
and what I've learned

298
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:51,910
from being a dad

299
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,649
is that I've got four daughters

300
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:54,949
that come from the same place,

301
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,610
same upbringing.

302
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:56,569
They're all so different.

303
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,529
So the reason I say that

304
00:07:58,529 --> 00:07:59,769
if my kids are all different,

305
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:01,629
all my players are gonna be different

306
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:02,470
and you're gonna treat them

307
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,310
all differently, right?

308
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:03,970
And a lot of,

309
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,750
a lot of the mistake

310
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,490
a lot of coaches,

311
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:07,589
a lot of leaders make

312
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:08,610
is they try and treat

313
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,470
everyone the same.

314
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:10,329
We can't do that.

315
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,769
Shane Moore is very different

316
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:12,930
than Adam Gilchrist,

317
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:13,949
who's very different

318
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:14,730
than Steve Moore,

319
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:15,550
who's very different

320
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,589
than Glenn McGrath.

321
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,629
Maddy Hayden and I,

322
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:18,970
who are,

323
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:20,209
we're very different as well.

324
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:22,149
So the trick is

325
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:23,610
to know what the,

326
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:26,069
to know what the expectations are

327
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:27,629
and then let everyone

328
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:28,790
within those boundaries

329
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,790
be themselves.

330
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,490
And, and if they step outside of that,

331
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:33,669
well, then there's issues.

332
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,690
But the,

333
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:35,669
that's the challenge

334
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,129
is to treat everyone differently

335
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:38,110
and with respect

336
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,269
and let them weave their magic

337
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,590
in their different style.

338
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,649
Yeah, you and Maddy Hayden scored,

339
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:46,250
you know, more runs in partnership

340
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:46,769
than anyone,

341
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:46,970
than anyone in,

342
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:47,350
than anyone in the,

343
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,250
in Australian cricket history,

344
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,549
the fourth most of all time.

345
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,649
And, but as you said,

346
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,190
there's differences

347
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,809
even in that great relationship.

348
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:54,350
And did you have your blues?

349
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,230
Did you have your moments

350
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,929
where you guys had to sit down

351
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:57,629
and thrash it out,

352
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,350
the two of you?

353
00:08:58,649 --> 00:08:59,669
Yeah, every now and then,

354
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,409
but we had a few out in the middle,

355
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,190
but no, actually,

356
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:02,889
we didn't have our blues.

357
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,629
We just, because we had such trust

358
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:06,710
and respect and love for each other,

359
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,350
we had to every now and then say,

360
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:09,809
mate, come on, pull your head in.

361
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,570
You've got to concentrate

362
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,549
or I'd say, mate, come on, come on.

363
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,690
And that was all about our,

364
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:14,750
the communication,

365
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,549
our relationship.

366
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,330
But I'm not sure about you,

367
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,690
I've got four daughters

368
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,350
and please,

369
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,330
for all the women

370
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,129
who are listening to this,

371
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,750
and I love my daughters

372
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,669
more than anything else,

373
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,570
but I know you, Das,

374
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:26,169
but my mates,

375
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:26,970
I've got my mates

376
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,690
since I'm a kid

377
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,809
and my mates in the team,

378
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:30,190
we don't really argue much.

379
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,370
We just get on with it.

380
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:33,610
We don't agree on everything.

381
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,450
Whereas girls,

382
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,549
my gosh, my daughters,

383
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:38,289
the fighting they have,

384
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,210
and then they've got

385
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,470
their girlfriends at school

386
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,429
and oh, man,

387
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,870
it's one of the great lessons of all.

388
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:45,289
I don't know how they do it.

389
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,330
But so we didn't have

390
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,090
that many arguments,

391
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,309
but we disagreed

392
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:49,990
on a lot of things

393
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,889
or we talked it through

394
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:52,309
and, you know,

395
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,029
we got on with it.

396
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,529
I do need to ask you

397
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:55,789
about the father

398
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:56,470
of four daughters.

399
00:09:56,909 --> 00:09:57,750
I've got one,

400
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,509
the beautiful Sienna,

401
00:09:58,769 --> 00:09:59,509
who I love,

402
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:00,450
but the three boys

403
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,909
are a fair bit

404
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:03,110
less complicated,

405
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:03,570
I'd say,

406
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:04,889
than a 15-year-old daughter.

407
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:06,149
And I look at you

408
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:06,549
and think,

409
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:07,570
geez, there must be

410
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,470
some amazing moments

411
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,830
in the house

412
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,629
because the father-daughter

413
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:11,269
relation to me

414
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:12,070
is completely different.

415
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:13,289
It's just so special

416
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:14,970
and she, you know,

417
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:16,610
I almost feel like

418
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,309
it's a different parent

419
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:17,809
and it's almost,

420
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,570
you can't compare it

421
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,289
to parenting boys

422
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:19,750
and you love,

423
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,470
but God, it's complex, mate.

424
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:22,169
How do you deal

425
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:22,889
with four girls?

426
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,590
How does your self-leadership

427
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,110
work on the home front?

428
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:27,370
There's two things

429
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,190
I learned as a dad

430
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:28,750
for daughters.

431
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:31,649
One is how I treat my wife

432
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:33,129
is very, very important

433
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:35,169
because how I treat my wife

434
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:36,350
is how they'll expect

435
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,529
to be treated by men,

436
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,789
which is very important.

437
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:41,230
The second thing is,

438
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,289
and the number one,

439
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:44,769
probably in any leadership,

440
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:46,029
one is vision.

441
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,309
So you know what you stand for,

442
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,330
but two is example.

443
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,169
And the greatest gift

444
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:52,190
I can give my daughters,

445
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:53,889
not only how I treat my wife,

446
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,690
but my example to them.

447
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:57,870
And I think about that thing,

448
00:10:57,909 --> 00:10:58,789
if I'm trying to make them

449
00:10:58,789 --> 00:10:59,669
proud every day,

450
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,429
then I'm doing the right things,

451
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:02,570
I'm living the right way

452
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,830
and that's hopefully

453
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,250
the example that they'll learn.

454
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:06,809
So example and knowing

455
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:07,610
what you stand for,

456
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,210
your vision,

457
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:10,070
are as important as a dad

458
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,250
as they are as the coach

459
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,309
of the Australian cricket team.

460
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,590
Yeah, beautifully said.

461
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,009
Such a great, great example

462
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,809
and everyone can relate to that

463
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:17,309
on the home front.

464
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,330
It's not always easy,

465
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:19,990
but the example,

466
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,110
kids pick up on the example,

467
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:21,850
you know,

468
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:23,070
you can have all the words in the world,

469
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:25,049
but they follow the example so closely.

470
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,070
I want to just pivot,

471
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:27,429
Jay, I know you're involved

472
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:28,309
in a collaboration

473
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:29,350
I want to ask you about,

474
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,570
which, you know,

475
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,610
pretty exciting thing you're doing

476
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,289
with a handful of other coaches.

477
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:35,129
You mentioned you're on the phone

478
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:35,750
to Paul Roos,

479
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:36,769
but I know regularly

480
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:38,549
you catch up with a group of coaches.

481
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:39,330
John Worsfold

482
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,049
has a legendary Western Australian,

483
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:43,149
maybe the greatest AFL leader

484
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:44,230
in Western Australian history.

485
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:45,649
Ben Rutten is the current coach

486
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:46,870
of the Essendon Football Club.

487
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,470
Trent Robinson,

488
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,509
an NRL Premiership coach

489
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,570
for the Roosters two times.

490
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:51,789
Matt King is his assistant.

491
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:52,389
Will Weaver,

492
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:54,230
who's gone on to the Houston Rockets.

493
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,710
Don Pike is a legend of the West as well

494
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,629
and a great mate of yours

495
00:11:57,629 --> 00:11:59,009
who's just finished coaching

496
00:11:59,009 --> 00:11:59,909
the Adelaide Crows

497
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:00,730
and now the Sydney Swans.

498
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:01,509
And a group of you

499
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:03,370
initially planned to get together

500
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,429
for about eight sessions,

501
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,029
but I understand eight months later

502
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:07,250
you're on a Zoom

503
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,250
or a Microsoft Teams

504
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,149
every fortnight.

505
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,370
Why do you take the time

506
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,669
in your incredibly busy schedule

507
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,230
to collaborate with people

508
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,210
outside of your sport?

509
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:15,370
It's like medicine.

510
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,629
Honestly, because what happens is,

511
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,169
and Luke, you can see

512
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:21,409
the painting behind me,

513
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,929
but I've just had a big,

514
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:26,850
next time we speak,

515
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,629
I've got the,

516
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,730
I've got it here

517
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,409
because I've just been,

518
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,230
the man, anyone out there,

519
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:32,649
the man in the arena

520
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:33,789
by Theodore Roosevelt,

521
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:34,909
and that's going to literally

522
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:36,149
go on this whole wall.

523
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:36,490
Yep.

524
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,149
Because the reason I say

525
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:38,909
it's like medicine,

526
00:12:39,169 --> 00:12:40,509
it's so nice to be able

527
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,970
to talk to different men

528
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,690
who walk in your shoes.

529
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:46,649
We all have the same challenges,

530
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:48,789
we all have the same criticisms,

531
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:51,029
we all have the same emotions,

532
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:53,190
but not many people really get it.

533
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,669
But they all get it.

534
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,649
They're all head coaches

535
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,629
and to be able to just talk

536
00:12:57,629 --> 00:12:58,490
and, oh, I'm glad

537
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,809
it's just not me feeling like that.

538
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:00,970
And just that one thing

539
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,370
we don't do great as Aussie men,

540
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:04,029
and I've learned this

541
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:05,389
over the journey,

542
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,070
is we don't speak enough

543
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,789
and to have great mentors

544
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:10,590
or great mates

545
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,549
who you can speak to

546
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:13,629
about things that are topical

547
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:15,009
or things that relate to you.

548
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:16,789
I know we spoke earlier,

549
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,610
about your physical

550
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,529
and mental health

551
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:20,710
and to be able to talk it out

552
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,610
as an Aussie bloke

553
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,049
and to be able to talk to those guys,

554
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:24,669
oh, it's just gold.

555
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:25,789
It's honestly like medicine.

556
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:26,429
I love it.

557
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:27,610
We have a laugh,

558
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:28,570
we get serious,

559
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,330
we talk about some serious points,

560
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,649
but great mentors.

561
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,789
I wouldn't be here now

562
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:34,870
talking to you

563
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,970
without great mentors in my life

564
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,750
and certainly those guys

565
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,889
are turning into great mates

566
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:41,289
and great mentors for me.

567
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,509
Beautifully said,

568
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,710
Theodore Roosevelt,

569
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,490
the man in the arena.

570
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,710
It's one of the most,

571
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,490
prophetic statements

572
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,509
I think people like you

573
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:51,090
who spend your life in the arena.

574
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,690
What sort of specific things

575
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,929
can you get into

576
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:55,350
a little bit of detail, JL,

577
00:13:55,429 --> 00:13:56,629
that something's happening

578
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:57,309
in your world

579
00:13:57,309 --> 00:13:58,649
and just to be able to bounce it off

580
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:00,549
someone who's dealing with it

581
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:01,330
at the same time,

582
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,269
what sort of examples work for you?

583
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:04,330
Oh, wow.

584
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:06,169
Well, I talked about the other day

585
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:07,009
when we caught up,

586
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:08,990
I talked about some of the challenges

587
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,490
we've got through this COVID period,

588
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,110
for example,

589
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:11,970
in AFL,

590
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:13,409
being on the board

591
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:14,409
of the West Coast Eagles.

592
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:16,289
I'll never forget, Luke,

593
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:16,590
that,

594
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,789
we had the first game

595
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:20,389
of the AFL season,

596
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,110
as you remember,

597
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,009
Adam Simpson had got me to,

598
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:23,669
I was going to,

599
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:26,769
due to speak to the West Coast boys

600
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:28,610
the morning before the game,

601
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:31,070
give them a bit of a rev up

602
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,409
and the night before on the Friday,

603
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,330
we had an emergency board meeting

604
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,850
and I had my jaw on the table

605
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:39,769
when they were telling me

606
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:40,610
the implications

607
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,470
of what could happen

608
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,149
if this COVID takes off

609
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:46,110
and the AFL season

610
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:46,850
doesn't go ahead.

611
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,570
And I went,

612
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:48,529
man,

613
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:48,889
like,

614
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,450
I couldn't believe

615
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,129
what I was hearing.

616
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:51,429
So,

617
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,309
and from there,

618
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,590
we've seen what's happened to COVID.

619
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:53,809
Now,

620
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:54,710
the challenges,

621
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,789
the reason I say that

622
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:57,190
is to be able to talk

623
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,409
to Trent Robinson

624
00:14:58,409 --> 00:14:59,490
from Rugby League

625
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,909
or Wushart

626
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:01,990
or Don Pike

627
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,710
or Ben

628
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,190
or even Will

629
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,870
from Basketball

630
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,190
made,

631
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:07,870
like we're going,

632
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:09,629
and to be able to talk about that

633
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:10,429
and then the challenges

634
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:11,250
and the complexities

635
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,129
that go with it

636
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:13,389
and how we deal with it

637
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:15,090
and how the guys dealt with it

638
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:15,929
in the hub life

639
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:16,789
and how we've dealt

640
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:17,570
with it in the past

641
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,669
to be able to talk about that.

642
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,029
The other day,

643
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,590
I talked about the hysteria

644
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,250
of losing

645
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,570
and the guys

646
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,210
and that's where

647
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,330
we talk about the man

648
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:25,970
in the arena

649
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:26,610
and the critics.

650
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,669
There's so many critics

651
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:28,769
and with social media

652
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:29,889
and media out there now,

653
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:30,750
you know,

654
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:31,610
how do you deal with it?

655
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:33,029
Our players find it really hard

656
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:33,309
to deal with.

657
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:33,990
How do we deal?

658
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:34,169
So,

659
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,230
they're the sort of topics

660
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:35,870
we talk about.

661
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:37,149
We talk about list management.

662
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:37,950
We talked about

663
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,769
how the guys came back

664
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:41,009
after that six weeks

665
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:42,009
or eight weeks,

666
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:43,610
how they did their training,

667
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,870
like their physical training,

668
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,110
what they did to get them ready

669
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:46,570
for the AFL,

670
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:47,690
we had to do that

671
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,690
with our fast bowlers.

672
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:49,690
I mean,

673
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,909
the topics

674
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:51,409
that come up,

675
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:51,909
leadership,

676
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,909
how do we keep

677
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:55,929
the progression of leadership,

678
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:58,850
the question of culture,

679
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,110
those things,

680
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:00,370
I mean,

681
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:01,289
we can talk about that

682
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:01,850
for hours.

683
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,070
So,

684
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:02,950
they're the sort of subjects

685
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,669
that come up.

686
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:05,230
Sometimes it's formal,

687
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:06,950
sometimes it's very informal

688
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,889
and it's very conversational.

689
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:11,269
I take reams of notes

690
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:12,110
and,

691
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:12,669
you know,

692
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,529
that just helps me

693
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:14,009
to develop

694
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:15,149
as a coach

695
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:15,610
and a leader

696
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,389
and as a person.

697
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:17,429
JL,

698
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:18,450
the old style of leadership

699
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,389
was hierarchical.

700
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:20,289
I'm the boss

701
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:22,289
and I've got my subordinates

702
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:23,789
and you take your instructions

703
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:24,269
and,

704
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:24,750
you know,

705
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:25,669
I probably grew up

706
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:26,590
in an AFL environment

707
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,149
where that was

708
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:28,289
pretty much the norm.

709
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:28,529
You know,

710
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:29,509
you didn't get a lot of,

711
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:30,990
I suppose,

712
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,009
collaboration from a player

713
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:33,850
back to a coach

714
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:34,690
or vice versa

715
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,769
or you certainly didn't see

716
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:36,549
a lot of it.

717
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:37,690
Why are you passionate

718
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,049
about that model, JL?

719
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:40,230
Why do you see,

720
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,429
you know,

721
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,669
collaborating with other equals

722
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:43,889
as beneficial?

723
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,309
The hardest thing

724
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:45,990
about leadership,

725
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,769
is you've got to make

726
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:48,370
the decision.

727
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,090
Right?

728
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:50,690
So,

729
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,429
the reason I love collaboration

730
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:53,169
is because,

731
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,610
and I've got some,

732
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:54,870
look,

733
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:55,610
I've got some guys

734
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,629
inside our tent

735
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:57,909
and outside of our tent

736
00:16:57,909 --> 00:16:58,850
that I talk to a lot

737
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,330
about cricket decisions,

738
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:00,929
for example,

739
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:02,070
but ultimately,

740
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:03,590
the leader has to make decisions.

741
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,369
But to be able to talk

742
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:07,630
to people who I trust

743
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,650
is very,

744
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:09,369
very important

745
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,569
because when you make a decision

746
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,549
and you want to make sure

747
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:14,230
you're not being blinded by,

748
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,970
you know,

749
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:15,970
whether it's loyalty,

750
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,210
or blinded by

751
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,990
what the media is saying.

752
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:19,190
So,

753
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:20,789
I've got a number of people

754
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,970
who I trust,

755
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:22,690
like I say,

756
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,490
within the camp

757
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,069
and outside of the camp.

758
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,170
and that's crucial,

759
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:26,410
mate,

760
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,009
because you want to verify

761
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:29,750
your decisions,

762
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,690
but ultimately,

763
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,190
you have to make the decision.

764
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,759
I just love listening to you

765
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,000
every time you speak.

766
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,240
It's,

767
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:43,420
you know,

768
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,799
yesterday I reached out

769
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:45,960
to Paul Ruse

770
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,319
or I was in town,

771
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,519
so I wanted to learn from,

772
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,039
you know,

773
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,119
what about your learning?

774
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,779
How do you go about doing that?

775
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,859
Is it always looking,

776
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,380
if the opportunity

777
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,859
to learn from someone else?

778
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:55,740
Yeah,

779
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:56,019
I've been,

780
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,660
I've always been a reader.

781
00:17:58,339 --> 00:17:59,980
I read a lot

782
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,980
and I have,

783
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,579
and I've got this great room

784
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:03,160
out the back,

785
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:03,579
Darcy,

786
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,119
you'd love it,

787
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,299
mate.

788
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,140
It used to be,

789
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,400
when we built this house,

790
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,279
it was a,

791
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:08,420
when I was still playing,

792
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,119
it's a five by five metre room,

793
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
which was like my old,

794
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,480
the old tin shed

795
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,500
that I had in the old house

796
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,539
before we knocked it over

797
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:15,900
and it turned into my gym,

798
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:16,880
right?

799
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,140
So,

800
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:17,980
I'd train up there

801
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,380
and anyway,

802
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:19,980
the very first day

803
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,980
we moved into the house,

804
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,859
I got a permanent mark

805
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:22,880
on it,

806
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,680
and wrote across the door,

807
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,339
the pain of discipline

808
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,099
is nothing like

809
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:28,059
the pain of disappointment

810
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:29,279
and I picked that up

811
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,259
and my wife went,

812
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,339
what have you done?

813
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,140
This is a beautiful new house.

814
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,460
Anyway,

815
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:35,660
that room now has turned

816
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,579
from over the 20 years

817
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:38,059
we've lived here,

818
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:39,400
a five by five

819
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,359
to a 10 by five metre room,

820
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:43,559
which then became my study

821
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,359
and my gym

822
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:47,099
and now it's a 15 by five metre room.

823
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:47,299
So,

824
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,519
and you should see it,

825
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,640
the whole walls

826
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,119
are covered

827
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,180
in permanent marker

828
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:52,880
that I've written about

829
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,319
of lessons of my life

830
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,599
that I've learned from people

831
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,940
and it's just,

832
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:58,160
and now my daughter lives up,

833
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,420
my 24 year old daughter

834
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,059
lives up there.

835
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,279
So,

836
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,039
I said,

837
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,180
whatever you want up here,

838
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,519
darling,

839
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:04,599
but you cannot touch the walls

840
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,180
because one,

841
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,980
I'm going to sit in the middle of it

842
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,700
and I'm going to write a book

843
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,859
about lessons I've learned.

844
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,660
and I've always said,

845
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,359
I hope the last day I coach,

846
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,039
I'll still be,

847
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,440
I'll still recognise myself

848
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,339
as a novice coach.

849
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:17,039
So,

850
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:17,519
in other words,

851
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:18,339
I want to keep learning

852
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:20,720
and in the COVID period,

853
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:21,359
my gosh,

854
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,779
some of the people I learned,

855
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,900
you've got to be,

856
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:25,400
have the courage to reach out.

857
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:27,640
I'm fortunate in my,

858
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,440
in my role

859
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,759
that I can reach out to people,

860
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:30,960
but I love talking to people.

861
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:31,700
I love learning.

862
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,380
I love my journals.

863
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,099
I take that many notes

864
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:36,940
and a lot of it goes up on my walls,

865
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:39,700
whether it's quotes or scriptures

866
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,599
or poems or lessons.

867
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:42,960
And it's a really,

868
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,240
it's an inspiring place

869
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:44,700
to be up,

870
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,779
up the back there.

871
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:47,200
We'd love to see a photo of that,

872
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:47,460
Jay.

873
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:47,599
Oh,

874
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:48,240
that'd be brilliant

875
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,440
without getting

876
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,839
the personal information away.

877
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,220
But,

878
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,740
can I go back to

879
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,240
the hard decisions

880
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,660
you've got to make?

881
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,759
You're an Australian cricket coach.

882
00:19:56,859 --> 00:19:57,700
You've got to tell someone

883
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,920
they're not coming on tour.

884
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,400
They're not in the side.

885
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,680
You're on the receiving of that yourself

886
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,380
as every sportsman is at some stage.

887
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,140
How do you deal with,

888
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,259
with those conversations?

889
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,000
One of the first things

890
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,220
that Sir Alex Ferguson said to me,

891
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:14,039
literally in three minutes,

892
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,400
and I don't even know how it goes.

893
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:16,859
Justin,

894
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,759
truth works.

895
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:18,859
What?

896
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:19,279
He goes,

897
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,119
truth works.

898
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:21,839
Two words.

899
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:22,940
I thought,

900
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:23,920
there's my next tattoo.

901
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:24,740
Truth works.

902
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,400
It's written up

903
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,200
and they're back up

904
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,900
in my back room.

905
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:28,680
But,

906
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:31,380
these things are really hard, Luke.

907
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:32,839
But what I've learned,

908
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,140
one of those values

909
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,700
we talk about

910
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,200
in our behaviours

911
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,720
is honesty.

912
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:36,839
It's not just honesty,

913
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,240
meticulously honest

914
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,880
with yourself.

915
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,220
A lot of people aren't,

916
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,680
as you know,

917
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:42,920
but you've got to look

918
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,339
at the Australian way

919
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:44,839
as I know

920
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:45,220
is to look

921
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,500
someone in the eyes

922
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,220
and tell them the truth.

923
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,079
And that's the best way.

924
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,539
At least you can sleep well.

925
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:51,900
They know where they stand.

926
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,200
They know where they're going.

927
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,380
And I promised my dad

928
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,880
when I became a coach,

929
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,319
I promised my dad

930
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,759
that we would be,

931
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:00,019
we'd go overs

932
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:01,039
with communication,

933
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,039
honest communication

934
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:02,740
to our players

935
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,880
because my experience

936
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,440
as a player

937
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,319
is often it was just,

938
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:07,759
you either read it

939
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:08,299
in the paper

940
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:10,200
or I just go

941
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,259
and make more runs, son.

942
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,480
Okay,

943
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:13,299
no worries.

944
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,079
We'll do that.

945
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:14,359
So,

946
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,039
the pact with my dad

947
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,140
is I'll always be honest

948
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:17,880
with my players

949
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,099
and it's a part

950
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:21,000
of leadership

951
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,740
that you learn.

952
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,200
It's a part of

953
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,400
it's a learned skill actually.

954
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:24,700
Believe it or not,

955
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:25,000
you know,

956
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:25,859
you get nervous

957
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:27,000
but also

958
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,400
the great Wayne Bennett

959
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,380
once told me

960
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,960
just remember Justin,

961
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,299
you're not dropping them.

962
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:34,640
They're dropping themselves.

963
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,599
You've just got to communicate

964
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,299
that they've been dropped

965
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:38,700
because you don't get rid

966
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,160
of people

967
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,339
who are performing well

968
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:41,819
or who are good people.

969
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:44,079
You're just the one

970
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:44,799
who's got to tell them

971
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,039
because they drop themselves

972
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,660
99% of the time.

973
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:48,380
Yeah,

974
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,200
as you said at the start,

975
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:50,440
sometimes a simplification

976
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,559
is brilliant,

977
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:51,920
isn't it?

978
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,539
And you can tell

979
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:54,140
from that message

980
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,279
and it is a bit

981
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,099
uncommon sometimes.

982
00:21:56,259 --> 00:21:57,099
I can remember being

983
00:21:57,099 --> 00:21:57,599
in environments

984
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,279
where the truth

985
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,960
was a pretty hard thing

986
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,640
to find.

987
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,839
I loved the Amazon

988
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,579
eight-part test series,

989
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,319
The Test,

990
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,420
produced by Adrian Brown

991
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,779
who's a friend of mine

992
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:10,579
and a great film producer

993
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,859
and sat down

994
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:12,640
with the whole family

995
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,799
and they loved it.

996
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:14,920
It was just an incredible,

997
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:16,359
brilliantly produced

998
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,339
and we got a great

999
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:18,339
insight into you

1000
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:19,420
and I thought you came across

1001
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,559
as you sound,

1002
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:20,819
you know,

1003
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:21,680
vulnerable and open

1004
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:21,799
and, you know,

1005
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,019
collaborative and raw.

1006
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,420
What was that experience like

1007
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,299
opening yourself up

1008
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:26,700
to the cameras in that way?

1009
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:27,539
Well,

1010
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,700
when I did my very first

1011
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,559
press conference

1012
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:31,180
as the Australian

1013
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,940
cricket coach

1014
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,059
and there was a lot going on

1015
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:33,880
with what had happened

1016
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,660
in South Africa,

1017
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,259
I got in the taxi

1018
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:36,940
and I went

1019
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,420
and it was a whirlwind

1020
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,319
24 hours

1021
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,180
and I got in the taxi,

1022
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:40,980
I flew to Melbourne,

1023
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:41,940
did the press conference

1024
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,619
and I'm driving back

1025
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:44,539
to the airport

1026
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:46,779
and there's a guy

1027
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:47,440
named Andre

1028
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,240
with a camera

1029
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,799
and he's just,

1030
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,119
he's asking me questions

1031
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,059
and I'm getting filmed

1032
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:51,720
and I thought

1033
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,420
it was just for

1034
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,680
the CA website

1035
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,480
or another part

1036
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,359
of the press.

1037
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:56,420
Anyway,

1038
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,900
we get to the first tour

1039
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,500
and there's Andre

1040
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:58,960
and I'm going,

1041
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,519
and I had no idea

1042
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,400
we were doing a documentary

1043
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,259
and Andre was literally

1044
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:04,019
with us

1045
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:04,900
everywhere

1046
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,279
for the first 18 months

1047
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:07,180
and I honestly,

1048
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:07,440
mate,

1049
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,460
it was really confronting.

1050
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,859
I was really,

1051
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:10,720
really nervous

1052
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,640
how it was going to come out.

1053
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,420
I was going to be nervous

1054
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,000
how the team

1055
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,740
would be perceived.

1056
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:14,900
I'd be nervous

1057
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,859
how I'd be perceived

1058
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:17,039
but, look,

1059
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,059
they did a great job

1060
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:19,279
and the feedback from it

1061
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:20,579
was extraordinary.

1062
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:21,299
It's going to be

1063
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,359
a great archive for me

1064
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,720
because you are

1065
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,799
opening yourself up

1066
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:26,559
and,

1067
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:27,839
but I was thankful

1068
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,819
how it came across.

1069
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,819
I was really nervous

1070
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:30,880
but it came across well.

1071
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:32,559
One of the funny things,

1072
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,680
I still remember

1073
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,660
standing at the front

1074
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,900
and I rang Adrian

1075
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,359
and said,

1076
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,759
two things happened.

1077
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,160
First,

1078
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,180
we were able to watch them

1079
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,200
before they came out

1080
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,140
and after the first

1081
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,140
or second episode,

1082
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,859
my third daughter, Sophie,

1083
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,640
she got this funny look

1084
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,180
on her face

1085
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:50,740
and she said,

1086
00:23:50,859 --> 00:23:51,099
Dad,

1087
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,119
this is the first time

1088
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,339
I've ever seen you angry

1089
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:55,079
in my life.

1090
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:57,180
I can't believe you get angry

1091
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,759
and I said,

1092
00:23:58,099 --> 00:23:58,559
so one,

1093
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,200
that was hopefully

1094
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,220
a compliment for me

1095
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:00,759
as a dad

1096
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:02,680
but that's what happens

1097
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,160
at work,

1098
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:03,480
you know,

1099
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:04,019
sometimes

1100
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:06,019
and the second thing was

1101
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:07,059
there was an episode

1102
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:09,700
where Nathan Lyon

1103
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,799
had just missed

1104
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:11,559
the run out

1105
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,019
for Ben Stokes

1106
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:14,559
in that amazing test match

1107
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,359
with Ben Stokes.

1108
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,819
We lost an unlosable

1109
00:24:16,819 --> 00:24:17,420
test match.

1110
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:19,380
I kicked the rubbish bin

1111
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,220
and I said,

1112
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:21,680
I said,

1113
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:21,900
mate,

1114
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,779
you can't put that in.

1115
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,440
I said,

1116
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,940
people think I'm a psycho.

1117
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,319
Please don't put that in.

1118
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:27,500
He goes,

1119
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:27,640
yeah,

1120
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,119
but do you see

1121
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:28,799
what you did next?

1122
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,059
I said,

1123
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:29,539
what do you mean

1124
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:30,059
what I did next?

1125
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,700
Nathan Lyon

1126
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,700
has missed this run out

1127
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,019
and my God,

1128
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,119
we're going to lose the Ashes

1129
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:34,859
and what do you mean

1130
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:35,480
what I did next?

1131
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:36,539
I kicked the rubbish bin.

1132
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:37,420
I look like a psycho.

1133
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:37,740
He goes,

1134
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:37,920
yeah,

1135
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,359
but mate,

1136
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,140
with three runs out,

1137
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,359
you picked up all the rubbish

1138
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,359
and you put it back in

1139
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,799
and you talk about humility.

1140
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:45,880
There's humility right there.

1141
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,119
I went,

1142
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:46,440
oh,

1143
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:47,740
anyway,

1144
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,099
okay,

1145
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,039
so they left it in there

1146
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,019
and the amount of people

1147
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:51,500
that said to me,

1148
00:24:51,579 --> 00:24:51,759
mate,

1149
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:52,420
what about when you

1150
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,200
kicked the rubbish bin

1151
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,400
and then you picked up

1152
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:54,920
the rubbish?

1153
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,380
I said,

1154
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,759
stuff,

1155
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,539
but yeah,

1156
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,740
it turned out

1157
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,920
to be a great documentary.

1158
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,039
It was confronting.

1159
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,640
I was nervous about it,

1160
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,660
but they did a great job.

1161
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:04,599
And that was one

1162
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,240
of the great moments,

1163
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:05,619
wasn't it?

1164
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:06,099
To see,

1165
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:06,420
you know,

1166
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,339
that rawness in you,

1167
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:07,640
mate,

1168
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,359
and to see it come out

1169
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:10,039
the way it did

1170
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:11,339
and is it something

1171
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:13,579
that you do more of?

1172
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,220
Because for me,

1173
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,980
as someone who loves

1174
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,880
learning like you,

1175
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,759
I just sat there

1176
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:18,880
and just absorbed in it

1177
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,019
and,

1178
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:19,880
for me,

1179
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,599
it's such a gift

1180
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:21,819
that you've given other people.

1181
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:22,720
Traditionally,

1182
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,700
the doors were closed

1183
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,000
on sport

1184
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,220
and it wasn't something

1185
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,259
that we were able

1186
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:27,720
to see through.

1187
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:28,420
And I look back

1188
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:28,759
and think,

1189
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:29,400
wouldn't you love

1190
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,319
to go into

1191
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,359
Vince Lombardi's

1192
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,119
locker room

1193
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:32,420
from,

1194
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:33,140
you know,

1195
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,079
the legendary NFL coach?

1196
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:35,640
Wouldn't you love

1197
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,220
to hear more

1198
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,059
of Sir Alex Ferguson?

1199
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:38,380
You got a great lunch,

1200
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:38,980
but wouldn't you love

1201
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,440
to have these

1202
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,400
time capsule pieces?

1203
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:41,519
Is it something

1204
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:42,740
you see as you're

1205
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,460
being more open to?

1206
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:43,900
Yeah,

1207
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,319
we're certainly

1208
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:44,940
looking at it.

1209
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,420
We're definitely

1210
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,440
looking at doing it again.

1211
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,420
I mean,

1212
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,259
the Michael Jordan

1213
00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:48,880
documentary,

1214
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,859
how good was that?

1215
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,019
There's so many

1216
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:53,160
great documentaries.

1217
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:55,200
I'm sure it's

1218
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,240
the way of the future.

1219
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:57,480
But to be honest,

1220
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,000
at the end of it,

1221
00:25:59,460 --> 00:25:59,539
after,

1222
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,539
and Andre became

1223
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:01,160
our cameraman,

1224
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,400
he was one cameraman

1225
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,140
and he was actually,

1226
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:04,539
he's actually

1227
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:05,539
a stand-up comic,

1228
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,220
so he became

1229
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:06,920
part of the team.

1230
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,619
He's told the joke

1231
00:26:08,619 --> 00:26:08,960
of the day

1232
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,599
every day

1233
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:10,440
for a year and a half.

1234
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:11,299
How he did that

1235
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:11,799
has got me,

1236
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,140
but he become part of it

1237
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,119
and that's how I operate.

1238
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,240
You talk about collaboration.

1239
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,400
If you come into

1240
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,279
any of my teams,

1241
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,000
you become part

1242
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,559
of the family.

1243
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:19,920
I think you have to,

1244
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:21,299
you've got to treat people

1245
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:21,859
with respect

1246
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:22,839
and with love

1247
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,859
and make them feel special.

1248
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:26,059
So he did that.

1249
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,000
I'm sure we'll do it.

1250
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:28,039
I'm sure it's the way

1251
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:29,460
forward in the world,

1252
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,279
but we also know

1253
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,279
that it comes

1254
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:33,500
with a price.

1255
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:33,740
I mean,

1256
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:35,279
every single day

1257
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:35,900
of your life,

1258
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,500
you've got someone

1259
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,180
filming everything you say.

1260
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:39,519
It's tiring.

1261
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:40,039
Yeah.

1262
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,240
But we've learned

1263
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,039
from the last one

1264
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:43,720
and yeah,

1265
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:44,019
I mean,

1266
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,819
if people want it,

1267
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,700
then that's usually

1268
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,359
how it works,

1269
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:47,700
isn't it?

1270
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,359
Well,

1271
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:48,660
great.

1272
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,299
Great experience

1273
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:50,180
for Andre the cameraman

1274
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,400
to be able to tell

1275
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,279
the joke every day

1276
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,059
in the Australian

1277
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:54,440
dressing rooms.

1278
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,079
He did a remarkable job.

1279
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,480
You saw in that documentary

1280
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,700
and just hearing

1281
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,220
your schedule

1282
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,259
before we started talking,

1283
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:01,700
JL,

1284
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,279
and your schedule

1285
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:03,839
for life,

1286
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,119
really,

1287
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:04,880
as a young cricketer

1288
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,460
you've been travelling

1289
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:05,940
the world

1290
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,160
and you married

1291
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,460
your childhood sweetheart,

1292
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:08,859
Sue,

1293
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,920
and your four daughters.

1294
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:12,140
So how do you

1295
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,000
manage that?

1296
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:13,960
How do you get

1297
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,759
the balance right

1298
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,299
between achieving

1299
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:17,420
what you have achieved

1300
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,460
and continue to achieve

1301
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:18,720
and,

1302
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,599
and the family time?

1303
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,200
Well,

1304
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,680
there's a couple of things

1305
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,640
here now is

1306
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,759
staying connected

1307
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:25,640
now is nothing

1308
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,519
more than an attitude

1309
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,400
because we've got,

1310
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:27,640
I mean,

1311
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,480
the fact we're sitting

1312
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,099
here now

1313
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:30,559
doing this interview,

1314
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,519
I'm in my office,

1315
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:31,960
you're,

1316
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:33,799
you're in your office there.

1317
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,460
I mean,

1318
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:36,279
communication,

1319
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:37,920
staying connected

1320
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,119
is purely an attitude

1321
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,059
and I learned this

1322
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:42,279
when I was 16 years old,

1323
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:42,880
I went to England

1324
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,799
for the first time

1325
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,480
and I ran a school boys tour

1326
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,220
and my mum

1327
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,420
saved up her cash

1328
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,240
to send me there.

1329
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:49,900
It was amazing

1330
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,480
and in that time

1331
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,640
I got a hundred at Lords

1332
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,200
and,

1333
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,240
you know,

1334
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,000
like,

1335
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:56,700
I don't remember

1336
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,019
one thing about the hundred.

1337
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,400
I don't remember one ball.

1338
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,079
I don't remember anything

1339
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,079
but what I do remember

1340
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,279
is after the,

1341
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:03,400
after the innings

1342
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,039
I ran around

1343
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,180
to the red phone box

1344
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:05,920
which is between

1345
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,759
the main oval

1346
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:07,660
and the nursery oval

1347
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,200
and I reverse charged

1348
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,319
called on my mum and dad.

1349
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:11,960
I said,

1350
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:12,460
mum and dad,

1351
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:12,940
you don't believe,

1352
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:13,480
so it was probably

1353
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,519
three o'clock in the morning

1354
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:14,940
back in the,

1355
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,720
oh, is everything all right,

1356
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:16,480
darling, what's happened?

1357
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:17,160
I said,

1358
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:17,900
mum,

1359
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,680
I got a hundred at Lords

1360
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,640
and they're so proud of me,

1361
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:22,880
right?

1362
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,740
I just remember that feeling

1363
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,559
and it's driven me

1364
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:26,559
every day since

1365
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,519
and I spoke to my,

1366
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:29,640
until my mum died

1367
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,440
three years ago,

1368
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:31,599
I spoke to my mum and dad

1369
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,859
every single day

1370
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:34,599
and I do with my wife

1371
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:35,160
and my kids

1372
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,079
every single day since

1373
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:37,539
because,

1374
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,700
and back then

1375
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,700
it cost a lot of money

1376
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,420
to,

1377
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:41,200
but I said,

1378
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,259
if there's one sacrifice

1379
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:42,740
I'll make,

1380
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:44,299
I will always stay connected

1381
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:45,019
to my family.

1382
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:45,299
So,

1383
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,059
and now with FaceTime

1384
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:47,660
and Skype

1385
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,180
and everything,

1386
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,140
staying connected

1387
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,680
is an attitude,

1388
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,720
so that's one thing.

1389
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,339
Two,

1390
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,400
I remember Steve Waugh,

1391
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,339
I asked Steve Waugh

1392
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:54,299
a similar question,

1393
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,339
probably when Jesse,

1394
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,339
my first was born,

1395
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,599
I said,

1396
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,960
and he had three kids

1397
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,299
and I said,

1398
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,839
how do you do it, mate?

1399
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:01,160
He said,

1400
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:01,460
well,

1401
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:02,700
I look at it like this,

1402
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,039
if I'm going to sacrifice

1403
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:06,160
being away from my family,

1404
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,119
I'm going to put everything

1405
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,400
into being the best batsman

1406
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:09,940
in the world.

1407
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,440
I'm going to put everything

1408
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,660
I can into being the best

1409
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,700
I can possibly be

1410
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,460
because they'll get benefit

1411
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,000
from that

1412
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,259
and if I'm going to make

1413
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:18,579
the huge sacrifice

1414
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:19,619
of being away from my family,

1415
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,539
I'm going to put everything,

1416
00:29:21,619 --> 00:29:22,079
I'm going to make

1417
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,279
some sacrifices myself.

1418
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:23,660
So,

1419
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:25,119
that was great advice.

1420
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:25,960
So,

1421
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:26,720
I stay connected

1422
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,160
and I make sure

1423
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,079
that they're proud of me

1424
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,500
by me doing the very best

1425
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:30,940
I can,

1426
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:32,240
either as a player

1427
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,220
or now as the

1428
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,180
Australian career coach.

1429
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,339
Beautifully said,

1430
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:35,920
JL.

1431
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,099
So,

1432
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,480
every day on tour,

1433
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,660
all four daughters,

1434
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:39,420
you'll make sure

1435
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,380
you touch base

1436
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,920
and it's fantastic.

1437
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,000
It's not a day,

1438
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,779
there is not one single day

1439
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:46,019
that I don't,

1440
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:47,019
I'm not in contact

1441
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:47,880
with my whole family.

1442
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:48,420
Now,

1443
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:48,559
look,

1444
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:49,759
I do it with my mates as well.

1445
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,700
I stay in touch

1446
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,279
with my mates.

1447
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,799
I mentioned

1448
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:53,799
when we spoke about

1449
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:55,160
health before,

1450
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:55,640
Darce,

1451
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,539
is there's two things

1452
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:57,359
I know in life

1453
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,779
that you've got to look

1454
00:29:58,779 --> 00:29:59,579
after your health

1455
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:01,000
and your relationships

1456
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,079
because after I finish

1457
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,119
playing cricket

1458
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,259
or after I finish

1459
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:06,440
coaching the Australian

1460
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,119
cricket team,

1461
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:07,880
the things that are going

1462
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,759
to be most important

1463
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:09,619
to me are my family

1464
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:10,380
and my mates

1465
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,460
and my health.

1466
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:11,720
So,

1467
00:30:11,859 --> 00:30:12,940
you've got to be on that

1468
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,700
every single day.

1469
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:13,839
So,

1470
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,079
okay,

1471
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,180
and the Australian

1472
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:15,700
cricket team

1473
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,380
that you talked about

1474
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:16,799
before,

1475
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:17,259
literally,

1476
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,079
they are like

1477
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:18,880
my brothers.

1478
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,859
I speak to

1479
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:21,220
Pano,

1480
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:21,859
Hados,

1481
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:22,640
Gilly,

1482
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:23,839
McGrath,

1483
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,619
Steve Waugh.

1484
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,240
I speak to

1485
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,160
Warnie a lot.

1486
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:28,460
They are literally,

1487
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,839
Jason Gillespie,

1488
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,200
they are literally

1489
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,559
like my brothers.

1490
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:33,579
I spent more time

1491
00:30:33,579 --> 00:30:33,740
with them

1492
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,000
than I do

1493
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,900
with my blood brothers

1494
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,680
and,

1495
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:36,279
you know,

1496
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:36,880
I'll never take

1497
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,519
that for granted.

1498
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:38,700
Great joy

1499
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,319
of team sport,

1500
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:39,619
isn't it?

1501
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,180
The experiences

1502
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,299
you had to have

1503
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:41,920
those lifelong

1504
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,400
friendships,

1505
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,019
to me,

1506
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:43,420
the greatest

1507
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,500
takeaway from sport

1508
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,759
and what a privilege

1509
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:46,859
to have those

1510
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:48,299
friendships for life

1511
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:49,519
as you just

1512
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:50,400
described.

1513
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:51,140
Just quickly touch

1514
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,599
on your health,

1515
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:52,019
JL,

1516
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,559
because you did

1517
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:54,819
have in 2019

1518
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:55,579
the World Cup

1519
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:56,160
a serious

1520
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,299
health issue

1521
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:58,519
and can you

1522
00:30:58,519 --> 00:30:58,980
tell us about

1523
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,460
what happened

1524
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,240
and how you've

1525
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,740
dealt with that?

1526
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:02,279
Yeah,

1527
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,339
before I do that,

1528
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,279
I'll talk about

1529
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,259
these mates to us.

1530
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:06,500
My best mates

1531
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,400
in my life

1532
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,440
to this day

1533
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,759
are my mates

1534
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:10,160
from the

1535
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,759
Warwick Black

1536
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:11,400
Footy Club.

1537
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:13,440
When I was a kid

1538
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,119
and we won

1539
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:15,240
six flags together

1540
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,099
and they're still

1541
00:31:16,099 --> 00:31:16,759
away from me.

1542
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:17,339
I'm from cricket.

1543
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,359
They're my best friends.

1544
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,579
So the bonds

1545
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:21,240
and the friendships

1546
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,259
from sport,

1547
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,740
they are literally

1548
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,440
Can I ask you,

1549
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,180
the Warwick Black

1550
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:25,640
Footy Club,

1551
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,440
six premierships,

1552
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,019
that sounds like

1553
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:28,160
a good junior club

1554
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,819
you're running there,

1555
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,019
JL.

1556
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,500
What sort of AFL player

1557
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,420
was young Justin Langer?

1558
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:33,099
I loved it,

1559
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,779
but then I went

1560
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:34,259
to England,

1561
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:34,940
like I said,

1562
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,799
and I decided,

1563
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:37,980
imagine being

1564
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,519
a professional

1565
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:39,220
cricketer one day.

1566
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,079
Steve Rosich,

1567
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,759
who was the

1568
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:42,660
CEO of the Dockers,

1569
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,640
he was like

1570
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,480
the prodigy.

1571
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,279
He was like,

1572
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,700
what a player.

1573
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:47,680
When he was a kid,

1574
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,079
oh,

1575
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,759
so we've been

1576
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:50,700
mates ever since,

1577
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:51,180
but they're all

1578
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:51,839
my best mates.

1579
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,559
So those bonds

1580
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:54,140
that are formed

1581
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:54,880
through sport,

1582
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:55,660
team sport,

1583
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,140
oh,

1584
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:57,680
that's why I love

1585
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,420
sport so much.

1586
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,400
And getting back

1587
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,420
to the health,

1588
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:01,559
you had a serious

1589
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:03,140
health self-issue.

1590
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:03,839
Can you share with us

1591
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,460
what you've done

1592
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,559
to get yourself

1593
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:05,920
right again?

1594
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,180
Yeah, I did.

1595
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,539
I kept having all these.

1596
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:08,940
I got,

1597
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,480
when I was in England

1598
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,140
last year,

1599
00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:12,579
I developed

1600
00:32:12,579 --> 00:32:13,920
these issues

1601
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,839
in my left ear

1602
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:15,359
and I,

1603
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:18,880
now as I know it,

1604
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,460
is tinnitus

1605
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,160
and then I got

1606
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,980
this vertigo

1607
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,019
and I literally

1608
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:23,259
had a day in bed

1609
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:25,579
after the World Cup

1610
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:25,980
where,

1611
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,160
and it was the day

1612
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,680
before we were

1613
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,980
announcing the Ashes squad.

1614
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:29,980
We had all these players

1615
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,640
and I literally

1616
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,640
wake up at three o'clock

1617
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:31,900
in the morning

1618
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,019
and the room was spinning

1619
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:34,680
like I was blind drunk

1620
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,720
and every time I sat

1621
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,259
and I couldn't,

1622
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:37,339
I couldn't stand up

1623
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:38,119
and I slept

1624
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,160
for 24 hours

1625
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,559
and then

1626
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,480
I was having,

1627
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,059
feeling all seasick

1628
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:43,400
and,

1629
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,099
and I honestly

1630
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:45,339
felt like I was

1631
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:45,940
like drunk

1632
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,880
and hazy for,

1633
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:47,720
and then I thought

1634
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,660
I had a brain tumour

1635
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,140
because my dad

1636
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,160
had a brain tumour

1637
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,359
in his left ear

1638
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,680
when he was about my age.

1639
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:53,259
So,

1640
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:53,980
oh man,

1641
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,220
I was stressing out

1642
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:55,680
and then,

1643
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,000
and I felt,

1644
00:32:57,099 --> 00:32:57,599
and the other thing

1645
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:58,759
about being an Aussie bloke

1646
00:32:58,759 --> 00:32:59,640
is I kept putting

1647
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,700
the mask on every day

1648
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,680
so that was taking up

1649
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,200
not just the physical side

1650
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,099
of it was affecting me

1651
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:05,460
but also the mental side

1652
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,559
because it was so tiring

1653
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,400
having to put the mask on

1654
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,839
and sort of act

1655
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:10,839
like nothing was wrong.

1656
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,140
So,

1657
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:12,960
I've got great advice.

1658
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:13,559
I met some,

1659
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:14,880
some great medical,

1660
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,599
medicos

1661
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:16,720
who have helped me

1662
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,099
and they've put me

1663
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:19,059
on some medication

1664
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:19,880
and they've helped me

1665
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,059
with some different

1666
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:22,240
lifestyle things

1667
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,720
to,

1668
00:33:22,819 --> 00:33:23,779
to make sure I stay

1669
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:24,440
on top of it

1670
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,579
but it's no good

1671
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:26,539
when you're going through it.

1672
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:27,480
Jay,

1673
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,380
I've got six questions

1674
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,140
for you on

1675
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,660
what we think

1676
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,519
makes up the dimensions

1677
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:31,839
of,

1678
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,039
of great leadership

1679
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,240
and can I start

1680
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,400
with the first one?

1681
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,240
What does self-leadership

1682
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,799
mean to you?

1683
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:38,980
Self-leadership,

1684
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:40,200
I go back to that

1685
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,339
initial quote

1686
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:42,059
that probably

1687
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:43,019
one of the mottos

1688
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:43,599
of my life,

1689
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,740
the pain of discipline

1690
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,319
is nothing like

1691
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,279
the pain of disappointment

1692
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,160
and I think

1693
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,759
you've got to lead

1694
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:50,440
by example.

1695
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:51,019
You've got to make

1696
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:51,960
disciplined choices

1697
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,839
because it never

1698
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:53,859
makes sense to me.

1699
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,839
There's an old saying

1700
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:56,259
to us,

1701
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,759
if you preach

1702
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:58,559
excellence

1703
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,019
and walk mediocrity,

1704
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,660
you're nothing

1705
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,660
but a common liar

1706
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,380
and what I've learned

1707
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:03,740
in life,

1708
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,720
anyone can talk

1709
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,279
a good game.

1710
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,460
Anyone can talk tough.

1711
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:08,739
Anyone can talk

1712
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:09,980
but actually doing it.

1713
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,079
There's another

1714
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:12,119
great mate of mine

1715
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,059
who's from the SAS,

1716
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,300
Brett Warner,

1717
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:14,619
once,

1718
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:15,199
said to me,

1719
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,679
JL,

1720
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,539
just remember,

1721
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,500
most people can live

1722
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,059
the dream,

1723
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,099
not many people

1724
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,039
can live the reality.

1725
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,599
So a lot of people

1726
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,760
want the green beret

1727
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,300
or the baggy green cap

1728
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,739
or the bulldog's

1729
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:26,880
jumper

1730
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,500
or drive a Mercedes Benz

1731
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,460
or live in a mansion.

1732
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,019
Most people can dream

1733
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:32,460
about that,

1734
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:32,920
not many people

1735
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,699
can live the reality

1736
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:34,420
of what it takes.

1737
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:35,519
So I guess

1738
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:36,820
example

1739
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,380
and self-awareness

1740
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,420
and self-discipline

1741
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,340
is crucial

1742
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,440
in self-leadership.

1743
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,800
And how do you

1744
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,480
positively impact

1745
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:46,340
others in your environment?

1746
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:47,539
Believe it or not,

1747
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,880
to me,

1748
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,260
the most important thing

1749
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,079
about leadership,

1750
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,780
one of the most important

1751
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,219
is caring for people.

1752
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:57,719
Caring for people

1753
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:58,440
and making people

1754
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,179
feel special.

1755
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:01,559
And sometimes

1756
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:02,380
you come across

1757
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,159
as the tough guy

1758
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:04,119
but I know that

1759
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:05,039
and sometimes,

1760
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:05,320
look,

1761
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:06,460
I've talked a lot

1762
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,280
about mentors,

1763
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:07,659
Dars.

1764
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,340
Some of the mentors

1765
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:09,699
in my life

1766
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:10,199
have been the ones

1767
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,340
who have been toughest on me

1768
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,360
but to this day,

1769
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,380
the people I respect

1770
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:14,960
and admire

1771
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,440
and love

1772
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,280
and my best friends.

1773
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,300
So the reason

1774
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,139
they were tough on me

1775
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:19,139
because they cared for me.

1776
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:22,119
And so caring for people

1777
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:22,739
is to me

1778
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:24,260
how you show people

1779
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,420
great leadership.

1780
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:26,920
How do you go about

1781
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,059
creating and sharing

1782
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:28,579
your vision?

1783
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,179
Well, you've got to be

1784
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:30,860
strong with it

1785
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,860
and one,

1786
00:35:32,019 --> 00:35:32,320
again,

1787
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,420
it's easy to anyone,

1788
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,380
you'll appreciate this,

1789
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:36,780
I'm sure.

1790
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,460
Every pre-season

1791
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,760
and I did it

1792
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,860
for 25 years,

1793
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:42,260
you have a pre-season

1794
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,260
and you all sit around

1795
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,340
and this is our mission state,

1796
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:44,780
we're for these

1797
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,940
and these are our values

1798
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,940
and for 24 hours

1799
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,739
or two days

1800
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:49,780
or three hours

1801
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,659
and you put them on

1802
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:51,940
big fancy posters

1803
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,780
around the walls

1804
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,119
and you sit there

1805
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,139
and you sing Kumbaya

1806
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:56,699
and you all feel happy about it

1807
00:35:56,699 --> 00:35:57,219
and you all think

1808
00:35:57,219 --> 00:35:57,820
this is great

1809
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,800
but guess what?

1810
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,340
It actually means nothing

1811
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,139
because unless you live it

1812
00:36:02,139 --> 00:36:03,719
every single day,

1813
00:36:05,659 --> 00:36:07,079
it's like toilet paper,

1814
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,219
the fancy mugs

1815
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:09,260
and the fancy tattoos

1816
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,000
and the fancy posters

1817
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,940
in your gym

1818
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,000
and around the walls

1819
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,679
mean nothing

1820
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:14,360
unless you live it

1821
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,820
every day.

1822
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,019
So to me,

1823
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:17,159
that's the key.

1824
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,860
The key is to live it

1825
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,119
every single day

1826
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:20,860
and it's hard

1827
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,400
and everyone wants

1828
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,019
to be popular

1829
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:24,659
but you've got to live it

1830
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:25,360
every single day.

1831
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:25,940
It's a very,

1832
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:26,699
very important part

1833
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:27,739
of selling your vision.

1834
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,719
You can say it

1835
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,519
but then you've got to live it.

1836
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:31,679
And what's your approach

1837
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:32,800
to learning and improvement?

1838
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,199
I think you've guessed here

1839
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,599
that it's an everyday thing.

1840
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:40,340
One day when I retire,

1841
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,340
I hope I'm still saying

1842
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,260
I'm a novice coach,

1843
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,539
you can never,

1844
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:44,519
ever stop learning

1845
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:46,239
and the greatest learning

1846
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:48,820
comes from living it

1847
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,860
and learning about winning,

1848
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:51,980
learning about losing,

1849
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:52,840
bouncing back.

1850
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,940
We've just had a test series

1851
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,980
where we lost to India.

1852
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,659
You know, a series,

1853
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,659
you could say we should have won

1854
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:01,199
and my gosh, it hurts

1855
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:03,139
and you crawl into the cave

1856
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:03,699
for a while

1857
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:04,400
and then you've got to

1858
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,559
dust yourself off.

1859
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:06,559
I learned it as a player

1860
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:09,199
and the greatest learning

1861
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:09,980
of my life

1862
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,119
is that when it's happening,

1863
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:13,300
it's horrible,

1864
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:13,860
it's a horrible feeling

1865
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,780
but the best,

1866
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,739
I look at it as a 50-year-old now

1867
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:17,820
and the times I was dropped

1868
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,920
or the times I failed

1869
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,699
was I learned the most about myself.

1870
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,239
I had a choice.

1871
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:21,880
I could either quit

1872
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,739
or I could get better

1873
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:25,199
and one week ago,

1874
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,599
we got beaten

1875
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:29,280
and I asked myself the same question.

1876
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,400
What are you going to learn from it?

1877
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,840
Do you quit or you get better?

1878
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:33,579
And, you know,

1879
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:35,440
life is the greatest teacher

1880
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,280
and if you surround yourself

1881
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,219
with great people

1882
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:39,059
and great books,

1883
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,099
then you literally learn

1884
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:43,280
every single day.

1885
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,039
Every single day of your life.

1886
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,679
How do you communicate

1887
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:46,619
with clarity?

1888
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:47,500
Honesty.

1889
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,840
Clarity comes from honesty.

1890
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:51,960
I honestly believe that

1891
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,199
that if you look a person in the eye

1892
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,139
and tell them the truth

1893
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:56,739
and sometimes that's hard as well

1894
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:57,300
and everyone says,

1895
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,480
oh yeah, I want to tell the truth.

1896
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,360
Oh, really?

1897
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:01,179
It's that easy, is it?

1898
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:02,599
But it actually is.

1899
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:04,599
My nana, my great nana,

1900
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:05,380
she used to say,

1901
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,579
you've got a choice.

1902
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:07,559
You can either tell the truth

1903
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:08,360
or you can tell a lie.

1904
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,260
At that moment,

1905
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,000
you've got a choice

1906
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,699
which one you're going to do.

1907
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,360
It's much easier to tell the truth.

1908
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,420
If you might not think it at the time,

1909
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,900
but it is because you sleep well,

1910
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,960
you don't have to have a good memory

1911
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,019
because you just tell the truth.

1912
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:19,320
So honesty is clarity.

1913
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:20,679
Beautifully said.

1914
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,400
How important is collaboration

1915
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,500
and how do you do it?

1916
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:25,460
Yeah, collaboration's important,

1917
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:28,179
but recognise that the people

1918
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:29,400
you collaborate with

1919
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,059
should be the ones you trust the most

1920
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,539
because ultimately your head's on the line.

1921
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:35,980
You're the one who's going to make the decision.

1922
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,199
Decisions always have implications.

1923
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,500
So show people respect,

1924
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,719
listen to their opinions,

1925
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,860
but then understand as a leader,

1926
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,940
you have to make the decision.

1927
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:46,960
You have to make the call.

1928
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:49,420
It's the most important thing about leadership.

1929
00:38:49,539 --> 00:38:51,280
You have the courage to make the tough calls.

1930
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,900
JL, thanks so much for sharing your time.

1931
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,440
It's been a great pleasure to listen to you

1932
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,099
and I feel informed.

1933
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,000
I feel inspired.

1934
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,400
I've got lots of things to take away from our chat

1935
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,760
and you're certainly doing your job

1936
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,820
of making Australians proud

1937
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,880
of the Australian cricket team.

1938
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,699
It's become a great sanctuary

1939
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:11,139
to watch cricket under your leadership

1940
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:11,159
and I'm sure you'll be doing that too.

1941
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:11,239
Thank you.

1942
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:11,300
Thank you.

1943
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
And to have followed you from a very young age

1944
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,059
and to have seen your incredible success

1945
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:16,900
and to know a bit more about your journey now

1946
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,500
has been a great experience.

1947
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:19,940
So thanks so much.

1948
00:39:20,019 --> 00:39:21,340
I really appreciate your time today.

1949
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:22,380
No, thanks, Luke.

1950
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:22,920
I've loved it.

1951
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,400
Thanks, mate.

1952
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:28,900
