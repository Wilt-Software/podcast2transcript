00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,910
Kemi Neckverpool is my next guest on this Empowering Leaders podcast.

2
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:08,509
I love this conversation.

3
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:12,130
Brilliant, remarkable, full of wisdom is how I describe Kemi.

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:18,789
You'll hear her talk about her ability to encourage and coach people to action to live a better life.

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,230
She's got a brilliant, unique, and concise way of doing exactly that.

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,269
She also shares her view on what it means to live a connected, values-based life.

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,690
She's a remarkable person, Kemi.

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,809
I hope you enjoy the conversation.

9
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:33,990
I'm sure you will, and I'm sure you'll learn a lot from it.

10
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:38,530
Kemi is one of the leaders that inspire the work that we do at Alita,

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,890

17
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,590
in that space that we're incredibly passionate about.

18
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,510
Huge thanks, as always, to Jason Nicholas and his team from Temper,

19
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,909
a mattress like no other.

20
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:15,069
It's NASA-approved, the world's best in mattresses and bedding,

21
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:17,109
an investment in a Temper mattress.

22
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:19,750
For better sleep, we'll change your life.

23
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,030
The great leaders that I speak to on the Empowering Leaders podcast

24
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,530
all share that in common.

25
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,590
They value sleep, and they understand that that is an incredible part

26
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,250
of living a happy, successful life.

27
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,079
Kemi Neckler.

28
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,819
Kemi Neckler is one of Australia's leading credentialed coaches

29
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:38,959
for female executives and entrepreneurs, an author,

30
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:41,120
and a highly sought-after international speaker.

31
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,579
She has studied leadership and purpose at the Gross National Happiness Centre

32
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:49,299
in Bhutan and trained with Dr. Brené Brown to become a certified

33
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:50,700
Dare to Lead facilitator.

34
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,319
She's the host of a brilliant podcast, The Shift Series,

35
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,819
has a new series on Audible, which I'm keen to find out more about,

36
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,819
and renowned for her compassion and wisdom, Kemi is a powerful advocate

37
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,219
for connected, values-based living.

38
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,060
Kemi, I've heard so much about you from so many different people.

39
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,439
Thanks for taking the time to chat today.

40
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,780
Oh, I'm really happy to be here, Luke.

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,840
Thank you for inviting me.

42
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,439
And I was saying just before we started, I really enjoyed listening

43
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,819
to your brilliant podcast in preparation for today, The Shift Series.

44
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,939
I'm not sure I'm the target demographic, Kemi, in some ways,

45
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,319
but it's brilliant, and you've got an incredible way of sharing practical,

46
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,120
actionable ways to live a better life.

47
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,159
I love the stuff.

48
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,939
I love the stuff on intention-setting and the power of dreams.

49
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,020
Congratulations.

50
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,979
You've got a great way about it.

51
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,960
Thank you so much.

52
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,180
I love that you listen to my podcast and I listen to your podcast as well,

53
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:44,219
so we can prepare for that.

54
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:46,819
That's really great.

55
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,960
Yeah, I created The Shift Series because, obviously,

56
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,840
I know that coaching is an incredibly powerful tool for people,

57
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,219
but that not everyone is going to be able to access coaching.

58
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,580
And so the way that I decided to set up The Shift Series was that people

59
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,159
are kind of looking at it from a different perspective,

60
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,379
listening in on the essence of a coaching conversation.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And then from that, I invite the listener to then take action

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,719
that is relevant to them in their area of life at that moment.

63
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,180
And, you know, they're very short podcasts, as you'll know.

64
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:20,219
They're kind of like five to eight minutes because I really want it to be

65
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:23,240
about the person taking action in their lives and not just sort of having

66
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,020
the insight and then going on living the life the same way

67
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,560
that maybe isn't working for them.

68
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:28,860
And it works.

69
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:29,479
It is actionable.

70
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,460
I found myself writing down and following your words and saying,

71
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,939
right, you know, this is what – don't just listen to this.

72
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,520
What are you going to do about it?

73
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:40,620
And I think you've got a brilliant way.

74
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:44,680
I mean, coaching for a lot of people still, Kimmy, is a scary word.

75
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,900
A lot of people still think that's something that's unattainable.

76
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,620
Are you finding that shifting slightly or not?

77
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,360
100%.

78
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,919
You know, I think definitely when we look at culturally,

79
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,199
coaching is new in Australia.

80
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,180
You know, obviously, not sports coaching.

81
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,180
That's, you know, that's very well woven into it.

82
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,419
It's very well woven into Australian culture.

83
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,060
But when it comes to, you know, you don't have to be an executive

84
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,620
to have a coach.

85
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,520
I think a lot of people are realizing that we're not meant to do life

86
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,840
on our own and that there are many different helping professionals

87
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,139
and supportive professionals.

88
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,720
So, you know, my definition of the work that I do as a coach is to really

89
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,199
walk alongside somebody, not behind, not in front, but alongside them

90
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,680
as they are journeying through their life and working out what is working

91
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,939
right now and what can I celebrate, you know, in regard to that.

92
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:32,040
Okay.

93
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:33,339
What is not working?

94
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,519
What are my opportunities for growth and how do I want to move forward?

95
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:40,220
And then there are therapists who are, you know, I'm sure that a lot

96
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,220
of your listeners either, you know, have a therapist or have had therapy

97
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,180
or understand what it is.

98
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,560
And therapists can be trained as coaches, which is where people can get

99
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,459
kind of confused.

100
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:50,860
But the idea is that with the therapy, you're really working in that

101
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,079
therapeutic space for a period of time.

102
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,180
But my focus as a coach is always about moving forward.

103
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:01,699
So it doesn't ignore what has happened in the past or behaviors,

104
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:05,339
but it's really focusing on what is it that you need to move forward

105
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:08,399
into the life that you want to create for yourself or the style of leadership

106
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,639
that you want for yourself.

107
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,040
And it's so powerful that we use it in the work that we do in our space

108
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,720
called A Leader as well, Kimmy.

109
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,879
We call it accompaniment coaching, exactly as you're saying.

110
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,980
You're not mentoring, which is a different thing.

111
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,160
It's really walking, as you said, side by side with someone.

112
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,360
And I love the accountability of it.

113
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:25,899
And often the answers lie within.

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,160
And we know, Kimmy, the research is so powerful, isn't it?

115
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,740
When you come up with your own solutions and they're the ones that are going to be

116
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,819
and they're the ones that stick more often than not.

117
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:36,339
Is that is that why you've chosen that path?

118
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,360
Yes, 100 percent.

119
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,920
You know, I'll be honest, Luke, in the early days, you know,

120
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,800
like when I was a teenager in my mid 20s or something, I was definitely the helper.

121
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,060
I say an inverted inverted commas because there can be a kind of arrogance

122
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,480
around being the helper because you just kind of think, well,

123
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,420
if they just do what I say, you know, if they just take on my advice,

124
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,319
their life would be fine.

125
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,139
What is wrong with them?

126
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,560
The thing about that is that what we do is that we create

127
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,600
a power imbalance that we then the person that you've been given advice to,

128
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,920
if it wasn't right for them, they then feel like they failed

129
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,139
because they didn't do what you told them to do.

130
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:15,980
And what I've you know, what I've discovered is that none of us like unsolicited advice.

131
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,300
You know, I think what's really powerful is if we ask someone for advice

132
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,860
and they can give it to us, that is great.

133
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:24,220
We're all here as humans to connect and support each other.

134
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:27,680
But there is something more sustainable and more empowering

135
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,500
when someone finds their own answer.

136
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,540
So it was a coach.

137
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,500
You know, somebody might say to me, I want to get healthier.

138
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:37,060
For example, I don't generally work with people in the kind of the health space

139
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,160
in particular well-being as a whole umbrella I do.

140
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:43,600
But just to give a simple example, if somebody says to me, I want to be healthier,

141
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,060
I'll then say in what area of your life, what does that mean for you?

142
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,240
What does that look like?

143
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,339
Why is that important?

144
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,220
And then breaking it down to very small actions.

145
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:56,839
Because if I said to them, well, you obviously have to drink two liters of water a day

146
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,180
and they go and do that and it doesn't work for them for whatever reason.

147
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,399
That's not coaching.

148
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,879
So I'm always very mindful.

149
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,860
And that's why I hold my credential in such high regard

150
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,699
because I'm very clear about what my role is and what my role isn't.

151
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:12,759
And giving advice is not my role.

152
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:15,379
And there's a real discipline in that too, isn't there, Kemi?

153
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,660
Because at times I'm sure it's, you know, God, I've got the answer for you.

154
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:21,800
I can genuinely share that.

155
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,519
But you're right.

156
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:24,939
I love the discipline of that style of coaching.

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,120
And I often think, you know, some of the most successful people in the world,

158
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,540
Roger Federer, maybe the greatest tennis player ever,

159
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,560
still had a coach, you know, right at the end of his career.

160
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:37,740
It's such a powerful, powerful tool to use,

161
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,720
particularly when you've got someone as credentialed and respected as you.

162
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,939
Kemi, I wanted to use some of your own words

163
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:45,040
and then ask you a question on the back of it.

164
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,759
And you wrote this,

165
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:48,060
My story is not my excuse, it's my why.

166
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,660
As a black child raised by five sets of white foster parents,

167
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,980
some incredibly loving, some not so much,

168
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:58,079
I always felt I had to prove my worth so that I could be allowed to stay.

169
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,000
I had to not only be a good girl,

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,019
but a good black girl.

171
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,959
I had no say in where I would live or who my new mum and dad would be

172
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,120
or where I would be living next.

173
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,259
Can I ask you about your own personal development from that upbringing

174
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:15,879
to the point now where you help so many people so consistently well,

175
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,720
what were you able to do to get to that stage?

176
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,800
Well, yes, I grew up in the 1970s in England.

177
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,740
I hope that people can still hear my English accent.

178
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,079
I'm now an Australian citizen.

179
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,720
I've been here for 20 years, but I'm still saying yogurt.

180
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,819
And I'm still holding on to duvet.

181
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,379
If I can take them to the end, I'll be very happy.

182
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,480
And I was one of many tens of thousands of Nigerian children

183
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,120
that were fostered to white families in the 1960s, 70s and 80s.

184
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,299
My parents, like all parents,

185
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:48,879
made the decisions that they thought were the best for their children,

186
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,299
especially in regard to education.

187
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,279
But we also can't ignore the kind of colonial narrative that went into that,

188
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:59,039
the idea that the best education is English white education.

189
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,879
And so that meant, yes, I had very many foster parents growing up.

190
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,360
And I did feel a sense of powerlessness,

191
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:06,460
because if you don't know who your next mom and dad's going to be,

192
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,580
and I just knew I had to be good.

193
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:11,000
I think for those of us identified as women,

194
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,440
part of our kind of socialization is that we have to be a good girl,

195
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,559
a good wife, a good sister, a good daughter,

196
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,200
which is a really small box in, you know, in which we get to operate.

197
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,580
And I don't want my epitaph to say Kemi was good.

198
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,620
Like I would be really disappointed if I could see my own gravestone.

199
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,019
And that's what I would say.

200
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:31,240
I'd be scratching it and graffitiing on it.

201
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,360
But, you know, we, by default,

202
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:38,159
we kind of have this sense that that is what we need to do to be valuable.

203
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,860
And having spent a childhood where I felt powerless most of the time

204
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,720
and that I didn't get to use my own voice most of the time.

205
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,740
And that, to be honest, Luke, I wasn't really showing up as myself,

206
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,879
because the mask of good means that no one can actually really get to me,

207
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,200
because I was always on high alert to make sure I wasn't doing anything

208
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,039
that would upset anyone around me

209
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:58,919
or anything that would upset anyone around me.

210
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,559
Or anything that would cause the consequences

211
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,200
to have a negative impact on me.

212
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,480
And so I definitely know that my childhood

213
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,139
and the way that I've lived my life,

214
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,519
100% is part of the reason why I do my work now.

215
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:14,340
The other reason, I'm an avid reader.

216
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,899
And I read my first personal development book at 18.

217
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,240
I don't know if you remember the book, The Celestine Prophecy.

218
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,279
Have you ever read that book?

219
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:21,960
No, I haven't, no.

220
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,720
So it was written by James Redfield.

221
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,139
And it was in the 1990s.

222
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,980
I'm not sure how it translates now.

223
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,899
So I will put that in the description.

224
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:29,419
There's a caveat.

225
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:33,740
But at the time, I was about 18 years old.

226
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,360
And it was the first time that it had ever been communicated to me

227
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,940
that you didn't just have to put up with the life that you had been given.

228
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,360
Like, even with all those different families.

229
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,500
And there's been some actually great things about living in different families.

230
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,799
It's really helped how I've parented my own children.

231
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,840
Because I've kind of had a bit of a buffet table.

232
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,980
Take what worked, sort of leave that that didn't work.

233
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:55,940
Take a little bit of that.

234
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,340
But this idea for me of, wow,

235
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,360
you don't just have to just put up with what you've been given.

236
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,679
You can actually craft and curate your life.

237
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,080
Doesn't mean it's easy.

238
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,639
Doesn't mean that people around you are going to understand what you're doing

239
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,700
or why you're doing it.

240
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,779
But that book gave me permission to think,

241
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,360
maybe I get to create a life that actually honors who I am.

242
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,720
And maybe I'm allowed.

243
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:20,320
Actually, I'm going to rephrase.

244
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:26,620
Maybe I am going to allow myself to show up in the world as a full expression of myself.

245
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,320
Kimmy, I wasn't aware.

246
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,399
I wasn't aware of that happening in the 60s and 70s,

247
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,820
that there was lots of Nigerian young people like yourself sent over to the UK.

248
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,440
When you speak and spoke to your parents and I suppose other Nigerians,

249
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,460
what was the experience?

250
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,659
Look at it as a whole.

251
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,340
Was it well-intentioned but damaging?

252
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,820
Or do you think, how do you view it when you look back on it?

253
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,159
Yeah, look, it's an interesting thing.

254
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,759
There's actually a film called Farming,

255
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,759
which is about this particular.

256
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,080
And in some ways, there's kind of the Australian parallel

257
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,659
with kind of the stolen generations.

258
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,500
You know, like I was born in England,

259
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:11,779
but there was still very much this idea that the English way of education was the best way.

260
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,120
Like my parents were smart enough to kind of have us born in England as well,

261
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,259
because they were like, if they have England citizenship,

262
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:19,519
then that means they're going to get more opportunities as well.

263
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,960
In terms of, you know, overall,

264
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:25,220
I would hate to give an overall opinion of how it turned out.

265
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,320
What I can tell you is that some of the children,

266
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,259
did go back and become the doctors and lawyers of Nigeria,

267
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:32,980
because that was the main intention.

268
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,779
You know, so many parents want their kids to be doctors and lawyers,

269
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:37,700
or they definitely did, you know, in that time.

270
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,139
And that did happen and they had their dream come true.

271
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:43,940
Some families became very, very disconnected.

272
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:48,580
And a lot of kids that I know that did go through that kind of system

273
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,899
have had to navigate their identity and where they sit.

274
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:57,059
And that's been a journey that they have to take ownership of as well.

275
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,139
And I love what you said.

276
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,419
The other part of that previous answer was that power at a young age to find,

277
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:04,259
hey, I'm in charge of my own destiny.

278
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:05,980
I can create my own future.

279
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,179
And for some people,

280
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:10,299
that is not something they maybe grasped their entire life, is there?

281
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:13,139
That they feel as though the circumstances that they were brought up in

282
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:16,059
or life has dealt them a hand and that's it.

283
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:18,139
It's a pretty powerful thing.

284
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:22,299
And that's, I'm assuming what you do is coach people to that best version, isn't it?

285
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:23,100
What do you want to be?

286
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,659
How do you want to take action to do that?

287
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:27,899
And, you know, it's interesting.

288
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,860
You know, Nigerian heritage grew up in London.

289
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,220
You end up in country Victoria.

290
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,700
You've definitely taken charge of your own life.

291
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,940
You're a chef as well and an actor.

292
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,299
So you've certainly treaded your own path.

293
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:43,100
Yeah, I have.

294
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,980
And what's been really interesting, you know, when I look back,

295
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,740
I think it's Steve Jobs that said it's only when you look back that you sort of realize.

296
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,620
And I noticed a few years ago that the one thing,

297
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,779
even though I wasn't necessarily in safe situations as a child,

298
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:03,899
or I wasn't necessarily, you know, one of one of the things for me in my experience at school

299
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:08,980
was that because I was black in a mainly white space and because I was fostered,

300
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,899
my teachers didn't expect anything from me and they just thought the fact that I turned up was enough.

301
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:19,620
So I was never kind of given any opportunities to kind of stretch or expand outside of myself.

302
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,179
And but what I've noticed, what I've realized is that I've always done what I've been passionate about.

303
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:27,779
And I am one of those multi-passionate people.

304
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:31,019
I left school, I trained as a baker, then I went from there.

305
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:36,620
I acted for seven years in England with the Royal Shakespeare Company on TV with the National Theatre.

306
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:39,580
But then when I was in New York with the Royal Shakespeare Company,

307
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,019
I realized I really love acting.

308
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:45,740
It is fun, but it's taken me a long time to understand who I am.

309
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,299
And I don't want to play characters for the rest of my life.

310
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:50,139
I'd like to learn more about who Kemi is.

311
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,779
So then that was probably one of the scariest things I've ever had to do is leave an industry

312
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,259
and a pay packet at that time.

313
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,220
Or a form, it's not even so much about the pay packet.

314
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,299
I suppose it's what society believes that particular role gives you.

315
00:15:05,299 --> 00:15:09,980
So there I am coming from this space of, well, you've had this amazing opportunity

316
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,139
and you never thought that someone like you would be able to do this.

317
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,100
So what, now you're going to give it up?

318
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:21,940
But I just knew that I couldn't maintain being in that environment that wasn't bringing me joy.

319
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,659
I was getting sadder and sadder and sadder.

320
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:26,500
And it was very isolating and very lonely

321
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,580
to leave a profession like that.

322
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:32,340
A profession that many people covet or that people perceive is like,

323
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,220
well, once you've got that, then that's the ultimate.

324
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,620
And to actually go, but I don't want it.

325
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,259
And it's lonely and I felt guilt.

326
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:43,179
And who do you think you are to not want what you should want?

327
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:45,500
But it was one of the hardest and best decisions of my life.

328
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,940
And I think sometimes they are.

329
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,059
Isn't that how it works out?

330
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:50,220
The hardest ones can be the best ones in the end.

331
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,340
I think you're right.

332
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,379
And I love the courage of it too, isn't it?

333
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:57,299
When someone else's dream job doesn't make you happy, a lot of people,

334
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:58,980
well, a lot of people stay in any job, don't they?

335
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,340
Because the courage to change is, you know,

336
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,299
and I think the stats on that are really horrific, aren't they?

337
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,440
People for security reasons don't leave, but it's a long life, isn't it?

338
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,220
Doing something that doesn't fulfill you.

339
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:15,220
Someone on this podcast came in the work we did to success leaves clues.

340
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,200
And now you're genuinely helping people around, you know,

341
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,100
connected values-based living.

342
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,519
What would you describe?

343
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,679
I mean, it's a unique thing to everyone, I'm assuming,

344
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,259
but to live it.

345
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:29,840
Happy, connected, and successful life.

346
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,200
How would you describe that?

347
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,379
Definitely values come into that because you're right.

348
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,720
It is unique to every single individual.

349
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,620
And I could have five people in front of me and ask them exactly the same

350
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,419
coaching question, and they would all give me a completely different answer.

351
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,279
Because although we've been kind of duped into the idea that we all want the

352
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,399
same life, which is a very kind of capitalist sort of external,

353
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:56,019
how does the life look as opposed to how does it feel?

354
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,220
And look, when I say capitalistic,

355
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:59,440
I'm not saying, you know, money is currency.

356
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,080
It's an energy that we have in the world that we have.

357
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,419
And it's incredibly important.

358
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,880
I'm talking about the structure of capitalism,

359
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,480
that that is kind of the ideal,

360
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,380
that that's the ladder that we should all attain.

361
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,940
But that isn't the ladder that a lot of people want,

362
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,480
you know, and some do want to get to the top of that ladder and they thrive.

363
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,339
And that's their, that's their calling.

364
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,720
And that's what they're meant to do.

365
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,539
But I found that when people actually give themselves the space,

366
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,279
which is kind of coaching for me,

367
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:24,779
I work with my clients 45 minutes fortnightly.

368
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,779
That's all it is,

369
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:27,180
but it is 45 minutes.

370
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,519
It's where they really honestly get to look at their life and what is

371
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:35,339
important to them and what is not important to them and taking the time to

372
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:36,480
kind of move away.

373
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,859
What they've been told should be important compared to what is important are

374
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,680
the life changing realizations.

375
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,039
And as a coach,

376
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:45,500
I have an action bias.

377
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:49,700
So of course the insight and the breakthrough is really important,

378
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,579
but unless it's transferred into action,

379
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:54,339
sort of out in the real world,

380
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,660
we just go around with insights and breakthroughs,

381
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:56,960
nothing,

382
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,160
actually,

383
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:57,960
actually transforms.

384
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,180
And the action is the hard part.

385
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,299
We can know it,

386
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,460
but actually having the courage to do something about it,

387
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,059
that's where the courage comes in.

388
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:05,720
Yeah.

389
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,259
And it sounds like listening to your work.

390
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,220
That's a really clear thing.

391
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:12,000
You really push to action straight away.

392
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:14,819
And I love the intention setting part as well.

393
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,380
I think that forces you into that space too,

394
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:17,839
doesn't it?

395
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,039
Can we have all these goals and I listened to all this stuff and I write

396
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:21,819
down these notes,

397
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,539
but nothing happens for me.

398
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:24,000
Why is that?

399
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,160
Can you explain why intention setting really is important?

400
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,940
And part of it for you?

401
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:28,779
Yeah,

402
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,900
I find for me,

403
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,960
intention setting is really important.

404
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,059
I set an intention every day.

405
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,539
What was mine?

406
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:35,079
Let me think today.

407
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,339
What was I journaling this morning?

408
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,420
So I do a meditation and my intention comes and my one today was connected

409
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:41,940
magic.

410
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:42,960
Actually,

411
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,720
that was my intention for today.

412
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,640
And so then when I have the intention,

413
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,559
I'm just,

414
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:47,740
yeah,

415
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:48,539
connected magic.

416
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,980
So then I'm just kind of looking,

417
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,460
looking for the magic and I'm always looking for magic and delight and joy.

418
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:55,539
I'm kind of obsessed with magic and joy and delight.

419
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:58,319
And yesterday I was right.

420
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,200
I was the end of the third day of a dare to lead retreat.

421
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,940
I run dare to lead retreats.

422
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:09,160
And my intention that day was ignited gratitude that I get to be in the space

423
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,099
doing the work that I do with leaders that are really wanting to lead in a way

424
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:14,900
that is human and value based.

425
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,539
And,

426
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,000
you know,

427
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:20,640
a few people are scribbling down notes all the time and we were looking at

428
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,660
cause Brené Brown's works.

429
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,200
We're looking at vulnerability and shame.

430
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,420
And I sort of asked them and I said,

431
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:24,799
so how,

432
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,400
how tell me about the note taking?

433
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:26,799
Oh,

434
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,740
I always take lots of notes.

435
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:28,000
I said,

436
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:28,200
okay,

437
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:28,500
great.

438
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,960
And then what happens?

439
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:30,680
Cause Oh,

440
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,059
nothing,

441
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,440
nothing at all.

442
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,240
And,

443
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:34,599
um,

444
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:34,779
and,

445
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:37,099
and because we're on such a heavy topic of looking at,

446
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,319
you know,

447
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,140
where the shame show up in organizations or in your leadership,

448
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,160
we then could have the conversation where she was honest enough to say,

449
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,420
she goes,

450
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,279
I just find this all just so,

451
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,059
you know,

452
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,880
just so difficult and so vulnerable.

453
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,400
I just thought I'd write some things.

454
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,160
Um,

455
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:52,299
I think the writing is fantastic.

456
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:54,019
It can reveal so much to us,

457
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:54,559
the journaling,

458
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,480
and the note taking.

459
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,640
But once again,

460
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,000
unless we take action outside of ourselves,

461
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,519
and that's why,

462
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:00,440
as you mentioned at the beginning,

463
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:04,240
accountability is so important that that's what we provide as coaches is that

464
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,059
level of accountability.

465
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,000
Not that I'm texting my clients every day going,

466
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:08,460
have you done it?

467
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:09,000
Have you done it?

468
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:09,619
Have you done it?

469
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:15,339
But just that they know that I can hold for them what is important to them and

470
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,220
that they've told me what they're going to do.

471
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,500
And that when we next speak,

472
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:19,619
they're either going to say to me,

473
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,279
I took the action and this was the outcome.

474
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,359
It's better than I expected,

475
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,500
or it's not what I expected.

476
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,400
So can we,

477
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,079
can we work on that?

478
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,140
Or they're going to say,

479
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,519
I didn't take the action and I'm like,

480
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:28,900
great.

481
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,619
Now we have some feedback.

482
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,140
So why do you think you didn't take the action?

483
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:33,539
Okay.

484
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:34,960
So what was it about that?

485
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,480
And that might take us on a completely different track.

486
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,700
So for me,

487
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,200
it's not always about the client taking the action.

488
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:42,859
I think you'd agree,

489
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,160
Luke,

490
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,160
it's about who the person becomes on the goal.

491
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,779
It's not always about the goal.

492
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,680
It's who do you become on the journey?

493
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,579
Some of my sessions are celebrations.

494
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,000
You know,

495
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,640
people struggle to celebrate themselves and their achievements.

496
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:54,380
And part of my,

497
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,460
my role is to mirror back.

498
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,119
Hey,

499
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,799
do you know how you just had that hard conversation?

500
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,619
Would you have had that a year ago?

501
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,799
And there's that recognition of no.

502
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:02,759
Oh,

503
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:04,279
and they suddenly realize,

504
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,160
oh my gosh,

505
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,180
I'm making progress.

506
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:07,200
I'm like 100%.

507
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,799
You're making progress.

508
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,039
Yeah.

509
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:09,380
Brilliant.

510
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,940
I love so much to,

511
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,200
to,

512
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,980
to jump off and chat to you about the celebration part in,

513
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,759
in an era of sport,

514
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:16,140
Kimmy,

515
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,819
where you were told unless you win the grand final,

516
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,759
that's the only time to celebrate.

517
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,359
And some of us played for 14 years and didn't do that.

518
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,619
And you go,

519
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,380
that's a long,

520
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,980
long time of really having an ordinary time,

521
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:27,380
isn't it?

522
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,279
Whereas now it's so much better.

523
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,779
It was little wins along the way,

524
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,380
just the joy and the genius.

525
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:33,920
But if you don't celebrate them,

526
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:34,920
you miss,

527
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:37,819
you miss so much joy along the path.

528
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,500
So I love that,

529
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:38,960
you know,

530
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,299
you've,

531
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:42,319
you've sort of championed that part of the conversation as well.

532
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:42,980
Well,

533
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,599
it's so important.

534
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:43,880
And look,

535
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,299
I'll be honest.

536
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,619
I'm not a big sports person.

537
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:47,359
I watched Ted Lasso.

538
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:50,099
That's probably about as close as I'm getting to sport at the moment.

539
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,359
And how good's Ted Lasso,

540
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:51,859
by the way,

541
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:52,940
if you haven't seen that,

542
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:54,220
really worth watching.

543
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,880
Ted Lasso,

544
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:56,319
talk about leadership,

545
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:57,500
value-based leadership,

546
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,420
just breaking down gender stereotypes.

547
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:00,319
Like it is,

548
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,880
that is impactful television.

549
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,720
But I am an endurance runner.

550
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:05,980
So it's really interesting.

551
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,759
So most of my goals and I'll run like my sort of sweet spot is a 50 K race,

552
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,819
but I've run up to 104 kilometers and,

553
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,039
you know,

554
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,059
marathon distances.

555
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,380
My goal is always to finish the race.

556
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:17,700
Okay.

557
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,079
That's,

558
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,059
that's my main goal.

559
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:20,319
But even within that,

560
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:22,400
I always have three other goals.

561
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,220
So there are always,

562
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,680
kind of next little steps.

563
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,420
So it's kind of like,

564
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,460
I'm going to run up to the top of that particular high hill,

565
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,980
or I'm going to make sure that I am at a particular pace on the downhill on

566
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,619
that particular thing or something so that actually I always,

567
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:37,839
you know,

568
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,400
success begets success.

569
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,700
So then you have this feeling of I'm always making progress.

570
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,680
I can put these little goals in place.

571
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,220
I think a lot of times we make the goal so big,

572
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,980
even when I'm running those big races,

573
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,740
I'm only taking one step at a time.

574
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,400
I'm not running 104 kilometers.

575
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,160
I'm running one step at a time.

576
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,900
One foot in front of the other.

577
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,059
But I think unless we put little,

578
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,319
little goals in,

579
00:22:59,680 --> 00:22:59,940
um,

580
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,900
we miss the progress that we're making.

581
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,460
And if we don't think we're making progress,

582
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,940
then we pull out or we create the goal to be so big

583
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,059
that we don't even know where to start.

584
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:07,880
And we're paralyzed.

585
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,039
And that doesn't work either.

586
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,259
And I loved even going back to a bit of,

587
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:11,779
um,

588
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,440
your intention setting to,

589
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:13,900
by the way,

590
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,359
104 case sounds like the worst thing ever in the history of

591
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:17,799
the world.

592
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:20,720
You don't want to play soccer for me Sam.

593
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,039
You know,

594
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:21,960
so that's okay.

595
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:22,839
You can have,

596
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:23,539
you can have,

597
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:24,099
I'll do me.

598
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,539
That's right.

599
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,759
You can have your marathon running.

600
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:26,559
That's all for you.

601
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:27,359
Uh,

602
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:27,740
but,

603
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,880
but I love even one of the stories I think you shared in

604
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,480
your podcast.

605
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,119
I read it,

606
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,599
uh,

607
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,680
in the last couple of days,

608
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,240
which is even about your shift to the country and you put

609
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,220
some intention around,

610
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:36,700
Hey,

611
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,859
this is what it's going to look like.

612
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:39,440
And I think you and your husband sat down and,

613
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,440
and put a,

614
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:40,720
you know,

615
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,299
a dozen factors around what it might look like planning it

616
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:44,579
for a long time further out,

617
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,019
I believe.

618
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,279
But,

619
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,400
but you know,

620
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,480
people often wonder why things don't work out,

621
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,839
but you put that into the universe and,

622
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:51,259
you know,

623
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:51,559
suddenly,

624
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,539
you know,

625
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:52,740
you,

626
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,140
you're there a lot quicker than you thought.

627
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,559
It's,

628
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:54,839
it's,

629
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:55,579
it's a powerful thing,

630
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,259
isn't it?

631
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:56,920
It is.

632
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,440
I remember sitting my husband down.

633
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:58,960
So I've,

634
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,539
I grew up in Kent in England's country garden.

635
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,279
It's known as,

636
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,119
and so we took our kids out of school in 2015 and we

637
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,539
went around Australia for 387 days.

638
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:10,940
And when we got back,

639
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,880
I just said to my husband,

640
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,460
you know what?

641
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:14,539
I love the city and everything that it brings,

642
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:16,180
but I actually want to stay.

643
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,119
I want to move to the country because I knew with the

644
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,039
work that I do,

645
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:22,839
I wanted to be around nature and have space so that I

646
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,140
can be full up so that I can,

647
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,039
I can be of service in a sustainable way.

648
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,460
And we're not yet permanently at the farm,

649
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:30,519
but we will be once our youngest leaves home,

650
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,259
which hopefully will be in the next couple of years.

651
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:33,920
But I remember just saying to my husband,

652
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,099
let's just write down,

653
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,819
let's just write down what it is that we want in this

654
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:38,160
property.

655
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,960
Like what is important to us moving forward?

656
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:43,940
And I think we wrote a list of 16 things and we got

657
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,839
14 of them,

658
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,180
you know,

659
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,660
and it's true.

660
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,599
I'm very much believe in putting intentions out to the

661
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,079
universe.

662
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:49,920
And it was like,

663
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,160
Oh yeah,

664
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,839
14 will do.

665
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,400
That's okay.

666
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,640
We can let the other two go.

667
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:53,880
I reckon we're pretty close.

668
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,059
I love it.

669
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,259
Brilliant to,

670
00:24:57,259 --> 00:24:58,779
to create your own path.

671
00:24:58,779 --> 00:24:59,299
As you said,

672
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,559
it's what you discovered at 18,

673
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:00,940
isn't it?

674
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,400
Going back to the celestial prophecy,

675
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,319
as you said before,

676
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:06,480
the ability to be able to create your own,

677
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:09,259
your own world fascinated by you studying in Bhutan.

678
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:11,960
And what an incredible place on my,

679
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,039
my list to go.

680
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,519
The only country in the world that measures its wealth

681
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:17,039
for the happiness of its people.

682
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:17,259
I mean,

683
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:18,180
you've got to say that again,

684
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:18,980
don't you?

685
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,740
To understand how brilliant that is.

686
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:20,980
I mean,

687
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,940
you studied the gross national happiness,

688
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,880
enter in Bhutan.

689
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:25,339
Tell me,

690
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,140
tell me about that.

691
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,079
Well,

692
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:27,700
funnily enough,

693
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,579
my husband and I were chatting.

694
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,240
We're actually going to go back again this year.

695
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,039
It isn't.

696
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,940
I highly recommend that you go just be aware of the plane journey.

697
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,180
As you go into Bhutan,

698
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:39,779
the plane kind of goes vertically through some cliffs.

699
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:41,299
Very scary.

700
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:45,160
Make sure you have your values intact by the time you do that.

701
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,599
I'm already nervous.

702
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,759
It's about six months away,

703
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:48,819
but yes.

704
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,359
So,

705
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:51,099
and I need to put a caveat in here.

706
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,579
Of course,

707
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,599
Bhutan has people in it.

708
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:56,920
So although they measure the wealth of their country through the

709
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,680
happiness of their people,

710
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,059
of course,

711
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,640
there are people that are unhappy in that country.

712
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,900
It's not as if everyone's skipping through flowery meadows,

713
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,420
but what they notice,

714
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,359
as I said earlier,

715
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,779
that success is not just measured on economic advancement,

716
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:12,220
that you also have to look at it in terms of how a community is

717
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:12,500
going,

718
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,859
how individuals going,

719
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,880
what is the impact that we're making on the environment and that

720
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,859
they're measured all the time.

721
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,140
And even being at the,

722
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,259
at the leadership course there in Bhutan,

723
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:23,460
at the,

724
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,460
at the happiness center,

725
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:25,380
you know,

726
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,359
that we were leaders from all over the world,

727
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:30,839
various industries spending a week together in this incredible environment.

728
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,880
And even how that was constructed,

729
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,559
I could feel my very Western mind wanting to kind of speed up the process.

730
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:38,200
So,

731
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,460
you know,

732
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,359
this was now over 10 years ago and,

733
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:41,579
you know,

734
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:42,460
we'd wake up every day,

735
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,339
we'd spend time together.

736
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:43,500
We'd,

737
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,740
we'd kind of co-create what we'd be doing for that day.

738
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:47,839
And I could feel,

739
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,240
I think I said to my husband at one point,

740
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,980
like,

741
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,700
so what are we doing?

742
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,259
Like,

743
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:53,380
so what are we doing?

744
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:53,980
Or something like that.

745
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,339
And he was like,

746
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:55,000
there it is.

747
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,259
I was like,

748
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:55,559
oh yeah,

749
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:55,779
okay.

750
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah,

751
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,559
there it is.

752
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,880
There it is.

753
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,079
To just kind of be in how grounding it is to just have that pause and to have

754
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,720
that peace was incredibly special.

755
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,660
And just to spend time with leaders across the world,

756
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,420
wanting to look at leadership from a different lens,

757
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:14,140
wanting to look at what sustainable leadership is from a different lens.

758
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:16,839
And I'm really looking forward to going back this year and seeing kind of where

759
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:17,539
they're up to now,

760
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:20,440
their programs and learning more.

761
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:21,099
Yeah.

762
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,200
I think some of the words that,

763
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,960
that I read of yours,

764
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,019
the world doesn't need more busy women.

765
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:26,759
Uh,

766
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:28,960
it needs more present and powerful women,

767
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,700
another great piece of wisdom.

768
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,880
And it sounds like that's something we all juggle with,

769
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,299
isn't it?

770
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:35,900
There's so many great things to do,

771
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,519
but you know,

772
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,299
pressing pause to not miss the point of life is something I think about all

773
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:40,900
the time.

774
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,099
And how do you go about that?

775
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,359
Yeah,

776
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:43,700
I,

777
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,140
I,

778
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,339
I love the pause.

779
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,180
I spend a lot of time.

780
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,380
It's funny because people,

781
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,779
I call myself an anti busy advocate.

782
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,200
So people will sort of see the work,

783
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,579
that I do or where I do it,

784
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:57,279
or who I spend my time with and just assume that I'm busy.

785
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,200
But one thing I know for sure is that I'm not a kind person when I'm

786
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,500
overwhelmed and busy.

787
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,240
I'm incredibly resentful.

788
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:05,700
If I feel too stretched,

789
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,700
if I feel like I'm not really showing up to the people or the things that

790
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,140
matter to me in a way that,

791
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,500
that,

792
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:11,859
um,

793
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:12,940
that I feel proud of,

794
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,440
I'm not a very kind person.

795
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,400
Like I'm exhausted.

796
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,299
So for me,

797
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:17,920
I try and move away from busy.

798
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,700
And even,

799
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,099
even the wording that I try to use is,

800
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:21,579
you know,

801
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:22,900
we all have periods in our life,

802
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,200
especially,

803
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,420
when it comes to work or even raising children where,

804
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,160
you know,

805
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,160
the stakes are higher,

806
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:27,519
you know,

807
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:29,859
like it's taking something and it's tough.

808
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:30,880
And I,

809
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,420
I changed that to full.

810
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:33,279
So I might say,

811
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,000
I've got a full couple of weeks and I've just started writing about a little

812
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,079
bit.

813
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,819
I'm about to start writing my fourth book.

814
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:40,940
And so I'm playing with this idea,

815
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,059
but I think the distinction is for me,

816
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:47,319
busy is having things happen to you.

817
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:52,579
Whereas full is intentionally choosing what is in your calendar.

818
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,039
Okay.

819
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:54,579
So I'm busy.

820
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:58,720
I'm busy as if you have no control as opposed to know I've chosen what's in my

821
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,259
calendar.

822
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:01,359
And there's a level of ownership over that.

823
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:07,079
That the idea of busy is that I'm not present to what's important.

824
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,880
Whereas full is I'm doing what is important.

825
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,079
So I'm just playing with,

826
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,220
I'm playing with it now,

827
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:15,000
come back to me in a year or so see where I'm up to.

828
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,119
But I think it's important that we really look at these words that we use

829
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:22,900
because this whole busy as a status thing is what leads to burnout in people.

830
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,400
And leads to people living lives that aren't actually fulfilling for them.

831
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:27,759
It's a great point.

832
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,539
And I love the way you described that.

833
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,819
Can you busy as a status?

834
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:31,140
You know,

835
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:31,579
I've been,

836
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,220
uh,

837
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:32,759
you know,

838
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:37,859
in Hawaii city on a beach next to someone who's had to take a phone call.

839
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,339
Who's having a great time,

840
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:40,440
but needed to say,

841
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm busy.

842
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:41,819
I've got some meetings.

843
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:43,220
I've got stuff going on.

844
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:44,440
And I've done that too.

845
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:44,799
Isn't it?

846
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:48,940
Where you think people are going to think I'm not successful if I don't show

847
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,400
them how full my calendar is.

848
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:50,640
And,

849
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,400
and,

850
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,619
but in the end that,

851
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:54,299
it makes us incredibly unhappy.

852
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:54,640
I mean,

853
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,039
it's,

854
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:55,519
it's,

855
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,099
you're right,

856
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,460
isn't it?

857
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,019
That it's a,

858
00:29:57,019 --> 00:29:59,779
it's a success language that needs changing,

859
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,099
doesn't it?

860
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,000
It's a work in progress.

861
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,099
Yeah.

862
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,579
And that's such a great example because I think about it now.

863
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:05,380
And actually when I think,

864
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:06,519
when I think about that,

865
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:11,660
I think I'm more prone now to look at the person that could be on the beach

866
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,140
in Hawaii,

867
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:13,859
which by the way is on my bucket list.

868
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:18,440
I'm more prone to see the person that could be on the beach on Hawaii and

869
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,519
not have to take calls as a successful person because they're present to where

870
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:22,599
they are.

871
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:24,980
So let's even take Hawaii out of it.

872
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:28,559
The person that can be on holiday with their children and be with their

873
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:28,920
children.

874
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,839
That would be a level of success for me,

875
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:31,519
you know,

876
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,480
and not everyone,

877
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,339
depending on the industry or where you are,

878
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:34,700
you know,

879
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,839
in terms of title within your role or your job or what you do.

880
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:38,619
Of course,

881
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,859
not everyone can do that all of the time,

882
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:42,779
but I do think people miss that.

883
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,539
We can do it more often than we think we can.

884
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:45,839
Like I'm speaking as an entrepreneur,

885
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:47,819
I get a hundred percent ownership over my time,

886
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:52,519
but I've also been an employee and one of the gifts I believe of COVID is

887
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,279
that we actually,

888
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,660
for those people that are employed,

889
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,460
we have a little bit more agency now around how we work.

890
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,900
And I just hope that people are courageous enough to ask for what they need

891
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,480
so they can be present to what matters most in their life.

892
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,140
Yeah.

893
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
It's a beautifully said,

894
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:07,579
isn't it?

895
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:09,700
It is hopefully this huge shift that's happened,

896
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:10,019
isn't it?

897
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:11,880
Now the ability to have that flexibility.

898
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:13,819
I'm thinking of a line that I know I'll butcher,

899
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,480
but you know,

900
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:19,519
no one on their deathbed has ever regretted working harder or striving more.

901
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,799
The only regrets are always,

902
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,099
isn't it?

903
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,319
The less time with family,

904
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:24,279
or the more time to take that time out.

905
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:24,900
And it's,

906
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,980
it's easy to say,

907
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:28,220
but we've been conditioned the other way.

908
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:29,740
And I know the same feeling too.

909
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:30,039
When you,

910
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,640
when you work in a space where people see you,

911
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,039
they go,

912
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,299
geez,

913
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,200
you're busy all the time,

914
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,460
isn't it?

915
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,119
I tried to fence.

916
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:35,519
No,

917
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:37,480
there's nothing like what it looks like.

918
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,640
You just see me.

919
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,759
I've got a whole heap of other time where I do my best to not be busy,

920
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,319
but it doesn't always work that way.

921
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,240
And I think having the balance is,

922
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:47,500
you know,

923
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,000
I think most of us are aiming for kind of having that balance where we're doing

924
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,980
work that is fulfilling.

925
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,740
And we're also in relationships and in families that are nourishing and

926
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,079
fulfilling.

927
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,039
I think,

928
00:31:57,099 --> 00:31:57,359
you know,

929
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,779
people have had some,

930
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,799
some people have had that experience of where they have the success,

931
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,220
whatever it looks like on paper,

932
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,380
but actually all of their personal relationships are in disarray or where you

933
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,259
have all of your relationships are working perfectly well,

934
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:10,940
but you're not making the impact or you're not doing the work that you want

935
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,259
to do.

936
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,579
So I think the work is always what is balanced look like for me,

937
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,599
depending on the season I'm living in,

938
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,920
which is different for all of us.

939
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,119
Beautiful.

940
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:19,759
Say it again,

941
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,380
one of the things I,

942
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,539
that I'm really passionate about with our space called elite,

943
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:26,319
we bring together different leaders,

944
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,960
diverse leaders from different backgrounds into these bespoke connected

945
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,339
groups.

946
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,019
And I love talking.

947
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,660
I'm fascinated by your answers in this,

948
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,220
because we see some patterns of what really great modern leadership is

949
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,359
looking like in our view.

950
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:40,200
And I want to ask you about some of these dimensions of leadership,

951
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,799
starting with self leadership.

952
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,200
Can we,

953
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:45,740
we don't think that you can lead others without a sense of what your own

954
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,500
self is.

955
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,359
Does that resonate with you?

956
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:48,299
Oh,

957
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,000
100%.

958
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,039
And I think the beautiful thing about that is,

959
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:51,859
and,

960
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,819
and this is the work,

961
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,240
right?

962
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:56,400
Luke is that we think that work is this thing outside of us that we,

963
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:56,619
you know,

964
00:32:56,619 --> 00:32:57,259
get on the car,

965
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,920
get in the car to get to or something,

966
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,180
but actually the ultimate work is the work on self.

967
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:06,019
And so we all want to follow leaders who are self aware of how they

968
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:07,400
impact the people around them.

969
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:11,920
We want to be around leaders that can identify the humanity in us because

970
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,940
they can identify the humanity in themselves.

971
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:17,160
And I've literally just come off the back of doing a dare to lead

972
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,200
retreat yesterday.

973
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:18,980
And,

974
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:19,220
you know,

975
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,680
that is the context of the work.

976
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,599
And Brene Brown says this self awareness matters that so many things

977
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:28,420
happen in organizations within leadership,

978
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,319
because we're just not aware of what we're doing.

979
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:33,900
We don't know that we made that offhand comment that actually made,

980
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:34,140
you know,

981
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,259
one of our team members kind of really off for the rest of the day or made

982
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:39,240
them feel like they could,

983
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,640
they weren't capable at their job and we don't have the tool to then go back

984
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
in and just check in and say,

985
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:43,779
Hey,

986
00:33:43,819 --> 00:33:44,539
did I make a,

987
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,779
that comment I made,

988
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:47,440
did that kind of put you off side a little bit?

989
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,240
Cause I'd like to know,

990
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,420
cause I don't want you to feel like you didn't do a great job on the

991
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:50,819
project.

992
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,740
I just want to redefine what the project was meant to be or something,

993
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:54,460
you know?

994
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,019
So yes,

995
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:55,700
I think leadership,

996
00:33:56,019 --> 00:33:56,140
well,

997
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,180
not I think I know that leaders should always be doing work on themselves so

998
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,420
they can show up as for humans.

999
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,859
Cause we want to be led by humans.

1000
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:04,740
Yeah.

1001
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:05,220
That's great.

1002
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:05,839
Um,

1003
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:06,400
uh,

1004
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,519
insight into that.

1005
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,159
And I was looking at your dare to lead,

1006
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:09,619
um,

1007
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,519
retreats.

1008
00:34:10,539 --> 00:34:10,760
They look,

1009
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,380
they look brilliant.

1010
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:11,639
Can we,

1011
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:11,900
can we,

1012
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,280
can we give that a mention now?

1013
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,900
Because I see you've,

1014
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,340
um,

1015
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,219
I was just obviously finished one up,

1016
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,079
but it's something you do.

1017
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:20,699
You bring groups of people,

1018
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,519
you know,

1019
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,539
eight to 10 to 12.

1020
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,099
Is that right?

1021
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:23,320
To,

1022
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,599
to spend that reflective time.

1023
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,480
Yeah,

1024
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:26,260
that's right.

1025
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:26,699
So,

1026
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,039
you know,

1027
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:29,099
very blessed to go and train with Renee in Texas.

1028
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:29,800
Um,

1029
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,239
and as a coach,

1030
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,039
I can now sort of add that tool set of the deadly program and kind of,

1031
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:36,800
it's her IP,

1032
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:38,599
but I get to facilitate the content.

1033
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:39,599
And,

1034
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,019
um,

1035
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,940
these actual retreats are for women.

1036
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,199
I do actually do one-to-one coach with a few good men.

1037
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,179
I have to let you know that Luke,

1038
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:48,480
like not exclusively when I birthed a man and I'm married to a man.

1039
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,260
So that all works.

1040
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,099
But,

1041
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:50,380
um,

1042
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,019
the debt,

1043
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:51,880
I do believe in,

1044
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,000
I do believe in,

1045
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:53,480
you know,

1046
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,639
what it is for,

1047
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:55,679
especially what,

1048
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,380
cause I love to bring together women of various ages in different industries.

1049
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,539
I remember when I first started putting the retreats together,

1050
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:05,480
I'm kind of curious to know sort of the work that you do in terms of if you

1051
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,380
work with entrepreneurs and people within the corporate organizational space.

1052
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,019
But I remember thinking at the beginning,

1053
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:10,300
Oh,

1054
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,059
I'll do a death lead retreat for entrepreneurs and I'll do a death lead

1055
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:15,260
retreat for people in organizations and corporates.

1056
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:16,699
And then I realized,

1057
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,820
why would you do that?

1058
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,360
You want to bring together,

1059
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,719
these two different styles of working.

1060
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,440
So there can be this beautiful osmosis and people understanding how it is in

1061
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,760
each other people's camp.

1062
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:28,559
And even,

1063
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:28,820
you know,

1064
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,679
everyone always says one of the most powerful things about having groups of

1065
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:35,199
people together where they feel safe is that you get to hear that what you're

1066
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,099
going through is not a solo experience that someone's either been there before

1067
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:40,059
or they're in the middle of it,

1068
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:41,440
or they're on the other side of it.

1069
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,039
And that,

1070
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,119
that gives you a really great,

1071
00:35:43,179 --> 00:35:46,900
really good grounding in your leadership and your style of leadership moving

1072
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,380
forward.

1073
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:47,820
Well,

1074
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,940
we'll have to connect with this,

1075
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:49,539
Kimmy,

1076
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:50,340
because I think there's some,

1077
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,179
some shared synergy.

1078
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,079
What we,

1079
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,780
a leader connect is the program that my,

1080
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,460
my great friend,

1081
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:56,539
Matt and I are passionate about.

1082
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:57,639
And we started because we,

1083
00:35:57,659 --> 00:35:58,800
we come from a sporting background.

1084
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:06,219
So we put non-competing coaches together in groups and then created this sort of trusted

1085
00:36:06,219 --> 00:36:08,800
space where it's pretty lonely for a lot of them,

1086
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,039
Kimmy,

1087
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:11,300
as you would know in leadership positions.

1088
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:14,820
But then what we quickly realized a bit like you was that,

1089
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,179
you know,

1090
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:17,159
to have a coach and we have got this,

1091
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:17,480
you know,

1092
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,780
a coach of a sporting team,

1093
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,139
senior coach of a sporting team.

1094
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:20,300
And,

1095
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,659
and you won't mind Michael Voss from Carlton with Benjamin Northey,

1096
00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:25,639
who's the conductor of the Melbourne symphony orchestra.

1097
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,420
And then put Kimmy neck to the bill in that situation.

1098
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:29,739
You go,

1099
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:30,159
wow,

1100
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,659
what is,

1101
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:36,480
what happens when you get completely different parts of your brain using for the sports coach,

1102
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:42,179
they get to tap into your beautiful wisdom and thinking that there would never open a space or a conductor.

1103
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:43,900
How do you conduct an orchestra in Spain?

1104
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,960
We don't speak Spanish and you got 450 people.

1105
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:48,119
And what does that bring to the table?

1106
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:50,360
So that's become the real passion for us.

1107
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:50,719
You know,

1108
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:58,219
the diversity of thinking is the superpower and not just the idea that you need to do it for ticking a box.

1109
00:36:58,219 --> 00:37:00,260
So it's really evolved in that space.

1110
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,599
So I'm fascinated that you're seeing a bit of the same in what you're doing as well.

1111
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,099
Well,

1112
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:07,039
100% and actually what happened this retreat was really great.

1113
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:07,760
You know that,

1114
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,260
you know,

1115
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:12,800
we all know why diversity is really important in all spaces in all places for all people.

1116
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,780
But even in the retreat over the weekend,

1117
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,159
one of the female leaders,

1118
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:16,760
you know,

1119
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,239
we do a lot of role play around hard conversations because that is the,

1120
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,460
that is the thing that kind of has daring leaders.

1121
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:30,380
That's the antithesis to daring leadership is not having hard conversations is talking about people behind their back instead of talking to them.

1122
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,780
I'm creating these kind of the meeting after the meeting,

1123
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,019
you know,

1124
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:35,059
all of these sorts of things we do in the data lead work.

1125
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:41,480
And one of the women could take ownership of her neurodivergency and we'll role playing these hard conversations.

1126
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,619
She just said,

1127
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:44,059
but I'm just direct all the time.

1128
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:45,739
I don't need to role play.

1129
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:46,820
That's part of my,

1130
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,639
that's part of what I do.

1131
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:48,719
That's what my husband's always saying.

1132
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:49,619
You don't have to be,

1133
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:50,239
you don't have to say,

1134
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,920
the truth all the time.

1135
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,079
So then it was people.

1136
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:54,960
So then people like,

1137
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,760
Oh wow.

1138
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,619
Okay.

1139
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:57,179
So then she,

1140
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:57,980
so someone was said to her,

1141
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,420
so how would you say that?

1142
00:37:59,420 --> 00:37:59,579
You know,

1143
00:37:59,579 --> 00:37:59,820
she said,

1144
00:37:59,820 --> 00:37:59,940
well,

1145
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,400
I would just,

1146
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,380
and she could just cut through it because of her neurodivergency.

1147
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,739
She didn't have kind of the social malls that some of us can fill it.

1148
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:06,380
Oh,

1149
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:06,860
I don't want to,

1150
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,980
I don't want to hurt that person.

1151
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,199
I don't want them to think this.

1152
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,619
She just said it like it was.

1153
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:13,880
And what was interesting is that the person that she was kind of role playing with,

1154
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,360
I said,

1155
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:14,840
you know,

1156
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,559
feedback to the room,

1157
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:20,019
how did it feel to have someone communicate with you in a really clear and kind and direct way?

1158
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:21,519
And this other woman just said,

1159
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:22,519
it was amazing.

1160
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,519
Like I just,

1161
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:24,780
I didn't leave the room.

1162
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,019
I wouldn't have left the room thinking,

1163
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:28,019
what did she,

1164
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:29,519
what did she really mean?

1165
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:31,519
Or was there something she wasn't saying?

1166
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:32,519
Or is she saying this?

1167
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,019
She told me what she thought.

1168
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:36,019
She told me how we were going to work on it together.

1169
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:39,019
And I feel supported as a team member and I could take the feedback.

1170
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:41,019
And how brilliant is that real life learning,

1171
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,019
isn't it?

1172
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,019
From someone who's actually doing it,

1173
00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:46,019
who does it naturally and not,

1174
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:47,019
you know,

1175
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:48,019
in a style that you're,

1176
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:49,019
but you can learn.

1177
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:50,019
They're learned skills,

1178
00:38:50,019 --> 00:38:53,019
you can learn how to bring people together in retreats is close your line with what we love.

1179
00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:54,019
I mean,

1180
00:38:54,019 --> 00:38:55,019
case studies are brilliant,

1181
00:38:55,019 --> 00:38:56,019
but they often happen 20 years ago.

1182
00:38:56,019 --> 00:38:58,019
What's happening currently is really,

1183
00:38:58,019 --> 00:38:59,019
really interesting.

1184
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:00,019
The second dimension,

1185
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:01,019
Kimmy,

1186
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:02,019
I wanted to talk to,

1187
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:03,019
and you actually mentioned in your first answer,

1188
00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:06,019
we see modern leaders that are self-aware,

1189
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:10,019
very conscious about how they positively impact people in their environment.

1190
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:12,019
How have you gone about that?

1191
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:14,019
And what does that mean to you?

1192
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,019
I suppose for me,

1193
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:18,019
it is being able as,

1194
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:19,019
you know,

1195
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:20,019
working as I do,

1196
00:39:20,019 --> 00:39:22,019
as a public speaker and author,

1197
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:26,019
I do have a freedom and a privilege in being able to kind of own my opinions.

1198
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:28,019
And I get to say what I want to say.

1199
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:29,019
I'm a very bounded person.

1200
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:33,019
So you're never going to see me sort of oversharing on social media or anything,

1201
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:35,019
but I do share,

1202
00:39:35,019 --> 00:39:42,019
but I do share about my life and I do share about my story and I share about what I'm thinking as opposed.

1203
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:44,019
And I sometimes will share about what I know,

1204
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:46,019
but I try and share through the lens of my experience.

1205
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:48,019
Like I don't have it all together.

1206
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:49,019
I don't have all the answers.

1207
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:55,019
And what I have found is that I'm attracting people that want to work with me,

1208
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:57,019
that it's sort of sitting in that space too.

1209
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:03,019
It's kind of like they know that they want a trusted partner to walk alongside with them as they're navigating life.

1210
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:05,019
And the more that I share who I am,

1211
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:06,019
what's important to me,

1212
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:07,019
my views on things,

1213
00:40:07,019 --> 00:40:09,019
they get to know whether or not I'm the person for them.

1214
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:11,019
And I think it's really,

1215
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:15,019
the more people are able to stand up and feel safe enough to say,

1216
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:16,019
this is who I am.

1217
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:17,019
This is where I come from.

1218
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:18,019
This is what's wounded me.

1219
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:19,019
This is where I've succeeded.

1220
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:21,019
This is how my wounds have helped my success.

1221
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:23,019
The more that each of us are willing to do that,

1222
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:27,019
we can't all be attracted to all the same people at the same time,

1223
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:28,019
you know,

1224
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:30,019
but we are led towards our people,

1225
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:31,019
to our clan,

1226
00:40:31,019 --> 00:40:32,019
to our mob,

1227
00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:33,019
to our tribe.

1228
00:40:33,019 --> 00:40:36,019
But we can only do that if the leaders are showing up as who they are.

1229
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:38,019
And I think that's really powerful.

1230
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,019
And once again,

1231
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,019
I always just want to put the caveat in because I know that there are people that are not entrepreneurs.

1232
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:45,019
So you just get the leader that you get and that's it.

1233
00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:48,019
But that's kind of where the self leadership comes in.

1234
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:49,019
As well.

1235
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:50,019
And looking at,

1236
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:51,019
okay,

1237
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:54,019
so how do I get to show up as a leader in this space where maybe I don't have the title,

1238
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:58,019
but I still get to lead and show up in a way that is of service to others,

1239
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:01,019
but in a way that also empowers me.

1240
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:02,019
Yeah,

1241
00:41:02,019 --> 00:41:03,019
beautifully said.

1242
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:04,019
I love the holistic thought,

1243
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:05,019
Kimmy,

1244
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:08,019
just sharing what great outcomes look for different people.

1245
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:12,019
And you mightn't be an entrepreneur or you mightn't want to take it in a certain direction,

1246
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:15,019
but given the state of some of the things happening at a higher level,

1247
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:17,019
to just share what good people are doing

1248
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:19,019
and the way they live their life,

1249
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:22,019
I feel is a pretty meaningful and positive thing to do.

1250
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:26,019
And clearly you're doing that at an incredibly powerful way.

1251
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:27,019
And I want to mention your book too,

1252
00:41:27,019 --> 00:41:28,019
and I'll get to that in a moment,

1253
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,019
Power Word,

1254
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,019
a brilliant book,

1255
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:33,019
A Women's Guide to Living and Leading Without Apology.

1256
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:34,019
I'll ask you about that in a moment.

1257
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:39,019
Creating and sharing your vision is something we see really as a common trait,

1258
00:41:39,019 --> 00:41:40,019
again,

1259
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:42,019
a modern leader is very clear about how they go about it.

1260
00:41:42,019 --> 00:41:46,019
You've got very clear language around what you do and how,

1261
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:48,019
you want to achieve that.

1262
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:52,019
Can you tell us how you've gone about creating and sharing that vision?

1263
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:53,019
Well,

1264
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:56,019
on a kind of tactical sort of ground level basis,

1265
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:58,019
I do three things.

1266
00:41:58,019 --> 00:41:59,019
I coach,

1267
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:00,019
I write,

1268
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:01,019
and I speak.

1269
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,019
So that is it.

1270
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:08,019
And then I have an incredible EA that does everything in the background so that I can show up and do those things

1271
00:42:08,019 --> 00:42:12,019
because my calendar management is just not my core genius.

1272
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:15,019
So no one should have to deal with me doing that.

1273
00:42:15,019 --> 00:42:16,019
Okay.

1274
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:17,019
Actually,

1275
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:18,019
people did have to deal with me doing that,

1276
00:42:18,019 --> 00:42:21,019
which is why I now have somebody else doing it.

1277
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:22,019
So,

1278
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:23,019
you know,

1279
00:42:23,019 --> 00:42:24,019
on a kind of tangible level,

1280
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:25,019
that's what it is.

1281
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:28,019
I very much see that my,

1282
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:29,019
my,

1283
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:30,019
actually,

1284
00:42:30,019 --> 00:42:32,019
somebody said in the retreat that she has a divine mission.

1285
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:34,019
And I thought that was so beautiful.

1286
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:35,019
You know,

1287
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:38,019
and then you just cut away anything that's superfluous from the divine mission.

1288
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:39,019
But for me,

1289
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:40,019
it's this idea of,

1290
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:44,019
I know why I'm here and I'm here to create spaces where women,

1291
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,019
in particular,

1292
00:42:45,019 --> 00:42:48,019
identify as women or anyone from marginalized communities,

1293
00:42:48,019 --> 00:42:54,019
know that they are allowed to be in any space that they want to be without apology.

1294
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:55,019
And that is my work.

1295
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:59,019
And whether that is me sharing on Instagram,

1296
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:00,019
me,

1297
00:43:00,019 --> 00:43:01,019
you know,

1298
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:02,019
as a black woman owning a farm,

1299
00:43:02,019 --> 00:43:03,019
actually getting into flower farming,

1300
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:04,019
that's my next passion.

1301
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:07,019
And I'm there with my hydrangeas and my delphiniums and,

1302
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:08,019
you know,

1303
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:09,019
like that's my next passion.

1304
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,019
And I know for myself,

1305
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:14,019
there's not many black women that are growing flowers or that own farms in Australia.

1306
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:15,019
So for me,

1307
00:43:15,019 --> 00:43:16,019
that's giving,

1308
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:17,019
that's giving a mirror to people to say,

1309
00:43:17,019 --> 00:43:20,019
you are allowed to do this too.

1310
00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:22,019
It doesn't just look a certain way.

1311
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:23,019
And so for me,

1312
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:26,019
anything where I'm living my life as a model,

1313
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:27,019
not as a guru,

1314
00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:29,019
have no interest in being anyone's guru.

1315
00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:32,019
I am a human being and I have,

1316
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:34,019
speak to my teenagers or my husband,

1317
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:36,019
like I'm very much a human.

1318
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:43,019
But I do definitely feel that the life that I have lived and the experience that I've had,

1319
00:43:43,019 --> 00:43:46,019
I am taking full ownership of those things.

1320
00:43:46,019 --> 00:43:47,019
And I,

1321
00:43:47,019 --> 00:43:48,019
you know,

1322
00:43:48,019 --> 00:43:49,019
I'm a woman in midlife now.

1323
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:51,019
And if I have 40 years left,

1324
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:52,019
what a gift that would be.

1325
00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:54,019
And I'm definitely not going to hide anymore.

1326
00:43:54,019 --> 00:43:56,019
And I don't want other marginalized people,

1327
00:43:56,019 --> 00:43:58,019
whether that's gender,

1328
00:43:58,019 --> 00:43:59,019
whether that's ability,

1329
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:01,019
whether that's identity to think that,

1330
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:05,019
that we have to keep on hiding because this,

1331
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:06,019
you know,

1332
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:09,019
I have a 17 year old and I know that you have teenagers loop.

1333
00:44:09,019 --> 00:44:12,019
I feel so privileged to be around this generation.

1334
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:18,019
That just don't even care about the things that we thought were really big things and that they are recreating language.

1335
00:44:18,019 --> 00:44:20,019
And is it difficult to get on board?

1336
00:44:20,019 --> 00:44:21,019
Yes,

1337
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:22,019
it is.

1338
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:26,019
Sometimes I have a non-binary 17 year old and it took a while to change the pronouns and all of those things.

1339
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:28,019
I had a dear friend say to me on my,

1340
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:30,019
my child sort of maybe doing the pronouns,

1341
00:44:30,019 --> 00:44:31,019
but I just don't understand it.

1342
00:44:31,019 --> 00:44:32,019
I don't understand.

1343
00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:33,019
And I said,

1344
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:35,019
if you focus on understanding,

1345
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:38,019
you're going to miss what they're asking from you.

1346
00:44:38,019 --> 00:44:39,019
They're asking,

1347
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:41,019
can you love me and respect me?

1348
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:43,019
While I am trying to figure out my identity.

1349
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:44,019
And I think as parents,

1350
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:45,019
if we get stuck in there,

1351
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:47,019
but I need to understand why they're doing the thing,

1352
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:49,019
we're going to miss connection with our teenagers.

1353
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,019
And this generation,

1354
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:54,019
I believe is creating the world that most of us want to live in through language change.

1355
00:44:54,019 --> 00:44:55,019
Yeah,

1356
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:56,019
that's a brilliant thought,

1357
00:44:56,019 --> 00:44:57,019
isn't it?

1358
00:44:57,019 --> 00:44:58,019
And I,

1359
00:44:58,019 --> 00:45:00,019
my mind was going immediately to my 18 year old daughter,

1360
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:01,019
three boys as well.

1361
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:03,019
And you know exactly where you stand with her.

1362
00:45:03,019 --> 00:45:04,019
She,

1363
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:06,019
she tells you in no uncertain terms.

1364
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:07,019
Yeah.

1365
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:08,019
And,

1366
00:45:08,019 --> 00:45:09,019
and if you don't,

1367
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:10,019
you know,

1368
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:11,019
and,

1369
00:45:11,019 --> 00:45:12,019
and if you try and,

1370
00:45:12,019 --> 00:45:13,019
I think like the language,

1371
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:14,019
like that's not okay.

1372
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:15,019
That's not okay.

1373
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:16,019
Yeah.

1374
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:18,019
A hundred percent as direct as you could possibly imagine.

1375
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:19,019
Sometimes it's confronting,

1376
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:20,019
but you work out,

1377
00:45:20,019 --> 00:45:22,019
get out of the way and you don't need to understand.

1378
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,019
As you said,

1379
00:45:23,019 --> 00:45:24,019
I haven't thought about it quite that way.

1380
00:45:24,019 --> 00:45:25,019
You don't need to understand.

1381
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:28,019
You just need to have the love and support in the background.

1382
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:29,019
And it's a,

1383
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:30,019
it's a,

1384
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:31,019
it's a great lesson.

1385
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,019
Curiosity is a word that comes up,

1386
00:45:32,019 --> 00:45:33,019
Kim,

1387
00:45:33,019 --> 00:45:34,019
with all the leaders we speak to.

1388
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:39,019
And I use curiosity as a bit of a jumping off point to how they continually learn.

1389
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:40,019
Is,

1390
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:42,019
is that something that aligns with you?

1391
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:43,019
Yeah,

1392
00:45:43,019 --> 00:45:44,019
you have to be curious.

1393
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:46,019
What is life without curiosity?

1394
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:47,019
You know,

1395
00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:49,019
I imagine it's very small.

1396
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:50,019
And I,

1397
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:51,019
I would say for me,

1398
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:53,019
as you said earlier about these skills of practice,

1399
00:45:53,019 --> 00:45:54,019
for me,

1400
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:55,019
curiosity has been a practice.

1401
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:57,019
I was definitely navigating the world in a very small box,

1402
00:45:57,019 --> 00:45:59,019
very scared if I step out of the box that there'd be,

1403
00:45:59,019 --> 00:46:00,019
you know,

1404
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:01,019
negative repercussions.

1405
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:02,019
And the reality is,

1406
00:46:02,019 --> 00:46:04,019
is that there has been sometimes.

1407
00:46:04,019 --> 00:46:05,019
Um,

1408
00:46:05,019 --> 00:46:06,019
but I think,

1409
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:07,019
you know,

1410
00:46:07,019 --> 00:46:08,019
this idea of curiosity,

1411
00:46:08,019 --> 00:46:09,019
and I like this idea,

1412
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:10,019
you know,

1413
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:11,019
it's a very extreme sort of thing,

1414
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:13,019
but I will talk to my clients and even myself.

1415
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:14,019
I talk a lot about play.

1416
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:15,019
Like let's just,

1417
00:46:15,019 --> 00:46:16,019
just get curious.

1418
00:46:16,019 --> 00:46:17,019
Let's just play.

1419
00:46:17,019 --> 00:46:20,019
Why do you think you're not having that conversation with your boss?

1420
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:22,019
Or let's get curious.

1421
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:25,019
If you were to spend a day just on your own,

1422
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:27,019
what would you do with that day?

1423
00:46:27,019 --> 00:46:29,019
I asked the client that the other day and they,

1424
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:31,019
it felt like five minutes of silence.

1425
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:32,019
I'm sure it wasn't,

1426
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:39,019
but they had no idea because they are very much in their roles for other people,

1427
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:45,019
but could not for themselves even begin to imagine what they would do with a whole day for themselves.

1428
00:46:45,019 --> 00:46:46,019
So then I'm not going,

1429
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:47,019
you know,

1430
00:46:47,019 --> 00:46:48,019
I'm not judging.

1431
00:46:48,019 --> 00:46:49,019
I'm not going,

1432
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:50,019
what?

1433
00:46:50,019 --> 00:46:51,019
You don't know how to spend a day.

1434
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:52,019
What sort of a person are you?

1435
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:53,019
I'm just like,

1436
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,019
isn't that,

1437
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,019
isn't that great?

1438
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:56,019
Because now we have feedback.

1439
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:57,019
So if you were to,

1440
00:46:57,019 --> 00:46:58,019
um,

1441
00:46:58,019 --> 00:47:02,019
experiment to think about the things that you might like to do in your perfect day,

1442
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:03,019
what sort of things might you,

1443
00:47:03,019 --> 00:47:04,019
and then that kind of,

1444
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:07,019
that kind of gave the prod and then it all came out.

1445
00:47:07,019 --> 00:47:08,019
Like everything was coming out.

1446
00:47:08,019 --> 00:47:09,019
I was like,

1447
00:47:09,019 --> 00:47:10,019
okay,

1448
00:47:10,019 --> 00:47:11,019
so that's seven days now complete.

1449
00:47:11,019 --> 00:47:12,019
But curiosity is a huge part.

1450
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:13,019
I think it's also for,

1451
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:14,019
for us as coaches,

1452
00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:15,019
it does take out judgment because,

1453
00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:16,019
because a client might give you an answer or a client will give me an answer.

1454
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:17,019
And instead of me saying,

1455
00:47:17,019 --> 00:47:18,019
well,

1456
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:19,019
you didn't say that last time we spoke,

1457
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:20,019
that seems to be completely different to what you actually want.

1458
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:21,019
I would say,

1459
00:47:21,019 --> 00:47:22,019
oh,

1460
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:23,019
okay.

1461
00:47:23,019 --> 00:47:24,019
So I'm really curious because when we last spoke,

1462
00:47:24,019 --> 00:47:25,019
you,

1463
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:26,019
you,

1464
00:47:26,019 --> 00:47:27,019
you,

1465
00:47:27,019 --> 00:47:28,019
you,

1466
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:29,019
you,

1467
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:30,019
you,

1468
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:31,019
you,

1469
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:32,019
you,

1470
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:33,019
you,

1471
00:47:33,019 --> 00:47:34,019
you,

1472
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:35,019
you,

1473
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,019
you,

1474
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,019
you,

1475
00:47:37,019 --> 00:47:38,019
you,

1476
00:47:38,019 --> 00:47:39,019
you said that you wanted the promotion,

1477
00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:40,019
but now I'm hearing that you're thinking of leaving your job.

1478
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:41,019
Can you tell me more about that?"

1479
00:47:41,019 --> 00:47:42,019
So they don't feel judged in that.

1480
00:47:42,019 --> 00:47:43,019
They don't feel like I have an edge,

1481
00:47:43,019 --> 00:47:44,019
because I don't.

1482
00:47:44,019 --> 00:47:46,019
As a coach,

1483
00:47:46,019 --> 00:47:47,019
I don't have an agenda and I don't judge.

1484
00:47:47,019 --> 00:47:48,019
And then,

1485
00:47:48,019 --> 00:47:49,019
but that gives them the space to look at,

1486
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:50,019
oh yeah,

1487
00:47:50,019 --> 00:47:51,019
I hadn't even thought about,

1488
00:47:51,019 --> 00:47:52,019
actually I don't want the promotion.

1489
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:53,019
I thought I did,

1490
00:47:53,019 --> 00:47:54,019
but now that you said that back to me,

1491
00:47:54,019 --> 00:47:55,019
actually you don't.

1492
00:47:55,019 --> 00:47:56,019
And I'm like,

1493
00:47:56,019 --> 00:47:57,019
okay,

1494
00:47:57,019 --> 00:47:58,019
great.

1495
00:47:58,019 --> 00:47:59,019
Where should we go from here.

1496
00:47:59,019 --> 00:48:00,019
Yeah.

1497
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:01,019
The brilliance is in it.

1498
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:02,019
I love hearing,

1499
00:48:02,019 --> 00:48:03,019
you know,

1500
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:05,019
you explain it to people who might be excited to have the opportunity.

1501
00:48:05,019 --> 00:48:08,880
hearing you know you explain it to people who maybe haven't thought about you know the power

1502
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,840
of that coaching is having someone to reflect your thoughts back to you isn't it is often a really

1503
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:20,519
it sounds simple but an incredibly powerful thing and I can hear the brilliance of the way that you

1504
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:27,159
go about it you mentioned you're an author you're a coach and you're a speaker communicating with

1505
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:32,099
clarity is the dimension I wanted to ask you about and clearly you've got an enormous skill set in

1506
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:36,340
all those three disciplines have you thought about that to your communication how you go about it

1507
00:48:37,179 --> 00:48:45,699
my I've been told that my communication is very direct um I one of my clients called me the sword

1508
00:48:45,699 --> 00:48:53,699
of kindness and even another client this week said to me you're very mean to me um and we sort

1509
00:48:53,699 --> 00:49:00,219
of had a joke about that but I think it's because this was kind of before before training as a data

1510
00:49:00,219 --> 00:49:01,300
lead facilitator

1511
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:07,239
I just know that I want to be communicated with clearly not unkindly but clearly and then with

1512
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:12,659
all of Brene's research you know it's very much the idea is that clear is kind unclear is unkind

1513
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:17,659
so I care very deeply about all of my clients I wouldn't work with them if I didn't you have to

1514
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:22,940
care about the people that you work with it's such an intimate relationship and sometimes I have my

1515
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:26,739
own coach I believe the best coaches have their own coaches because I'm also navigating life I

1516
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:31,019
need someone to hold me accountable and mirror back to me my language or what I'm saying or not

1517
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:37,820
you know that I I believe that I've completely lost my train of thought we're talking about

1518
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:42,579
communicating with clarity and if you're communicating with clarity yes and so for me I

1519
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:48,980
want to be communicated with in a very direct way and I and I think it's a real gift when someone's

1520
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:54,840
willing to do that and when I say clear and direct way I'm not talking about aggressive you know I'm

1521
00:49:54,840 --> 00:50:01,280
talking the complete I'm not no passive aggressive just giving the information um in the way that

1522
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:07,920
you would want to be receive that information yeah my mind's going to a quick story before um

1523
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,880
I ask you the final two questions we had someone share this great story in this podcast um

1524
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:19,539
CEO of a bank who sent one of the team to an office in Hong Kong and the only option was that

1525
00:50:19,539 --> 00:50:24,119
all 42 people in that office lose their jobs and sent this beautiful female executive over

1526
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:30,199
there was no chance of uh being able to be integrated the business was being closed and

1527
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:36,619
it turned out six months later the surveys came through about engagement surveys and what you

1528
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:43,260
thought and that office having all been set gave her a hundred percent recommendation for her job

1529
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:47,900
and and and this particular boss well hey something's wrong here there's anomaly in the system

1530
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:54,719
and what he found out was that she was just so crystal clear so full of empathy by the way often

1531
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:59,199
went home in Hong Kong was a real cultural thing about losing your job even if it wasn't for any

1532
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:01,280
of your own actions so she was just so crystal clear and she was just so crystal clear and she

1533
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:05,820
actually asked if she could come home to the families and deliver that on behalf of some of

1534
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:11,500
them she still gets invited to birthdays and weddings of those people she stayed for an

1535
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:16,400
extended period of time she actually of her own accord went and you know became a referee and

1536
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,920
found her so even in the hardest possible decision you can tell someone to lose their job

1537
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:28,139
communicating clearly can still be such a gift can't it it's a powerful example I love it that

1538
00:51:28,139 --> 00:51:31,280
is such a beautiful story that is such a beautiful story and I think it's a really beautiful story

1539
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:37,039
yeah I love it I love sharing it and and I wanted to talk two things before the final two questions

1540
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:42,139
your brilliant book power women's journey to living and leading a life without apology and

1541
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:46,260
it's so much comes through and in your words and the way you speak about living a life without

1542
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:50,500
apology which I love but can you tell me also about audible series coming up that you've just

1543
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:56,199
created as well I'd like to hear about that too yes I'm very excited about this series so it comes

1544
00:51:56,199 --> 00:52:01,280
out um soon and it is called power talks and I

1545
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:05,079
had the absolute honor of speaking to some of Australia's most fascinating women

1546
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:10,000
and what I'm really excited about with this series is that it's so easy to look at public

1547
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,739
figures or people that have a large platform and think that they have it all together and we see

1548
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:17,659
their highlight reels even though we know their highlight reels you still can think they must have

1549
00:52:17,659 --> 00:52:24,420
it all together and all of us all of the women in some way are stepping in and out of their power

1550
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:31,159
and so I spoke to people like Miranda Tapsell the actor um Claire Bowditch musician um and looking

1551
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:37,019
at what it was for them in terms and Megan Gale just looking at what it is to send an email you

1552
00:52:37,019 --> 00:52:40,320
know the emails that you craft for three hours and you press send and you're just kind of holding

1553
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,860
your breath and you know you're really hoping that you don't go appear a certain way but when

1554
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:49,260
you're doing that you're not in your power you're completely power you're completely powerless and

1555
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:53,340
then one of the women is kind of midlife in her career in an industry where you're told kind of

1556
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:57,699
once you're past 25 there's nothing there's nothing here for you so then what is it to stand

1557
00:52:57,699 --> 00:53:00,940
in your power and actually take ownership of your career moving forward

1558
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:04,659
and another one shares about you know the phone call that you want to make but you're really

1559
00:53:04,659 --> 00:53:09,980
scared of rejection um and most of these women are really of service to their communities and

1560
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:14,480
the people that follow them and the few of them are looking at that balance that work-life balance

1561
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,860
how much am I sharing out in the world but how much is for me so I just know in the same way

1562
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:24,679
that you shared generously Luke about listening to my podcast I know that when listeners hear

1563
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:29,260
one they'll get that sense of connection of oh just like me I had to send one of those emails

1564
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:31,119
last week but also

1565
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:36,199
they'll also hear a coaching session so I know that something will resonate with them where they

1566
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:40,900
get to take an action because I asked them at the end of this series too what one action can you

1567
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:46,500
take today that will allow you to step into your power and having listened to the shift series I

1568
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:51,639
know it will be something that will move you it won't be a note that will then never see the light

1569
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:56,320
of day I think you force people in a brilliant way what was it the the kindness sword is that

1570
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:01,000
oh yeah the sword of kindness the sword of kindness I can see that in you it's like a

1571
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:07,139
but now you're going to go and do this now it's it's fantastic so I look forward to hearing

1572
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:17,170
about that who has been the greatest leader in your life oh wow what a question who has been

1573
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:23,050
the greatest oh gosh I wish you'd given me time to to answer that okay I'm actually going to go

1574
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:27,789
with the first person that came to mind maybe because he just sent me a text earlier his name

1578
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:56,289
10 years ago now and the way that he shared his story so his vulnerability gave me full permission

1579
00:54:56,289 --> 00:55:02,670
to be able to use my voice in the world and that was incredibly powerful for me incredibly

1580
