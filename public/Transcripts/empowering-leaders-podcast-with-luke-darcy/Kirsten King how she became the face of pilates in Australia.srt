00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:08,169
It is fantastic to be back with you in 2024 on the Empowering Leaders podcast and our

2
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:13,490
second guest for the year is Kirsten King, the founder of Fluid Form Pilates, a brilliant

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:19,510
success story and you'll find this conversation is one that is incredibly transparent, honest

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,629
and open and really love catching up with Kirsten and hearing about her story.

5
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:28,670
Kirsten was incredibly generous in this conversation to share with us the family tragedy of losing

6
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:34,149
her brother at 16 years of age and how that shaped her and her life going forward in so

7
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:34,770
many ways.

8
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,090
Kirsten speaks a lot about her Leader Connect group and how she's been able to let her guard

9
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,649
down and share so openly to help others in that group and herself face some of the problems

10
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,070
that occur for all of us on a daily basis.

11
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:50,750
She also talks a lot about the example of putting family first and by leading through

12
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,990
example herself, she allows others in her team to feel comfortable in the same way.

13
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,649
You're also going to hear about the quite incredible series of events.

14
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:04,849
That led to Fluid Form Packs being sent by the hundreds to places all over the world

15
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:12,010
from Afghanistan to Iceland, the US and beyond 99 countries in total and how the COVID challenges

16
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,549
really turbocharged her business and what it meant to her.

17
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:19,290
We're really passionate about creating a world of collaboration, inspiring connections at

18
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,269
a leader with people like Kirsten King and that shared knowledge, the idea of curating

19
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:28,569
groups of five or six people to learn and share for a better life, something we'd love

20
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:28,650
to see happen.

21
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,390
Talk to you about.

22
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:32,930

29
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,579
around the globe.

30
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,579
Having been a Pilates instructor for more than two decades, opening her first studio

31
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,459

To seven sites across Sydney and Melbourne.

33
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:09,900
Her forward-thinking decision to create a fluid form Pilates online platform two years

34
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:15,240
prior to the COVID period has seen her grow a community of more than 65,000 users in 90

35
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,740
countries around the world.

Kirsten is a mother to three daughters and married to NRL legend Matt King.

38
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,139
Great to see you, Kirsten.

39
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,020
Thanks for taking the time.

40
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:29,240
Thanks, Luke.

41
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,159
Nice to see you too.

42
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,599
Fluid form Pilates is an incredible.

43
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,780
Success story.

44
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,599
Congratulations.

45
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,599
You must feel very proud.

46
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:37,219
Yeah, thank you.

47
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:37,780
I do.

48
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:38,300
I do.

49
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:43,520
I mean, I never set out for it to be what it is today.

50
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,479
My sole purpose initially was just to help people and, you know, make their lives better,

51
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,520
free them of pain, rebalance their bodies to see where it is today and to see the number

52
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,060
of people that we have helped around the world is super fulfilling.

53
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,620
When you look back at your decision to create that.

54
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,259
Online platform, which was really ahead of the game in lots of ways prior to COVID.

55
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:09,960
Do you look back and think that was a real game changer for you?

56
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,580
Yeah, it definitely was.

57
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,520
It definitely was.

58
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:16,159
I wouldn't say that I had foresight into what was going to happen.

59
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:22,080
I know you'll talk to a lot of people about their business success and there's always a component of luck to it.

60
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,860
Um, but fluid from at home was created from a really authentic place.

61
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:32,479
I had clients that traveled a lot, uh, when they, they couldn't get into the studio,

62
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,060
potentially their issues would flare up.

63
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,379
There were people regionally that didn't have access to great Pilates.

64
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,599
And so there just was this need in my, you know, very.

65
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:52,719
Um, close community of clients to help them, but also in the larger community that, that couldn't get access to things.

66
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,539
So yeah, fluid form was create fluid form at home was created.

67
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:59,419
So where did the passion for Pilates come from?

68
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:02,180
So I think I've always.

69
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,979
I've always loved movement and the body.

70
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:08,000
I studied commerce and marketing at university.

71
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,879
Um, I always toyed around with the thought of being a physio, but I've always been active.

72
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,379
I danced growing up.

73
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:17,600
Um, you know, I used to run a lot.

74
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:22,939
I had a knee injury actually, that took me to Pilates and I fell in love with it.

75
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,459
And I've never, you know, I've never looked back.

76
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:26,600
I did my training.

77
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,620
And then when I moved to the UK with Kingy, I started teaching.

78
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,379
Talk to you about, uh, Kingy.

79
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:43,899
You're a brilliant, uh, partner in, in a moment, but it takes a lot of school from starting as an instructor to then go on and a lot of vision, create a 65,000 strong community around the world.

80
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,500
Looking back now, what, what do you think's been the keys to enable you to have that success?

81
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:53,319
Uh, I'm super passionate about helping people.

82
00:04:53,379 --> 00:05:02,360
I get, you know, I don't think there's any bigger buzz in life than, you know, fixing someone, helping people, helping people get rid of their pain.

83
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:06,220
And just seeing them enjoy life to their fullest.

84
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:11,620
And so that driver for me and my ability to work, I'm a great worker.

85
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,759
I, um, yeah, I, I'm not afraid to get up early to stay up late.

86
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:25,540
I can operate on very little sleep that coupled with my passion to help people has definitely helped me get to where I am today.

87
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,139
You hear that a lot, isn't it?

88
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:32,279
That someone you didn't start out to have this global community that comes from that authentic passion.

89
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,240
That you genuinely love supporting people.

90
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,259
And then maybe a perfect storm.

91
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:41,019
You've got a commerce degree and a work ethic that is legendary from what I hear.

92
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,759
And you put all those pieces together.

93
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,160
It's probably, as you described, helped you in a way.

94
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,860
And then you've had some really high profile people coming into your world, haven't you?

95
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,199
I was doing my homework and Rita Auras, uh, you know, got a big following.

96
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:57,000
Elle McPherson, you're in the sporting community.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,519
You've done a huge amount of work with a whole range of people.

98
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,879
How helpful has that been to have those people?

99
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,139
As sort of ambassadors effectively.

100
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:15,100
Yeah, I mean, they, they are amazing ambassadors and, you know, I'm very grateful that they sort of knock on my door and allow me the privilege to teach them.

101
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:22,899
You know, I always say it's a privilege to teach people Pilates, you know, people walk in with their greatest asset and hand it over to you.

102
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,959
So you should take care of them and take up, take care of their body.

103
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:31,560
So those guys, to be honest, I treat them like everyone else because the client that comes in.

104
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,100
Yeah.

105
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,160
Yeah.

106
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,259
Yeah.

107
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:39,860
Every day that lives around the corner to a business starting out is just as important as those high profile names.

108
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:56,019
And I think ensuring that there was always that balance for me in my business, not just going out there to teach, you know, the high profile person, because at the end of the day, they won't necessarily enable you to continue to run your business because they come and they go.

109
00:06:56,019 --> 00:07:01,519
So having that balance between the core community, you know, your local community of clients.

110
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:10,860
And then through that, through that authenticity and that vibration that your business gives out to the world, you attract all of these legendary people.

111
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,300
And they definitely help raise your profile.

112
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:22,180
Now that I have a global business, I can teach anyone and, you know, teaching Rita enabled me to have more impact into the UK.

113
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,899
Also teaching her husband allowed me to penetrate New Zealand a little bit more.

114
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:31,500
You know, it definitely all helps, but it's not something that I.

115
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,500
I'm obsessed in and out there trying to do.

116
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:34,980
Yeah.

117
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:37,319
It only helps if what you're doing works too, doesn't it?

118
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,740
It's only helps if it's authentic and you can see that come out in everything that you say.

119
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:52,459
I rang your husband, Matty King, who NRL legend is a great way to describe Matty, but he's one of the nicest people on the planet, your partner, and he's got such a big heart.

120
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,620
And every time you get the privilege to speak to him, it just makes you smile.

121
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,079
And the way he spoke about you yesterday made me smile all day.

122
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,100
Yeah.

123
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,160
He's loved for you clearly, but he said, and I think this is a good point.

124
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,300
You read the headline, you think, God, Kirsten King's had this remarkable success and life must come easy.

125
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:13,120
And he said, well, you probably need to understand more about some of the hardships along the way.

126
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,300
And he was encouraging me to ask you about it.

127
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:25,300
And I know some of this you probably haven't shared so widely, but, you know, he was sharing with me a really personal, tragic story from you as a 16-year-old growing up.

128
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:30,100
He said that you lost your brother who was 19 at that stage in a car accident.

129
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,200
And it's every family's worst nightmare.

130
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,240
I just can't even imagine what you went through at that age.

131
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,659
Did that shape you a lot as a 16-year-old?

132
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:38,620
Yeah.

133
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:39,460
Yeah, definitely.

134
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:43,779
I think it's probably was a turning point in my life.

135
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:51,019
At the time, I don't think I fully understood what my mum and dad were going through.

136
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,279
And I've only really understood that now once I've had my own children.

137
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,620
So the loss was obviously significant and heartbreaking.

138
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:09,100
For me, as I was the middle child, even more so probably at that time, had more impact on my little sister.

139
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,019
And then mum and dad just, you know, they tried to continue on.

140
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:28,960
But for a long time, I was there, you know, holding everyone's hand, keeping everything going and had to compartmentalise, I guess, the loss of my brother to ensure that everyone else was OK.

141
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:50,740
And whether I was born that way or learnt how to do that, you know, during that time, it is definitely a skill, I think, to be able to, you know, compartmentalise something so tragic and hard and then selflessly move forward and look after those around you.

142
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:57,820
And that's something that I started doing then and I probably still do or I definitely still do today.

143
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,059
Does that come at a cost sometimes?

144
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:09,860
For you personally, when in a devastating situation, you've got everyone else's back sorted, but looking after yourself sometimes, is that hard?

145
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,759
Yeah, definitely.

146
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:19,320
You know, you have to look after yourself to look after others, you know, a great leadership quality.

147
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,440
And I've probably learnt that along the way.

148
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,139
As a 16-year-old girl, you're pretty resilient.

149
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,940
You know, your mum and dad are everything to you.

150
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,899
So is your younger sister.

151
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:37,139
You still have to turn up to school and no one wants to talk to you because no one wants to, you know, broach that subject.

152
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:40,539
So you just learn to move on.

153
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,919
And I think it does affect you later down the track.

154
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:48,059
I probably have become a lot more emotional in my older age.

155
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,779
I suppressed my emotions definitely when I was younger.

156
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,779
And it just changes your perspective on things.

157
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:02,019
And how you don't sweat the small stuff.

158
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,980
You know, it's not life or death.

159
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,940
Okay, let's move on.

160
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,159
So, yeah, I definitely look at things in a different way.

161
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,799
Kingy was sharing with me yesterday.

162
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,860
He said he just has got such admiration for your resilience.

163
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,940
And when tragic things happen, he said you have this ability that's unique.

164
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,659
You know, he was again sharing.

165
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:22,879
And I hope you don't mind.

166
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,120
You've got three beautiful daughters.

167
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,980
But he said there were three miscarriages, you know, before that.

168
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:28,879
And he said...

169
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:32,299
Your ability to just, okay, we're going to go to work the next day

170
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:33,559
and we're going to get through this.

171
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,740
I mean, how is that?

172
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,980
Do you think, as you said, being the middle child part of who you are

173
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,960
or what you developed from that early tragedy?

174
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:43,240
I think it has to be a little bit of it, a little bit of both.

175
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,440
I think the pressure as well of having your own business and being a leader.

176
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:51,100
You know, you're the one that always has to be positive.

177
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,059
You're the one out the front.

178
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,179
You know, you're climbing that hill.

179
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,419
You might be struggling, but if you start to struggle

180
00:11:58,419 --> 00:11:58,879
and you're not going to be able to do it, you're going to be struggling.

181
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,620
When you look over your shoulder, you know,

182
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,320
your greater team are going to start struggling too.

183
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:07,620
I'm surrounded by a lot of females in my business

184
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,259
and everyone goes through tragedy.

185
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,259
Everyone has lost.

186
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,539
And I think that's probably what, you know,

187
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,779
I learnt from my brother's passing too.

188
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:19,720
You know, we lost him and it was a tragedy.

189
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,120
But there's a lot of people that go through some pretty tough stuff.

190
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,039
And I think because I was one that, you know,

191
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,980
compartmentalised it and moved on,

192
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,580
and you just never know what anyone else is going through in the world.

193
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:37,799
So, you know, you have to be kind and you have to just be aware

194
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,340
of others and how they're feeling.

195
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:42,980
I think, you know, with my miscarriages,

196
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:50,220
it wasn't that I didn't want to share, but for me, it's not about me.

197
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,059
It's about everyone else.

198
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,179
You know, I take care of everyone else.

199
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,759
And maybe sometimes I suffer in silence.

200
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:57,779
I don't think I do.

201
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,460
I think maybe I'm just born that way.

202
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:00,340
I have this ability.

203
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,139
But, you know, it's in my nature to take care of you

204
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,679
before I'll take care of myself.

205
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,399
Beautiful quality to have, isn't it?

206
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,059
It's fascinating to hear.

207
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,179
And, again, I think I know when I sit down and have these conversations,

208
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:16,919
the headlines are always amazing and you think,

209
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,440
well, how do you start and create what you've created?

210
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,000
But I think allowing people in to see that there's been incredible hurdles

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,340
along the way and including in your partnership.

212
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,960
And I know you've had some challenges.

213
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,899
I know you've had some challenges there where partners have come

214
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:33,460
and it's not worked out and you've had to have some legal challenges

215
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,059
along the way.

216
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,200
Have you got some insight in to share about what, you know,

217
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,440
good partnerships look like and what lessons you've learned

218
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,639
along the way in that front?

219
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:41,980
Yeah, definitely.

220
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:48,679
I think, you know, my partnerships in business came about from, you know,

221
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,259
being lonely in business.

222
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,899
People don't often talk about when you're a leader and, you know,

223
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:57,580
you're pioneering a way.

224
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:03,320
You're, you know, in your chosen profession and you're at the top of your game.

225
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,679
All of a sudden, you can look around and there's no one really next to you.

226
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:12,419
You've got your team, definitely, who are supporting you and embracing that vision.

227
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:18,320
But people start, whether it's jealousy or they don't believe you should have

228
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,639
that success, people start to change.

229
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,539
And it's all of a sudden you're standing at the top on your own

230
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:26,899
and it becomes lonely.

231
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:33,159
And that was the driver for me to move into a partnership in my business.

232
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:41,860
I thought it was the way to go to begin and it just didn't end up working out in the end.

233
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:48,279
And I think my biggest learning from that was it's not about that initial relationship.

234
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,539
It's not about that initial marriage.

235
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,059
And at the time, everything seems rosy and everything seems like we're going

236
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:55,799
to do this together.

237
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:56,740
But it's not.

238
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:56,779
It's not.

239
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:56,820
It's not.

240
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:56,860
It's not.

241
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:56,879
It's not.

242
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:01,259
It's actually you need to have the foresight to look at what happens

243
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:04,000
if there is a divorce, for want of a better word.

244
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,019
And I have friends at the moment in business.

245
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,480
I call them and they might be doing deals and I say to them, you know,

246
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,519
they say, oh, but this, this, and this, it's great.

247
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,360
It's going to work.

248
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,419
And I'm like, okay.

249
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,600
And you don't want to be, you know, mis-negative.

250
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:23,419
But I just say to them, that's fine now, but you just don't know what's going

251
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:26,559
to change in people's lives or in their,

252
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,840
people aren't all resilient.

253
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,679
You know, they can't get on with stuff for a long time.

254
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:37,000
And when there starts to get a few hurdles and potentially the job isn't

255
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,299
panning out like you thought it was going to, sometimes then that relationship

256
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:43,179
can fracture and can break.

257
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,700
You know, more often than not in business, they can't be repaired.

258
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,740
And so the divorce clause has to be executed and you just need

259
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,759
to make sure it's a good one.

260
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,500
Yeah, it's stressful, isn't it?

261
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,720
And I have been through that a couple of times as well.

262
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:03,200
And you're right, you start up with great intentions and great vision

263
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,740
and you can see the harmony, but you're right.

264
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,840
It's not always with malice that it ends, but then when it does,

265
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:14,860
trying to unpick that if you're not clear at the start is just a nightmare

266
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,299
and stressful and relationships break down.

267
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,379
And you're right.

268
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,840
I mean, it's a common thing you hear, but it's still, you know,

269
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,700
I always think the greatest learnings I ever had were in those situations.

270
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,700
And I didn't have any idea of setting it up right at the start,

271
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,860
but you certainly learn along the way, Kirsten.

272
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,679
I can hear that that's something you have definitely done along the way.

273
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,159
Is it going to stand you in better stead now, you think,

274
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:38,799
having weathered those storms?

275
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:39,620
Yeah.

276
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,620
I mean, there's, if you have, if anyone has had a partnership breakdown

277
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,659
in the past in business, you definitely want to learn from it

278
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:52,299
and you don't want to be scarred from it.

279
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:55,659
You don't want it to stop who you are.

280
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:01,899
As a person, and I am super trusting and kind

281
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:04,740
and I am fully supportive of everyone around me.

282
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:11,180
And when you're taken advantage of, for want of a better word,

283
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:13,640
you start to look at yourself in the mirror and you think,

284
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,960
well, maybe I need to be tougher.

285
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,119
Maybe I shouldn't say yes all the time.

286
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,920
Maybe I, you know, need to be a bit meaner.

287
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:24,920
But then that takes away from who you are and why all these amazing things

288
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,680
have been attracted to you.

289
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,819
And why you're allowed to take care of people

290
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:31,440
and they let you into their life.

291
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:35,420
So that's probably one of the hardest things after a breakdown

292
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:43,779
is just taking the learnings and then parking that and moving forward

293
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:45,660
and not going back to it.

294
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,099
You almost need to erase it.

295
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:49,099
Learn from it, erase it, and let's go.

296
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,759
Reminds me of my dad, Kirsten.

297
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:54,140
We grew up in the hospitality industry and the old-fashioned pubs

298
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,900
and lived upstairs.

299
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,339
And I can think of as a kid four or five times where someone had worked

300
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:03,960
with my mum and dad really closely or been a partner and there was a range

301
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,440
of disastrous things that happened.

302
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:08,819
And I remember as I got older, I asked dad, I said, how did you move on?

303
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:12,680
And he said, well, you just have to trust the next person and you just move on

304
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,920
and you hope the next person is a great person because it's going to be

305
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,880
a really narrow life if you don't trust again.

306
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:23,740
And it's always stayed with me that, yeah, if you decide then that that's it,

307
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,660
I'm never going to collaborate.

308
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,700
But again, it's a pretty narrow world you live in.

309
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,480
You mentioned before, Kirsten, that loneliness is something that leaders face

310
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,859
and we feel really privileged to have crossed over with you.

311
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:38,700
And A Leader Connect, it's something we're really passionate about

312
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,619
and inspiring people like you with your stories and appreciate you sharing

313
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:43,539
it so openly today.

314
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,660
And then having a group of five or six who come from different worlds

315
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,099
around you and collaborating and sharing and learning together.

316
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,500
Can I ask you about A Leader Connect?

317
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,339
Has that had an influence on you?

318
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,519
Yeah, it's been amazing.

319
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:04,680
I had no idea what I was embarking on when I dove, you know, headfirst into it.

320
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:10,559
Obviously, Kingy had been part of it and through COVID, I'd hear him on Zoom calls

321
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:16,799
and he would always get off so inspired and just and almost look forward,

322
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,480
you know, you look forward to the next one.

323
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,319
And that intrigued me.

324
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,839
And so, obviously, you know, I joined a group.

325
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:30,799
And the same thing happened to me, you know, a group of like-minded but so different.

326
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:36,440
And here you are on this Zoom call feeling within the first session

327
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,339
like you intimately know these people and care for them

328
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:41,660
and want to help them and look after them.

329
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,420
And then all of a sudden realizing that even though you're

330
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,220
in totally different industries, different ages in terms of and,

331
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,539
you know, like years of experience, but we're all going through the,

332
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,680
you know, same thing, or we've been through it and we can help each other.

333
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,019
Or there's just this hurdle that you can't see past.

334
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:08,700
And then you share it with the group and there's five answers in 40 minutes.

335
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,720
And you think, I have not slept for two weeks thinking about that.

336
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,579
Like, how is this possible?

337
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,200
So, yeah, it's extraordinary.

338
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,119
It's pretty special.

339
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,680
I mean, I've said it to Matt as well, your business partner, it is, it's really special.

340
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,940
And the fact that the people that join a leader totally let down their guard.

341
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:32,579
I think that's what's so amazing because as leaders and, you know,

342
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:36,839
in my group, some extraordinary people with extraordinary experience

343
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:41,519
have just come on this phone call and dropped their guard.

344
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:44,599
And what happens there is magical.

345
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,619
That's a beautiful description of it, Kirsten.

346
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:48,519
I appreciate it.

347
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,839
And if you don't mind, I might share just some of the diversity in your group.

348
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,359
I think it paints a picture.

349
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:52,380
Yeah.

350
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:52,440
Yeah.

351
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:52,480
Yeah.

352
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:52,619
Yeah.

353
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:52,660
Yeah.

354
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,099
It's a picture.

355
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,059
Di Richardson's founded a business called Principal Media Group and they do amazing

356
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:59,259
things in their world.

357
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,480
Sean Wellman is one of the great people I've met in sport.

358
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,980
Well, he was a premiership player at Essendon, but runs a really successful finance space.

359
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,799
Justin Walter and ASX listed medical imaging business.

360
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,059
Andrew Sutherland's the happiest person on the planet, Kirsten.

361
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,740
You've never met anyone quite like Sutherland.

362
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,619
I'm lucky to call him a friend, but from his world of cybersecurity to property,

363
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:27,119
and incredible personality, Blackburn's doing amazing things as a leader in her world

364
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,940
as a captain of an AFLW team, the Western Bulldogs.

365
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,940
It's very different backgrounds, isn't it?

366
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:33,839
You put Kirsten King in with your experience.

367
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:38,400
It's fascinating to see the different thinking and how that benefits people.

368
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,779
And that sounds like what you found.

369
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:41,019
Yeah, definitely.

370
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,539
It's at the end of the day, you know, we all realized it comes down to people and making

371
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:51,660
sure, you know, what you learn on that journey is making sure that you can take care of yourself

372
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,180
first.

373
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:54,700
And then take care of others around you.

374
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,119
And in its simplest form, that is leadership.

375
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,720
But when you are at the top as a leader, you sometimes forget about yourself.

376
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:10,480
And you get so stuck in the day-to-day of your own business, and you're tired because

377
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,740
you're not taking care of yourself.

378
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,839
And then you start to lose that ability to make decisions and make good ones and make

379
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:17,940
them in a timely manner.

380
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,119
And I think that too, with being able to connect.

381
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:30,099
With all those amazing people, you know, fortnightly, you will force to take a self-check each time

382
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,099
too.

383
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:36,599
So for some of us that were out of the habit, maybe of taking care of ourselves, it really

384
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:38,680
allowed us to get back on that pathway.

385
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:44,599
Yeah, the experience across the board, you know, even from Ellie in the AFL world and

386
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:50,500
through to Andrew with, you know, from Visi to cybersecurity, it's, you know, leadership

387
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,460
doesn't really change what's happening.

388
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,299
What's happening in business doesn't really change.

389
00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:00,160
It's just great to be surrounded by people who are willing to share their experience

390
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,740
intimately.

391
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,779
And at times your solution is just right there.

392
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:06,539
Yeah, beautifully said, Kirsten.

393
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:10,619
You articulate that in a really fascinating way for me.

394
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:14,640
And leading into what we have found is exactly as you said, is that success leaves clues

395
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,359
and there are patterns around, whether it's growing an online community in the health

396
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:20,940
and fitness space as you've done, or an elite athlete or someone in a, in a completely different,

397
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,940
you know, environment.

398
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:27,440
And we think that idea, as you mentioned before, that leaders have to show up for themselves

399
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,720
first to lead others.

400
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,380
And self-leadership is really the dimension we always think of at the start.

401
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,420
And you probably just answered that.

402
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,579
When you think about self-leadership, Kirsten, what does that mean to you?

403
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:42,000
I think first and foremost, it is about turning up for you.

404
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,220
You know, you are in my role as a leader, I'm very compassionate, caring, supportive.

405
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,720
So, yeah.

406
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:57,000
In order for me to fill everyone else's cup, my cup needs to be filled up.

407
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,720
And don't get me wrong, I'm not always great at it, but you become aware really quickly

408
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,960
when you're starting to be depleted, whether that's in your workplace or at home.

409
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,099
You know, I'm not, I'm not only a leader at Fluidform, I'm also a leader at home.

410
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:17,740
I've got three young girls and I want to be the best possible role model I can to them.

411
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,940
So I've got to have two leadership hats.

412
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,819
And that can be, you know, draining.

413
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:24,299
And fatiguing as well.

414
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:30,579
So for me, you know, making sure that movement is part of every day for me, whether it's

415
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:37,339
15 minutes at home, whether it's a class in one of the studios, making sure I'm having

416
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:43,380
time just to think, you know, to think about, to dream, you know, about that big picture

417
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:49,579
stuff, because that really motivates you when you're dealing with the day to day.

418
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:51,779
I think making sure that your dream is constant.

419
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:57,319
And you're thinking about it is so important and not being so hard on yourself.

420
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:03,039
I think we are just as human beings, just so hard on ourselves these days from, you

421
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:08,180
know, the access of social media and everything that is thrown at us and what we see and the

422
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:14,660
pressures we just need to be more compassionate to our own self.

423
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:21,299
And if we need that time out to have it, you know, you need our eldest daughter, Charlie,

424
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:23,299
she graduated from primary school.

425
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:26,180
It was like a fanfare.

426
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:30,680
There was so many activities on and, you know, I was trying to juggle work the entire week

427
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,759
and it was just at one point I was like, I can't go to work on Wednesday, I've got too

428
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:36,599
much on.

429
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:41,319
And you know, I'm always really honest with my team, guys, this is what's on with Charlie,

430
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:45,380
can't make it in, call me if you need me, but I'll see you on Thursday.

431
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,339
And just knowing that I had that time for her and didn't have to worry about anything

432
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,579
on that day.

433
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:55,180
It just allowed everything else to continue to flow.

434
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:01,380
Because it's all about flow, you know, find your state of flow and stay in it when you

435
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,380
can.

436
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,700
And how brilliant is that for your team that you've just shown them that family comes first

437
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,180
by taking that action.

438
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:12,720
And as the leader, no matter how busy work was, I'm having that day because that is the

439
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,019
most important thing in my life.

440
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:17,880
And that allows them to be able to ring you one day and say, hey, Kirsten, I really need

441
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,579
this day and know that they're going to be supported.

442
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,259
And that's, you know, how great culture starts and continues.

443
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:28,259
And you can see, listening to you about your passion was about helping people.

444
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:32,559
And we see that for leaders, they're really conscious about how they have a positive impact

445
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,859
on a daily basis.

446
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,759
How have you gone about that?

447
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:41,619
Yeah, for me, I mean, probably going back to what you said, what I said before, I'm

448
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:44,940
really transparent with my team.

449
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,779
I treat them like an extension of my family.

450
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:50,380
I need them to understand that.

451
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:56,940
As much as fluid form is a passion, that, you know, my family, you know, is equally,

452
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,259
if not, you know, my greatest passion.

453
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:03,539
So I find what works for me is allowing them in.

454
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,539
You know, there's no need for them not to know what I'm doing, where I am.

455
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:12,019
Some days I might have to leave early and I'm on the tennis court with the girls.

456
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:13,019
They're doing a tennis lesson.

457
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:14,779
I've got my computer on my lap.

458
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:15,779
I'm working away.

459
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:16,779
I'm watching them.

460
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:19,059
And, you know, you just have to do it.

461
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:20,059
You become really great at juggling.

462
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:26,440
But always just allowing them to know where I am and what I'm doing and likewise them

463
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,440
with me.

464
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,400
You know, it's not, like you said, uncommon for someone to say, hey, Ki, can I leave at

465
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
4.30?

466
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,859
I've got a physio appointment.

467
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:37,740
It's never, ever a question of yes or no.

468
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,779
It's just they're letting me know and I know where they are.

469
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:43,940
And so I think that is really important.

470
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:48,279
I never wanted to be that leader that was like up there in her glass box and no one

471
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:49,059
really knew what she did when she left her glass box.

472
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:50,059
Yeah.

473
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:56,440
We have an open environment in the office, but also in our studios.

474
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,720
So a fluid form studio is not segmented into rooms.

475
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,220
It's open plan.

476
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:09,099
And the thinking from that comes back to being able to collaborate, you know, to learn on

477
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:10,099
the job.

478
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:12,460
A lot of new instructors are young.

479
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:18,440
So I don't want them in a room with the door shut on their own, in their own thoughts,

480
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
potentially.

481
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,160
They're getting lost in their programming.

482
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,420
I want them in a space where there's other instructors around them that they can feel

483
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:31,599
confident from and potentially see someone teaching and it might interest them.

484
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:34,640
And they ask after a lesson, oh, Ki, why did you teach that?

485
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,680
I'd love to know what you were doing there and why that helped that client so much.

486
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:44,960
So even in our studios, it's very much about supporting each other and having that transparency

487
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,980
across what we do.

488
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,980
Yeah.

489
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,680
The next dimension I wanted to ask you about.

490
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,359
It's a, it's a big vision to, to create a global community.

491
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:55,799
How have you gone about creating and sharing that vision with your team?

492
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:04,000
Well, Fluid Form at Home started as a local sort of Australian thought process.

493
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,980
And then two years after it launched, COVID hit.

494
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:15,019
So we very quickly overnight were sending our equipment packs all around the world.

495
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,400
I guess that wasn't a planned vision.

496
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
Yeah.

497
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:25,500
But as it started to happen, we were all together sending packs to Afghanistan, to the frontline,

498
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:32,079
to, you know, Iceland, to Barbados, you name it, there was a Fluid Form pack flying there.

499
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:38,400
And so as a team that we were on that journey together, we very much were holding each other's

500
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,559
hands.

501
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:45,160
And that's probably something as well, as a leader, I like to be, to work alongside

502
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,160
the team.

503
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,079
I don't always want it to be me at first.

504
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,079
Yeah.

505
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:55,039
I think it's important to be able to be together and to, you know, everyone needs to be able

506
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,500
to roll their sleeves up.

507
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:03,079
I think that vision as those packs started to fly around the world, it just became really

508
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:08,799
apparent to us that we can actually help people all around the world.

509
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,279
We can make people's lives better.

510
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:16,839
And because of the intimacy and the access to me as a founder, and I wanted to be so

511
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:17,559
heavily involved in it.

512
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:24,599
We, I constantly receive, you know, probably 20 emails a day from Fluid Form at Home members

513
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:29,339
telling me about, you know, I was going in for back surgery, just went to see my surgeon.

514
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:30,599
I'm not anymore.

515
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:34,920
I haven't been able to get down on the rug and play with my son in over three years.

516
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:40,380
Now I can, you know, my football career, I was being injured again and again and again,

517
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:46,559
and I've just played the most number of games in my career without an injury, you know,

518
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,440
and that is all.

519
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,900
It's all from Fluid Form at Home.

520
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:56,480
So once we started to see and experience what was, you know, this brand was capable of,

521
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,140
we then, we knew what our vision was, you know, we're in 99 countries around the world

522
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,140
now.

523
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:07,980
We just continue to exceed expectations is, you know, what we say internally, no matter

524
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,940
whether that's online or in the studio.

525
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:15,599
And we come from a really great place together as a team of wanting to make people's lives

526
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:16,599
better.

527
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,599
And we've made a lot of progress.

528
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,599
And I think we've all been successful in that.

529
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:20,599
And I think that's what it's all about.

530
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:21,599
We've been successful in that.

531
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,599
And I'm sure we've all done well, but I think it's just the time and order coming in from

532
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,599
Iceland and Afghanistan.

533
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:25,819
And I can just imagine how full on that would have been, but you then have to execute too,

534
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:26,819
don't you?

535
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:27,819
People have to get their products.

536
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:31,940
They have to still be able to, as you said, value it and change their lives around the

537
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,940
globe.

538
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,940
It's a, it's a brilliant story.

539
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:39,039
Curiosity is a word that comes up in our space all the time at Elida and we see through curiosity,

540
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,900
people are constantly trying to learn and develop and how they approach their life through

541
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,900
curiosity.

542
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,940
Is that something that resonates with you?

543
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,940
Yeah, definitely.

544
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:55,259
Yeah, definitely. I'm always curious as to what we can do next as a team. Where can the brand go?

545
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:02,460
You know, what would it look like if we did this? And I think you have to be curious. Otherwise,

546
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:09,880
you become fatigued in your day-to-day capabilities and your day-to-day role. I think

547
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,660
for your clients, you don't want them to become fatigued with the product. You know,

548
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:21,720
you need to continue to challenge what's out there, challenge the norm, you know,

549
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:27,859
be curious about potentially where you could take the brand. And particularly from an IT

550
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:32,839
point of view and, you know, at the moment, you know, I say to the team, the answer should never

551
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:38,460
be, no, we can't. It should be, why can't, you know, why can't we do that and find out what the

552
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:45,500
is and let's fix that. And for me, that's probably one of the

553
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:52,799
key pillars as a leader. You know, you want to be, even with your staff, never assume that they

554
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,900
don't want to grow or never assume that they don't want that next step or they don't want to move

555
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:02,440
from operations into marketing. You know, be curious, talk to them, start the conversation

556
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,160
because you just never know what's in their head or what's out there.

557
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:12,759
Yeah, which leads really to that communication part of anyone who's had success in communicating

558
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:15,440
with clarity. It sounds like you've got some clear...

559
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:25,539
Yeah, I think for us, you know, traditionally as a studio, because Fluidform started as a studio

560
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:31,960
in person, when you are a Pilates instructor or you're an instructor of any type of movement

561
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:38,140
method, your communication is key. I would like to think I'm a good communicator. But then

562
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:43,880
likewise with your team, you know, I haven't always got it right. I stumbled initially because

563
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,640
I thought, oh, Kirsten doesn't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to

564
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,819
do it. She doesn't want to work Thursday nights and Saturdays. She wouldn't want to do that.

565
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:53,660
And next thing, Kirsten has a job with someone else on a Thursday night and a Saturday. And you're

566
00:33:53,660 --> 00:34:00,720
like, oh, my gosh, how? And why didn't you come to me first? And, you know, why, why, why? And so

567
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,819
I learned early on, never assume, ask the question, because the worst thing that can happen is that

568
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:13,360
they say no. And sometimes the no doesn't mean no as well. I mean, you have to really keep the

569
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,639
communication open. Also, if you're a Pilates instructor, you have to know how to communicate

570
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:22,420
that is why I'm super transparent with my life outside of the office, because I want my staff

571
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:26,599
to be like that. I want to know how they're feeling. I want to know if things aren't

572
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:33,860
going well in their life. And I have a pretty good radar with people and I have a pretty good gut.

573
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,380
And I can sort of tell when someone's not OK. And I'm very comfortable with having

574
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:45,039
those conversations. You know, when you teach Pilates movements, probably

575
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:51,380
60 percent of it and 40 percent of it is life coach slash counselor. You learn to communicate

576
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:57,159
with your clients. You know, you're essentially doing that as much as you are teaching them and

577
00:34:57,159 --> 00:35:03,480
strengthening their bodies. But my biggest, I guess my biggest project with communication was

578
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:10,320
before I launched Fluidform at home. You know, it was a big deal. I sat on it for probably 12

579
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,739
months because it meant I was taking myself out there to the world.

580
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:19,280
Well, here I am. This is my movement method. You're going to be judged. You're going to be

581
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,820
criticized. You're going to have copycats, all of it. So I had to be really comfortable. I had to

582
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:33,320
be confident. I'm quite conservative in my approach. So I did my programs. I set it up in

583
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:40,119
the studio. I had clients in the space and I stood in the corner of the room and I faced the wall

584
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:44,639
and I had a video camera up and I just spoke.

585
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:50,199
Through the programs. So, you know, stand with your left leg forward, right leg back, hinge at

586
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:55,980
the hip, blah, blah, blah. Recorded it and then watched it back. And so I needed to know that

587
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:01,639
without seeing anyone, without having hands-on corrections, which is a big part of our in-studio

588
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:09,960
experience, that people could follow my cues, my, you know, my instruction and still get a great

589
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,719
workout, feel it the next day, but have the same experience that they did in studio.

590
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:19,699
So, you know, for a few weeks I stood in the corner looking at the wall and just went through

591
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:27,019
all my programs and it worked. So when I was confident with that, I was then confident to

592
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:30,659
say, okay, let's do this. Let's take that out to everyone else.

593
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:35,260
Yeah. What an amazing way to test it. And then to see it go around the globe must have been

594
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,400
incredibly satisfying and to translate into different language, different countries,

595
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,519
different fields and movement perhaps is a common language, but it's brilliant to see.

596
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:46,519
How important has collaboration been for you?

597
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:54,360
Huge. I mean, for me in my studios, I collaborate with my instructors on a, you know, day-to-day

598
00:36:54,360 --> 00:37:01,159
basis, but probably the biggest collaboration for me was fluid form at home. I had to build a website.

599
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:08,280
I needed someone to do the video. I needed sound. I needed editing. So there is a team,

600
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:14,360
a team of people that, who are external, obviously to fluid form,

601
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:20,559
but they are so important. They are like, they work with us day-to-day and I needed to share

602
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:26,420
my vision with them, you know, so I make them part of the experience of fluid form. I send them,

603
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:32,079
I, you know, I make sure that they receive client feedback because, you know, as much as it's me on

604
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:38,059
the screen, they put as much time into it as I do. So, you know, we're all equal. Collaboration

605
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:44,219
for me is about, like we said early, sharing the vision, but making everyone feel,

606
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:52,260
supported and equal, you know, part of the team. I'm not, I'm not huge into sort of hierarchy. I

607
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:56,159
understand that you need, obviously people have different roles on paper and different

608
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:02,440
responsibilities, but at the end of the day, everyone is here for a reason. You know, you

609
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:08,420
have a skill that I don't have, you know, you have a responsibility that I don't have and together

610
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:13,460
we share a common vision and should be working together. And when you create those conditions,

611
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,199
Kirsten, we often,

612
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:19,760
see that someone might be working as an editor on your video, but has an idea about something that

613
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,000
you've never even thought of, but you've allowed them to share it because of the way that you set

614
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,820
up. And you're right. Someone has to make the decision. So we understand that, but the best

615
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:33,139
organizations we're seeing have that space where someone on their first day may have an idea,

616
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:38,579
but you'll never know if you don't have the space for them to feel comfortable to share it. And

617
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:41,699
that sounds like you're doing that. Yeah, definitely. It's important. You,

618
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:43,780
the little pearls of wisdom that

619
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:50,559
have come out of the most unexpected mouth sometimes is just, I mean, that's what,

620
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:55,599
that's what running a business is about. That's what being a great leader is. And then taking

621
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:03,179
that and allowing people to just feel valued. Yeah. I often say having worked in the television

622
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:07,500
and called sport on TV, the people who know TV better than anyone else are holding the cameras

623
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:12,179
or working behind the scenes, but I often wonder, I know they don't get asked, you know, they don't

624
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:13,760
get asked their thoughts and it's a,

625
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:18,039
it's a waste of all this great experience and, and knowledge. Kirsten, who's been the greatest

626
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:25,480
leader in your life? I think, you know, definitely my mom and dad, you know, from an early age,

627
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:33,880
they, they taught me about work ethic. They're both great workers, super, super resilient humans

628
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:42,559
and, you know, the ability to juggle, you know, multiple things at once. So they obviously,

629
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:43,739
you know, have led,

630
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:51,239
that pathway for me. And then I think, you know, from, from a business perspective,

631
00:39:51,880 --> 00:40:00,219
you know, I've had some great mentors over the years, but probably starting fluid form,

632
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:06,179
it would be the people around me every day that I'm learning from, you know, not, not necessarily

633
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:13,519
that person that gave me, you know, the task when I was younger, but watching my team around me

634
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:20,239
lead their clients, look after their clients and learning from them. I have so many leaders in my

635
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:25,059
business. You know, we all approach things slightly differently. You know, I'm still

636
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:29,880
learning every day, which is what I love. Brilliant answer, isn't it? To, to, you know,

637
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,539
not put yourself in a position where you feel like you're the font of all the knowledge in

638
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:37,579
your organization, that the great leaders actually come into your space and you learn from them. It's

639
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:42,500
a, it's a really intriguing to hear you describe that. I'm, I'm not surprised by the,

640
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,739
by the person that you are.

641
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,519
I love asking this question as well, Kirsten, and the spirit of collaboration. And we love that

642
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:52,139
at a leader, this world of collaboration and inspiring connections. Is there been someone

643
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:56,480
you thought on any, you know, you've done some great collaborations with unique people and

644
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,500
to get into 99 countries now, you have to collaborate. Has there been somebody who

645
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,800
thought, God, that's the person or the organization I'd love to collaborate with?

646
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:12,780
Yeah, I must say I'm a bit of a Gwyneth Paltrow goop fan. So I feel like if a fluid form

647
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,760
could, you know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't

648
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:21,139
know. I would do a goop collaboration. I mean, she's so inspiring in, you know, just from like

649
00:41:21,139 --> 00:41:28,340
health, physical, mental, you know, sexual sort of unspoken topics, what she's done in that space

650
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:36,300
for females is extraordinary. So from a movement point of view, I really feel like, you know,

651
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,980
we could add value, it would be, you know, a collaboration, which could be, you know,

652
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:43,739
quite amazing. So that would be one that I would.

653
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:50,860
I would definitely have on my storyboard. And then not from a person point of view, but

654
00:41:50,860 --> 00:42:00,019
I've always, you know, like Nike as a brand, you know, Phil Knight, you know, his book,

655
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:08,780
he has just fearless ambition. And Nike still haven't had a Pilates ambassador worldwide.

656
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,760
So that's, you know, they've got yoga, they've got every other sport.

657
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:20,219
But they haven't dived into Pilates as yet. And that would be something that I think

658
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:21,599
would be pretty cool too.

659
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,619
There's a couple of inspiring collaborations, Kirsten. I loved it. It's, you know, think of

660
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:30,760
from a Hollywood actress into creating that movement is an amazing story, isn't it? And

661
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:35,500
hadn't thought of that, isn't it? Nike have got every other base covered, but Pilates is such a

662
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:43,099
huge and so well known now, isn't it? Athletes and people understand that the power of what you do,

663
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:48,860
I wouldn't put it past fluid form ending up in either of those spaces. And I really appreciate

664
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:54,699
you taking the time to share your story so openly and really learned a lot from it today. We love

665
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:59,780
collaborating with you in our space as well. And I wish you all the best. It's a great story

666
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,760
unfolding. I feel like you're just getting started as well, Kirsten. So thanks again for

667
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,440
taking the time today. Thanks, Luke. It's been fun. Thanks for having me.
