Tony Blauer is an internationally renowned expert when it comes to fear management and

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:15,240
self-defense. Here, Tony explained why he thinks making friends with fear is such an

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,219
important skill to learn. I realized something very powerful, this is about 1985,

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,579
and it became this expression that the people who manage their fear manage to fight it. And

5
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:28,179
it didn't matter if that was in business, for your relationship, for your health,

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,740
for your finances, or for your personal safety. There's so much I could talk about this,

7
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,840
but it's really been the story of my life. Also, I found it interesting to hear Tony explain

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,259
that no one teaches us that really courageous people feel fear as well.

9
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,700
Famous stories of George St. Pierre, one of the greatest mixed martial artists.

10
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:53,659
Mike Tyson used to throw up and cry before fights. St. Pierre, who's considered the goat

11
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:59,439
in MMA, one of them, recently came out and said the worst day of his life was every day he had

12
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,020
to fight. He loved the training, but he hated, he dreaded,

13
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:03,719
dreaded, dreaded, dreaded, dreaded, dreaded, dreaded, dreaded, dreaded, dreaded, dreaded,

14
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:03,740
dreaded, dreaded, dreaded, dreaded, dreaded, dreaded, dreaded, dreaded, dreaded, dreaded, dreaded,

15
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,739
fight day. We all want our kids to be resilient and deal with the inevitable hurdles that life

16
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:14,379
throws our way. Have a listen to Tony's advice for parents. So I've got a program with the words

17
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:20,079
no fear on it, and it's spelled K-N-O-W, not N-O, because I don't believe there's such a thing as

18
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,560
no fear. That's rationalizing. Remember the Richard Feynman quote, right? But there's

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,480
getting to no fear. When you get to no fear, you can use fear as fuel. You become

20
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,719
adaptive. You become more resilient. You become mentally tough. International leaders,

21
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,120
and fear experts, people like Tony Blau, inspire the work that we do at Alita.

decades. As the CEO of Blau Tactical Systems, his organization has grown into one of the world's

37
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,240
great to catch up with you. Thanks for joining me today.

38
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,240
Thank you.

39
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:59,719
Well, you've achieved a lot over a long period of time in a unique way, and it's a fascinating

40
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:05,800
story. A leading psychologist wrote that he found your research on fear to have been more effective

41
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,460
for clients.

42
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:13,280
Any material learned in 20 years of practice, why has understanding fear been so important for you?

43
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:20,580
That's crazy. And the day that there's a gentleman named Jeff D'Ateso, the day he said that to me,

44
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:26,360
we were on a call. He works with vets, military vets dealing with PTSD, one of his specialties.

45
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:32,300
And he said to me, this really resonates. It's helping them more than anything in 20 years.

46
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,740
I go, holy shit, Jeff, that might be the best thing I've ever heard about my,

47
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:36,860
in 20 years of practice.

48
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:43,300
I said, too bad we can't use it because you can't say that. He said, you can say that. It's true.

49
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:50,620
So it's on our No Fear website. But I love sharing that anecdote because it's outrageous

50
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:57,159
at a certain level. My relationship and my experience with fear has been, I'm turning 65

51
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:01,939
this year, has been like every day I have fear about something. I make the joke that if you

52
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:06,740
want to learn how to manage fear, you need to talk to somebody who manages fear. I'm very,

53
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:12,919
Very often when we want to experience courage or have a more courageous lifestyle, whether

54
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,160
it's being an entrepreneur, being a better parent, being able to protect ourselves, we

55
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,959
very often seek out people that I refer to as unicorns in their world.

56
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,660
Like, I want to be like that.

57
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:28,879
And if you talk to somebody who doesn't manage fear, they won't understand how to teach you

58
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,120
because they're the unicorn.

59
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:31,699
They don't go, I don't know why I'm not afraid here.

60
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:37,339
And so the number one fear in the world still, it's not getting dragged into an alley and

61
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:40,279
beaten and raped and taken to a secondary crime scene.

62
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,600
It's public speaking is still the number one fear in the world.

63
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,459
It's wild what our minds do with that.

64
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,100
So I'm fascinated by the whole thing because I can't ever remember not being afraid, even

65
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,660
as a kid.

66
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:58,680
Every sport I played, whether wrestling, skiing, swimming, when I got into martial arts, if

67
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,420
I was in school, the teacher would go.

68
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,379
Okay, Tony, what is the answer?

69
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,439
I'd be like freaking out.

70
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,519
I couldn't understand it.

71
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:11,639
When I started teaching self-defense around 1977 and 1980, it became professional.

72
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:19,339
I realized that a lot of the people that were coming to learn from me had fear too.

73
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,060
And I was doing these scenario-based training.

74
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:21,879
I would make a joke.

75
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:24,040
It was kind of like Fight Club before Fight Club, the movie.

76
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:27,839
We were like doing these wild scenarios in the basement of my school.

77
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,600
And I noticed something that was so peculiar.

78
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:36,000
That people who I thought were going to do well in the scenario didn't and other people

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,379
did.

80
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:41,420
And I was always like intuitively, unconsciously studying behavior.

81
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,680
I didn't want to and couldn't talk about that vulnerability.

82
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,379
Like when you're 7 or 11 or 15 or 20, it doesn't occur to you to say, you know, to turn like

83
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:50,720
you and I are about to do something.

84
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,899
I'm not going to turn to you and go, hey, are you scared shitless, man?

85
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,060
Because I am, right?

86
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,699
And because especially guys were macho about that sort of stuff.

87
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:59,639
I realized something very powerful.

88
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:00,779
This is about 1985.

89
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:05,660
And it became this expression that the people who manage their fear managed to fight.

90
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,899
When I would talk to people after, like, how did you do that?

91
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,800
What was going on?

92
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,819
Like this kind of Socratic debrief.

93
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,360
The person I thought was going to like roll over, tap out, freak out.

94
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,519
And we were doing like full-on scenarios, like force on force scenarios.

95
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,939
And they would always talk about the same thing.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,980
Well, I knew I couldn't stop or I didn't want to do this.

97
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,459
And even though I was scared and it just hit me one day, the people who managed their fear

98
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:31,220
managed to fight.

99
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:31,680
And it didn't.

100
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,660
It didn't matter if that was in business for your relationship, for your health, for your

101
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,600
finances or for your personal safety.

102
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:43,439
There's so much I could talk about about this, but it's really been the story of my life.

103
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,420
And I realized that if there's one superpower, you know, we talk about self-awareness as our

104
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:55,939
superpower, but you can't fully actualize self-awareness if you're rationalizing fear.

105
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,579
So if you're there's a Richard Feynman is a famous physicist, mathematician.

106
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:04,160
He said, the first principle is never fool yourself.

107
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,019
And remember, you're the easiest person to fool.

108
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:10,980
And what we do is we rationalize why we're going to do something or did something or not going to do

109
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,319
something.

110
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:18,319
And most of the time, it's the, it's the effect of psychological fear influencing our behavior.

111
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,959
And we can't manipulate that because we don't have the self-awareness to understand that.

112
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,220
That's a great point, Tony.

113
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,819
We're not told or taught that courageous people feel fear as well, whether it's a seal team,

114
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:30,759
six commando.

115
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:35,079
I played a sport called Australian rules football that I'm sure you know nothing about,

116
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,339
but the scariest player in our era was a guy called Tony Lockett.

117
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,579
And he was the most intimidating.

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,240
You didn't want to go near him on the field, but it wasn't until he retired.

119
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,639
We found out that he was so anxious before a game.

120
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,699
He was physically ill almost every game.

121
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,379
And like he made a lot of us feel physically ill because he was a chance to kill you if

122
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:56,060
you went near him.

123
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,480
But he obviously managed his fear in a way that made him so.

124
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,399
And I think that's the point you're making, isn't it?

125
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,360
That fear is normal.

126
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,199
It's just the ability to manage it is something that you're really passionate about.

127
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,240
Is that, is that how you'd sum it up?

128
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,300
Yeah.

129
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,699
I mean, you bring up a great point.

130
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:15,120
There's, there's famous stories of George St.

131
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,259
Pierre, one of the greatest mixed martial artists, Mike Tyson used to throw up and cry

132
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,160
before fights.

133
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:20,879
St.

134
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,199
Pierre, who was like one of the, you know, he's considered the goat, you know, in, in

135
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,439
MMA, one of them, you know, recently came out and said the worst day of his life was every

136
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,180
day he had to fight.

137
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,459
He loved the training.

138
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,379
But he hated, he dreaded, dreaded the fight day.

139
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:41,399
But what we see is 4% body fat, Superman punched through the air, knocking out all these people,

140
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:45,059
not realizing this guy didn't sleep the night before, couldn't eat the day before.

141
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,940
And then you go in there, see him and go, man, I got to be like that.

142
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:51,679
And I, it was funny because I was, I was on a call this morning with a group of people

143
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,299
that I coach.

144
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,580
And I said to them, I said, how many of you have been intimidated in your life?

145
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,279
All the hands come up.

146
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,440
And I went.

147
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,019
Do you realize that you, including myself, intimidate ourselves?

148
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:12,139
But what we tell people is I go, Hey, that guy intimidated me.

149
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,379
His intensity intimidated me.

150
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:19,179
His impact, the force of his nature intimidated me, or you threatened me.

151
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,080
And that was intimidating.

152
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,139
But what we're doing is we're talking about, I love the acronym, false expectations appearing

153
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:31,159
real, where we're visualizing an event in the future that's immobilizing us in the present.

154
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,600
It hasn't happened yet, but it's impacting our behavior.

155
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:40,879
And so probably two decades ago, I came up with this new way to think about the psychology

156
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,940
of intimidation and all of us experience intimidation.

157
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:51,120
The gift in this insight, if you grasp it, is that we intimidate ourselves by visualizing

158
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,519
what we think is going to happen.

159
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:57,340
And if you're feeling intimidation, it's because you're visualizing a negative outcome.

160
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,700
The power we have is suppressed.

161
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,720
It's because of the fear we hold.

162
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,320
And that fear isn't the enemy.

163
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,340
Fear is our energy, but only if you can change your relationship with it.

164
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:15,320
So when you get a fear spike in your body, anxiety, butterflies in your stomach, sweaty

165
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,720
palms, vertical breathing, whatever, however it shows up in you, is if you look at that

166
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:26,620
as if you were working in the military and you're monitoring radar, and you see a blip

167
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,620
and you go, is that a missile or is that a flock of birds?

168
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:29,919
You got to check it out.

169
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,100
But if you do this, you're going to see a blip.

170
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,179
You're going to see a blip.

171
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:31,240
You're going to see a blip.

172
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,259
You're going to see a blip.

173
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:31,340
You're going to see a blip.

174
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:31,440
You're going to see a blip.

175
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:31,460
You're going to see a blip.

176
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,940
And that's what a lot of us do when we get a psychological fear spike.

177
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,659
We say, we go into denial.

178
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,100
We go, man, I don't believe this is happening.

179
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:40,779
And that's the message.

180
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:46,200
Like in our self-defense protocol, we talk about like this timeline of violence or timeline

181
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,919
of escalation.

182
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,179
It's a 30,000 foot view.

183
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:55,259
And we talk about the three Ds, detect, defuse, defend, detect and avoid, defuse to de-escalate,

184
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,120
like defuse, like D-E-F-U-S-E, take the fuse out.

185
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,460
And then if you can't, you defend yourself.

186
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,440
So, you know, it's a lot of times when you're in a situation where you're in a situation

187
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,279
where you're in the D1, D2 phase is where you go, you get this bad feeling about anything.

188
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:07,860
What are you going to do now?

189
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:11,759
And to make decisions early, you need to manage fear.

190
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,620
Because when we're in the fear loop, we're procrastinating.

191
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:18,759
And whatever's happening is getting closer and closer and closer.

192
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,299
And it could be root canal.

193
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,240
It could be imminent danger.

194
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,100
It could be, you know, finances.

195
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,259
It could be health.

196
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,179
It could be a relationship.

197
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,980
Things rarely just happen.

198
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,399
Tony, I love your point around the mind and how...

199
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,039
You play out these scenarios of fear that become so real in our mind

200
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,779
that often don't eventuate either.

201
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:41,159
And your body reacts in the way that it may as well have happened to you anyway.

202
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,240
You produce the same chemical reactions in your body.

203
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,860
And that's where a lot of stress and anxiety comes for a lot of people.

204
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:50,679
And understanding that and understanding the mind the way you described

205
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,039
is a really powerful thing.

206
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:53,700
I want to go back to 2009, Tony.

207
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,360
I was reading in preparation for the conversation,

208
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,379
you experienced your own fear to deal with in a really extreme way.

209
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:00,940
Your family.

210
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:05,000
I had a violent confrontation that changed everything in your life at that time.

211
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:09,799
Within days of that home invasion, you had an employee betray you and forced you to shut

212
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,399
down the company.

213
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,860
You spent decades building and a group of trainers you've mentored effectively took

214
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,460
your IP and your contacts.

215
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,860
That's a whole lot of stuff to deal with.

216
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:20,480
And I'm assuming a lot of fear.

217
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,460
When you're in that scenario, how did you find a way through it?

218
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:25,100
I mean, it took years.

219
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,179
It literally took years.

220
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:29,779
And ironically, yesterday was the 15th anniversary of that event.

221
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,159
It was...

222
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,080
The most chaotic blend of fear and anger that I've ever experienced.

223
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:42,000
But listen, a home invasion, and I wasn't home for it, my family experienced it.

224
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,480
So I had, I carry around massive shame about that because I wasn't there to protect them.

225
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:50,659
So extreme anger and fear for me.

226
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:54,639
And I immediately focused on my family.

227
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:01,220
The week after it happened, I get a letter from one of our suppliers.

228
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,600
That they wanted to buy my equipment company for a ridiculously low number.

229
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:09,899
Like, if you know anything about valuations and EBITDA and stuff like that.

230
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,299
And I answered back.

231
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,100
I said, I literally said, are you high?

232
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,779
Like in the message, like you're drunk, you're smoking crack and you're on Jack Daniels.

233
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,559
What kind of number is that?

234
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:27,820
And then I get a call from the lawyer of the company that I'm partnered with saying, you

235
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,200
need to sell it to them or we're going to remove you of management.

236
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,440
You're the manager of the company.

237
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,740
And, and I'm like, how can you do that?

238
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:40,919
Like I'm the 50, 50 and the guy says, well, your COO has vested equity and he's voting with us.

239
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,600
So they had been planning this.

240
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,340
It turns out the cops caught the guys that did the home invasion.

241
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:55,320
And, uh, one of the guys worked for a carwash company that had a contract with my partner.

242
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:58,679
And they had been at my house the week before washing my wife's car.

243
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,960
So I'm dealing with, oh my God.

244
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:07,639
That's a setup because I was so unbalanced and I just wanted to protect my family that

245
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:12,139
when they started pushing to sell the company, I literally, I don't know if I can swear on

246
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:12,539
your show.

247
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,779
I said, fuck off.

248
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,399
I'm out of here.

249
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:18,639
And I signed without like, like really getting educated on the whole thing.

250
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,399
And then I immediately realized what was happening and I dissolved the company.

251
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,799
I signed off the manufacturing side and I dissolved the whole training side.

252
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,600
And three of the people I had mentored.

253
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,279
Who were like running different divisions.

254
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,779
We had a personal defense program.

255
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,179
We had a combatants program, military law enforcement.

256
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,500
I call them in and I say, listen, man, I'm dissolving the company.

257
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,159
Our equipment's being manufactured by these guys.

258
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:44,539
And we're going to rebuild the training division.

259
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,860
And they all like just went, we're out of here.

260
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,440
And next thing I know, like a month later, they're contacting my clients.

261
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,460
And this all literally happened like within a month and a half.

262
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,460
So I was being hit from my training.

263
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:06,539
I had a guy that was working for me, who's a family member, a brother-in-law

264
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:14,539
contacting clients saying, Hey, and it was a hard, hard lesson for me.

265
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:16,799
And when you say, how did you get through it?

266
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:20,240
I got through it in ways I can't imagine.

267
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,559
I mean, it took five years to rebuild the company.

268
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:27,240
I moved us to California and my wife's crying.

269
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Like right after the crazy.

270
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,820
Craziness, man, like helicopters over our house, you know, reporters knocking

271
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,919
because what happened was unheard of in our area, which made it even more

272
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:38,799
suspicious that it did.

273
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:39,840
There was tears.

274
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,659
There was anger.

275
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,960
There was, Oh, what do I do to just at the end of the day?

276
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:46,720
You know what it is?

277
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,600
It's it's if I asked you, what was the hardest hit you ever took?

278
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:55,600
And were you relying on your back and you looked up and you see stars and

279
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,080
and there's three of your, there's one person looking over you and you see

280
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,580
three of them.

281
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:06,399
You know, did you get carried off the field or did you go and get up?

282
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,639
Like the warrior gets up and it was just that, it was just getting up, focused,

283
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,139
rebuild every day was managing fear, managing fear because the mind was just

284
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,360
going nuts, heavy experience, man.

285
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,679
For parents listening to this, what, what advice would you give to parents to

286
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,399
raise resilient kids in a generation where that feels it's getting harder and

287
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:26,700
harder?

288
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:29,279
That's such an amazing question because.

289
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,399
I don't have to point out that the world's gotten weird in the last four

290
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,559
years and there's something afoot and there's something going on.

291
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,860
A lot of it is it's, it's like half the world has lost critical thinking and

292
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,779
the other half that's going, what's going on, doesn't know what to do.

293
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:52,580
So we're sending each other memes as opposed to like taking action, but you

294
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,159
don't want to take action because you don't want to get canceled, which means

295
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:55,899
you're in the fear loop.

296
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,379
The future of our world is in the hands of.

297
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,320
These kids, what are we teaching them?

298
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,180
When you look at grown adults acting irrationally, that's the

299
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,099
flaw of education and parenting.

300
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:13,740
A good friend of mine who does a lot of my tattoos calls me a year and a half into

301
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:19,380
COVID and he says his 10 year old son is exhibiting anxiety.

302
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,819
His personality is completely changed at school with a mask, no smiles.

303
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,519
And he goes, it's killing me, Tony.

304
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,420
It's killing me.

305
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,259
I don't know what to do.

306
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,480
So I've got a program.

307
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,519
I've got a program with the words, no fear on it, and it's spelled K N O W not

308
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:40,160
N O because I don't believe there's a such a thing as no fear that's rationalizing.

309
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,779
Remember the Richard Feynman quote, right?

310
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,720
But there's getting to know fear.

311
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,920
When you get to know fear, you can use fear as fuel.

312
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,400
You become adaptive.

313
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,680
You become more resilient, you come mentally tough.

314
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:55,279
So my buddy Aaron's his name says his, his son Salem is exhibiting anxiety.

315
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,400
He says, is your no fear program too old for him?

316
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,099
He's only 10.

317
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,720
I said, Aaron, it's not too old for you.

318
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,079
And you're your son's coach, not just his dad.

319
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,980
You're his mentor and his coach and his teacher.

320
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:17,480
You can have him raised by the school system, but you can see what's happening.

321
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:18,859
Or you can coach him.

322
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,079
He gets the program a month later.

323
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:24,480
I'm in Vegas on business and he hands me a letter.

324
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,880
I open it up.

325
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,359
There's, but it's amazing.

326
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,319
It's this handwritten letter from this 10 year old.

327
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:32,079
Salem who says, dear Mr.

328
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:36,099
Blower, I want to thank you for, you know, uh, the no fear program.

329
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:39,880
And there's a line in it that I tell people, you can't be brave.

330
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:46,000
If you're not afraid, the primary ingredient of courage is fear, but

331
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,240
no one ever told us that as kids, like when I was growing up afraid, none of

332
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,000
my coaches, mentors, teachers, or parents said, it feels good, man.

333
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,500
It's okay.

334
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,960
If you're afraid.

335
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,200
To present or do something, it's because you care, you're nervous.

336
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,480
What people think of you, that's normal.

337
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,180
And here's how you can use it or just go through it.

338
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:11,440
And every time you do it, it's a rep that'll get better your first game.

339
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:16,299
You might've been shitting your pants, but you're 20 games later, 50 games later.

340
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,859
Now it's like, this is a big game.

341
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:20,200
We've got to win it to get to the championship level.

342
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,240
Now the anxiety is about the outcome, but not about your endurance, your stamina, or

343
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,420
whether you can take a hit or our fears become more specific.

344
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:28,779
Yeah.

345
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:31,420
And then we can, we can manage them.

346
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,180
And so, um, you want to improve sales in your company, address

347
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,920
the fears of your sales force.

348
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,059
You want to be better in a better relationship with your significant

349
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:47,740
other address the fears, because very often I'll come home.

350
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:52,119
I see that my wife's burdened by something and I go, Hey, are you okay?

351
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:52,660
What's up?

352
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,339
And she'll go, I don't know, or nothing.

353
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:55,960
Right.

354
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:57,640
And you know, it's always something.

355
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,779
So our inability.

356
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:04,240
To look at our fear and then articulate what it is means that it just lives on our head,

357
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,819
suppressing the communication or the movement that's required.

358
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:08,519
Yeah.

359
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:13,980
Beautifully, uh, beautifully said, uh, Tony, we have this belief that success leaves clues.

360
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,420
And, uh, someone on this podcast said that, uh, in this forum and the idea that someone

361
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:24,279
who grew up with your background, who becomes an expert in self-defense and techniques around

362
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:28,720
overcoming fear or someone from a diverse background in, in the arts.

363
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,319
Or theater have, uh, similar patterns as to why they're successful, even though their backgrounds are unique.

364
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,279
And we have this belief around self-leadership.

365
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:42,079
I want to ask you, what do you do to fill your own cup so that you can be the leader you want to be?

366
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,559
Um, it varies.

367
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:50,319
You know, I, I have this idea that what is important to us changes every 10 years.

368
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:55,559
That's not a law or a, but you know, what I was worried about or thinking about or interested in change.

369
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,359
And so what I'm doing now.

370
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,920
To fill my cup.

371
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:08,720
Uh, a lot of it is, is really esoteric and metaphysical, but it's really self-care taking time for myself.

372
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,019
Reminding myself and people like everything will happen when it's ready to happen.

373
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:13,980
We don't need to rush.

374
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,019
We don't need to panic.

375
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,759
I live near the ocean, try to go for walks, enjoy nature.

376
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:21,319
I got four dogs.

377
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,519
I got three kids.

378
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:28,519
I spent so much time building my business obsessed with that, that I realized I didn't

379
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:34,880
I neglected a lot of things that I wish I hadn't as, as a parent, as a, as a, as a dad.

380
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,720
So it's continually working on your own self-awareness and just trying to be a better person.

381
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:43,720
Self-care and self-awareness is, uh, absolutely.

382
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:45,359
Um, it makes a lot of sense.

383
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,019
So what's one thing that's always worked for you, Tony, as a leader that you would never change?

384
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,279
Wow.

385
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:58,480
Um, I think it's my relationship with, with intuition over the years.

386
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:13,220
Like in 1980, when I was conceptualizing my approach to self-defense, I was told by, uh, the, the term thought leaders didn't exist back then, but the thought leaders in the self-defense industry that I would never be successful.

387
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:27,200
I would never make it that my approach to training, no, no belts, no levels, no uniforms, just understanding kinesiology, physiology, psychology, that you couldn't, people didn't learn that way.

388
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,319
Um,

389
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:40,259
And I could have, because some of these people were like very high ranking people who I looked up to saying to the point where, you know, I'm struggling, struggling, struggling, where my first wife is, when are you going to get a real job?

390
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,980
And, and when she said that I knew we were going to get divorced, right?

391
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:52,339
My self-belief that I was onto something when I was 20 years old, I got asked by a venture capitalist that I got introduced to.

392
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:58,339
I didn't even know what venture capital was, but he said, Hey, Ricky said, you got this different idea about how to make money.

393
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:00,220
How to make the world safer, explain it to me.

394
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:03,079
And I explained it to him and he goes like this.

395
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:06,400
He goes, he puts his hands back, leans back in his executive chair.

396
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,059
He goes, uh, you don't think this idea of making the world safer is a little bit grandiose.

397
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,319
And I didn't understand why he would think that was grandiose.

398
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:21,220
And I left his office and never, but here we are 45 years later, I'm still trying to make the world safer.

399
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,640
So it was like, are you going to be a professional or going to the family business?

400
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,319
And my mom asked me when I was 15, have you started to?

401
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:32,839
Think about this because you're going to graduate high school and what you're going to go into law school.

402
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:33,799
You're gonna be a doctor.

403
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,500
And I looked up word for word.

404
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,500
I said, mom, school's not going to be that important to me.

405
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:44,180
I'm going to develop my own martial arts system, like Bruce Lee and teach self-defense.

406
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:46,460
And she said, what?

407
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,319
I said, yeah, I'm going to be a famous martial artist.

408
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:53,359
And she literally pat me on the head and said, okay, honey, we'll talk about this when you're a little bit older.

409
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,619
I just knew.

410
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:56,220
So that was like, that was intuition.

411
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,279
I describe intuition and as, as.

412
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:02,259
Something, you know, to be true, you just don't have the evidence yet.

413
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,980
And that's interesting.

414
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:16,819
You say that Tony, in that answer, that's a common thing I hear from a lot of people in this forum that when they've made great decisions, their intuition, they've trusted when they've gone away from that's often when they've made a decision that they regret in life.

415
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:18,220
We're interested in, in vision.

416
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:23,920
Have you got a story of a visionary leader that inspired you that you felt compelled to follow along your journey?

417
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,019
Well, ironically, I just mentioned him.

418
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:28,119
Bruce Lee, you know, was one of them.

419
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:41,039
I remember reading a story obsessed with him and he was Chinese American trying to make it as an actor and there was a lot of racism back then.

420
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:41,480
Oh, okay.

421
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:48,259
You can be, you could build a rail, like a railroad road, you know, with a bunch of other Chinese people in this Western movie.

422
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,180
Like that was the roles that were opposite.

423
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,099
You can run a, a laundry shop.

424
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,319
Like, it was like really like, like racist, uh, stereotyped.

425
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:02,660
And he was fighting that, fighting that, where he had to go back to Hong Kong to become successful.

426
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:11,779
And when the books and stories and interviews came out with him, he had written something to himself that said to hell with circumstances, I'll create my own circumstances.

427
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:18,619
And I read that when I was 15 and I memorized that it was emblazoned on my head to hell with circumstances.

428
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,960
I'll create my own circumstances.

429
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:24,079
So that combination of trusting my intuition.

430
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:27,319
Where in the eighties, when my business was going.

431
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:36,640
Struggling, my accountant said to me, Hey, seriously, kid, you should close your business and go get a job like this.

432
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,400
Isn't going to work.

433
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,059
So I have the subject matter experts saying, you're never going to make it.

434
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:44,599
My mom going, why don't you just go to work for your dad?

435
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,079
My accountant saying, you're never going to make it.

436
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:57,000
And I fired my accountant and, you know, here we are like all these years that line from that one of Bruce Lee's biographies.

437
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,259
Just.

438
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:01,099
Stuck in my head and I'm, I'm moved by great thinkers.

439
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:11,839
So there's been a lot of spiritual guides, if you will, over the years that, um, you know, just like even a sentence can blow my mind and, and put me off on a trajectory.

440
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:25,819
I don't know if you remember the author, Dan Millman, he wrote the book, the way the peaceful warrior, uh, this isn't from the book, but in, in being suddenly fascinated with like the way he would teach and educate and inspire, I came across one of his quotes.

441
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:27,299
That was, you know, when you.

442
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:41,240
Face just one opponent and you doubt yourself, you're outnumbered and that, like, if you don't give yourself permission to win, that's two against none, you know, you're, you're doubting yourself and the opponent is, or whatever the obstacle is, is, is all over you.

443
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:51,579
So there's been a number, but I, I would say, I guess the primary one that got me through my teens into my business life was that Bruce Lee line and trusting my intuition.

444
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:53,819
Creating your own circumstances.

445
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,680
I love it.

446
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,180
We see curiosity is a word that's very common.

447
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:02,339
And for people who've had great sustained success, like you have, how do you carve out time to be curious?

448
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,099
And do you integrate that into the work that you do?

449
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:11,220
Not deliberately, but my, my wife made a joke this morning on a private text with a friend of mine.

450
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,640
And she said, I think Tony's on the spectrum.

451
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:18,420
Like, so I make this joke that I have like entrepreneur, entrepreneurial ADD.

452
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,019
I'll go, oh my God, check this out.

453
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,460
And then I'll, I'll, I'll take the company off on this other direction.

454
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,220
And everyone's like, oh shit, come on.

455
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:27,920
Let's go.

456
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,079
And sometimes my enthusiasm is, is, is contagious.

457
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:38,460
But although I'm not using the word curious, I think that's a component of curiosity.

458
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,440
It drives a lot of people better.

459
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,779
Cause like, if you ask anyone on my team, we've got trainers all over the world.

460
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:57,019
And if you ask any of the ones that are on my actual mobile training team, and you ask them this question, what was the best course you ever taught for Blower Tactical or Blower Training Systems?

461
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:00,720
They will answer you without hesitation, my next course.

462
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,859
And you can't be thinking about reinventing yourself each time if you're not curious about how do I get better?

463
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,359
And so I always ask people, are you coachable?

464
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,240
And you've got to go, like, you can't be coachable if you're not curious.

465
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:13,980
Brilliantly said.

466
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:16,259
We're obsessed with collaboration in our world.

467
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:23,400
We bring leaders together from around the globe to learn and to connect and share from different backgrounds in a space we call a leader.

468
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,259
Have you had an example of a great collaboration in your life you could share with us?

469
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,720
Wow.

470
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,339
It's like in our spear system where someone sucker punches you and you flinch.

471
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,579
My brain is flinching right now.

472
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:40,859
The greatest collaboration I've had is something that happened in the last two years.

473
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:56,660
And there's been a number of, if I go back to the early 90s, 1993, I got asked to go teach at the world, at the time, the world's biggest law enforcement training symposium called ASLET, A-S-L-E-T, the American Society of Law Enforcement Trainers.

474
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,299
But they had, you know, they had a lot of people.

475
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:01,079
They had trainers from Australia, all over the world come in there, thousands of guys.

476
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:06,180
And I was talking and my system was very polarizing.

477
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,680
I'd be talking and I'd see these famous trainers.

478
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,299
They had books out in my class, like sitting there like this.

479
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:14,779
Who's this asshole?

480
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,460
Wow, they're telling us this, this, this.

481
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,519
Because our system was unlike anything they'd been exposed to.

482
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,680
And I had two guys that became mentors of mine that came up to me and said,

483
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,299
You're so on.

484
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,000
You're so on the money here.

485
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:33,519
But your bedside manner in approaching it, you're too enthusiastic and it's coming across as arrogance.

486
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,680
I'd say things like, there's no such thing as reactionary gap.

487
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,900
That's why you guys are getting dropped inside that six feet.

488
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:42,339
The language is messed up.

489
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,220
You got to change that.

490
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:49,059
And here's all these type A personalities going, who's this guy that's not a cop telling us what we should do?

491
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,579
Right?

492
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:56,720
And so these were significant collaborations where somebody took the minute to see that.

493
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,720
My passion, my obsession was being misconstrued by people because they didn't understand.

494
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,859
And, you know, like, how many people do you know love change?

495
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:06,779
Right?

496
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:08,279
Like, people don't like it.

497
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,119
So there were a bunch of people who put me, took me under their wing.

498
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,099
I'm trying to put my arm up here, the screen.

499
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:15,319
Like, and said, hey, don't say things like that.

500
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,240
But I was coachable.

501
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:18,180
I was resistant at first.

502
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:18,900
I go, that's bullshit.

503
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,740
They shouldn't be defensive.

504
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,299
They go, Tony, I'm just trying to help you.

505
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,160
You've got an antidote.

506
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:26,519
An antidote to this sort of metaphor.

507
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:30,960
We have a lot of poison in our industry, but nobody's going to take it because of how you're coming across.

508
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,220
And I was coachable.

509
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,619
And I would sit with it, and I would figure out different ways to explain stuff.

510
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,579
I had another guy named Bob Lindsay, one of the most famous police trainers in the world.

511
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:48,319
He saw me teach back then, and he said, you're going to face so much resistance, but please don't stop.

512
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:54,380
One day, people are going to go, oh, I was there when I heard that.

513
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,460
They won't understand for a long time.

514
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,980
And I was like, young and dumb.

515
00:30:59,099 --> 00:30:59,880
And why is that?

516
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,859
Why are people defiant?

517
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,680
Why are people defensive?

518
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:09,619
But I listened to it, and I always hear his voice in my head when I want to quit or when I want to do something abrupt.

519
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:10,200
Right?

520
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:15,779
So I've had mentors that I am using collaboration differently.

521
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:22,519
It was their love of what they saw in my passion and obsession.

522
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,799
I use the word obsession, too.

523
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:26,259
I used to say I'm so passionate about this.

524
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:33,059
And I had somebody like you, who's like a thought leader, much more mature, say, you're not passionate.

525
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,740
You're obsessed.

526
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,180
You wake up in the middle of the night thinking about this stuff, don't you?

527
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,880
And I'm like, yeah, that's not passion.

528
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,019
Passion is I'm going to play guitar on Saturday.

529
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:47,099
You know, obsession is, you know, I'm playing guitar at the dinner table eating, you know, because I'm writing a song.

530
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,359
And that's how I am.

531
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:55,880
Collaboration is when somebody says, here's an idea that's going to improve the direction.

532
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,960
Or the product or the service.

533
00:31:58,539 --> 00:31:59,420
And you integrate that.

534
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:01,859
Tony, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

535
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:03,980
The greatest leader?

536
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,180
I'm going to give you a weird fear answer.

537
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,559
A weird spiritual answer is my fear.

538
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:19,460
If you're asking, if you're looking for a name, my head went right to everything that has shaped me to who I am.

539
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:23,859
It's because of that, the dance of fear and intuition.

540
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,779
And I don't know if this is.

541
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,500
It's obnoxious to say the greatest leader would then be myself.

542
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:37,859
And I would argue if you said, oh, your mom or your dad or your coach, I would say, dude, you're the greatest leader.

543
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:44,240
And we need to teach our kids to be the greatest leader, their CEO of their business of their life.

544
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:51,640
When I'm training and mentoring coaches, I will always say to them, OK, here's a professional instructor.

545
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,480
All the hands come up.

546
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,859
I go, who is the most important student that you have?

547
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,579
And people start thinking outside and say, one person always goes yourself, right?

548
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,240
And that's it.

549
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,059
And so most important leader.

550
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,680
What a brilliant answer.

551
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,680
I love it.

552
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:06,960
Yeah.

553
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:11,000
And your own relationship with fear that has governed your whole life.

554
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,660
It's a brilliant answer.

555
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:18,920
And you can hear the obsession coming out in everything you say with full passion mixed in.

556
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,240
We are a bit obsessed with this idea of collaboration, Tony.

557
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,220
And you've been a self-driven guy by the sounds of it.

558
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:25,660
And you've tread.

559
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,599
You've tread your own path.

560
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:31,440
And even when the experts and so-called champions of your industry have doubted you.

561
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:39,559
But has there ever been one person you thought, wow, in your clear passion in life, I'd love to connect or collaborate with one person?

562
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:41,039
Is there a name that strings to mind on that front?

563
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:44,000
No, but probably so many.

564
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,140
I don't know if this is arrogance or love.

565
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,079
Like, I really believe.

566
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,039
Like, I've worked with world-class athletes.

567
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,039
I work with businessmen.

568
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:00,099
Businessmen that have companies that are literally 50 times the size of mine.

569
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,400
Like, running $100 million companies.

570
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,559
And I'm in awe of them.

571
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:08,619
And they'll bring me in for coaching and coaching their team and everything.

572
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:18,820
Because I think for whatever reason, they went and saw the power of just this no-fear change for people.

573
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:24,639
I love your really clear understanding of intuition, how we've all got it.

574
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,760
And for us to tap into that is an incredible power.

575
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,579
And becoming friends with fear.

576
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,599
It's a great message from listening to you today.

577
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,539
It's been your life's work, your life's obsession.

578
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,800
And you've clearly helped make the world a safer place.

579
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,840
If that was what you set out to do, it sounds like you're doing that in an incredible way.

580
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,320
I really appreciate you taking the time to join me today.

581
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,800
Knowing fear and understanding fear is a gift for all of us.

582
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,159
And I appreciate you taking the time.

583
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,500
And I get lost in rabbit holes.

584
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:53,900
And I hope your audience got something out of it because it just takes over.

585
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,519
But it's a...

586
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:54,619
It's a...

587
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:00,559
You know, if I just share one last thing for your audience is that we all have fear.

588
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,880
And if we can change our relationship with fear, we can change what we're thinking right there.

589
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,059
So if you change your mind, you can change the next action you take.

590
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:17,860
So managing fear helps you improve your self-awareness, which improves your critical thinking, which improves your situational awareness.

591
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:21,500
If you think about it, what's the only resource we can't regenerate?

592
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:23,159
Time.

593
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:29,340
When we're obsessing and consumed by fear, we are wasting time.

594
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,699
We are not spending time.

595
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:33,639
If we're thinking about the problem, we're spending time.

596
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,960
If we're in the fear loop worrying about the future, we're wasting time.

597
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:44,739
And so when you invest in trying to understand how to manage fear, you're actually investing in time management.

598
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,440
You know, I can't think of a more important skill.

599
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,320
Manage your time, manage your fear, manage your mind.

600
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:51,760
Beautifully said.

601
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:53,119
Tony Glassman, a great privilege.

602
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,000
Thanks for spending some time with me.

603
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:54,619
Thanks for joining me.

604
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:55,699
Thank you, sir.

605
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:59,659
