1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:09,269
I genuinely think this conversation with Kurt Fearnley will change the way you think about

2
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,689
pretty much everything. Kurt has the most beautiful, unique, powerful world view. And

3
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:20,190
in this conversation, you hear how he came to be as successful as he is in every facet of his life.

4
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:27,250
Kurt came from a large family in a small country town with a very clear idea of what life is meant

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:32,049
to be. How that community grew up and fought so hard for him to be part of their world,

6
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:39,070
not segregated in any way as many of the services his parents' access suggested. Time and time again,

7
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:45,409
the small town he grew up in insisted that he be included in absolutely everything. And what it

8
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:51,030
took for his mum to go against pretty much what everyone told her to do and how much of a legend

9
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,829
she is in Kurt's life. You hear the story of how at 13 years of age, the tiny town Kurt grew up in

10
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:01,549
raised $10,000 to buy his first race chair and send him to the city to compete.

11
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:07,129
He talks about how he would love to remove pity from the world and that if you're on the receiving

12
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:12,569
end of unrequited pity, how can you ever have an image of yourself that's strong and beautiful?

13
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:17,390
He talks about why the segregation of people with a disability is literally a scar on the

14
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:22,769
communities in which we live in. You can hear about the 18-month preparation involved in Kurt

15
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:29,790
crawling the 96 kilometres of the famous Kokoda track with his brothers and cousins who'd been

16
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,769
so instrumental in his upbringing.

17
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:36,730
From a very young age. He talks a lot about you can't save other people until you have the ability

18
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,310
to save yourself and why to start with the assumption that the person across from you

19
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,170
is the best in the world at what they do. Couldn't be more inspired by Kurt Fearnley,

20
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,730
a unique and brilliant Australian with a remarkable story. It's people like Kurt

30
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:38,189
Argo and London in a career spanning more than 20 years. In 2009, Kurt Fearnley crawled the Kokoda

31
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:42,849
track in Papua New Guinea to raise awareness of men's mental health. Kurt was also a member of

32
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:47,729
the winning Sydney to Hobart yacht crew Investec Loyal in 2012. He was the New South Wales

33
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:52,490
Australian of the Year in 2019. Kurt hosts several of his own podcasts, including the

34
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:57,129
brilliant Tiny Island where Kurt talks to great Australians about what it means to them to be

35
00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:01,590
Australian. Born without the lower portion of his spine, he's never held Kurt Fearnley back from

36
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,949
his resilience and determination to succeed. He's nothing short of legendary, Kurt. I love sitting

37
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:12,030
back and reading your story again in the last few days. It's blown me away by what you've been able

38
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,770
to achieve. I really appreciate you spending some time with me today. No problems, Luke. Looking

39
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,770
forward to it. Now, you were born on a start, maybe from the beginning. You were born in a

40
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:26,569
small country town called Karkour in New South Wales, born without the lower portion of your

41
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:31,590
spine. I imagine, Kurt, it would be easy to accept that there's a lot of things you can't do. Where

42
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,810
did your determination and your resilience to go on and achieve what you have, where did that come

43
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,729
from? Well, it wasn't mine. You know, like all good kids, you kind of grow up in the community

44
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:47,830
that you're in. And your belief system and your approach to life is usually what is reflected back

45
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:53,669
at you. I grew up in that tiny little town of Karkour. It's in the middle of Wiradjuri land,

46
00:03:53,669 --> 00:04:00,729
which is out in the centre of New South Wales. We didn't have a lot of resources.

47
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:08,550
My family were, I was the youngest of five kids. My dad was one of 11. You know, my mum was one of

48
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:16,589
five. But what we had was this solid idea of what life was meant to be. And although every time my

49
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,610
family touched the systems that were around to support people with disabilities, they usually

50
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:26,269
touched systems that, you know, tried to get me away from the people that I loved, that tried to

51
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:31,490
isolate me, that tried to segregate me, that tried to say that, you know, that the community that I'm

52
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,029
in is not going to be the same. And so, you know, I think it's a really good thing to have that

53
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:32,389
community. And so, you know, I think it's a really good thing to have that community. And so,

54
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:32,550
you know, I think it's a really good thing to have that community. And so, you know, I think it's

55
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:37,329
not made for me. The community that was there was the exact opposite. They demanded that I would

56
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:43,930
play a part in it. They valued and loved me as I was. They fought for me to be a part of every

57
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:50,209
corner of their community, whether it be my cousins who would carry me through paddocks to be a part

58
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:56,870
of life growing up in the bush or a principal of Karkour Public School who, when a four-year-old

59
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,790
kid wanted to go to his local school with his brothers and sisters, my parents were told that

60
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,029
I actually had to go to a local school. And so, you know, I think it's a really good thing to have

61
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:07,829
should be taken away from my home and sent through segregated education. I had a teacher

62
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:14,769
at Karkour Public that cemented the school as much as he possibly could, bought bags of concrete out

63
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:19,970
of his own money, and made sure and told my mother and father that there's no place else in the world

64
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:26,029
that I deserve to be than the place that values, the place that loves me, the place that is

65
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:27,509
my community and family.

66
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,769
I just have the hair standing on the back of my neck when you explain that. It's

67
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:36,410
the beauty of rural Australia, isn't it? I understand Karkour, total population at that

68
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,149
time, maybe 200 people. Is that correct? Yeah, 200 and shrinking.

69
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,930
And how brilliant, Kurt, that all the things that you've gone on and been an incredible advocate for,

70
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:50,430
that community got just intuitively, didn't they? There is no way Kurt deserves to be anywhere

71
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,009
apart from with the people that love him the most. It's pretty special, isn't it?

72
00:05:55,389 --> 00:06:00,449
Well, they just did it time and time again, you know? So you'd think maybe it was just,

73
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:01,509
you know, the one moment...

74
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:10,769
One moment of kindness is easy. The repeated purposeful acts of inclusion, that was amazing.

75
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:17,970
They demanded that I went to school. They offered me pathways where I had to crawl around the bush

76
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:25,430
to be me, but it was just accepted. And where I needed help, they jumped in. And then when I was

77
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:31,009
shown the potential to race wheelchairs, you know, that town of 200 people and shrinking,

78
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:37,189
they got together against the wishes of my mother and father, who tried to stop them.

79
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:43,910
They raised 10,000 bucks in two weeks. And when my mother and father, who, like I said,

80
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:50,290
we weren't very financial, we were probably the wrong side of the poverty line, but we were

81
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:56,230
extraordinarily proud. And when they tried to stop them, the town simply said, stay out of it,

82
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,990
it's between us and the boy. You know, like that sense of community,

83
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:11,870
so naturally and so prevalent that every single time where, you know, there was the potential for

84
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:17,370
me to be ushered into isolation and segregation, the community were there and just making these

85
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,910
choices that were beyond, you know, beyond the year that we were in, beyond the time that we

86
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:28,250
were in. And Kurt, you mentioned you're the youngest of five. And my understanding from

87
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,490
reading in the last few days was that the doctors didn't think you'd survive. And I think that's

88
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:35,910
the first week of your life, if that's correct. And then that community, as you said, they raised

89
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:42,009
$10,000. That's not a small amount of sum from a tiny country town. And that was for a race chair

90
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:48,629
that set you on this elite athlete pass. Again, life-changing moments. Yeah. Well, being born out

91
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:54,689
in the bush with a disability that is quite rare, I think there was an immediate fear of whether or

92
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:59,610
not I'd live through the night, let alone the week. And then because of disability also has

93
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,350
a thousand other complications, usually.

94
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:09,389
That potentially running alongside the fear of how long I'd be around for was pretty real for a

95
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:16,170
while. Even from that first few days, I think my mum, because when you bring disability into a

96
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:23,269
world where you also exist, you know, in a pretty tough financial situation, there were lots of

97
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:30,769
people trying to offer her alternatives to taking me home. And again, there was no more natural

98
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:31,149
choice.

99
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:35,809
And my family's life then to take me back and whether I live a day or a week or a month,

100
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:40,009
I live a day or a week or a month as a family. And that means with the family.

101
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:47,269
And then when it come time to race wheelchairs and they just jumped up and started raising this

102
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:55,769
money, mate, these are cockies and chippies and laborers, you know, who were working for,

103
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:00,429
for, you know, if they're lucky, 10, 20 bucks an hour.

104
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:08,889
A fine of $10,000 amongst, you know, a few hundred people, because they knew that I deserved

105
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:14,909
the pathway that was out there. And that pathway would enrich everyone. They raised the 10 grand.

106
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:20,350
I was about 13 years old, 12, 13 years old. And they told my mother and father that that's for

107
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:27,129
a racing wheelchair and a trip to wherever, wherever I need to go to be around other kids

108
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:31,490
that are doing this same thing. And yeah, mate, it's hard to believe.

109
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:37,090
I actually do remember, I remember it all happening and just thinking it's not real,

110
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:42,049
you know, like you can see it in front of you. You can see it, you know, like you can

111
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:48,990
really almost feel that there's this big world out there, but you've always got this little

112
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:56,690
protective amount of doubt in you that, but will I get there? They own, I always like to say that,

113
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:01,450
that I live in Newcastle. I'm about as proud of Nova Castrian,

114
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:05,809
you know, I've been here 20 years and it's got my heart, but car core and

115
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:10,350
where I drew land that got my, that got my soul that owns, that owns a big chunk of me.

116
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:16,769
You talk about life and sliding doors moments, the, the, the people around the medical profession,

117
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:23,809
you're born and they're saying to mum and dad, Hey, you need to let Kurt, where exactly were

118
00:10:23,809 --> 00:10:26,710
they thinking you should end up rather than with your family? Can I ask?

119
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:31,370
Oh, well, back in the, you know, seventies, eighties,

120
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:36,470
institutionalized life for people with disabilities was not uncommon. Like I said,

121
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:41,730
in 1984, when I went to go to school, the department of education, and it wasn't this

122
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:47,090
one off, it was like multiple times when you would interact with the system that we hope

123
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:53,250
would support people with disabilities often, often was set up to remove them away from the

124
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:58,629
people that love them and their immediate families, especially when you, when you put

125
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:01,330
disability and combine it with things like poverty.

126
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:07,610
It can be a really isolating experience. And for my family, I think that we did actually

127
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:13,610
isolate ourselves even more because each time we went in there, the, the, the interventions that

128
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:19,350
were encouraged were so unpalatable that we just, we interacted with them less and less and less

129
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:26,129
and less, you know, so that those, those, those fail points of the systems that were around people

130
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:31,490
with disabilities led to us becoming more isolated. But thankfully we backed in,

131
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:37,129
to a community that was so forward thinking and so forward leaning that it caught me, you know,

132
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,389
like it really caught me.

133
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:42,789
And I'm talking to a board member of the Australian Paralympic Committee. You're a founding member of

134
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:48,049
the National Disability Insurance Scheme Advisory Council and a whole range of other boards. I mean,

135
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:53,690
you have taken what Karkor, that tiny little country town in rural New South Wales gave you

136
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:59,809
and have you pass that on and you continue to fight. Can you just explain, it's so stark to

137
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:01,370
hear what your family was.

138
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:04,129
Yeah, it's so stark to hear what your family was confronted with compared to what they did. What,

139
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:09,250
what do we need to learn? People like me who haven't had to grow up with understanding your

140
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,350
world, what, what do we need to learn first and foremost to make life better for, for people in

141
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,110
our country who have a disability?

142
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:23,710
I think the first thing is remove any assumption of how horrible you would experience it. You know,

143
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:30,669
there is this inbuilt assumption that if I was in that situation, I wouldn't handle it.

144
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:31,490
If,

145
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:38,289
if I had a spinal injury, I would really, I would not do very well. If I had a kid with a disability

146
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:42,889
that would be so hard, I don't think I could deal with it. You deal with it because you've got to

147
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:47,789
deal with it. The, the, the environment that you live in is the environment that you live in. The

148
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:51,850
hardest thing that anyone's went through is the hardest thing that anyone's went through. The

149
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:57,649
first thing would be get rid of any assumption that you had of how hard or how, how horrible

150
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:01,269
any sort of variation in existence would be. And,

151
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:09,789
and just go in with an open mind that this person loves who they are, loves where they are, until I'm told otherwise.

152
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:30,950
When I get around in my day to day life, I genuinely assume that I'm doing great at it, right? Like I'm, I'm nailing this part of life until somebody comes up and goes, Ooh, that looks tough. And then it, it kind of brings you out of this moment where you think, is that how you seem? Is that, and, and I genuinely do believe that one of the things that a loved one can do is to be able to show a little bit more of that person's side.

153
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,629
One of the things that if I had a magic wand that I would remove

154
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:37,149
out of this world would be pity because pity is like a cancer

155
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,370
that it eats away at the foundation of the person.

156
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,230
Like how can you believe that you are great and that you are valued

157
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:51,330
and that you are valuable if you are the unrequited recipient of pity?

158
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:57,809
It's just how will I ever have an image of myself that is strong

159
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:06,110
and that is, you know, beautiful if I am forced to see myself

160
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,809
through another person's lens of pity?

161
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,990
That would be the first couple of things that I would kind of address.

162
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:17,029
And Kurt, it's a profound lesson to learn and to hear that, isn't it?

163
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:19,809
I know this almost sounds like a contrite thing to say,

164
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:23,370
but the thing an athlete hates the most is when you're injured

165
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,149
and someone asks you how you're feeling about your injury.

166
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:27,289
It's the worst thing.

167
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:27,789
And you know that.

168
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:28,549
You know that as well, don't you?

169
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:31,289
Like it just takes you to a place you don't want to be.

170
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,029
Because as you said, in your mind, I'm recovering, I'm going well.

171
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,970
It's, you know, and when you give a curt answer to someone, you know,

172
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:40,710
you've done your knee and it's like because it's probably the 100th person,

173
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,129
isn't it?

174
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:45,470
And it's probably at glance taking you back a way that you're not.

175
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,610
And as you said, I'm talking to a winner of the Don Award,

176
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,710
the most prestigious sporting award in Australia.

177
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,950
And for those who don't understand, it's named after the great Sir Donald Bradman.

178
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,470
It's about recognition.

179
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:01,190
It's about recognizing the Australian that inspires the nation the most,

180
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,490
not the person with a disability that inspires the nation the most.

181
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:08,450
You're the first person with a disability to win that award.

182
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:13,350
But that must, when you sit there and hear that, that's you, isn't it?

183
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,470
Not anything else.

184
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,909
And to speak at that level, that must fill you with great pride.

185
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,149
Can I say not really?

186
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,629
You're winding me up, mate.

187
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,029
Seriously.

188
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:31,850
Mate, I honestly don't know how to process those moments.

189
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,169
And I've never have, right?

190
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:40,629
Like the moments of recognition seem as foreign to me as anything else.

191
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,549
Like I just don't know how to handle them.

192
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,750
Like I do actually have that award out.

193
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:47,230
It's in the kitchen.

194
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,490
It's in the kitchen.

195
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,409
It's the only award that I have out because it's the great Don Bradman

196
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:55,870
and it was a pretty great night.

197
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,169
But.

198
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:01,129
I am 100% intrinsically motivated

199
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:08,009
and I have had either people coming into my life to offer me feedback

200
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:14,129
so often and for so long that you reduce the impact of that feedback.

201
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,590
So if somebody will jump into my life and portray it in a negative

202
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:24,730
or an extraordinarily positive way and I just want to live my life,

203
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:26,950
I can't let that in and I won't let that in.

204
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,429
So.

205
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:30,970
Somebody comes up and tells me how shit it must be to be in a wheelchair,

206
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:36,110
which they do, or how much of an idea,

207
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,149
you're a saint because you're in a wheelchair, you know, which they do.

208
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,730
You can't let either of it in because you just want to be you, right?

209
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,889
So you shut that down and you move on and do something else.

210
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:51,889
Now, there is feedback and there are people that you let in, of course,

211
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:57,309
that help build this idea of who you are and whose opinion on what you were doing

212
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:57,690
truly matters.

213
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:03,070
But I think that I spent so long removing anybody else

214
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,950
who isn't within my valued group.

215
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:12,750
I removed that so far from the reality of how I live that when I go

216
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,829
to an awards night and I receive an award, I don't know how to let it in

217
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,450
to feel about it.

218
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:25,029
I see that as one that's worth keeping out because the people

219
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:27,789
that I do love were there and they enjoyed it.

220
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:32,069
You know, they got this experience out of it.

221
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,670
So I'm like, okay, I get that.

222
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:40,750
But during sport, nobody else's opinion mattered about a race except for mine,

223
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:46,210
my coaches, my trainers, and maybe two or three other people in the world

224
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,970
that I really, really, really valued their opinion.

225
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,509
And that was it.

226
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:55,690
You could have somebody come out and say that that was the greatest race

227
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,589
in the world or the worst race in the world.

228
00:17:57,809 --> 00:17:59,630
And it just didn't matter.

229
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,869
And Kurt, it's a fascinating mindset.

230
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,990
And to delve into that is intriguing to me.

231
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:09,730
And I get, as you said, to be able to not take on the stuff you don't need

232
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,309
to take on.

233
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,069
That's a superpower that you've created there.

234
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,730
But my question is, I wonder, has that enabled you to – I mean,

235
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,490
you've got so much that you have to celebrate.

236
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,970
They're remarkable things you've done, mate.

237
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,690
Are you able to enjoy them enough is my question.

238
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,170
I enjoy every day.

239
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,329
Like, honestly, like, I enjoy every day.

240
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,309
I am –

241
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:32,069
The most – I am more grateful for every moment of my life that, you know,

242
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,690
like I feel like I am living an absolute gift.

243
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:41,450
But an award, you know, in one of those really strange settings,

244
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:45,769
I wouldn't swap that for – there's this one memory I have crawling around

245
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:48,769
the bush with my kids when they were really little, you know,

246
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:53,890
and that was as perfect a moment as I've ever had in my life,

247
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,269
whether it's awards or racing or anything.

248
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:58,309
It was just perfect.

249
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,730
It was beautiful and amazing.

250
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,730
And so, yeah, you've got to try and enjoy every single moment.

251
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:06,910
But I don't know.

252
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:12,269
Sometimes I think you can't value too much the big and flashy ones

253
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:16,910
because then they stop, you know, like they stop.

254
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:20,789
And your value and worth in life, that can't stop.

255
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:26,609
I want to find value and joy and celebration in life when, you know,

256
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:27,130
when – well,

257
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:30,490
it's well and truly behind me, but when all of that is done and dusted,

258
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,750
you've still got to find those kind of – those perfect moments.

259
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:38,809
But, yeah, you celebrate them a bit, but not too much.

260
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,430
And I understand what you mean.

261
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,089
You're not attaching your identity to being the Don Award winner

262
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:48,750
or a three-time Olympic gold medalist or the numerous other marathons you've won.

263
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:51,690
I totally get the brilliance in your thinking on that.

264
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,390
I've got to ask, tell us about that day.

265
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,950
You're crawling around with the kids out in the country.

266
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:56,750
What was that?

267
00:19:57,309 --> 00:19:58,730
It was so perfect about that day.

268
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,490
Well, we were looking for koalas.

269
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:02,650
And I was –

270
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,190
As you do.

271
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:04,509
As we do.

272
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:09,809
And we just disappeared into the scrub for hours and crawling through.

273
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,509
And they were having a ball because we were kind of half lost.

274
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:17,529
And we never saw a bloody koala, but we did lie down on the ground a heap

275
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:21,569
and just talk about the trees that were swaying and the – you know,

276
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,109
it's – I guess it's – if you think about it deeper,

277
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,509
it's probably just 100%.

278
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,509
Just being in the moment.

279
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,130
And you can see this little, you know, again,

280
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:35,609
somebody who is one of the cool people that you love,

281
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,490
you can see they're kind of growing and that they are in that moment too.

282
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:44,490
And I think that it was just – it was probably at my leaving –

283
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,849
at the time that I was leaving sport.

284
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,910
And I think there was just a moment of realisation that this moment

285
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,390
is as good as any sporting moment.

286
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,369
And it's okay to go.

287
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:57,089
You know, it was probably –

288
00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:00,509
it was probably my brain kind of putting a bookend on something

289
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,650
and just saying, you're good.

290
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:04,630
And it just stayed with me.

291
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:08,109
And I love what you're referencing there too because sometimes we set up

292
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:11,029
these great trips for the kids and we've got this expectation

293
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:14,210
this is going to be – do you know how lucky you are to be here

294
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,410
in Port Douglas or whatever, but going for, you know,

295
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,210
a crawl around the bush and trying to find koalas is probably the thing

296
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,369
they're going to remember the most as well, isn't it?

297
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:27,109
Without having to worry about the expense of doing anything extravagant.

298
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:30,670
Well, it is going to be interesting to see what their stories are

299
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:35,650
because they have done some wild stuff, but they've also, you know,

300
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:39,430
seen their old men crawl alongside them for 5Ks.

301
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:41,150
Well, I don't know.

302
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,289
I just think that that might have an impact on them one day.

303
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:46,190
But you're right, mate.

304
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,109
Like the 12-month-olds, their birthday's in two weeks and people say,

305
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,650
what gift do you want them?

306
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,849
I don't know, a bag of tissues?

307
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:56,690
What do you – you know, like throw them up in the air for a bit?

308
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,109
You know?

309
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:02,269
Like kids just want – kids want presents and they – as in your presents,

310
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,150
your attendance, you to be in there with them.

311
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:10,369
And I got in the Hall of Fame last year and somebody asked me

312
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:11,589
what my kids thought about it.

313
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,309
And I'm like, I haven't told my kids.

314
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,549
Why would I tell my kids?

315
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,390
They would just be like, okay, well, whatever that means.

316
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,990
And they don't really have the context for it at the moment,

317
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:25,329
but they would – they care about whether or not you're there

318
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:26,230
for soccer training.

319
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:31,430
And, you know, they want the really normal father moments.

320
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:34,990
They want you to be mates with their friends' fathers.

321
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,630
You know, they want that.

322
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:41,230
They don't want the flashy stuff that you think that they would.

323
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:44,009
I always say you can't fake time with kids.

324
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,630
You're either there or you're not.

325
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,349
And that time is, as you said, the presence is what counts.

326
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,049
So how would you describe yourself?

327
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:54,210
Father of four, you've got the twin girls that, as you said,

328
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,210
are two weeks away from their first birth.

329
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:57,930
What are you like as a dad?

330
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:02,529
Oh, gee, I don't know.

331
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,990
I probably run them a bit hard.

332
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:11,170
I've got a couple of hundred acres just outside of Newcastle,

333
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,990
and me and the young fellow are there for six hours working yesterday.

334
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,789
And he's a 10-year-old.

335
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:20,710
He's almost 10, and he'd give me a solid six hours worth of work.

336
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:25,670
And I think that I remind them on a daily basis

337
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,210
that they're loved.

338
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,150
They're loved always.

339
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:29,750
There can't be a day go by that you can't tell them that you love them

340
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,829
and that they're strong and that they're valued.

341
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:36,789
I don't really know how to classify myself as a dad except for, like,

342
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:41,450
I make sure that they know that they're the most important thing in my life.

343
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,849
And, yeah, that's about it.

344
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:52,890
A little while ago, I got offered this acknowledgement as an award as a dad,

345
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:53,369
right?

346
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:55,990
And I couldn't take it.

347
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:00,230
Because I think the only person that should ever judge you as a dad is kids

348
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,289
on the other side of it.

349
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:06,430
And the thought of taking that without them having a word in it kind

350
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,869
of made me feel real sketchy.

351
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,869
So I don't know.

352
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,710
You can have all this intent at the end of the day that they're going

353
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,410
to be the judge.

354
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:21,289
But I do do everything I can to make sure that I've got a hand in their normal,

355
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,529
their average, their everyday.

356
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:25,470
I love your aversion to awards.

357
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,609
You're not even going to turn up.

358
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,130
I hate it, mate.

359
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:32,490
I'm picking up a common theme here and you're not even turning up for that one.

360
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:34,730
But I love what you just said, isn't it?

361
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:36,410
You know, they know they're loved.

362
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:38,190
They know they're the most important thing in my life.

363
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,549
You can't get a better start than that.

364
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:42,549
And we all make mistakes as parents.

365
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,990
But if you're coming from that lens, it's hard to do much more.

366
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,509
I have to ask you, you've done some extraordinary things.

367
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,829
But the one that I – and you probably know where I'm going.

368
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:54,710
But the Kokoda track, 96 kilometres.

369
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,589
Some of the toughest terrain.

370
00:24:57,849 --> 00:25:01,210
And I know people have described that as just incredibly challenging.

371
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:06,829
You crawl that famous track that's got so much history in terms of Australia.

372
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,710
That must have been an amazing experience.

373
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,150
I think it is truly one of the most achievable adventures

374
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,069
that you could ever throw yourself into.

375
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:18,869
And it is really achievable.

376
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:20,910
We were so fortunate.

377
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:25,329
So I did it with my brothers and cousins or family or grew up.

378
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:29,930
We did it as a reminder to come back that we were all going to be there

379
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,730
for each other, to support each other.

380
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:36,589
And also that if a guy in a wheelchair can look for and ask for help

381
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:40,269
from those around him, then he'll feel confident and comfortable enough

382
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:42,549
to have a crack at the Kokoda track.

383
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:47,829
And then we were fortunate enough to find a tour company

384
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:53,329
that would talk to me because the first one was pretty –

385
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:55,109
they were pretty adamant.

386
00:25:55,329 --> 00:25:57,890
But what I was doing was irresponsible

387
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,190
and shouldn't be even spoken about any further.

388
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:04,390
And then I called Wayne Wetherill at Kokoda Spirit

389
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,029
and he had just watched me race in Beijing.

390
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:11,150
And he said, it's crazy, but I want to meet you anyway.

391
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:16,670
And he flew down to Newcastle and I had grown up crawling

392
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:21,329
because Karkour had no concrete outside of the main street.

393
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:25,230
So I jumped out of my chair and we crawled for a few minutes.

394
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,369
We crawled for a few kilometres and he could see that it was possible

395
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:29,730
and he was ready to go.

396
00:26:29,869 --> 00:26:33,289
And I said, give me 18 months because I knew that there would be

397
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:36,450
a lot of sideline preparations that were needed.

398
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:42,549
And they were to try and minimise blisters and impact on my joints,

399
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,250
to try and make sure that I had the confidence.

400
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:49,069
You know, you can say you're going to do something,

401
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:55,150
but then there's the lying in bed at midnight realising the thousands,

402
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,029
thousand risk areas that you've got to manage to do it.

403
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:02,549
So, you know, saying you're going to do it and then being comfortable

404
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:05,910
with going to bed at night are two different things.

405
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:11,109
And it took me 18 months to kind of slowly piece together equipment

406
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:14,650
that would keep me safe, that would keep everything in one piece,

407
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:21,029
and then build the physical strength to be able to go through the metre

408
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:24,730
by metre of just dragging yourself through mud again.

409
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:30,329
And dragging yourself up hills and, yeah, 18 months from the moment

410
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:34,670
that we first talked about it to the moment that we're all flying

411
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:40,250
over the top of the Owen Stanley Ranges and seeing this incredible jungle

412
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,950
behind or underneath us.

413
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:43,730
Yeah, that's remarkable.

414
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:47,630
And you did it with the Carcore cousins and brothers.

415
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:51,849
Is that the same crew that were there when they didn't accept anything

416
00:27:51,849 --> 00:27:54,329
apart from Kurt Finley going everywhere they went?

417
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:54,630
That must have...

418
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,029
You've added another layer to it to go back for those guys.

419
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:02,490
They were all the guys that were instrumental in me growing up,

420
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:05,210
crawling around the bush, were all on the trip with me.

421
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:07,789
So I wasn't a...

422
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:11,670
It wasn't a surprise for them to see me crawling around.

423
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:13,950
And then we also had...

424
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:18,630
And the PNG people were one of the most beautiful, incredible,

425
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:24,309
strong, like fierce community that you could ever see.

426
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:25,210
But they...

427
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:29,930
They have this real strength that is layered with this generosity

428
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:35,170
and kindness and gentleness that is pretty amazing to kind of fall into.

429
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,609
And, you know, I think they saw me crawl off the plane

430
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:40,029
for the very first time as well.

431
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:44,690
And we had some porters there and they just didn't know how it was all

432
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,849
going to work as well.

433
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:51,529
And then I just started crawling and these porters kind of lined

434
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,789
up alongside me and then I kept on crawling and then they kept on trying

435
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:55,190
to get me.

436
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,609
They kept on trying to get me to sit on the stretcher.

437
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,430
They kept on trying to get me to...

438
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,809
They wanted to carry me.

439
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,829
I think a couple of them, the one guy in particular,

440
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,589
he had a brother with a disability who he lost.

441
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:09,009
We didn't find out until later in the crawl.

442
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:12,890
But every night he would come alongside me and he would sit down

443
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:16,509
and I don't talk about this as much, but he...

444
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:21,869
It was one of the most relieving moments in my day because he would say,

445
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:25,170
if you want to be home, tell me now.

446
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,990
And I'll have you in Moresby by morning.

447
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:32,630
Like he just had this, I'll throw you on my back and I'll run you out of here

448
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,650
the moment you tell me you're ready.

449
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:42,470
And knowing and just somebody giving me that just absolute comfort

450
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:49,210
and support and like knowledge that no, I'm okay was...

451
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,309
That was...

452
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:54,910
That allowed me to do the day-to-day...

453
00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:02,250
Just drag and managing the pain of every moment was a lot easier

454
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,730
knowing that there was a relief valve there.

455
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,910
Okay, there's the legend of the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels as they were called

456
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:15,730
in World War II, the New Guinea locals who just did that in World War II

457
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,890
for the Australians, didn't they?

458
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,190
That literally put Australian soldiers on their back

459
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:22,029
and showed incredible bravery and courage.

460
00:30:22,369 --> 00:30:23,970
And how fascinating.

461
00:30:24,109 --> 00:30:24,730
You got to experience...

462
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,009
A little bit of that of your own.

463
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:29,390
Did that sort of history dawn on you a bit at the time?

464
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:33,769
Yeah, there was a moment that I was being carried through a bit

465
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:37,750
of a swampy area and I am on a stretcher and I'm in a lot of pain

466
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,849
and the boys had me up on this stretcher and they're kind

467
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:44,849
of running me through it and you've got a treetop over you

468
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:48,269
so you're getting these speckles of light and I'm pretty emotional

469
00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:52,069
because even though you had that moment every night,

470
00:30:52,069 --> 00:30:54,569
there was still trying to wrestle yourself

471
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:55,069
into dealing...

472
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,970
And with the step after step after step and the doubt about,

473
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,630
you know, how am I going to feel tomorrow?

474
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:03,670
And I remember just being carried and being really vulnerable

475
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,269
because they have...

476
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:08,130
They literally have you in their hands, right?

477
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:12,430
And I can see the sun coming through these beautiful just trees

478
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:16,609
and thinking that this is the exact sight that our boys,

479
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:20,589
you know, that Australians who for the very first time

480
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:24,269
were fighting for their own defence were realising, you know,

481
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:25,190
that we are on the other side.

482
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,789
We're on the other side of the world and that there's no one

483
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:28,890
that's going to come and protect us.

484
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:35,369
These 17, 18-year-old kids off, you know, property or in the western suburbs

485
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:40,430
of, you know, Melbourne and Sydney and they went over there.

486
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:46,789
They fell victim to the realities of war and these beautiful people

487
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:50,609
who had no dog in the fight just wanted people to live.

488
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:53,789
They would throw them on this stretcher

489
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:55,190
and there was a lot of people who were like, you know,

490
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,910
there's a moment that I just remember feeling the vulnerability of that

491
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:01,869
and how vulnerable they would have felt, you know,

492
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:05,490
being carried away from conflict by a group of guys

493
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,269
who had no reason to do what they were doing

494
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:12,730
except for that they were these angels out of nowhere that would appear.

495
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,549
Amazing story and amazing bit of history.

496
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:19,309
If you haven't read it before, it's worth it and I still...

497
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:23,329
Just the mind is just incredible what you were able to achieve in doing that.

498
00:32:23,329 --> 00:32:24,970
I didn't know that it was with...

499
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,710
The people you grew up with, what a special story.

500
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,089
Kurt, we use the term success leaves clues

501
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:32,470
and I love sitting down from people like you

502
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:34,829
and learning from your lived experience,

503
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:38,049
but we think there's these patterns around what great successful people do

504
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:41,269
in terms of the way they lead, starting with this idea of self-leadership

505
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:44,170
that very hard to do anything else for someone else

506
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,170
unless you've got an idea of your own sense of self-leadership

507
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,670
and your story is full of that.

508
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,970
But what does that mean to you?

509
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,170
Self-leadership.

510
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,609
I really believe you can't save other people

511
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:54,170
until you have the...

512
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,789
The ability to save yourself, right?

513
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:59,869
But I think when I think about leadership,

514
00:33:00,109 --> 00:33:02,009
there are two different ways.

515
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,549
There is leadership that's thrust upon you

516
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:08,930
and then there is leadership that you show in day-to-day life,

517
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:12,430
like the leadership through osmosis.

518
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:17,190
It's like the stuff I was talking about with my kids.

519
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:20,109
I will go and I will crawl 5K with them

520
00:33:20,109 --> 00:33:21,829
because I know at the end of the day

521
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:24,849
that I want them to value this adventure.

522
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,529
Of finding out what the view on the other side of the mountain is

523
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:30,390
and you're hoping that through living a certain way

524
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:35,849
that there will be this experience for them to get on the other side of.

525
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,029
And then there's the leadership,

526
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:40,390
when leadership is kind of thrust upon you,

527
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:43,849
where you were given these roles or these titles

528
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:47,049
because of something that you have shown

529
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:52,230
where you need to not forget about the reason

530
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,950
why you were given that title in the first place.

531
00:33:54,970 --> 00:34:01,170
And that was usually because you live the day-to-day values

532
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,109
that people valued.

533
00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:07,609
You live the life that people valued to give you that role

534
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:09,349
and you can't stop doing that.

535
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:10,969
Yeah, brilliant answer.

536
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,750
And it's so clear the way that you think about those things.

537
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:16,909
We see people really conscious, Kurt, on a daily basis

538
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:19,829
who have consistent success like you have

539
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:22,829
about how they positively impact others in their environment

540
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:24,030
every single day.

541
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:24,929
How have you thought?

542
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:24,949
How have you thought about that?

543
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:26,349
How have you thought about that impact on others?

544
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:29,750
I always think, I always start with the assumption

545
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,869
that the person next to me is the absolute best in the world

546
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:36,909
to do the tasks that they are buying into.

547
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:40,690
And then if I've invited them into this space,

548
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:43,889
then it's kind of, it's up to me as well to make sure

549
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:44,730
that that's a reality.

550
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,389
And I think that has come from my experience

551
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,710
of the alternative to that.

552
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:53,170
When you experience this and when you go into a setting

553
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,750
and you experience,

554
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:59,090
where people have this huge lack of expectation

555
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,829
of who you are and what you can do,

556
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:06,170
you realise pretty quickly how disempowering that is

557
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,030
and how that can be one of the things

558
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,369
that rip the hope out of you.

559
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:12,590
And I will never be a part of something

560
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,949
that rips the hope out of people.

561
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:18,030
So I will always assume that this person

562
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,210
who is lining up for this experience with me

563
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:23,269
or this, whatever it is that we're about to undertake,

564
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:24,730
they are the absolute best in the world.

565
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,929
They are what it is that they are undertaking.

566
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,030
And then when I adopt that approach,

567
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,949
I also own that with them.

568
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:34,210
I just couldn't imagine doing the alternative

569
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,929
because the alternative to that means

570
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:38,449
that you're having to fight scepticism

571
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:41,670
through every single thing that you approach.

572
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,829
And scepticism is another thing

573
00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:45,909
that will just get in your road time and time again.

574
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,469
Like I accept there needs to be diligent work

575
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:53,429
to ensure that you are able to succeed at it.

576
00:35:53,429 --> 00:35:54,670
But assuming,

577
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:58,230
assuming that that person that's with you on the event

578
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,550
is going to nail the things that they line up for

579
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:05,590
just allows you to kind of, I don't know,

580
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:09,250
give them the entire reign

581
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,969
that they could potentially need

582
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:13,829
to be the person that they believe they have to be.

583
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,969
What a brilliant thing to give people the benefit

584
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:18,570
that I trust you, isn't it?

585
00:36:18,889 --> 00:36:20,690
Inherently, I trust you, not the opposite.

586
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,550
And so many of us do that.

587
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,449
We judge and we go,

588
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,550
this person might let us down.

589
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,550
This person's not up to the chart.

590
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:28,369
And we, for no reason,

591
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:30,309
no understanding most of the time, isn't it?

592
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:33,170
And, you know, I love that you always start there, isn't it?

593
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,809
And I'm going to trust this person

594
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:38,369
is going to be world-class and work my way from there.

595
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:40,130
What a brilliant way to think about life.

596
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,110
I love asking you about, you know,

597
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,230
creating and sharing a vision.

598
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,449
You've had some extraordinary visions

599
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:49,769
from your marathon success to your Olympic success

600
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:52,090
to Kokoda to your advocacy

601
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:54,170
and the board work that you do.

602
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,949
Your own media stuff is a big vision.

603
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,230
How have you gone about creating that

604
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,650
and sharing it to the level

605
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,909
that you've been able to achieve?

606
00:37:02,409 --> 00:37:04,150
I've had a really good team around me,

607
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:06,170
a really, really, really good team around me

608
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:09,349
in everything that I've kind of been able to be a part of.

609
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,050
Look, my vision is genuinely,

610
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:17,969
I would say that I believe that segregation

611
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,489
is a scar on the community in which we live

612
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:21,869
and that whenever it exists,

613
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:23,070
we need to do everything possible

614
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,150
to make sure that it is,

615
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,150
that it is read.

616
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,429
I think that telling stories

617
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:29,849
that haven't been told in mediums

618
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:33,710
that allow the story to be told a little differently

619
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,369
is really, really important.

620
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,590
I love creating content

621
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,909
and creating conversations

622
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:42,309
where people are invited into a space

623
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:45,670
that they may not have heard it voiced in that way before.

624
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,269
You know, I love Tiny Island.

625
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:49,070
I love You Little Ripper,

626
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,929
which is a Paralympics podcast

627
00:37:50,929 --> 00:37:52,949
where we just talk Paralympic sport.

628
00:37:52,949 --> 00:37:54,530
I don't let any other sport,

629
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:55,909
in there, never will.

630
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,989
You know, like AFL and NRL Grand Final,

631
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,130
not for our audience, my friends.

632
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:04,550
This is all sport for people with disabilities

633
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,329
and it is, you know, it is a wild world

634
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:11,190
and one that is something that created,

635
00:38:11,409 --> 00:38:13,550
you know, a big chunk of who I am.

636
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,909
I love to, I don't know,

637
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:19,170
if I find a pathway that I believe

638
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,510
that it aligns with purpose,

639
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:22,889
I love just chasing it

640
00:38:22,889 --> 00:38:24,369
and just seeing where it'll end.

641
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,429
And I could never,

642
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:29,309
one of the, I guess I have FOMO

643
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:32,590
to the ninth or the hundredth degree.

644
00:38:32,829 --> 00:38:34,829
I just hate the idea

645
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:37,869
of seeing an opportunity in front of me

646
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:40,809
and not kind of,

647
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:43,909
not shaking it as hard as I can

648
00:38:43,909 --> 00:38:47,230
and not making sure that I've seen the view

649
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,710
on the other side of that mountain

650
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,150
or I've gave that, you know,

651
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,289
that pathway a hell of a shake.

652
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,289
I've got to pick up on what you said there,

653
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:58,710
segregation's a scar on our community.

654
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,849
Can I understand that a bit more?

655
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:04,429
Is that coming back to your experience around

656
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:09,349
just why do we need to put people in specialised schools

657
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:12,809
or why do we need to deviate off from,

658
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,409
all the resources are there,

659
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:17,710
if we just accept people, whatever shape, size,

660
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,190
is that being too simplistic?

661
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:22,590
Is that the message that we need to just,

662
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,269
as your community did,

663
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,190
200, just make a way for whoever

664
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,710
and whatever challenges they've got?

665
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,750
Yeah, I think it's about understanding

666
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,530
that the way that we live

667
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,090
and the life that we live

668
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:38,349
is not the only way that people experience life.

669
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,710
And I think that we all,

670
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:43,309
as a community,

671
00:39:43,929 --> 00:39:46,050
would value, would benefit

672
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,429
from experiencing the way

673
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:50,550
that every other person experiences this life.

674
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,389
You know, like I said,

675
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:54,349
I've got four non-disabled children,

676
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:58,789
and we have a world that is changing pretty quickly.

677
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,570
And we get worried about, as a community,

678
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:06,570
the potential lack of resilience

679
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,409
that is in the next generation.

680
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,269
One of the parts of our community

681
00:40:11,269 --> 00:40:13,289
that do not lack resilience

682
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:15,269
is this community of people with disabilities

683
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:17,469
who are learning to forge their way

684
00:40:17,469 --> 00:40:19,170
in a world that's not made for them.

685
00:40:19,889 --> 00:40:23,570
And one of the hardest things about creating resilience

686
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:24,250
is about making it a reality.

687
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:24,329
And I think that's a big part of our community.

688
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:24,489
And I think that's a big part of our community.

689
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:24,510
I think that's a big part of our community.

690
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:24,570
And I think that's a big part of our community.

691
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:25,590
We want to ensure that somebody

692
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:29,369
sees the very real world that is out there.

693
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,110
And it gives them a healthy sense

694
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:35,190
that this, I think I said earlier on,

695
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:36,429
the hardest thing you've done

696
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:37,489
is the hardest thing you've done.

697
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:39,489
Now, if you've never seen somebody

698
00:40:39,489 --> 00:40:42,210
with a variation on life other than you

699
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,250
who's doing it pretty bloody tough,

700
00:40:44,389 --> 00:40:46,090
but nailing it and loving it,

701
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:48,329
then that's doing yourself a disservice

702
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:51,570
because you're removing this experience

703
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,130
of a variation of life

704
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,230
that shows you the reality.

705
00:40:54,230 --> 00:41:04,449
you that gives you context of of how you know to be grateful for the for the ease but give you the

706
00:41:04,449 --> 00:41:10,389
context that if you found a tougher road you'd be able to nail it like they're able to nail it

707
00:41:10,389 --> 00:41:16,869
so i see that it's this twofold thing that we need to make sure that that individual who has

708
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:22,110
a variation of life is a part of everything because they need to feel that they are not

709
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:27,050
somebody somebody's problem to be pushed to the side that they have they are valued and they can

710
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:35,289
be valued and loved as they are where they are but the rest of the everybody also gets this really

711
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:42,530
valuable gift of understanding that that life is varied and their experience is is only just that

712
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:47,929
it is their experience yet should it change you know pathway towards this kid with a disability

713
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:51,710
you'll be fine because they're fine so giving this real

714
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,090
solid

715
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:58,610
understanding of a tangible taste of variation of life i think that that is a gift for everyone

716
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:08,670
and i am a uh i'm a high school teacher and i believe that every single person in this country

717
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:14,889
would benefit from being a part of a really inclusive education system and i understand

718
00:42:14,889 --> 00:42:20,289
the realities where parents come in and say you know this kid who has this disability is affecting

719
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:21,690
my child's experience

720
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:27,630
in a negative way yet not willing to take a moment to think about the long-term

721
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:34,769
amazing gift that that will give that your child or another person's child or my child

722
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:40,110
by experiencing every variation of life and there is nothing more natural in this world

723
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:44,469
than the variation that disability gives to every person that is around it

724
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:50,110
incredibly well said kurt it's a profound statement and you can tell that comes from

725
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,670
the heart of your of your lived experience and i think that's a very important thing to do and i

726
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:56,090
think you can Beyond what you've said a lot on your past garden faces and what Umm has

727
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,610
experienced as you said from your perspective as a as a high school teacher communicating

728
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:05,530
with clarity is another dimension arsed you and and you are brilliant communicator you just summed

729
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:10,269
up something that seems complex for a lot of us in in such a brilliant profound way

730
00:43:10,269 --> 00:43:15,130
and you listen to all of your communication and all the podcasts and all the world that you're

731
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:19,190
in have you thought about the way you do that episode something that you've put time into i kind of landed in spaces where about being placed in these roles where you've

732
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:22,610
based in these roles where you've got to communicate, you know.

733
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:26,969
Like I was captain at Karkor Public School, all 16 kids.

734
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:31,610
So you had to talk in front of kids from, you know,

735
00:43:31,889 --> 00:43:33,309
when you're in year six.

736
00:43:33,429 --> 00:43:36,150
And then I was captain at Blaney School for high school.

737
00:43:36,269 --> 00:43:40,030
So I've landed in these roles where you've kind of got to communicate.

738
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:46,150
I didn't really think about it until I was lucky to hear

739
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:49,769
Justice Michael Kirby speak maybe 15 years ago.

740
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:54,829
And then I spoke after him and we had a good yarn after him.

741
00:43:55,090 --> 00:44:01,269
And he said that he told me that words,

742
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:06,289
being able to be eloquent with your words is like painting a picture

743
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:08,769
for everybody who hears them.

744
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:13,050
And we need more pictures and we need more people because

745
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,929
when they hear these pictures,

746
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:15,929
it allows them to feel.

747
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:20,989
Something that they otherwise wouldn't be able to be a part of.

748
00:44:21,789 --> 00:44:28,489
And making people feel is the first pathway to allowing people

749
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:29,570
a chance to change.

750
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:33,550
I do think that if you are able to paint a picture with your words,

751
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:37,449
that you can potentially bring people who otherwise, you know,

752
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:39,889
have no interest in being a part of the pathway ahead,

753
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:43,449
you can bring them on board and you can bring them in with you.

754
00:44:43,929 --> 00:44:45,750
So I think I did.

755
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:49,750
I think about it quite a lot after that about making sure that when I

756
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:53,349
talk, I try and describe, you know,

757
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:58,969
the pathway ahead in emotive ways so that people feel what it would be

758
00:44:58,969 --> 00:45:02,449
like to not be invited into that pathway or to,

759
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:09,210
to feel what it would be like to be a part of that because feeling is

760
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:12,210
without it, then there's no hope of change.

761
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:15,250
And there's no hope of, you know, bringing people with you.

762
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:15,530
Yeah.

763
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:17,630
How important has collaboration been for you, Kurt?

764
00:45:17,869 --> 00:45:18,909
Yeah, collaboration.

765
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:23,769
You might think a marathon is, is about an individual sport as you've

766
00:45:23,769 --> 00:45:28,949
ever, ever seen, but I was a part of a team and that team was, you know,

767
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:33,590
I would back that team to be the best in the world at what we did.

768
00:45:34,349 --> 00:45:38,730
You, you, you always need to recognise that no matter what you're going

769
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:42,309
through, although it is tempting to kind of feel like you're stuck

770
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:44,269
in a silo and this is only a you problem.

771
00:45:44,269 --> 00:45:45,510
It's very rare that it is.

772
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:49,949
There's usually people that have gone through the exact same problem that

773
00:45:49,949 --> 00:45:54,570
you're battling it out with that are able to potentially give you insights.

774
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:58,409
It's like, you know, experiencing life with a disability.

775
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:02,969
The first thing that I tell all people with disabilities who acquire it is hang

776
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:05,349
out with other people with disabilities, get the cheat codes.

777
00:46:05,889 --> 00:46:10,230
You know, life isn't about having to, you fight it out in this silo to try

778
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:15,510
and find this pathway that just seems so bloody unattainable when, you know,

779
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:20,510
the majority of issues that are out there, people have fought them before

780
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:22,570
and, and found the cheat codes for it.

781
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:26,150
And it's cheat codes and it's, it's, it's not really cheating.

782
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:30,130
It's, it's just allowing you to do more and be more confident

783
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,550
and feel like you're less alone.

784
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,210
Kurt, who's been the greatest leader in your life?

785
00:46:35,389 --> 00:46:37,389
Oh, look, my mum probably.

786
00:46:37,789 --> 00:46:44,269
Look, it's a little kid, five-year-old brought back into a pretty wild space.

787
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:50,750
And she allowed me to crawl away from the house as a toddler to,

788
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:57,889
to take these cuts and bruises that, you know, I would feel pretty motivated to,

789
00:46:58,289 --> 00:47:01,969
you know, there would have been, there would have been a thousand voices

790
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:04,630
of doubt telling her to stop me doing this, you know,

791
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:09,010
stop allowing him to come back at the end of the night with all these cuts

792
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:10,289
and bruises and breaks.

793
00:47:11,289 --> 00:47:14,250
But she backed herself.

794
00:47:14,269 --> 00:47:20,469
She genuinely got the input, found out, listened to me,

795
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:25,610
learned about, you know, what was out there and then made a choice

796
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:26,329
and backed herself.

797
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,329
Pretty amazing, isn't it, Kurt?

798
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:31,210
With no, his true understanding, isn't it?

799
00:47:31,409 --> 00:47:33,630
And the mother's instinct, she must have had, as you said,

800
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:37,750
had to override so much of that instinct to protect, you know,

801
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:42,050
your youngest sibling who's got challenges that they didn't understand.

802
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:43,989
I mean, pretty profound, isn't it?

803
00:47:44,269 --> 00:47:49,389
Yeah, I think Alan Marshall's I Can Jump Puddles also helped her out of,

804
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:53,170
it got rid of any lingering voice of doubt that she was doing the,

805
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,530
potentially the wrong thing.

806
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:58,869
And Alan Marshall was a young Australian in the 50s, I think,

807
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:03,269
who grew up with polio and, you know, had fistfights,

808
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:04,769
crawled through mud, fell out of trees,

809
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:08,849
did all the mischief that all kids deserve to do.

810
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:13,929
But I think that's something about sharing a story will hopefully,

811
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:18,849
probably validate that next person who's going through that same feeling

812
00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:25,170
of siloed, you know, hard, siloed, almost torment.

813
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:31,130
But I think that that was probably one of the biggest influences on her.

814
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:33,349
But it does take something, mate.

815
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:36,230
Like, it genuinely does take something to truly,

816
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:40,210
truly go against all of the advice that you've been given,

817
00:48:40,849 --> 00:48:43,510
but just know and follow it.

818
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:45,750
One of the great Australian books, I Can Jump Puddles,

819
00:48:45,869 --> 00:48:50,550
if you haven't read it, it is iconic and a classic.

820
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:53,690
You mentioned the silos and cheat codes in life.

821
00:48:53,789 --> 00:48:56,969
We're a bit obsessed with collaboration and getting people out of their silos

822
00:48:56,969 --> 00:49:01,070
to do what we're doing and share knowledge for a better life.

823
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:03,170
And as you described beautifully, you know,

824
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:06,130
the diversity of experience is brilliant for everyone

825
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:08,110
if you actually get your head into it.

826
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:11,250
In that spirit, if you could collaborate with anyone on anything,

827
00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:13,050
you've done these remarkable things.

828
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:13,909
Have you ever thought,

829
00:49:13,929 --> 00:49:17,329
God, that's someone that would really be fascinating to me

830
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,469
to be alongside of?

831
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:21,090
Oh, you know what?

832
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:22,630
I would do everything.

833
00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:29,309
Look, I remember being in, I grew up in a pretty fully,

834
00:49:29,429 --> 00:49:34,929
fully obsessed family when I was at rugby league.

835
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:36,909
When I was a young fellow,

836
00:49:36,989 --> 00:49:38,989
my uncle was coaching New South Wales and Australia

837
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:43,230
and another cousin who was, he won a grand final in 91

838
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:43,730
for the P.

839
00:49:43,929 --> 00:49:44,949
He was a great Benrith Banthers.

840
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:50,889
And I got to experience the great Craig Bellamy actually in our origin,

841
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:55,869
but just his ability to fire people up in a situation

842
00:49:55,869 --> 00:50:00,230
and the way that he used parts of himself to give emotion

843
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,909
to others around him.

844
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:03,949
You name it, mate.

845
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:09,849
I think I've kind of exposed myself that if there is something out there

846
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:13,630
that is outside of my usual experience,

847
00:50:13,929 --> 00:50:17,670
and I could be a part of something where somebody created either music

848
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:21,349
or, you know, just seeing how they do it is amazing.

849
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:24,690
And I don't think of, I can't think of one off the top of my head.

850
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:28,030
I'm an anything and everything type of guy, I guess.

851
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:30,510
What a brilliant answer to finish on.

852
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,630
And I could see, and that's your life, isn't it?

853
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:36,409
You have just, as you're given a red hot shake to anything in front of you,

854
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:39,349
and Kurt, it's inspiring to listen to your story

855
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:43,769
and understand, you know, your values and for really a deeper understanding

856
00:50:43,769 --> 00:50:47,550
for me of what it means to live with a disability

857
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:49,630
and how you've attacked life.

858
00:50:49,869 --> 00:50:53,510
And it's a fascinating and inspiring story

859
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,130
with plenty more chapters to play out

860
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:59,610
and some beautiful kids growing up right before your very eyes.

861
00:50:59,769 --> 00:51:01,469
And I really appreciate you taking the time today.

862
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:02,050
Thanks so much.

863
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:03,010
No problem.

864
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:09,550
