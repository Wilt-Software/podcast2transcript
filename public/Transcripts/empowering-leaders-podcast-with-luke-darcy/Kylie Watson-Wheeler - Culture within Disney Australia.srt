1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:10,029
Disney is one of the largest and most respected media companies in the world.

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,869
How do you make sure that you're creating a positive working environment

3
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:15,710
and a culture that encourages growth and diversity of thinking?

4
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:19,839
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,339
The idea of self-improvement and leadership,

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,500
both on and off the field, has been a lifelong passion of mine.

7
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,420
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,160
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,320
in education, sport, industry and the arts

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,299
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

11
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:39,759
where everyone has a voice.

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,320
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

13
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,119
I was joined by Kylie Watson-Wheeler, the General Manager of Disney Australia,

14
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:06,939
to talk about leadership in the workplace, Walt Disney's extraordinary legacy

15
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:09,760
and how you begin to understand the language of empowerment

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,019
and developing confidence.

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,519
So Kylie Watson-Wheeler, and this is quite an extraordinary CV

18
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,420
and I'm going to have to do it a little bit of justice here.

19
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,640
Kylie, as the Senior Vice President and Managing Director

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,879
for the Walt Disney Company Australia and New Zealand,

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,980
currently President of the Western Bulldogs Football Club,

22
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,280
Kylie's responsible for the Walt Disney Company Australia and New Zealand

23
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,340
across film, TV, digital, home entertainment and distribution

24
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:34,879
and streaming services.

25
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,340
She manages a portfolio of content and products across Disney, Pixar,

26
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,579
Marvel, Star Wars, ESPN, ABC Studios in the US,

27
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,680
20th Century Fox, National Geographic.

28
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,680
And Kylie's leadership history is extensive.

29
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,640
She was the Director of Advertising and Brand Management for Hallmark Cards,

30
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,480
based in Kansas City in the US.

31
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,719
She oversaw marketing for Hallmark's $4 billion business prior to moving to the US

32
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:04,019
and Kylie spent four years as the Marketing Manager for Hallmark.

33
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,780
Kylie had previous marketing positions with Coca-Cola, Amatil and Penguin Books.

34
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,020
She's a board member of Mentone Grammar here in Victoria,

35
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,159
Motion Pictures Distribution Association of Australia.

36
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,879
And I think the list could go on and on, Kylie, but we might start there.

37
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,319
Thank you.

38
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,479
Thank you for joining us.

39
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,740
It is an extraordinary CV.

40
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:24,659
Can I start by asking you, did you always have ambitions to be a leader?

41
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,699
No, I didn't actually.

42
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,860
You know, if I think about the progression of my career,

43
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,340
what was always really important to me was finding something that was meaningful to me

44
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,360
and something that I enjoyed and was passionate about.

45
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:42,300
And so my career journey has really taken me, you know,

46
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,460
through those pathways as I've always sought that.

47
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,539
But one of the key things for me was,

48
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,159
I've always really lent in to the creative side.

49
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,259
So the businesses that I have worked for and have progressed in

50
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,780
generally have really lent into that creative side that I have

51
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:06,419
and enabled me to really bring to life a vision that has creativity at its core.

52
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:10,139
And I think that for me, because I did seek out those opportunities

53
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:14,419
that were meaningful to me, I was able to build my strength

54
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:18,520
within those industries and within those companies, which led to progression.

55
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,039
Even at a school age, were you pretty clear on that?

56
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:24,819
At a school age, I knew that I wanted to do something creatively.

57
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,759
And I knew that perhaps being an artist wasn't really a great option for me

58
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:33,699
for multiple reasons, not only because I might have found myself on the breadline.

59
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,960
And while I say that I like creativity, I'm not sure I'm the best at that version of it.

60
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,639
But I knew that I needed to, that for me, I wanted to be involved in things

61
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,479
that were important to me, that were meaningful to me,

62
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,860
that I was passionate about.

63
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,699
And that was right from when you're at school, the subjects that you choose

64
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:56,199
and the journey that you head yourself on as a result of that.

65
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,120
So I think probably for me, it wasn't necessarily conscious,

66
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:03,020
but it was just a matter of always going towards and moving towards the things

67
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,919
that inspired and motivated me.

68
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,520
Yeah, a lot of people you talk to, Kylie, work day to day and they exist in their job

69
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,740
just to get through to some sort of joy on the weekend.

70
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,879
To me, it's one of the saddest things that you can hear people express

71
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,860
and they spend 40 years.

72
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,879
And they say, I didn't really enjoy my job.

73
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,699
And I find that hard to relate to.

74
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:26,279
I feel very lucky to have always done things that I've been passionate about as well.

75
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:29,660
So narrowing down on that, I want to get to the Walt Disney Company,

76
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:33,220
which for a lot of people is just this extraordinary organization.

77
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:39,379
But for you, were you prepared to pick roles that maybe were based purely on passion

78
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,319
rather than stuff like pay and finance at the start?

79
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:43,379
Yeah, definitely.

80
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,879
I never, ever chased money.

81
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:48,139
I always chased what interested me.

82
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:53,259
And I think in addition to that, sometimes I chose roles that I didn't like,

83
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,660
but for brands that I did.

84
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:58,819
So the perfect example is really when I had been living in the US for four years

85
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:00,980
and we made the decision to come home.

86
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,839
My son was one.

87
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,620
We wanted to raise him here in Australia.

88
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:07,360
And when I was looking at opportunities back here,

89
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,160
I really narrowed it down to brands that I wanted to work for

90
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,399
because I figured that whatever I did next, hopefully, would be a long career journey.

91
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,980
I'm quite loyal.

92
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:19,759
I worked for Hallmark for eight years.

93
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,180
I've worked for the Bulldogs my entire life, as she now does.

94
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:24,899
Loyalty is kind of at my core.

95
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,319
So I wasn't necessarily choosing a stepping stone.

96
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:31,860
I wanted to find something or somewhere that I thought I could have a long career.

97
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:34,459
And so Disney was high on my list.

98
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,620
I actually chose or applied for and got a role that wasn't actually that exciting to me.

99
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,720
And to be honest, I wasn't actually really qualified for either.

100
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,259
So I'm not really sure how I got that role, but it was in the product division.

101
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,019
So working on products.

102
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,459
Products and building the consumer products business there,

103
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:53,180
which is something I had never done before.

104
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,860
But I really wanted to work for Disney.

105
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,639
It was a brand that was really meaningful to me

106
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,240
and that I thought had values that would align with my own.

107
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,199
And so I went through a bit of a rocky early stage at Disney

108
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,180
as I tried to work out what on earth I was doing.

109
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,560
Ultimately, somehow worked it out and found myself on a pathway in there.

110
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:15,480
And Disney is, Kylie, known and legendary for its culture and values.

111
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,720
And you sit here today, as we said,

112
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,399
off the top as MD of this part of the world, Australia and New Zealand.

113
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,779
And then you work through Disney Plus.

114
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,379
It takes you across all the business worldwide.

115
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,759
Can you explain to people the culture and values at Disney

116
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,040
and why it appealed so much and what it's like now

117
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,800
being a leader of those culture and values?

118
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:40,939
Well, right at the core of our business is the company stands for entertainment with heart.

119
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:45,019
And regardless of what execution that is and what brand that's under,

120
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:47,360
it really is about fantastic,

121
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,300
great storytelling.

122
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,040
And that's really at the core of everything that we do.

123
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,279
So there's such a strong, authentic foundation in what we represent as a business.

124
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,040
But then as far as how we operate and I guess the culture that we build within the business,

125
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:05,579
it is centered around three key pillars of humility, teamwork, and optimism.

126
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,180
And if I break those down, humility basically means,

127
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,220
obviously, we're a really large, well-known company.

128
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:14,300
We have a lot of amazing assets and content.

129
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,040
But when we're working with our partners and when we're working,

130
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,480
you know, we really need to ensure that we're treating everyone with respect,

131
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:25,060
that we're not necessarily puffing out our chest.

132
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,980
We're valuing our brands and what we have,

133
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:33,319
but we're always partnering and creating relationships externally and internally with true integrity.

134
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,680
From a teamwork perspective, you know,

135
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,040
collaboration is at the heart of everything that we do.

136
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,560
And I think that's what's enabled our business to grow and evolve

137
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,040
and change as the industry itself has morphed.

138
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,920
And, you know,

139
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,680
a big legacy business, you know,

140
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,839
the Walt Disney Company is a hundred years old, nearly a hundred years old,

141
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:56,040
to have really kept pace with this ever-changing media and entertainment industry,

142
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,300
I think is really testament to that, that, you know,

143
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:02,660
really focusing on how we partner as a team internally and work together.

144
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:08,120
And then that optimism piece is really being prepared and open to what's coming

145
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,680
and what the future is and not being frightened and kind of entrenching yourself in,

146
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,959
well, this is how we've always operated.

147
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,160
This is what we've focused on.

148
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,279
Yeah.

149
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,980
And that openness to look into the future and a willingness as a team member in the business to be a part of that.

150
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,240
And Kylie, if you look back to the Walt Disney legacy,

151
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,860
those, you know,

152
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,519
clearly they're straight at the forefront of your mind as a leader in the business,

153
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:38,539
but you could read back and if you read about Disney innovation and quality and community and storytelling optimism and decency,

154
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,879
as you said, a hundred year old company,

155
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,240
it feels like that language has changed subtly,

156
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,919
but not a lot in a hundred years.

157
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,899
Was the Disney company just ahead of its time in understanding that?

158
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:51,080
Because it feels like a lot of companies didn't share those values for a long period of time.

159
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,779
Well, I think a lot definitely goes back to Walt Disney himself.

160
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,039
I mean, he truly was a visionary in many, many ways.

161
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:03,740
And I think that the leaders that have taken the mantle since him over many years have really understood that legacy

162
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,580
and understood that truly he was ahead of his time.

163
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:08,240
I mean, he was ahead of his time in filmmaking.

164
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,659
He invented a whole lot of different ways of making film that really set the future of the industry.

165
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,539
And he created the whole idea around,

166
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,299
creating franchises really,

167
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:21,840
and the opportunity that once you create a film,

168
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,419
it doesn't necessarily finish there.

169
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:25,620
You know, there's theme park rides,

170
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,179
there's products,

171
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:26,679
et cetera,

172
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:32,360
which was incredibly innovative when you think about how long ago that was and what a big industry that is now.

173
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:39,480
So I do think that that innovation and creativity is really at the foundation of our business and where it came from.

174
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,360
Also the creative risk taking,

175
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,659
you know,

176
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,019
Walt nearly went broke,

177
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,539
I think two or three times.

178
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,059
You know,

179
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:46,200
he really bit the farm.

180
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:46,700
And if you go back to the film,

181
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:46,799
you know,

182
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:46,899
you know,

183
00:09:46,899 --> 00:10:02,320
if you go to the main building at the Disney head office in the U S the main building is held up by all of the dwarfs from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs holding up the roof because it was that film Snow White that saved the business and won an Academy Award.

184
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:13,360
So there's a real understanding and an integration of that history and that leadership foundation that has really endured throughout the hundred years that the business has been around.

185
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,220
And it is such an experience,

186
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:15,559
Kyle.

187
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,539
I had the great pleasure.

188
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:17,899
And I've got to confess here.

189
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,559
Uh,

190
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,779
we were in the United States just before the lockdown happened and we're in Los Angeles.

191
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,940
We've got four kids.

192
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,600
So you've got to go and experience Disneyland and where,

193
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:26,799
you know,

194
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,480
there was lots to do and the U S sport.

195
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,240
And we were so lucky to have that trip looking back,

196
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:32,139
given the world has shut down.

197
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:32,860
And I must admit,

198
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,440
Disneyland was a bit of a go and take that one off for the kids.

199
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,279
And,

200
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:36,519
uh,

201
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:36,759
you know,

202
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,919
a bit like going to the show.

203
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,940
I had one of the best days I've ever had in my life.

204
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,779
I loved it.

205
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,340
I could have,

206
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:44,679
I could have gone back and spent the whole week there.

207
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,679
And there's something intangible.

208
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:50,019
About how friendly the people you smiled the whole time you were there.

209
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:50,899
And,

210
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,220
uh,

211
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:51,440
you know,

212
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:51,779
to me,

213
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:51,980
that,

214
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,120
that experience just was,

215
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,700
was hard to even explain.

216
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:54,919
Kyle,

217
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,179
is it,

218
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:56,440
is that the essence of what,

219
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:56,779
you know,

220
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:56,960
your,

221
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,879
your business does?

222
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,820
customer services is at the core of,

223
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,460
of that experience there.

224
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:08,559
And one of the things that the Walt Disney company really prides itself on is that ability to provide a level of service,

225
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,899
just incomparable.

226
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:11,059
And in fact,

227
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:11,799
even our language.

228
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,940
So we're all cast members.

229
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,860
So the people who work at Disney are called cast members.

230
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:16,299
And anyone who is either,

231
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:16,899
you know,

232
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:20,059
buying something from us or visiting our park is called a guest.

233
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,000
So it's really ingrained into the mindset of the culture of the business and everything that we do.

234
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,860
But another thing about your experience at Disneyland is that the whole idea of the park is that,

235
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,639
that is that it's the great leveler.

236
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,799
So before you step in those doors,

237
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,480
you're the dad and your kids are the kids.

238
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,059
But when you go through that door,

239
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,820
you actually are all of the same level.

240
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,419
You're all,

241
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:46,100
you're all equal and you're enjoying it together as a team rather than necessarily as parent and child.

242
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,539
And I think that's,

243
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,519
that's something that's really important in that experience too.

244
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,240
And you're,

245
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,259
and you hear people who like you,

246
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:51,600
Kylie,

247
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,580
who are part of the Disney family,

248
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:58,539
just talk about it being an incredible environment to work in and all of the language that,

249
00:11:58,659 --> 00:11:58,899
you know,

250
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:04,700
businesses are striving to try and talk now about the inclusiveness and diversity and parental leave.

251
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,019
I understand Disney's famous for its parental leave,

252
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:07,600
you know,

253
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,340
system has had and its own internal leadership development.

254
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:10,840
Can,

255
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,480
can you give us a little bit of an insight into how that works?

256
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:14,159
Well,

257
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,820
I think one of the important things is,

258
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,419
is really,

259
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:18,399
is really valuing your people and,

260
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:28,519
and I think that's something as a company that we've always done and really ensured that there is that openness and understanding of how people and their needs change and evolve.

261
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:35,480
And certainly as you mentioned regarding recognising that that people have children and they have other lives.

262
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:43,059
And I think it is a matter of understanding that your staff member or cast members in our case are the whole people.

263
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:43,779
So rather than,

264
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:45,860
you're not necessarily just looking at them as a staff member,

265
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,360
but your understanding,

266
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,100
understanding the whole person and the importance of that.

267
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,240
And I think some of the strides that the business is making the US in relation to some of the,

268
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,019
the key cultural shifts,

269
00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:03,659
particularly in the US around diversity and inclusion is really demonstrative of that focus of the business and the importance that that has.

270
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,179
Kyle,

271
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:09,279
we've been talking a lot to people on this podcast in what I think is a bit of a shift in leadership.

272
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,480
It's the 20th century of around hierarchy and the boss has the corner office and you know what,

273
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:14,799
you know,

274
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,360
good luck even getting a hello,

275
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,799
from the boss and you know,

276
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:24,700
let alone would they know anything about you or your family and people sit outside and it's very hard to get a voice in your own environment.

277
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,379
I feel like you guys have been well and truly down that path.

278
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:31,480
I heard your language before collaborations at the key,

279
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,399
humility's at the key.

280
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,860
Have you stayed away from environment?

281
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:42,080
Can you see that a lot of environments were run with hierarchy and is that the point of difference that you try and live?

282
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:42,879
Yeah,

283
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:43,340
absolutely.

284
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:43,559
I mean,

285
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,740
I certainly over my career,

286
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,240
I have worked in all different versions.

287
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,000
Of structures in the context of that.

288
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:50,379
But one of the things that,

289
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:50,519
you know,

290
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,519
as I mentioned before,

291
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,299
I do think that that collaboration component is really important.

292
00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:58,720
And I've worked in in businesses before where as a leader,

293
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,720
I have been pitched against someone else and there's been a real competitive combative mindset that's been created.

294
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:07,059
And while that might deliver in the short term,

295
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,240
I don't think that delivers in the long long term.

296
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,120
I think what's much more important is you've got a whole lot of people working together and heading in the one direction.

297
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:15,940
And I,

298
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,440
I often say to the team,

299
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:17,659
you know,

300
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:19,320
the sum is greater than the parts.

301
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,159
And so anything that you can do that can help enhance and create that collaboration,

302
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,200
bring people together,

303
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,139
breaking down walls,

304
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,399
breaking down silos,

305
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:37,899
ensuring that there is that visibility and not necessarily the hierarchy that you mentioned that you've got people from all levels of the team working together on different projects.

306
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:39,159
And I think that's really important.

307
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:45,820
We have a structure around in our marketing group because there are so many different facets to our business that we need to try to connect the dots.

308
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:51,159
And create that consistency of messaging market across many different areas.

309
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,299
So we have created these groups called pods.

310
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:57,759
And so there's small groups of people that are come that come from each different part of the business.

311
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,259
And they,

312
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:01,659
they joined together in one group and work on projects together,

313
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:05,980
which happened to work incredibly well during a COVID lockdown period because,

314
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,100
you know,

315
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,139
you had these small groups of people who were meeting regularly and were really able to think outside the box.

316
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:15,340
And there was lots of different vision and different ideas and different thoughts coming together.

317
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,759
And it really ensured that that we really flourished during that time.

318
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:19,539
So grabbing people,

319
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:21,779
not necessarily from the same division,

320
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:26,100
but getting that collaborative and almost structurally forcing that to happen.

321
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,419
Is that was that the idea?

322
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:27,879
And you know,

323
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:29,000
the groups would get together.

324
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,519
How were they facilitated?

325
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:30,940
What was,

326
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,299
was it,

327
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:35,379
was it run by a leader or a specific part of the business?

328
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:36,340
Well,

329
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,100
generally there would be someone who would be a lead in that group.

330
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,539
They wouldn't necessarily be a leader or the most senior person either,

331
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:45,240
but just making sure that there was someone who,

332
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,860
who was connecting the dots and,

333
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,480
and I guess ensuring that,

334
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,740
that they were staying on task and focus.

335
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:54,940
But ultimately it was the group that was working closely together on the outcome.

336
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,980
But the important thing there is it can't be a massive group.

337
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:03,580
It has to be a nice tight team where everybody has a voice and it's easy to collaborate and bring things to fruition.

338
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:04,200
Well,

339
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,360
we've been doing something similar in a business that I'm involved in and passionate about,

340
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,240
and we've been grabbing,

341
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:10,480
you know,

342
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,059
these sort of leaders in sport who come from different areas and we've been able to pull them together

343
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:15,200
through.

344
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,419
COVID in the last period of time.

345
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:19,240
So people like Eddie Jones,

346
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,820
who's coaching the rugby team of England and Ange Postakoglu who's in Japan and Justin Lange has been involved and you know,

347
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,600
different areas,

348
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,620
but to see these guys come out of their environments with people who are experiencing,

349
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:30,840
you know,

350
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,360
very similar challenges,

351
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,080
albeit in different sports and the amazing amount of,

352
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:35,820
I suppose,

353
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:41,360
sharing of information and collaboration and the joy that those guys have got out of it has been really rewarding.

354
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,019
It sounds very similar to what you guys are doing at Disney.

355
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:44,840
Absolutely.

356
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,179
And I think,

357
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,899
the key to that too is that you're bringing people with different experiences.

358
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:51,039
So there's a commonality across what you're discussing,

359
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,700
but they're coming at it through different lenses.

360
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,860
And I think that's something really important in business too.

361
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:01,340
And something that I really strive to do is to make sure I'm surrounding myself with people with different views and different perspectives.

362
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:06,740
It's really easy to get into that groove of just surrounding yourself with people who all think the same way as you.

363
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,579
It makes it really easy,

364
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,640
but it doesn't bring the best outcome.

365
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,980
And so I think that's something really important as well.

366
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:13,640
Collie,

367
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,599
on this podcast,

368
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,740
I was talking to Sally Capp,

369
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,700
the Lord Mayor of Melbourne,

370
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:21,359
and she's had a lot of firsts like you in her life as a leader,

371
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:34,039
but going on to do extraordinary things and be elected as Lord Mayor of Melbourne and the first agent general to Victoria based in London and a whole series of things along the lines of your history.

372
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:36,500
But she spoke about as a 22 year old in a law firm,

373
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,539
she was invited in by a senior partner to a meeting and she'd done her research.

374
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:42,799
She's incredibly diligent,

375
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,759
Sally,

376
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:44,359
and,

377
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:50,420
she spoke up spoke to the client at that stage and because she knew the answer and she knew what to pass on.

378
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,440
She got in the lift and the senior partner turned to her a mail and said,

379
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,299
do not ever,

380
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:57,160
ever speak again in one of my meetings.

381
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,900
And you could see her still,

382
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,460
you know,

383
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,240
uh,

384
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,539
you know,

385
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:01,799
red with the frustrate.

386
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:02,000
Yeah.

387
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,539
The frustrate.

388
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,299
Have you had to deal with any of that along the way?

389
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:08,000
Has there been people tried to try and keep you,

390
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:08,779
you know,

391
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:09,319
in your box,

392
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:09,859
so to speak?

393
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:10,640
Wow.

394
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,740
I feel really confronted on behalf of Sally.

395
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,880
That would have been.

396
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,220
So did I.

397
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,539
Absolutely horrible experience.

398
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:16,619
Yeah.

399
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,079
But to be honest,

400
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,039
I actually haven't.

401
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,819
Um,

402
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,960
I have had some pretty strong mentors in my career who did the opposite,

403
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,200
actually,

404
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,279
who gave me a voice.

405
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:31,140
And I remember one in particular when I was working in the U S and,

406
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,859
um,

407
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,660
the guy who,

408
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,920
who headed up all of marketing and I was overseeing advertising and I was,

409
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:36,539
you know,

410
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:36,839
this,

411
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:39,960
this Australian girl who'd just come over and I was sitting around the table,

412
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,039
um,

413
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,539
with all of my new peers.

414
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:44,220
And I remember the ad agent,

415
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:44,720
she being in there,

416
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,200
they'd flown in from,

417
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,220
um,

418
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:51,339
from another state and from Chicago and we're all sitting,

419
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,700
it was a big intense meeting and they did their pitch.

420
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,740
And the very first thing he did was he turned to me and said,

421
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,000
Kylie,

422
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,819
what do you think?

423
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,539
And I think I'd been in the States for five minutes and I think I'd been in

424
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:06,359
the company for three and I answered and he obviously liked my answer.

425
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,960
Cause he asked me that first,

426
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,740
every single time,

427
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,539
but just that,

428
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,099
that encouragement that that guy,

429
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:11,339
I mean,

430
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:12,859
apart from the initial heart,

431
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,240
you know,

432
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,119
horror and shock.

433
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,559
I think he was asking me that in that room of people,

434
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,579
um,

435
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:21,200
just the encouragement that that gave to me and the confidence it gave.

436
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,400
So it's something that I've always thought about and tried to make sure that

437
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,640
I do for,

438
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:28,779
for people who are up and coming within the business as well.

439
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,000
Not,

440
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:30,279
not to put them on the spot,

441
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,359
but more to give them the opportunity to have a voice.

442
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:32,819
Yeah.

443
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:33,859
That language of empowering,

444
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,240
isn't it?

445
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:34,480
How,

446
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:34,740
how,

447
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:36,519
how important that was for you.

448
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:39,859
And you can understand that you then pass that on to others,

449
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,180
isn't it?

450
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,839
It's such a powerful model.

451
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,980
You mentioned mentors.

452
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:43,440
Is there,

453
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,059
is,

454
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:44,339
any,

455
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,339
how important a mentor has been in your life?

456
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:50,099
And can you maybe share with us some of those people who've had a big impact on you?

457
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,079
I think,

458
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:51,319
uh,

459
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:53,680
anyone that believes in you on your journey,

460
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,420
um,

461
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,259
you know,

462
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:58,900
really helps to contribute to your evolution as a leader.

463
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,700
And I think that when you feel that there is someone who really has your back and,

464
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:09,259
and really values you and what you bring to the table and can really encourage you to lean into that,

465
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:09,740
you know,

466
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,299
certainly that,

467
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:10,859
that,

468
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,180
um,

469
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,460
that leader in the States that I mentioned,

470
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:13,599
there are a couple of those,

471
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:14,440
Peter Gordon,

472
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:14,839
of course,

473
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,359
has been another one for me on the,

474
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:19,359
on the seven year journey at the Western Bulldogs,

475
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:19,839
uh,

476
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,519
working with him and,

477
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:21,759
you know,

478
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,960
really learning about how he converts his passion,

479
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,960
uh,

480
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,519
to value for the club has been,

481
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,559
has been really important.

482
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:32,359
So there's been lots of people on my journey who have,

483
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,920
have provided me,

484
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,559
you know,

485
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:34,960
where they get,

486
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,319
I guess,

487
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:39,319
a little insight into how I'd like to operate and how I would like to be a leader.

488
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:42,200
There's also been plenty who have taught me what not to do.

489
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,480
And I do think like Sally,

490
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,960
he's first manager.

491
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,480
I think that there are people that you can learn from.

492
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,799
You can learn as much from those that you think I would never,

493
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,039
ever treat people like that,

494
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,000
or I would never want to behave that way.

495
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,960
And I think that that's something that I think sometimes you can forget that even from an awful,

496
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,079
awful experience,

497
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,079
um,

498
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,279
within your career,

499
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:07,519
you can actually draw some really strong learnings from those and turn them into a positive by ensuring that you either do the counter of that,

500
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,359
or that you just never,

501
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,279
ever do that yourself.

502
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,279
It might be a good time to,

503
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:13,440
to jump into our shared passion for,

504
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:13,880
for the red,

505
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,559
white and blue and the Bulldogs.

506
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,400
And you mentioned Peter Gordon,

507
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,440
who's been the legendary president over a few decades,

508
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,160
really in two stints and had an extraordinary legacy at the Western Bulldogs.

509
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:32,640
And to the point where you've taken over from him and succeeded as his vice president into the president of the Bulldogs.

510
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,599
But your first encounter with Peter was back in 1989.

511
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,400
The Bulldogs were about to go out of existence.

512
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,079
Can you pick up the story there and explain what you were doing on that day?

513
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,680
Yeah,

514
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,359
it was the Save the Bulldogs rally.

515
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,640
At the Witten Oval.

516
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,000
And it was,

517
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,599
I was in year 12 and it was actually the,

518
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,079
my year 12 study week.

519
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,920
And I had said to my dad,

520
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,039
oh,

521
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:51,200
look,

522
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,119
I really want to go.

523
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,519
And he said,

524
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:52,599
well,

525
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,559
no way you've got to stay home and study.

526
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:54,759
And I said,

527
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:54,880
well,

528
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,640
what if I take my,

529
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,119
my homework with me?

530
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,319
So I did.

531
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,440
And I sat in the gravel behind the goals,

532
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:00,720
uh,

533
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,920
with my homework on my knee.

534
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,119
Although I don't think I did any,

535
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,759
any of that homework that day,

536
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:05,480
but you know,

537
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,039
Peter was up there on the podium,

538
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,359
you know,

539
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:11,559
flying the flag for our club and really ensuring our,

540
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:12,359
our continued exist.

541
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:12,880
And,

542
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,960
so that was a really important pivotal moment to me and to

543
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,559
my life.

544
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:17,759
And,

545
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:17,960
you know,

546
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,680
the club was very meaningful to me as it still is.

547
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,559
It it's really a huge part of my family history and

548
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,279
where my family has come from and my relationship with my

549
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:31,279
dad and my sister and my connection to my grandparents.

550
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:32,400
So it is,

551
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:32,799
there's,

552
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,680
it was incredibly important to me.

553
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:34,839
And,

554
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:35,359
and as you know,

555
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,839
DAS often football is way more than football.

556
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,039
It's way more than a game.

557
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,359
And so it was such an important pivotal moment for,

558
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:42,839
for me.

559
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,400
And for Peter and all of those who worked with him to be

560
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,039
successful and save the club was,

561
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,640
was really amazing.

562
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,240
So then,

563
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,680
you know,

564
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,000
30 plus years later for me to be succeeding him as the

565
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,640
president is,

566
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,440
is a very surreal experience.

567
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,000
That's for sure.

568
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:57,279
It's,

569
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,279
it's a magical story,

570
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:58,640
Kylie,

571
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:58,839
and,

572
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:01,279
and a bit of context for those that perhaps listen,

573
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,480
they don't understand AFL.

574
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,880
It's the inner west of Melbourne,

575
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,920
10,000 people turn up to that rally.

576
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,359
The AFL have given a deadline.

577
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,160
You're insolvent.

578
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,759
We're either going to merge you out of existence or,

579
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:12,240
or out of existence completely.

580
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,720
And,

581
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,039
and I think it was $1.6 million was raised in three

582
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:16,680
days from,

583
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,839
from the most working class of areas to,

584
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:20,039
to,

585
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,400
to find that and to,

586
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:21,640
you know,

587
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,039
effectively against all odds save the club.

588
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:24,599
And as you said,

589
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,000
you know,

590
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,599
I can hear the passion coming out in all your life,

591
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:28,559
but you know,

592
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,599
I did read that it was,

593
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:32,000
you used to stand on a wooden box that your grandfather

594
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,079
had built and you were there at the footy all the

595
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:34,480
time with,

596
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,160
with your sister.

597
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,119
So that,

598
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,039
that is pure passion,

599
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:37,400
isn't it?

600
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:37,680
That's,

601
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,319
that's taken place over a long period of time.

602
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:39,839
Yeah,

603
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:40,359
absolutely.

604
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:42,519
It truly is at my heart and you're that wooden box,

605
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:44,759
my grandfather was a French polisher.

606
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:45,279
So he,

607
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,839
he made me a little box so that I could stand

608
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:48,279
up and say,

609
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:48,839
cause as you know,

610
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:49,519
in those days,

611
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:51,559
you didn't necessarily get a seat and you're still on the

612
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:51,880
wing.

613
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,319
And,

614
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:52,839
and,

615
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:53,039
you know,

616
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,279
it was such an amazing time too,

617
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,720
because the people that stood around you,

618
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,519
we all stood in the same place and you grew up

619
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:00,240
together and you might not have even known each other's

620
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,680
names,

621
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,240
but you know,

622
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,400
you,

623
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,200
you spent a decade standing next to each other at

624
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,599
the footy.

625
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,759
So it was just a very special part of my life

626
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:07,559
and it remains so.

627
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,400
Yeah.

628
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:08,759
Amazing.

629
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:09,160
Isn't it?

630
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,319
I think my own family history as well.

631
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:11,960
My grandmother,

632
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,720
who lived to 95 and she saw every game my dad

633
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,079
played and every game that I played and it's,

634
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:17,279
it's,

635
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:17,759
it's in you,

636
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:18,039
isn't it?

637
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:18,480
You can't,

638
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,240
uh,

639
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,119
you can't hide the,

640
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:20,279
uh,

641
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:20,720
the history.

642
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,200
It's quite,

643
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,519
uh,

644
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:22,160
quite extraordinary.

645
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,799
I just,

646
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,079
Kyle,

647
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:25,559
you seem to me to be this incredibly capable person.

648
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,160
Uh,

649
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,319
I can't imagine you ever having,

650
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:28,720
you know,

651
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,839
a mistake or,

652
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:30,359
uh,

653
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:30,640
is there,

654
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,480
is there something that you look back and think I

655
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:32,720
learned,

656
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,039
I learned a little bit from,

657
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,519
from that mistake along the journey.

658
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,680
I make many mistakes like,

659
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,480
like everyone,

660
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,720
but I think one of the most important things is

661
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,799
that learning from them.

662
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:43,680
And,

663
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:44,839
you know,

664
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:47,480
I do frequently reflect on decisions that I've made.

665
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,400
And even if they haven't been disastrous,

666
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:50,480
disastrous,

667
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,920
I might kind of look back and say,

668
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,119
would I have done that differently?

669
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,799
Is there something that I could do better?

670
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,720
But the times where things have gone wrong have

671
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,799
generally been when I have not trusted my gut.

672
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,599
So when in my heart,

673
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,400
I know this isn't the right decision,

674
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,279
I can feel it in my bones,

675
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,720
but for a variety of reasons,

676
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,640
I'm going to hire this person,

677
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,680
or I'm going to agree,

678
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,440
to this deal.

679
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,440
And without fail,

680
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
whenever I have gone against that instinct,

681
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,920
it has always gone wrong.

682
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,759
So that's a big lesson for me.

683
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:20,599
Always trust my gut,

684
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:21,160
no matter what.

685
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:21,640
Yeah.

686
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:21,839
It's a,

687
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:22,960
it's an amazing thing there,

688
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,839
isn't it Kylie?

689
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:25,920
And I'd like to maybe ask you a little bit more

690
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,240
about that because it's,

691
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,519
it is so true,

692
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:28,880
isn't it?

693
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,240
That powerful instinct to think this doesn't feel right,

694
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,720
but our mind overrides that sometimes for,

695
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,880
for a variety of reasons.

696
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:38,000
Does that happen less for you now when you really

697
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,240
instinctively know that something is right?

698
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,680
Obviously,

699
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:40,960
you know,

700
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,079
you,

701
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:41,200
you,

702
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,640
you use the word,

703
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,599
words of collaboration,

704
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:45,240
but do you find you just now really dial into that

705
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,200
more than you did in the past?

706
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:46,559
Yeah,

707
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:46,880
definitely.

708
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,960
And I think that comes with experience and trusting

709
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,559
yourself too.

710
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:50,160
I think,

711
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,960
I think the,

712
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:51,559
you know,

713
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:54,720
the times where your gut instincts have really delivered

714
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,519
for you.

715
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,559
And then the times where you haven't trusted them and,

716
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:58,759
you know,

717
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,759
the cleaning up of that is usually quite extensive.

718
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:01,920
You know,

719
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,440
you hire someone because on paper they look like the

720
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,960
right person and you really desperately need to fill

721
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,640
this role.

722
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,160
And it's been so hard to find someone,

723
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,599
but within the interview,

724
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,559
you just don't click.

725
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,160
There's something that just doesn't feel right.

726
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,200
And then you go ahead and hire that person and then

727
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,759
it's a disaster and it's an enormous amount of cleaning

728
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:21,200
up and time it takes to rectify that.

729
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,839
So I think the more times you do that,

730
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:25,559
the more scared away you are from that because you

731
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,240
recognize that you're going to set yourself up for a

732
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,039
tough journey.

733
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,759
So I do think that,

734
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:32,279
you know,

735
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,799
one of the key parts of leadership is,

736
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,160
is really learning to trust yourself,

737
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,440
to lean into your own values and recognize the importance

738
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,119
of those and also really being authentic in every way.

739
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:49,000
And I think that helps you to avoid some of those

740
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,759
issues and challenges and mistakes,

741
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:54,119
because if you're being truly authentic and you're really dialed in

742
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,279
to what's important,

743
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,799
I think you're less likely to go off task.

744
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:08,470
I want to ask you about the,

745
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:09,069
you know,

746
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:10,109
the balance of life.

747
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:10,710
I think to me,

748
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,150
something I think about every day,

749
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,390
you know,

750
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,430
as a father of four and to me,

751
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,549
I always think about it,

752
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:18,190
about not wanting to miss the point of life.

753
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:18,430
You want to,

754
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,230
you want to achieve and,

755
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:22,029
and you've got these things that motivate you from a passion

756
00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:22,670
point of view.

757
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:23,230
But you know,

758
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:23,549
for me,

759
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:25,230
if I get the family balance part wrong,

760
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,589
then it's not worth anything at all.

761
00:27:27,589 --> 00:27:30,750
And it's a constant battle to try and achieve all that.

762
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:32,589
You've got serious roles and,

763
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:34,549
and incredible leadership positions,

764
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:36,269
but you're also a mother of two.

765
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:37,230
How do you manage that?

766
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,230
I think the passion part is,

767
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:40,309
is really important too.

768
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:43,029
And I think one of the things that I'm really lucky in

769
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:45,829
my business is that it's interesting to my children.

770
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:47,829
And I mentioned,

771
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:47,950
you know,

772
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,390
my son was,

773
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,430
was one when I started at Disney and he's 18 now.

774
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,029
And I tease him that,

775
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:53,269
you know,

776
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:55,470
every time I thought that perhaps he might be growing out of our

777
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:55,910
content,

778
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,829
we acquire another studio.

779
00:27:57,829 --> 00:28:00,910
So whether it be Marvel or Star Wars or Fox,

780
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:02,670
but I think one of the things that,

781
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,309
that has been really helpful to me is that I've been able

782
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,269
to take them on the journey with me.

783
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,589
And I do remember a time when my son was,

784
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,349
was quite little.

785
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:13,230
And at the time I was running publishing for the region,

786
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:13,470
I,

787
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:14,230
and I was going to,

788
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:14,549
I don't know,

789
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:16,269
Indonesia or somewhere the next day,

790
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,349
I remember I was tucking him into bed and I said,

791
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:18,470
oh,

792
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:18,829
you know,

793
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:19,869
I won't be here in the morning.

794
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:21,910
So I might have to fly out.

795
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,390
And,

796
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:22,750
and he said,

797
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:22,829
oh,

798
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:24,029
I wish you didn't have to go.

799
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:24,990
And I said,

800
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:25,069
oh,

801
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:25,230
look,

802
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,109
I wish I didn't have to go either,

803
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:28,349
but if I don't go,

804
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:29,470
then I don't work for Disney.

805
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:30,029
And he said,

806
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:30,349
see you,

807
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:30,710
mom,

808
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,029
there's more than happy for me to go.

809
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:34,190
Cause me,

810
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,150
me working for Disney was more important than me missing the next

811
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:37,869
few days.

812
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,230
So I think that that's been,

813
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:42,029
that's been an important part of it for me.

814
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:43,470
But I think also recognizing,

815
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:43,589
you know,

816
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:47,789
the balance piece that you mentioned is ensuring that I'm recognizing my

817
00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:48,269
whole self,

818
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:48,630
as well.

819
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,029
I know I talked earlier about the importance of recognizing the whole

820
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,430
self of your staff,

821
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,829
but recognizing that all of these areas of my life are important to

822
00:28:55,829 --> 00:28:56,309
me.

823
00:28:56,309 --> 00:29:00,069
And I do think that career decisions that I've made have,

824
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:01,430
have been based on that as well.

825
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:01,630
You know,

826
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,109
I wouldn't,

827
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:06,309
I wouldn't take a role that had me overseas six months of the

828
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:07,150
year.

829
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:11,029
I moved back to Australia because I wanted my kids to grow up

830
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:11,829
around their family,

831
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:16,150
even though I had a really great career that was developing in the

832
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,509
state.

833
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:17,309
So I think there are,

834
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:18,150
I don't want to use,

835
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,549
use the word sacrifice because I don't think,

836
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,190
think they are,

837
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,269
but I think that there's definitely decisions that I've made to ensure

838
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:25,630
that I can live the life that I want to live and raise

839
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,910
my children the way I want to raise them.

840
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:27,470
Yeah.

841
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,950
The choices aren't they that make you successful in every part of

842
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,509
your life or,

843
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:31,869
or,

844
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:32,549
or attempt to,

845
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:32,750
is,

846
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,950
is there anything I always think of that the daily habits of

847
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,950
successful people are interesting?

848
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,230
Is there,

849
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,990
are there routines that set you up every day to,

850
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,710
to achieve that?

851
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,390
Well,

852
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:42,509
I'm,

853
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:43,670
I'm a pretty basic person.

854
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,910
I get up and I walk my dog,

855
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,670
the most important thing.

856
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:47,390
But,

857
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:47,710
um,

858
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,869
but it's also where I get my bit of headspace.

859
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:51,789
I think that's an important part for me to kick off the

860
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:52,230
day.

861
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:52,990
Um,

862
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,750
I'll often listen to a podcast or an audio book or,

863
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:55,910
you know,

864
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,470
just to get that bit of a,

865
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,150
a break from,

866
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:00,069
um,

867
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:00,309
you know,

868
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:01,950
the grind of the day and,

869
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,990
and of life and of school lunches and the like,

870
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,349
and,

871
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:04,869
and then,

872
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:06,630
and then also all of the things that you need to be

873
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,589
wrapping your head around,

874
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:08,430
uh,

875
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,069
at work.

876
00:30:09,069 --> 00:30:10,950
So I think that's something that's really important for me,

877
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,029
just that bit of headspace,

878
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:15,589
that opportunity to think about or listen to something else.

879
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,109
Um,

880
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:16,390
can you,

881
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,670
I've got on my list to ask you about,

882
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,349
uh,

883
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:19,509
the world of social media.

884
00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:20,789
It's something we're all,

885
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:21,549
uh,

886
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:22,609
whether we like it or not,

887
00:30:22,609 --> 00:30:23,029
I suppose,

888
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:23,410
you know,

889
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,769
attached to our phones from,

890
00:30:24,869 --> 00:30:25,029
from,

891
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,369
from a business point of view.

892
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:28,309
And then from a parenting point of view,

893
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:29,630
how do you manage it?

894
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:29,910
What's,

895
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,289
what's your strategies on that front?

896
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:32,269
Well,

897
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:32,710
business,

898
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:36,190
it's certainly an important way to connect with and engage

899
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,710
with our audiences.

900
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:42,930
And so we have multiple social media platform engagements

901
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,730
across all of our different brands.

902
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,390
So it's something that,

903
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:46,890
you know,

904
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:47,509
I think that,

905
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,349
is central to the way in which we operate today,

906
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,410
but you know,

907
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,450
you certainly have to be careful and cautious,

908
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:53,710
you know,

909
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,470
obviously in social media,

910
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,549
there's supposed to be an age level.

911
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:00,269
We know that then they're not necessarily is that the young kids

912
00:31:00,269 --> 00:31:01,029
are on there as well.

913
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:02,670
So given what our brands represent,

914
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,750
we need to be really careful of that.

915
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:07,549
So moderating that space is something that we really lean into

916
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:08,390
and ensure that,

917
00:31:08,589 --> 00:31:10,789
that we're really watching our feeds.

918
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:11,769
It's also a great way though,

919
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:16,130
to really temperature check how audiences are feeling about our content.

920
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:16,589
And,

921
00:31:16,589 --> 00:31:17,670
and it's a great way,

922
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,190
to uncover if there are any issues or challenges.

923
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,829
So there can be some positive elements to it as well,

924
00:31:22,829 --> 00:31:23,069
but,

925
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:25,670
but definitely protecting our audiences is really important.

926
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,470
From a kid's perspective,

927
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:27,970
it's,

928
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,269
it is really tricky because it's,

929
00:31:30,269 --> 00:31:31,390
it's quite difficult.

930
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,849
I think to block kids once they're of a certain age,

931
00:31:33,849 --> 00:31:35,430
and my daughter is 15,

932
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:39,569
my son is 18 and driving and at uni.

933
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:42,329
So I've lost all control there in every aspect.

934
00:31:43,049 --> 00:31:43,829
That's for sure.

935
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:46,650
So you just have to hope that you've laid some pretty strong foundations

936
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,670
there and cross your fingers.

937
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,589
And I hope for the best.

938
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,430
But I do think that,

939
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:55,289
that as much as anything talking about it is really important,

940
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:57,950
helping your kids understand,

941
00:31:59,369 --> 00:31:59,609
you know,

942
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:01,569
what the reality is of social media,

943
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,569
you know,

944
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:03,150
the,

945
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:03,509
the,

946
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:05,369
the polished view that they're getting,

947
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:06,450
you know,

948
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:06,750
the,

949
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:10,650
the very specific stories that people are telling that is not necessarily

950
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,829
the full story,

951
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:12,509
you know,

952
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:12,910
talk to them,

953
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:13,309
of course,

954
00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:16,190
about trolls and trolling and who these people are and,

955
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,430
and something that,

956
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,970
that you know,

957
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,190
if I,

958
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:22,390
if I think about people who comment in social media and,

959
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:22,930
and us,

960
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:23,069
you know,

961
00:32:23,069 --> 00:32:25,170
I know that you would face this and,

962
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,109
and I have had some on a much smaller scale,

963
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:30,430
but I've certainly had some criticism in social media myself,

964
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:35,970
but someone actually told me once that if you think about everyone who's

965
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:36,569
reading,

966
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:38,170
reading the social media,

967
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:43,970
10% don't care at all and 10% care a lot and everyone else is

968
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:44,789
pretty neutral.

969
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,269
So I think if you can really understand that,

970
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:47,849
you know,

971
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:50,329
this is not the whole world that's saying this,

972
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:53,630
it's a really tiny percentage and you've got to put it in context.

973
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,369
I think with my kids,

974
00:32:54,369 --> 00:32:55,529
helping them understand that,

975
00:32:55,529 --> 00:32:57,250
helping them understand that the,

976
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:02,009
what is being written and said and presented is not necessarily the full

977
00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:05,210
truth and certainly not the full opinion of everyone else.

978
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:05,930
Yeah.

979
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,230
It's a great way to look at it,

980
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:07,569
isn't it?

981
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:07,910
I mean,

982
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:08,990
it feels so personal,

983
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:09,630
doesn't it for,

984
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:09,829
you know,

985
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:10,930
and for,

986
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,529
for young kids in particular,

987
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:13,490
it's a lot to deal with,

988
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:13,809
isn't it?

989
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:15,269
That direct ability to,

990
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:15,650
um,

991
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,430
to get that,

992
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:16,869
um,

993
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:17,089
you know,

994
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:17,630
not negative,

995
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:17,930
you know,

996
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:18,589
not positive,

997
00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:18,829
uh,

998
00:33:18,829 --> 00:33:20,329
feedback on a regular basis.

999
00:33:20,329 --> 00:33:21,170
There was a,

1000
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:21,529
uh,

1001
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:23,930
a documentary I think came out in lockdown last year,

1002
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:24,849
the social network,

1003
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:25,250
and we,

1004
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:25,970
uh,

1005
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,069
forced the kids to sit down and have a look at it.

1006
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:29,210
And it was a really great,

1007
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:29,990
um,

1008
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,349
experience.

1009
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:31,130
They rolled their eyes.

1010
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,509
This is going to be boring,

1011
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:34,430
but they were really engaged.

1012
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:34,710
You know,

1013
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,529
I didn't understand,

1014
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:39,910
I didn't understand when I gave over my personal details that that was being

1015
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,009
collected for data.

1016
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:42,650
And I didn't quite understand that,

1017
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:43,309
you know,

1018
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:45,349
food was being tailored then to,

1019
00:33:45,349 --> 00:33:45,609
to,

1020
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:46,670
to my likes adding,

1021
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:46,849
you know,

1022
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:47,069
they,

1023
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:47,910
it was,

1024
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:48,309
uh,

1025
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:49,509
an interesting conversation.

1026
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:50,250
It's as you said,

1027
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:50,670
it's,

1028
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,369
I love the fact how quickly they can connect on.

1029
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:54,250
I remember as a kid,

1030
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:54,450
you know,

1031
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,509
you sound so archaic,

1032
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:57,990
don't you have to try and ring and catch up with someone.

1033
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:01,069
The home phone was engaged or the amount of times you went to meet

1034
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:03,490
someone and you miss them because they're on the other side of the

1035
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:03,869
wall,

1036
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:05,829
but they can connect so well,

1037
00:34:05,829 --> 00:34:06,150
but,

1038
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:06,450
uh,

1039
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,490
trying to manage it is,

1040
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:07,829
is a,

1041
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:08,750
is an ongoing challenge,

1042
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:08,969
isn't it?

1043
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:09,449
Absolutely.

1044
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:09,590
No,

1045
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,230
that's so true.

1046
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,869
It certainly is,

1047
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:14,309
is a very different environment for our kids than it was back in

1048
00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:14,610
our day,

1049
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:14,909
Darce.

1050
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:15,449
That's for sure.

1051
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,050
Kylie,

1052
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,610
there'd be a lot of people listening to this and hearing,

1053
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:18,809
you know,

1054
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:19,389
Kylie Watson,

1055
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,429
Wheeler and thinking that's,

1056
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,670
that's an unattainable level for me.

1057
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:22,849
What,

1058
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:25,550
what advice would you give someone who's got aspirations to,

1059
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,670
to end up in leadership roles like you are?

1060
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:29,130
I think,

1061
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:29,969
as I've mentioned,

1062
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:30,550
you know,

1063
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,889
following your passions is the most important thing because you're

1064
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:36,809
going to have the most credibility and the most likelihood of

1065
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:38,170
success and advancement.

1066
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,889
If it's something that you really care about and you're really

1067
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:41,389
engaged in,

1068
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:43,090
because I do think that all of the things that you need to

1069
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,809
do to be able to progress in that way,

1070
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:46,010
you need to care about,

1071
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,889
about what you're working on and what's central to your

1072
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:49,730
career,

1073
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:50,869
because as a result of that,

1074
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:53,510
then you're going to be inquisitive and curious,

1075
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:56,269
and you're going to seek out what the opportunities and the

1076
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:57,289
options are.

1077
00:34:57,849 --> 00:34:58,550
And so,

1078
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:58,909
you know,

1079
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:01,969
then I think also you're more likely to take educated risks

1080
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:04,909
and risks that then will return something that's bigger and

1081
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:06,829
out outside the box and something different.

1082
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:08,090
And the other thing too,

1083
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:08,409
I think,

1084
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:08,570
you know,

1085
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:12,469
you're really going to create the opportunity to take people

1086
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:14,530
along a journey with you.

1087
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,010
Cause I think that that's one of the important,

1088
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,650
the things about leadership and you don't have to be a

1089
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,750
lead in a leadership position to be a leader.

1090
00:35:20,769 --> 00:35:22,070
And I think that's really important.

1091
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:28,369
And I think when I first realized that I probably had leadership

1092
00:35:28,489 --> 00:35:32,090
opportunity was when I was in the States and I had

1093
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,510
received this random project due to a whole lot of strange

1094
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,150
things that happened in the business hallmark was,

1095
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,429
was sponsoring the salt lake winter Olympics.

1096
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,329
And it was the first time that they had ever sponsored

1097
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:44,090
anything like that.

1098
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:45,889
And there was some movement.

1099
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:46,369
And at the top,

1100
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:48,449
some people left and it was this hot potato.

1101
00:35:48,469 --> 00:35:49,610
No one wanted to touch it.

1102
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:53,750
They'd made this massive financial commitment.

1103
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:55,849
It wasn't something that anybody really understood who was left in

1104
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:56,809
the business understood.

1105
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,969
And so I was handed this hot potato.

1106
00:35:59,150 --> 00:35:59,750
And so I thought,

1107
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,349
okay, well,

1108
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:01,690
I've got to make the most of this.

1109
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:05,309
And I pulled together a team of my peers and,

1110
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:05,630
you know,

1111
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,210
between us,

1112
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,670
we divvied up all of the different areas.

1113
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,869
And it was quite an extensive sponsorship because it was the

1114
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:10,730
flowers in the,

1115
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:13,030
there was a retail component.

1116
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,889
There was a store at the village where all of the,

1117
00:36:15,889 --> 00:36:16,650
the athletes lived.

1118
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,170
There were multiple facets to it.

1119
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,769
And so I split it up between my peers and we sat down

1120
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:23,389
and we worked this out together and we absolutely worked our

1121
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,969
guts out for the whole period of the Olympics.

1122
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,909
And it was seen as a massive,

1123
00:36:27,949 --> 00:36:29,090
amazing success.

1124
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:32,090
So for something that was a hot potato before it was

1125
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,190
actually something that then was held up as a,

1126
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:37,730
as a really strong demonstration of the power of the brand

1127
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,630
within,

1128
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,590
within the States.

1129
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:43,269
And it was really through that collaboration of my team.

1130
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:45,329
And for all of these people that I managed to,

1131
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:46,030
uh,

1132
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,710
convinced to come and work with me on this project that we

1133
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,210
achieved that I wasn't their boss.

1134
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:50,670
Um,

1135
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,329
in some instances,

1136
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:52,710
I was more junior than some of them,

1137
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,329
but I think that that demonstrated to me that I can take

1138
00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:56,130
people on a journey.

1139
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,510
And I think that that's ultimately what led me to the career

1140
00:36:59,510 --> 00:36:59,949
I've had.

1141
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:00,510
Uh,

1142
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,230
it's a great story,

1143
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:01,550
Kyle.

1144
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,230
And I love the,

1145
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:02,570
you know,

1146
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,369
all of what you said,

1147
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,250
but one of it in particular,

1148
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:06,130
you don't have to have a title to,

1149
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:06,929
to be a leader.

1150
00:37:06,929 --> 00:37:07,230
And,

1151
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:07,590
and,

1152
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:07,949
um,

1153
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:08,150
you know,

1154
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,190
I'm really passionate about that.

1155
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:12,570
You can impact people positively without a title.

1156
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,210
Can't you just today by your actions and by your,

1157
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,949
your interactions and engagements,

1158
00:37:16,949 --> 00:37:17,429
uh,

1159
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:18,010
you know,

1160
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,210
you sum that up beautifully.

1161
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,710
There's a series of questions,

1162
00:37:20,889 --> 00:37:21,050
Kylie,

1163
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,329
that I've been keen to ask different people from,

1164
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:24,550
uh,

1165
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,289
different leadership backgrounds around,

1166
00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:26,809
you know,

1167
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:29,630
this thought that there are specific dimensions of what makes a

1168
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,010
great leader.

1169
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:30,230
So,

1170
00:37:30,409 --> 00:37:30,670
um,

1171
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:32,349
I might start with self-leadership.

1172
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:32,550
What,

1173
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,789
what does that term mean to you?

1174
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:37,349
I do think that self-leadership is about truly being authentic

1175
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:40,409
to yourself and being the same version of yourself in all areas

1176
00:37:40,409 --> 00:37:40,949
of your business.

1177
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:43,989
I do think that something that early on in my career that I

1178
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:45,010
thought I needed to do was,

1179
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:47,489
I needed to be the work version of myself and the home

1180
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:48,329
version of myself.

1181
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,150
And over time I've learned in some ways,

1182
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:51,929
the hard ways,

1183
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:55,090
hard ways that that's actually not the best way to do it.

1184
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,909
The best way is to actually always be your authentic self.

1185
00:37:58,429 --> 00:37:59,210
And then,

1186
00:37:59,289 --> 00:37:59,530
you know,

1187
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,309
you're more likely to get more engagement,

1188
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,230
more out of people.

1189
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:02,849
And,

1190
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:03,230
you know,

1191
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,570
I really think from that perspective,

1192
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,750
it really helps to create that foundation of being able to

1193
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,610
take people on the journey,

1194
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,170
which is,

1195
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:10,489
which is key to leadership.

1196
00:38:10,969 --> 00:38:11,929
The other thing that's,

1197
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,789
that's close to my heart is,

1198
00:38:13,789 --> 00:38:14,969
is this idea that,

1199
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,449
that your reputation is everything.

1200
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:20,650
And I think that one of the things that has really helped my

1201
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:23,769
growth and progression throughout the Walt Disney company,

1202
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:30,630
and also my ability to bring to light some unusual or unique

1203
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:34,969
or out of the box ideas is because I've built a reputation of,

1204
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:40,349
of trust of collaboration of partnership and of being upfront.

1205
00:38:40,389 --> 00:38:41,329
And I think that that's,

1206
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:44,630
that's really important and has been core to my success at Disney.

1207
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,010
Most definitely.

1208
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:45,829
Yeah,

1209
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:47,849
that's a really fascinating Kylie and,

1210
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:48,630
and make sense.

1211
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,510
I just wanted to ask you a little bit about,

1212
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,929
and I think for a lot of people,

1213
00:38:52,929 --> 00:38:55,769
we're all trying to be different versions of ourselves at times,

1214
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:56,230
as you said,

1215
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:56,989
and it's tiring,

1216
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:57,409
isn't it?

1217
00:38:57,429 --> 00:38:57,670
You know,

1218
00:38:57,909 --> 00:38:58,670
in this environment,

1219
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,809
I need to speak this way,

1220
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:00,489
I act this way.

1221
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:02,769
It wears people down.

1222
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:03,190
Can you,

1223
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,190
can you explore that a little bit more around,

1224
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,070
is it being more open and saying,

1225
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,510
this is me at home and,

1226
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,730
and unashamedly,

1227
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,889
and there's a bit of vulnerability.

1228
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:13,989
And that was a conscious decision that you made to just,

1229
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:14,909
to just,

1230
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,210
let that go at work as well.

1231
00:39:16,969 --> 00:39:18,809
I think you articulated it perfectly.

1232
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:23,429
Then trying to be different versions of yourself is exhausting because you're

1233
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:26,969
trying to invent a persona that isn't necessarily true to you.

1234
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:28,829
And then it's hard to maintain that.

1235
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:30,150
And by that,

1236
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:30,469
I mean,

1237
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:30,869
you know,

1238
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,550
people might be wondering what I'm talking about,

1239
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,929
but if you think that at work,

1240
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,889
all of a sudden you have to be this very formal,

1241
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,789
very serious version of yourself.

1242
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:38,909
Whereas at home,

1243
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,469
you might be a bit lighthearted,

1244
00:39:40,469 --> 00:39:40,969
you know,

1245
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,230
you bring a different type of energy.

1246
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:43,349
And so,

1247
00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:43,909
you know,

1248
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:44,829
I think what's important,

1249
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:50,630
is that that home version of you actually is what differentiates you and what is special and unique about you.

1250
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:53,269
So ensuring that you're always bringing that to the table,

1251
00:39:53,269 --> 00:39:57,570
I think really helps to create your place and,

1252
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:00,650
and your opportunity in the work world.

1253
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:00,929
But,

1254
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,130
you know,

1255
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:01,449
I think,

1256
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,130
as I said before,

1257
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:02,409
just,

1258
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,329
just that whole idea of trying to,

1259
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:07,170
to be someone different is tiring,

1260
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:08,250
but then is also not all,

1261
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:08,909
not authentic.

1262
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:11,170
And it does reduce your ability to be vulnerable.

1263
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,170
And I think that that's something that is spoken about a lot in leadership.

1264
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,429
And it took me a really long time to understand what that meant,

1265
00:40:17,429 --> 00:40:24,170
but it means being prepared to be really open and to not always have to be,

1266
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:24,449
you know,

1267
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,389
in inverted commas,

1268
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:25,909
the boss.

1269
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,329
You can be someone who can say,

1270
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:28,829
I've,

1271
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:29,829
I learned from this,

1272
00:40:29,909 --> 00:40:32,030
this mistake because of X,

1273
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:32,210
Y,

1274
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:32,429
and Z,

1275
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:35,869
or I did this this way and it didn't work for me,

1276
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:37,510
or things didn't always work out for me.

1277
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:43,989
And it just helps for people to understand that you are human and that we're all on a journey like this.

1278
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:44,889
And you're not,

1279
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:58,510
you're not untouchable or unattainable because that's another thing I think that's that helps people be successful in modern leadership is as a leader to be really approachable to be someone who people can relate to and engage with.

1280
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,349
And something that,

1281
00:40:59,349 --> 00:41:04,969
that I did almost by accident over COVID was the first week that we were locked down.

1282
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,250
I did a video from home.

1283
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:06,969
You know,

1284
00:41:06,989 --> 00:41:09,769
I had my hair in a top knot and I was in my track suit and I'm like,

1285
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:09,969
well,

1286
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:10,389
here we are.

1287
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:11,150
This is really interesting.

1288
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,789
And I got a really positive response to that.

1289
00:41:13,789 --> 00:41:14,550
So then I did one,

1290
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,369
one every single week for the entirety of COVID.

1291
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:18,130
And now that we're,

1292
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:18,389
well,

1293
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:19,250
we're supposed to be back.

1294
00:41:19,309 --> 00:41:20,050
We're technically back.

1295
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:21,909
I've been doing it every second week.

1296
00:41:21,909 --> 00:41:24,650
But one of the things that I noticed is that when we went back to the office,

1297
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:28,510
all of these people that had never spoken to me before would come up and say,

1298
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:28,789
Oh,

1299
00:41:28,869 --> 00:41:29,070
Hey,

1300
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:29,449
Kylie,

1301
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,210
how are you going?

1302
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:31,889
And I felt like they knew me.

1303
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:36,369
Whereas before I was like this unknown senior person,

1304
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:36,909
you know,

1305
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:37,570
in the office,

1306
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:40,630
but it just created that opportunity for people to feel like they knew me.

1307
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,190
And sometimes I was serious on them.

1308
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,449
And sometimes I was a bit silly.

1309
00:41:43,449 --> 00:41:44,429
And sometimes my dog,

1310
00:41:44,429 --> 00:41:47,130
Mabel made a cameo appearance.

1311
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,070
But I think just from that perspective,

1312
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:52,809
ensuring that you as a leader is seen as a real person.

1313
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:56,929
And I think that's really made a difference to the culture of our business almost by accident.

1314
00:41:57,309 --> 00:42:01,130
I think Mabel's become the star of your Zooms and the Bulldog board meeting.

1315
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,170
You often see Mabel in the background.

1316
00:42:03,449 --> 00:42:05,190
That's been a big part of it.

1317
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:05,590
And I love,

1318
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,409
I've loved that too,

1319
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:06,710
isn't it?

1320
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:08,929
You actually go into people's homes and,

1321
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:09,110
you know,

1322
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:13,170
we're doing that today with you and it does open up the conversations.

1323
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,329
So how do you go,

1324
00:42:14,429 --> 00:42:18,090
how do you go about Kylie trying to positively impact others in your environment?

1325
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:19,269
No,

1326
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:24,369
I think that a big part of my role is bringing the energy of the business and the excitement.

1327
00:42:24,429 --> 00:42:25,469
And as I mentioned,

1328
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:31,889
the optimism when you work for a company that is in a phase of major change and evolution,

1329
00:42:31,889 --> 00:42:34,809
or it's in an industry that's in a phase of change and evolution,

1330
00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:36,130
which the media space is.

1331
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,969
And within our portfolio,

1332
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:38,130
you know,

1333
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,289
we have long-term legacy businesses.

1334
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:40,769
You know,

1335
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:41,349
we have film,

1336
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:42,869
we have physical home entertainment,

1337
00:42:43,309 --> 00:42:44,269
and we're moving into the digital space.

1338
00:42:44,269 --> 00:42:54,769
And so it's really important to keep the team energised and focused on the future and the opportunity for them to be a part of that,

1339
00:42:54,769 --> 00:42:56,989
regardless of what part of the business they're currently in.

1340
00:42:56,989 --> 00:43:00,170
So that's a really important part for me,

1341
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:01,909
ensuring that there's focus,

1342
00:43:01,909 --> 00:43:05,750
that everybody really understands where we're heading as a business.

1343
00:43:05,809 --> 00:43:06,650
And then of course,

1344
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,750
communication is certainly key.

1345
00:43:09,469 --> 00:43:12,750
And how do you go about creating and sharing that vision,

1346
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:13,250
Kylie?

1347
00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:13,449
Well,

1348
00:43:13,449 --> 00:43:14,269
one of the things that,

1349
00:43:14,269 --> 00:43:16,510
that I think is really important.

1350
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,949
So creating at first,

1351
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:23,989
it's definitely about ensuring that I'm leaning into the expertise of the team.

1352
00:43:24,449 --> 00:43:25,570
Our business is really broad.

1353
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:25,750
You know,

1354
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,909
you read out at the beginning,

1355
00:43:26,909 --> 00:43:28,309
there are many facets to it.

1356
00:43:28,489 --> 00:43:28,630
You know,

1357
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,449
we have our finger in lots of pies,

1358
00:43:30,449 --> 00:43:31,449
our fingers in lots of pies.

1359
00:43:31,449 --> 00:43:42,030
So ensuring that I'm leaning into the leaders of those businesses and the people who work within those teams to really understand the detail and what's important.

1360
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:43,650
And as I mentioned before,

1361
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:50,190
surrounding myself with people who are going to challenge and question and push on that thinking.

1362
00:43:50,849 --> 00:44:00,369
And then I think the other part of that is also really understanding and keeping an eye on what's happening outside of our company and how the industry itself is evolving.

1363
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:03,389
So you really recognise what else is happening out there.

1364
00:44:03,389 --> 00:44:06,210
So not being too insular is really important.

1365
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:07,829
And as far as communicating it,

1366
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:11,710
I create a story in a triangle.

1367
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,590
So I create a,

1368
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,530
some buzzwords or some,

1369
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:20,070
some language that really articulates our overarching strategy really,

1370
00:44:20,349 --> 00:44:22,150
really simply and clearly.

1371
00:44:22,489 --> 00:44:24,010
And that's at the top of the triangle.

1372
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:26,809
So that's something that I want to make sure that everyone in the whole business,

1373
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:27,750
regardless of their role,

1374
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:29,469
really understands that.

1375
00:44:29,769 --> 00:44:31,250
And I use those words a lot.

1376
00:44:31,329 --> 00:44:35,409
So an example of that is we talk about our local and love strategy here in Australia,

1377
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:40,550
which basically means that we take the amazing content that our parent provides us with,

1378
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:42,010
but we overlay an Australian,

1379
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:43,010
um,

1380
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:48,090
thinking and mindset for a much deeper connection with our local audiences.

1381
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:48,250
Now,

1382
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:52,349
I think I say that so many times that I think pretty much everyone in our business could articulate that.

1383
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:56,710
But then as you go down that pyramid where it gets kind of bigger at the base,

1384
00:44:56,929 --> 00:44:59,889
there's a lot of detail in that there's a lot of deep strategy,

1385
00:44:59,889 --> 00:45:02,650
high level strategy and articulation that,

1386
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:03,570
that perhaps on the,

1387
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:04,110
um,

1388
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:04,329
you know,

1389
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:07,889
the more senior experience people in the business would truly understand.

1390
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:12,530
But I do think that ensuring that there's a connection point for everyone in the business so that they really understand the job,

1391
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:13,449
understand the job,

1392
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:16,030
the journey that the company is on so that then they can feel a part of it.

1393
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:17,530
Learning and improvement.

1394
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:17,829
Kylie,

1395
00:45:17,829 --> 00:45:19,389
what's your approach to that?

1396
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:22,210
I definitely think learning from others is,

1397
00:45:22,269 --> 00:45:23,489
is really important.

1398
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:24,309
And,

1399
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:24,670
um,

1400
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:29,409
I do think that you can learn from other people's journeys and other people's mistakes.

1401
00:45:29,409 --> 00:45:34,550
That's why I like the autobiographies because I think that's when people are truly raw and an open,

1402
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:36,010
or you hope that they are some are not,

1403
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:36,329
but,

1404
00:45:36,329 --> 00:45:36,750
um,

1405
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:36,969
you know,

1406
00:45:36,969 --> 00:45:38,489
sometimes you do get under the skin of,

1407
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:42,429
of some of the mistakes that people have made or,

1408
00:45:42,469 --> 00:45:43,150
um,

1409
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,250
or the journeys that they have been on.

1410
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:49,030
I definitely think that as our business evolves and changes,

1411
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:51,909
learning about the new industries that we're going into,

1412
00:45:52,269 --> 00:45:55,869
certainly making sure that I'm on top of that digital space,

1413
00:45:56,269 --> 00:46:02,590
that I understand at least at some level how that is evolving and how that's changing.

1414
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:03,550
But an important part of that too,

1415
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:04,909
is I don't need to know all of that.

1416
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:09,730
I can bring experts into the business who have a deeper understanding.

1417
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:13,349
But one of the things that's important in my role is that I need to know,

1418
00:46:13,449 --> 00:46:16,989
a certain level about every part of the business.

1419
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:22,210
And I need to be able to have somewhat intelligent conversations with senior people in,

1420
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:23,710
in all of those industries,

1421
00:46:23,769 --> 00:46:24,050
uh,

1422
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:28,329
whether it's the CEO of channel nine or the CEO of Optus,

1423
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:28,829
or,

1424
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:29,710
you know,

1425
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:32,650
I need to know enough about their business and ours to be able to,

1426
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:33,429
uh,

1427
00:46:33,429 --> 00:46:37,269
articulate what it is that we need as a business and also to understand what they need.

1428
00:46:37,269 --> 00:46:38,050
Cause I think that's,

1429
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:41,389
that's the perfect part of partnership where you can find that intersect between the two.

1430
00:46:41,889 --> 00:46:43,349
So really learning and understanding,

1431
00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:46,429
understanding and keeping on top of the way industry is changing,

1432
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:48,469
evolving and evolving is really important as well.

1433
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:49,090
And,

1434
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:49,230
uh,

1435
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:49,949
and Kylie,

1436
00:46:49,969 --> 00:46:50,250
um,

1437
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,289
you mentioned collaboration a lot.

1438
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:53,909
How do you go about collaborating?

1439
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:54,530
Well,

1440
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:55,289
as I've said before,

1441
00:46:55,289 --> 00:46:57,349
collaboration is key.

1442
00:46:57,389 --> 00:46:58,949
And you know,

1443
00:46:58,949 --> 00:46:59,289
one of,

1444
00:46:59,289 --> 00:47:02,989
one of the things that I say a lot within the business is the sum is greater than the parts.

1445
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:08,489
And also another one I use is all boats must rise and we need to link arms.

1446
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:10,869
I say a lot of these things over and over again,

1447
00:47:11,309 --> 00:47:11,789
but it's,

1448
00:47:11,789 --> 00:47:13,250
but it's fairly clear then,

1449
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:13,550
uh,

1450
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:13,710
you know,

1451
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:16,110
how important I see collaboration is.

1452
00:47:16,489 --> 00:47:16,969
And,

1453
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:17,190
you know,

1454
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:17,989
from that perspective,

1455
00:47:17,989 --> 00:47:24,170
it really is about everybody being on a shared journey and it can be difficult in a big,

1456
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:32,130
broad business where each part of the business has a different set of objectives to try to help people understand that the business is evolving.

1457
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:39,630
And so then they need to both focus on what their individual objectives are and then the overarching view and direction of the business.

1458
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,869
And so the communication part is really key.

1459
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:52,989
To that and really helping people understand the importance of that shared vision and being prepared to sometimes put the shared vision before your own objective.

1460
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:56,309
And it's really important that you reward people against that.

1461
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:57,909
So it'd be one thing if I was to say,

1462
00:47:57,909 --> 00:47:58,230
okay,

1463
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:58,730
well,

1464
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:00,849
here are your targets within your area,

1465
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:04,110
but sometimes you need to relinquish those targets for the greater good,

1466
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:07,230
but you're only being measured and valued on your targets.

1467
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:10,929
So then all of a sudden the staff member or the cast member is in conflict.

1468
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,150
So as a leader,

1469
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:12,190
you really need to make sure that you're doing the right thing.

1470
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:12,429
You really need to make sure that you're doing the right thing.

1471
00:48:12,429 --> 00:48:12,489
So as a leader,

1472
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:12,670
you really need to make sure that you're doing the right thing.

1473
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:12,730
So as a leader,

1474
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:16,929
you really need to make sure that you're facilitating that collaboration and making it easy for people to do.

1475
00:48:17,289 --> 00:48:19,250
It's not just a matter of telling them that's what they have to do.

1476
00:48:19,289 --> 00:48:23,030
It needs to actually make sense to them and their life and how they're working as well.

1477
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:23,869
Could you name,

1478
00:48:23,989 --> 00:48:26,989
has there been someone who's been the greatest leader in your life?

1479
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:27,889
Well,

1480
00:48:27,969 --> 00:48:29,769
it'd be really hard to go past Bob Iger.

1481
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,150
And I know that's going right up to the top of the tree.

1482
00:48:32,389 --> 00:48:32,510
You know,

1483
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:36,130
the vision that he set on the journey that I've been at Disney,

1484
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:36,750
you know,

1485
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:37,070
10,

1486
00:48:37,889 --> 00:48:38,170
well,

1487
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:39,190
actually it was longer.

1488
00:48:39,489 --> 00:48:40,849
When I first started at Disney,

1489
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:41,690
you know,

1490
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:42,710
nearly 18 years ago,

1491
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:45,670
Bob Iger had just taken over as the CEO.

1492
00:48:46,409 --> 00:48:48,090
And one of the things that he said is that,

1493
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:48,289
you know,

1494
00:48:48,329 --> 00:48:49,429
at the time we had,

1495
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:50,369
like all studios,

1496
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:53,469
we might've had 25 different films on our slate that were,

1497
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,210
you know,

1498
00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:55,170
non-branded.

1499
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:58,889
Maybe there was Toy Story that was the only branded content that was on there.

1500
00:48:59,489 --> 00:49:06,010
And he said that we were going to become a franchise driven business and that all of the films that we would create and release would,

1501
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:08,449
would have a knock on effect to other parts of the business,

1502
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:08,650
you know,

1503
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,730
really going back to Walt's original vision.

1504
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,730
And I remember looking at the slate,

1505
00:49:12,809 --> 00:49:16,289
and thinking that makes total sense to me what he's saying,

1506
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:26,090
but how on earth could you possibly turn this massive boat around this enormous Walt Disney company that has been operating this way now for several decades and really reinvent it.

1507
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:28,369
And so while I loved his vision,

1508
00:49:28,409 --> 00:49:31,489
I had very little faith in it and he absolutely did it.

1509
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:37,130
And I learned so much from him about that preparedness to trust your instincts,

1510
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:39,130
to lean into creativity,

1511
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:42,170
to make those big educated bets,

1512
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:45,170
to really back yourself and your vision.

1513
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:49,929
And he's probably one of the greatest leaders I think that I've ever seen.

1514
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:55,690
And I've been incredibly lucky to work within an organization that he was running for the nearly two decades.

1515
00:49:55,969 --> 00:49:56,250
Kyle,

1516
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,610
it's been incredible to spend some time with you this morning.

1517
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:00,369
I've been writing notes.

1518
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:02,650
I've got content to watch and lessons learned.

1519
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:04,849
I'm sure lots of other people will feel the same way.

1520
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:09,329
I really appreciate your time and feel very fortunate to be able to spend some time with you.

1521
00:50:09,329 --> 00:50:09,769
Thanks again.

1522
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:10,409
Thanks,

1523
00:50:10,409 --> 00:50:10,809
Das.

1524
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:11,570
