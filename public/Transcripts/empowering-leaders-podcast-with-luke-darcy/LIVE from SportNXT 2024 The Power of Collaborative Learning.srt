1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,410
A Leader Connect is passionate about inspiring connections and creating a world of collaboration.

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,449
We curate groups of five to six people from non-competing backgrounds who come together

3
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:15,089
to learn, connect and collaborate.

4
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,050
Leaders from the arts, from the business world, social venture and sport coming out of their

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,890
silos to share life experience and best practice in their own unique worlds.

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,050
Our Leader Connect panel here at Semwood at Sport Next in Melbourne is a group of coaches

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,210
who have achieved extraordinary success.

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,289
Second from the left is Mike Dunlap, coach to the Michael Jordan-owned Charlotte Bogcats

9
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:41,609
in 2012, becoming the only coach in NBA history to triple a team's win total from the previous

10
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:42,609
season.

11
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,409
Mike's most recent success, as you can see on the screen, was with the Milwaukee Bucks'

12
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:48,969
historic NBA championship win in 2021.

13
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:52,530
John Aloisi next to Mike is a legend of Australian sport.

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,250
His penalty kick that put the Socceroos into the 2006 World Cup was voted by the sport.

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,170
Australia Hall of Fame was one of the three greatest moments in Australian sporting history.

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,049
John is the current head coach of A-League Club Western United, a team, as you can see,

17
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:09,329
he coached to win the championship in 2022.

18
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:12,689
Andrew McDonnell next to me was appointed as the head coach of the Australian cricket

19
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,290
team in February 2022 after a long and distinguished career.

20
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,950
In his short tenure, he has guided Australia to retain the Ashes, a World Cup win in India

21
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:27,569
in the most spectacular fashion and an almost unprecedented run of success.

22
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:29,290
Alongside Andrew is Craig McRae.

23
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,569
A triple Premiership winning player.

24
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:39,909
He was an extraordinary player and he coached Collingwood, as everyone knows, to an incredible

25
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:45,049
four-point win in the 2023 AFL Grand Final delivering the Magpies their 16th Premiership.

26
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:50,010
I'd also like to acknowledge Anthony Seybold, a legendary coach from Australian rugby league

27
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,329
and rugby union who unfortunately can't make it here today but is an integral part of this

28
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,329
group.

29
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:59,849
The Elite Connect program, I'm going to ask two questions to the panel and they sound

30
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:00,370
like this.

31
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:05,230
The Elite Connect program has created a forum to allow this group to share openly with other

32
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,250
world leading coaches from different sporting codes in regular online meetings.

33
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,330
This group get together on a monthly basis.

34
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,870
I want to ask them how it's helped them and have they got any specific stories or hacks

35
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,449
that they've been able to add to their life or to their own team.

36
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:21,629
I want to start with Ronnie McDonnell alongside of me.

37
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:24,509
Your commitment to the program, Ronnie, has been extraordinary.

38
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:28,569
I understand that these guys turned on their laptops, you were walking through customs

39
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:29,569
in India.

40
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:32,949
You had your pants over your shoulder, still found a way to dial in, you weren't going

41
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:33,949
to miss a meeting.

42
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:34,949
It's an incredible commitment to the group.

43
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:38,490
Can you tell us about your experience with this group of gentlemen alongside of you?

44
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,289
Yeah, thanks, Darce.

45
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:43,449
To start off, it's been an incredible experience but I'll take it way back to the start when

46
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:48,009
Matt first rang me and I was really sceptical around it and I pulled out of one group and

47
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:53,050
I was like, oh, and he rang again and he was relentless in the pursuit and I was lucky

48
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,849
that I missed out on that first group and that's no disrespect to those people that

49
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:59,530
were going to be in that but to be able to tap into the minds to the left of me here's

50
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:03,889
been a wonderful opportunity and it's helped me immensely in basically problem solving.

51
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:07,650
One thing you learn as a leader is that you're all going through a similar thing and to be

52
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,250
able to bounce it off these guys, work our way through it and even to the point midway

53
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,550
through the World Cup, jumped on a call and we were two and two, I think we had an awful

54
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,349
start and just to have people on the outside to be able to bounce ideas off and just get

55
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:24,949
clarity in thinking and to really appreciate that we all go through a similar experience.

56
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:28,770
But getting back to that challenge of getting online, we're in all different time zones

57
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:28,949
and there's a lot going on.

58
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:32,229
And yeah, we've made an incredible effort to jump on and yeah, I was going through the

59
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:34,990
airport security and the phone went through and these guys were patient enough for about

60
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,009
five minutes as I went through security, so I appreciated that.

61
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:42,009
Alongside you, Craig McRae, on Sunday 1st October 2023, your coach calling into a famous

62
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:46,530
Premiership victory, your daughter is born the morning of grand final day, Maggie.

63
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,430
That's a pretty big day by anyone's estimation.

64
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,030
Coincidentally you have an Alita Connect morning the next morning after grand final and no

65
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,129
one on this panel is expecting to see Craig McRae after he's won the grand final.

66
00:03:57,129 --> 00:03:58,949
You turn up with your one day old daughter.

67
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:00,610
You're on your lap.

68
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,449
Such has been your commitment to learning and sharing.

69
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:04,509
Can you tell us a bit about the experience, Fyfe?

70
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:06,169
Yeah, thanks, Darce.

71
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:11,110
And similar to Andrew here, it's been an incredible journey the last two years with this team.

72
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:16,470
You've seen Johnny win the championship and then winning Ashes and World Cups and riding

73
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,389
the bumps and Mike's just a wealth of knowledge and his experience has been incredible for

74
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:22,389
all of us.

75
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:25,009
Yeah, on that day it was, I couldn't let the team down.

76
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,949
I had the baby and my wife says, have the baby, she needs some sleep.

77
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:27,949
And then I thought, oh, I've got to have the baby.

78
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:28,949
She needs some sleep.

79
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:32,569
And I thought, shit, I'm on this Zoom call and I got there a little bit late myself.

80
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:38,449
But you know, we've got a strong connection and we ride bumps together and we enjoy successes

81
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:39,449
together.

82
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,490
It's been great to be part of.

83
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,529
Mike Dunlap alongside you is a legend of world coaching, flown in from Singapore.

84
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:51,170
He's had 2000 coaches under his tutelage and I understand that Mike dialed into a meeting

85
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:55,370
on the Milwaukee team bus on the way into the stadium and the group got to experience

86
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,310
an NBA pregame in real time, live, Mike.

87
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,910
Through your laptop.

88
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,269
And through you telling them the story, tell us about connecting with this group of coaches

89
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,610
and a leader connect and what it's meant.

90
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,930
One of the famous coaches in the United States who's now passed, John Wooden.

91
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,250
And also there's another one called Pete Newell.

92
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,329
But the bottom line is, is that as somebody who transported coach Newell around so he

93
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:23,470
could do clinics when he was 88 years old, I was the one who had the privilege of, of

94
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,110
traveling with him.

95
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,410
And he said, the one thing you want to do is be a lifelong learner.

96
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,189
Regardless of whether you retire or not, or somebody asks you to leave the business.

97
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:38,230
And the key point is, is that to always take a macro view that life is good and it's going

98
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,290
to be okay.

99
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,870
And what are the lessons learned?

100
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:47,089
And I would say in the Alita group, all of these guys bring a particular view to things,

101
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:49,350
which isn't necessarily my view.

102
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,689
And if you keep an open mind, you'll be a sponge and you'll pick it up.

103
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:57,490
Yesterday, I met with Jason Smith, who's second in line now.

104
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:57,990
For all.

105
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,790
And he was a big fan of the Atlanta Hawks.

106
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,790
He was a big fan of the Atlanta Hawks.

107
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,790
He was a big fan of the Atlanta Hawks.

108
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,790
And he played for basketball on the female and male side.

109
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,790
And he played for us at a small school.

110
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,089
And he was drafted by the Atlanta Hawks.

111
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:10,509
And right before he went to camp, he snapped his, his patella tendon and it changed the

112
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:11,769
direction of his life.

113
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:14,389
He played for the flag several times.

114
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:19,509
And then his last 15 years, he's been in the corporate world dealing with people's accounts

115
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:23,089
that have a hundred million and up for a particular bank.

116
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:26,810
And now he's made the choice to come in, help his country and develop.

117
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,370
And so the essence of what we do.

118
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,370
It's not what we think we do.

119
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,689
It's about relationships and not things.

120
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:37,350
There are things we have to pursue, but the most important thing to remember is, is that

121
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:42,269
what are your priorities and how are you going to raise your family and what kind of example

122
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,269
you want to be?

123
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:47,350
Because when that drives you, it has a tendency to have you make great decisions.

124
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,089
And the best decision I've made in the last two years is to be a part of this Alita group

125
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:57,230
because they challenge your thinking, they give you stories and they re-reference some

126
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,250
of some things that you've done.

127
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:58,350
Yeah.

128
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,910
That's what you would do, which is what I would call nuance.

129
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,470
And that's why Alita has been so good for us.

130
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,610
Thank you, Mike, for that incredible description.

131
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,850
John, I always see everything that John does tends to turn to gold.

132
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:12,470
And we mentioned one of the great sporting moments in Australian history.

133
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,470
John's famous for it.

134
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,329
But I know your dedication, John, to coaching and you take on a new A-League franchise and

135
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:20,470
you win the championship in 2022.

136
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,550
But you've got this team in your corner all the way through that.

137
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,250
Tell us about that experience for you.

138
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,250
Yeah, it was a great experience.

139
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,250
Yeah.

140
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,430
One thing that I learned about winning the championship that Mike said, celebrate, enjoy

141
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,509
it because they don't come around too often and make the most of it.

142
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:42,649
And they're the stories that we speak about, about the experiences that we're going through.

143
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:48,189
Also we were talking about the selection process in terms of captains or retiring players, how

144
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:50,829
we've dealt with it in the past.

145
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:55,069
And we all want to keep learning and that's the most important thing.

146
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:58,129
So when we go online, this is the first time we've been online.

147
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:02,329
It's the first time we've been together in person, but when we get online, it's story

148
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:03,329
after story.

149
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:08,550
It's what would you do in this situation or what have you done in this situation?

150
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,230
And it's good when you're winning.

151
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:15,910
When you're losing, you really tap into them a lot.

152
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,610
And it's sort of like a therapy session for me because as a head coach, you end up being

153
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:25,930
a little bit isolated at times and you've got different sorts of pressures from your

154
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,129
board and then from supporters, from media.

155
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:28,129
Yeah.

156
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:33,970
And then, you know, when I chat with these guys here, you know, they make it that it's

157
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:40,110
a lot more, you know, you can get through this, there will be something around the corner

158
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,110
for you.

159
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:46,830
And, you know, just six weeks ago, we were on call and my team hadn't been getting results,

160
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:52,009
but I was so excited about the young players that we got coming through.

161
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:55,470
And Fly said, you know, just make sure they harness it because you can do a lot with these

162
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,870
young players.

163
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,090
And we've gone on a run now.

164
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:03,570
And, you know, the younger players are really believing and it's incredible just from, you

165
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,230
know, a little chat that you can actually bring that to the group.

166
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,110
So it's been, for me, it's been amazing and I love every time we get together.

167
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,230
And there are not many spaces you can go when your leadership can be lonely at times.

168
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:19,269
So the opportunity to speak to someone who's got a very, even a non-competing sport.

169
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:20,269
Johnny said something interesting, Fly, celebrate.

170
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,269
He got advice from Mike.

171
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,850
I didn't think you're allowed to celebrate, Fly, in recent times.

172
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,129
The world of pressure comes to everyone.

173
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:27,129
I understand that.

174
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:28,129
Yeah.

175
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:29,129
I understand.

176
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:33,090
A lot of these conversations have been private from peer to peer, but I believe some of Andrew's

177
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,070
talks on leadership and how he approached the leadership of the Australian cricket team

178
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,950
really influenced your decision-making at Collin.

179
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,950
Can you share that story?

180
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,950
Yeah, I can.

181
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,629
And I'm disappointed because this is the first time we've been together in the same room

182
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:46,750
because we've been on Zoom for two and a half years and we're going out to dinner after

183
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,190
this and you don't have a game and you're over, come from overseas, you don't have a

184
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,809
game and I'm going to have to leave early, I've got a game tomorrow.

185
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:57,129
But yeah, it's been a great connection of relationships.

186
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:03,909
And yeah, the story you're talking about, at one stage last year, we were transitioning

187
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:08,370
our leadership from Scott Penelbury, who'd been a great leader for such a long time and

188
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,649
chose to move on from that role.

189
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:16,509
And I just asked to the group, have you gone through a leadership transformation before

190
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:17,870
and what did you do?

191
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,389
Just looking for experiences and stories.

192
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:25,070
And then Andrew shared the story only probably six months earlier that what they did with

193
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,070
Pat Cummings.

194
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,070
Taking over.

195
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,070
Yeah.

196
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,070
And the transition of that.

197
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,250
And I said, do you have any things you would change?

198
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,830
And I don't want to speak for you, but I will.

199
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,289
Or do you want to share what you shared with me?

200
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:43,110
I just recall the way that if you had your time again, you would take others on the journey

201
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,450
for this decision making.

202
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:50,110
Now the board and certain people had decided that Pat Cummings was the guy, but then there

203
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,129
was a ripple effect from the likes of Steve Smith and David Warner and so on and so on,

204
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:56,950
had aspirations that they thought they could be.

205
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,070
Yeah.

206
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,830
They thought they could be the guy, but there was no process to take them through when the

207
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,830
decision was made.

208
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,129
They were sitting there going, well, what about me?

209
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:05,370
What happened here?

210
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,330
So from that conversation, which happened just before Christmas, the first thing I did

211
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:14,850
when I got back in the New Year was to grab all the people, the aspiring leaders that

212
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,549
I thought would have, even if it was just this much inspiration to be a leader or thought

213
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:23,070
of in this capacity, was to get them in one room.

214
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,070
And there were 16 of them in total.

215
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,070
And some of you go, really?

216
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:30,830
But most of them all had at least this much thought that they could be the guy.

217
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,649
And then we talked through exactly what we're going to do in the process, and then what's

218
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:38,730
required amongst that, how we're going to vote for it, and the criteria everyone was

219
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,070
going to be involved in around that.

220
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,690
So without this guidance, that wouldn't have happened.

221
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:49,070
And then from that, we then had 16 people that were all invested in the outcome and

222
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:52,509
realised they'd been taken on a journey for the outcome.

223
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:55,950
And while that was happening, the other 30-odd guys were in a room with our young, young,

224
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:01,269
young, developing leadership group, working out how they can support the change of leadership.

225
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:06,450
And it was a really thought-out process, thanks to the guidance of this leader program.

226
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,629
Yeah, I love that.

227
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:12,129
We feel like we've been in silos a lot in the world in recent times, and that just chance

228
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:16,950
to share with like-minded people at the same level is exciting.

229
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:21,090
Ronnie, I look at the World Cup win and what you've been able to do in recent times in

230
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,950
India as one of the great sporting moments in Australia, without exaggerating too much.

231
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,929
But not without a few hurdles on the way, Glenn Maxwell falls off the back of a golf

232
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:30,929
cart.

233
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:34,129
I'm assuming not many people can relate to that.

234
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,950
Things happen in life and in sport.

235
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,830
Are they the sort of things that you can bounce off a group like this?

236
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,330
We've probably all been in a situation similar to that.

237
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:45,309
I'm not sure many have had a person fall off a golf cart mid-World Cup and concuss themselves,

238
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:48,149
but we can use that as an example.

239
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:53,370
Just the ability to, I mean, every team takes on challenges at different times, and you're

240
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,570
going to have different friction points across the journey.

241
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:55,950
Yeah.

242
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:00,529
And just to be able to share what you're feeling in a non-judgmental way with this

243
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,730
group of people, and there's no agendas within it, and just to be able to bounce ideas off

244
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,029
it, it feels like a safe environment.

245
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:10,549
When I first went into the Alita program, the first three or four sessions, I was really

246
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:13,330
doubtful around how we were connecting, and it didn't feel like there was any rhythm to

247
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,330
it.

248
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,429
And then once we got the trust and it opened up and we were able to share anything without

249
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:21,450
judgment, and as Mike said, we don't always agree on it.

250
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,570
But to be able to come at it at different angles, you get off the call and you always feel as

251
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,850
though you've got a path through anything that confronts you as a leader.

252
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,750
So it's a really nice moment when you've got that to be able to draw upon.

253
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,590
Mike, as you said, lifelong learning is one of your philosophies, and there's an enormous

254
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,450
amount of wisdom that you're able to share, but you're seeing a new generation come through

255
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:46,090
that react differently, and a new generation of young athletes they're dealing with.

256
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,669
What have you taken away from this panel alongside of you?

257
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:54,750
Well, I think the most important thing is as you're recognizing your workforce is younger,

258
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,190
and they're coming through.

259
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,830
It is that their parenting was different, and instead of doting on the fact that the

260
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,750
parenting is different, the good, the bad, the ugly, it's more important to stay in the

261
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:13,090
day of how the young athlete listens, what drives them, and to have information from

262
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:19,250
them of who they are so that you can lead, and better state it so they can lead themselves

263
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,029
and remand them back to themselves.

264
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:25,070
So I think it's really important that you have something like an I am sheet, so if somebody

265
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:29,029
comes to you and they're new to your company, or they're new to your team, or they're young

266
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:32,309
and you're going to put them in a position where they've got to perform now, you see

267
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:36,750
that they have talent, well, the best thing you can do is get information first, an I

268
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,049
am sheet, and you can make it up, and you can say, hey, favorite thing that you would

269
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:48,129
take to the moon, worst tragedy that you've ever experienced, your nickname that you like,

270
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:49,470
and you go through these questions.

271
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,470
You can make them up.

272
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,950
They could be anything that you wanted, and I will promise you, if it's two or three pages,

273
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,850
you're going to read things about them that you couldn't find if you were doing it haphazardly

274
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,629
in 10 years, 20 years.

275
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:05,730
Give it to your spouse, and you create your I am sheet, and I would guarantee you that

276
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,070
you'll only get two-thirds right, no matter how long you've been with them.

277
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:14,990
So the revelation is that be an information seeker before you decide to codify and put

278
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,970
them in areas where they've got to lead, and you're depending on everybody.

279
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,710
And the last thing I would say in team is everybody spends time with the star, but you

280
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:29,669
have to understand is that the role player is the one that makes it so the star can do

281
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:30,669
their job.

282
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:34,950
And if you don't have those people that grind and grunt and get the job done, and you don't

283
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,490
spend your time with them, and you don't acknowledge them, then your team is going to be paper

284
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,490
mache.

285
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,549
Well, it's wisdom.

286
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:45,669
When Mike Dunlap speaks, and we're really grateful to have Mike out from the US for

287
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:47,330
this panel here at Sport Next in Melbourne.

288
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,889
I just wish I'd had Mike this morning, because we just picked selection, and we've dropped

289
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:52,889
a role player.

290
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:53,889
You make me feel guilty.

291
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:54,490
Yeah.

292
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,710
And I am sheep.

293
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,710
Oh, God.

294
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,710
Sorry, Flay.

295
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,710
Can you expand?

296
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,710
That's a meaningful, live example.

297
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,710
I mean, I'm going to pick up on that.

298
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,710
Can you expand on that?

299
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,710
I mean, you're a learner.

300
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,710
You're always, I know you absorb things, so where's your mind gone to there when you're

301
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,710
listening to that?

302
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,470
Oh, well, I'm just listening to exactly that.

303
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,769
We nourish our role players.

304
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:19,330
Everyone knows who the stars are, but the role players quite often get missed, and you're

305
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:24,330
constantly trying to reward those behaviours within the team, because you need those players

306
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,330
to execute.

307
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:32,330
And we've dropped one this week, and just because we want to get, they can't all fit

308
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,330
in.

309
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,549
And there needs to be change after, well, there doesn't need to be change, but we've

310
00:16:36,549 --> 00:16:41,769
decided to change a few things up, looking for a spark or a different version, but we've

311
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:42,769
let one of them go.

312
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:46,230
And I'm not doubting it, but I'm going to make sure I've got to follow up more than

313
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,330
what I already have, because they're going to be important.

314
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,330
They certainly are.

315
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,330
I think Nick Dacos is safe.

316
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,330
I think he's more than a role player.

317
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,330
Yeah, yeah.

318
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,330
If you're listening live, you'll be okay.

319
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,570
Jonny, you've always approached learning in a really professional way, and when you

320
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,330
put your mind on something, it tends to take all of your focus.

321
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:07,609
Have you got a specific example of a hack or a strategy that you've taken and implemented

322
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,329
into your life or into your world of coaching?

323
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,329
Yeah.

324
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:17,970
Discussing with these guys here about the beginning of the season, or was it last season,

325
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,710
that it's funny, when you're a coach, that it's probably the only profession that everyone

326
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:26,769
has an opinion of what you're doing, right or wrong.

327
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:31,250
I would never go into a surgery and tell a surgeon how to operate.

328
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,710
We've been involved in the sport, I've been coaching over 10 years, and Mike's over 40?

329
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,710
45.

330
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,710
45 years.

331
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:45,609
And so we know what we're doing, but either your board or your chairman, they have their

332
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:48,849
ideas, and when you have a board meeting, they might be saying, why did you make this

333
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:50,950
sub and why did you do this and why did you do that?

334
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,650
And I was discussing it with them.

335
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,349
And they said, well, take them on the journey with you.

336
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:56,769
Take them with you.

337
00:17:56,769 --> 00:18:00,289
What about if they come into one of your analysis meetings?

338
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:02,210
What about if they come into one of your team talks?

339
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:07,789
What about if they see the way that you're actually engaging with the group and why you

340
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:08,869
made this change?

341
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:12,529
Because every day we get a wellness of how the players are feeling.

342
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:17,269
We get their data on fatigue or how they're going.

343
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:21,789
And so a lot of that, a lot of thought goes into when, in soccer especially, when you've

344
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:23,109
made a substitute.

345
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:26,730
Because you can see if a player's tiring before they even know they're tiring, and then there's

346
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,750
the risk factor of injury.

347
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:35,490
So I did that with my chairman, and it was quite funny.

348
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,390
We didn't win that game, but he came out of it and he goes, that was so good.

349
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,970
He goes, that was good.

350
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,250
I can actually see what you're doing.

351
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,029
And so when we went through a bad spell, he was with me.

352
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:51,589
And I don't think if I went on the journey with him, he would have just probably lived.

353
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:55,309
He probably listened to, because what happens is they go to a barbecue or they go to their

354
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:59,549
friend's house and they start telling him, this guy doesn't know what he's doing.

355
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:00,549
You need to get rid of him.

356
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:05,809
But because he was there with me, he understood what I was trying to get from the group.

357
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:08,970
And that will take a little bit of time, but the process is there.

358
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,430
And Mike, over 45 years of coaching, you've seen it all.

359
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,670
You've been through all of that and been in teams.

360
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:18,250
And I mentioned off the top, you have a record winning season, effectively, at the Charlotte

361
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,369
Bobcats, but you're not there the next year.

362
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:21,569
So you've experienced it all.

363
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:22,589
Is it still that process?

364
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:23,589
You can say the next day.

365
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:24,589
The next day.

366
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:25,589
No, I hate it.

367
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:26,589
Let's go ahead.

368
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:27,589
Yeah.

369
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:28,589
You're still learning.

370
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:34,410
You find that there's still things that surprise you, even with all your wealth of experience.

371
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,410
Yeah.

372
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:42,349
I just think the most important thing is that envision yourself when your career is no longer.

373
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:47,970
And a lot of times we adopt what we do as far as how we make a living as part of our

374
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,970
identity.

375
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,569
I think you need to embrace that, because that's where you spend your time.

376
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:58,170
But also is, if you're looking ahead, you have to say, okay, what will fill my days?

377
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,049
And it doesn't have to be right.

378
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:04,190
It just has to be the fact that you visualize those next things.

379
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,809
So people ask me, hey, I've been retired since June.

380
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:07,809
What are you doing with your time?

381
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:11,470
And I go, I don't know, I'm here.

382
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,630
The point being is that I thought I would come back to Australia.

383
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,190
The Alita group stimulated me.

384
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,269
We're going to have this function today.

385
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:20,569
And I said, well, how can I incorporate that?

386
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:23,750
And be of some use for Basketball Australia?

387
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,670
I feel like I owe them, because I lived here.

388
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,750
My daughter was born in Adelaide.

389
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,269
So I said, well, I'll volunteer my services.

390
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:34,329
And they asked me what my charge was, and I said, there's no charge.

391
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:35,750
I owe you.

392
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,210
And so this is wrapped around the fact that this was my target.

393
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:45,190
And I've just finished a whirlwind nine or 10 clinics and workshops, and I'm here.

394
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,890
And that all was because I got invited.

395
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,450
And so my point is, is that don't ever worry.

396
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:55,289
Don't worry about telling people about your own self-worth.

397
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:56,349
You don't have to do that.

398
00:20:56,349 --> 00:20:57,349
You just have to know it.

399
00:20:57,349 --> 00:21:01,410
And as Mr. Rogers would say is, we are in a very loud world.

400
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,769
But when are you seeking peace in a given day where it's quiet, where you can reflect,

401
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:07,769
and you're doing it with intent?

402
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:13,630
Because at some point in time, you're going to wake up and be irrelevant in terms of when

403
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:18,170
you leave your job, you're going to feel like, well, now what do I do?

404
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,630
And it's probably one of the least.

405
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:19,730
Most important.

406
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:19,849
Most important.

407
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:20,089
Most important.

408
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:20,150
Most important.

409
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:20,190
Most important.

410
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:20,230
Most important.

411
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,269
Most important.

412
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:20,289
Most important.

413
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:20,369
Most important.

414
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:20,410
Most important.

415
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:20,430
Most important.

416
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:20,450
Most important.

417
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,210
Most important things if it's directly connected to things.

418
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:27,849
You identify yourself with things and things, as opposed to, this is who I am and here's

419
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:28,849
my purpose.

420
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:30,710
What a great message, isn't it?

421
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:35,509
Not identifying yourself with the actual job and with a round of applause.

422
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:39,769
And I did want to jump in at that moment because sitting at the back, there's

423
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:44,170
an incredible connection and trust with this group that's been developed over more than

424
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:50,230
12 months and a special bond, it's such a humble group, very hard to drag out some of

425
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:55,069
of the the stories that i know are there but i thought what we might do given the connection

426
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:58,710
and we'll start with mike mike has just donated his time to australian basketball don't worry

427
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:03,450
about paying me he's flown through singapore and just done a master class for 2000 coaches on the

428
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,970
way down so i thought i'd ask the rest of the panel and we're going to go down the panel i'll

429
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,650
start with you john tell us about your experience with mike dunlap and and what you've learned and

430
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:16,549
from him and his wisdom well i think it's been over two and a half years that we've been going

431
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:23,369
online together mike comes up with a book every time that means i over talk

432
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:30,349
so yeah there's so much knowledge with you know sometimes uh i'm just sitting there listening

433
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:35,849
the whole time because um i just want to take it all in and you're trying to you know make sure

434
00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:40,869
that you don't forget anything you're writing down notes and um and so that we we get so much

435
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:45,549
from mike because mike's been the head coach and then when we started this mike was the assistant

436
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:46,190
coach so

437
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:51,730
you know i was the head coach at that time and then you know explaining how his role is within

438
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:56,509
that team and uh and so which is important because you know at the time i think we're all head

439
00:22:56,509 --> 00:23:03,930
coaches except uh sieves was assistant to eddie jones with england and then he ended up taking

440
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:08,769
on the head coaching role so it was that was important to find that also his experiences as

441
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:15,869
a head coach um experiences with some big stars and and you know that you know i think that you

442
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:15,990
know

443
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:22,230
we underestimate how big they are over there and and how they they um they you know talk to them

444
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:27,210
how they deal with them and and you know and we i still remember when you know we're in the he was

445
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:31,250
in the change room preparing for the games on his phone and you know i'm trying to see you know what

446
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:36,549
what place in the background to see if i can see anyone so yeah mike's been amazing amazing to

447
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:42,329
listen to and uh you know we're always you know getting great knowledge from him great book

448
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:45,990
recommendations uh from mike i'm trying to catch up to the miracle morning uh

449
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:50,190
one of mike's worth a read we'll maybe send that out to the community mike's uh

450
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:54,930
must read material as well craig tell us about uh your experience with mike i've got the winner

451
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:00,349
within book from pat roley which i'm reading and using consistently now about you know success

452
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:05,569
continuing and why you do it and why you don't so that's that's been a great help um i just love

453
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:10,230
your energy your energy you're always up and you're in a different time zone and you even

454
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:15,869
your text messages have energy i'm just reading them with you you're just uh you are you're a

455
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:15,970
great person and i'm really happy to be here with you and i'm really happy to be here with you

456
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,630
amazing he would say that because i was with hawthorne yesterday

457
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:24,430
i know i'm gonna get clubbed later on no you're dead to me you are dead to me but

458
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:30,390
um no you you just you're just really insightful you've got so much energy and then and so much

459
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:35,609
wisdom like i just i was trying to tell my wife yesterday a story about you know you talk you're

460
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:40,390
talking about like um celebrating wind you he says drink the whole thing and then when it's empty

461
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:44,470
drink it again you know and i did yeah

462
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:50,470
uh ronnie tell us about your experience having mike dunlap uh in this group with him

463
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:56,690
energy enjoyment but uh the one thing for me that strikes it sticks out is curiosity after 45 years

464
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:03,390
in the game um coaching worldwide to still be that curious is a skill in itself and the endeavor to

465
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:07,730
do things better and to continually learn and and not preach either learn off others and i think

466
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,269
that's the one thing he's got he's a great listener as well and he absorbs that information and

467
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:15,630
takes it and is able to come back to you with with something that you can take away from it so it's

468
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:15,869
it's not it's not it's not it's not it's not it's not it's not it's not it's not it's not

469
00:25:15,869 --> 00:25:20,670
just about him it's it's about the others around him making them better he's probably the godfather

470
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:26,369
of the group yeah he is every group needs a godfather fly but i'm going to continue down

471
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:30,990
the panel and mike i'm going to ask you john we see uh someone you had a connection with for over

472
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,509
two and a half years i didn't realize it was it was that long tell us about your experience of

473
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:40,430
what you've found with john well i i would uh say and i can shorten this and that'd be a good thing

474
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:45,509
for everybody but uh you raise your children in a certain way so there's a culture of

475
00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:52,450
of australia which because of living here i know a smidge about now and so i would say they're

476
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:58,910
byproducts of uh superior education it was important uh and as they've come through the

477
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:07,250
system they're uh they're they're humble they share with their acclaim you you don't hear a lot

478
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:15,769
of i in their vernacular and that's stunning to me in the way they defer to the story and wanting

479
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:21,930
to impart knowledge so that's a tribute to the people that are sitting out there in the audience

480
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:30,490
and then the other thing is is that they're very much people that rarely will even get into do as i

481
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:37,690
say not as i do they're examples by motion of what they do and they've all been in pivotal competition

482
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:45,690
and where the pressure's on and one of they they say is it's easy to be a good person when you win

483
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:51,089
but what are you going to be like when you get dropped and you know that a whole year you've

484
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:55,950
gone by and i've experienced this and you lose a national championship and i would say their

485
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:02,990
behavior is exemplary in the fact that it's not what you do as you lose or you win it's what you

486
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:09,289
do afterwards and they're get up people they're get up people they get up and they're ready to go

487
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:15,609
and they're in competition such that you could be owing to at this juncture but it

488
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:15,750
has a lot of value to it and i think that's a great point and i think that's a great point

489
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:20,390
nothing to do with the outcome and what that's going to be it's going to be lessons learned so

490
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:27,150
they have you know in their own way imbued in me that you may be retired but stay alive and stay

491
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:32,630
moving and stay going because they've been invigorating to me and i can say it with action

492
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:39,390
because i'm here because of these three and also anthony anthony was in vegas two weeks ago playing

493
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:45,609
in a competition i went over and watched him practice and was with siebes and did all of that

494
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:52,150
and then we had coffee in sydney a couple days ago so those relationships are ensconced because of

495
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:58,490
this meaningful connections uh mike uh craig tell us about collaborating with john lewis i was um i

496
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:03,150
was a new coach so i'm just starting out and and johnny's there and then watching johnny have

497
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:09,069
success and the storytelling of what what it's taking to be successful i love every time we get

498
00:28:09,069 --> 00:28:13,849
together there'll be something that comes up and then you watch and it comes to life within your

499
00:28:13,849 --> 00:28:15,450
coaching and it and it is

500
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:19,190
really inspirational whether it's a challenge of losing games in a row and then there's a

501
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,369
turnaround and how did that happen and you talk how you got out of the dip and

502
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:29,490
and then the lots of different layers to things that um i've had to live after you've already

503
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,930
lived it yeah so i'm gonna you're doing that and then i'm listening to it and then here it comes

504
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:38,210
and oh johnny told me to do this and then there's so many different layers of those things but i

505
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:43,789
great admiration for somebody who's probably in the most cut throat of all of us you know

506
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,289
soccer can be really ruthless

507
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:52,049
and and uh in particular but the way he's just he's seen such level um with his approach to all

508
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:56,549
of it so thanks great beautifully said ronnie collaborating with john lewis he's always a man

509
00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:00,630
with a plan for me like he's always clear and concise um he knows the direction he's heading

510
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:05,430
in and he's got a vision and a long-term vision he's had some challenging times um had that spike

511
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:09,569
at the start and he's going through a rebuilding um phase obviously at the club at the moment but

512
00:29:09,569 --> 00:29:14,410
he's clear on where he's heading uh he's always got a plan and yeah i just love that you're going

513
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,430
to keep rolling down the path and i'm going to keep rolling down the path and i'm going to keep

514
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:15,569
rolling down the path and i'm going to keep rolling down the path and i'm going to keep rolling down

515
00:29:15,569 --> 00:29:15,630
the path and i'm going to keep rolling down the path and i'm going to keep rolling down the path

516
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,930
great mccray has changed the face of coaching a bit in australian rules football for me john and

517
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:25,150
has uh left the mark already in a in a unique way what's it been like connecting with him the way

518
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:30,569
you have i love when he tells us how he's you know approaches a team meeting and um one time i think

519
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:37,089
you dressed up i can't remember what you dressed up as but i've dressed up a few times and i and

520
00:29:37,089 --> 00:29:42,450
i'm just picturing myself dressed up walking into the change room i go maybe my group's not ready

521
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:45,410
for that yet um yeah just just all those

522
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:50,670
And, you know, Fly is very, he's wanting to learn.

523
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:52,170
You talk about energy, you've got energy.

524
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,809
You've got energy and abundance.

525
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:58,930
And the thing that I noticed straight away was when he became the head coach,

526
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,369
it wasn't about winning or losing.

527
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:05,630
It was about the process and made sure that his club was going to be like that.

528
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:10,950
And I think that, you know, we spoke about shaking hands maybe on one of the first calls.

529
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,009
And you said that the first media conference you went into,

530
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:17,910
you shook everyone's hand and, you know, people that didn't like Collingwood,

531
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,430
I know you're here, Eddie, there was a lot of people that didn't like Collingwood,

532
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:26,130
but they ended up loving Collingwood because of Fly and the way that he comes across,

533
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:31,349
the way that he speaks to, you know, people in the press and then, you know, his playing group.

534
00:30:31,569 --> 00:30:36,309
And so, you know, that really sticks with me whenever I hear him talk, but they love him.

535
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,269
You know, he dropped the player today.

536
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,430
He probably still loves him, that player, you know,

537
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,950
because when you're picking,

538
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:49,410
you know, we have a squad of 23 and I know that 12 players are going to be pissed off with me.

539
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,490
It's just part of it.

540
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:56,730
But it's the way you do it, you know, and you can see that, you know, he does it the right way.

541
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,009
Mike Dunlap, tell us a bit about Craig McRae.

542
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:07,809
The best part of him was on Mother's Day and they had a match

543
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:13,470
and he had a mother of one of the players come in and give the pregame.

544
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:13,990
Remember?

545
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:19,470
Number one, that took courage and number two is it was spellbinding

546
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:26,250
and it captivated the group because in what you do and it's violent

547
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:32,190
and there's a physicality to the sport, but yet there's a tenderness underneath

548
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:36,190
and that's the human factor of all the athletes in there.

549
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:43,930
And so it just goes to show you can be fierce, but you also can be sensitive and sincere.

550
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:51,250
And humble and that act in and of itself, I brought it home to my wife Molly and I showed it to her

551
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:58,529
and it just stunned her and stopped her because in a male world of sport,

552
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:02,369
that connection with your wife, your family and all that is really hard.

553
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:09,089
So really what he was saying to his team is that it's a whole, it's not just what we do.

554
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:13,470
You impact your family name and he brought it to the fore

555
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:17,549
without being didactic and having to lay the lesson in front of them.

556
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:20,430
It was absolutely brilliant.

557
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,390
So that's what I can tell you about it.

558
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:25,029
Thanks Mike, what a beautiful moment that was and great we all got to share in it.

559
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:27,950
Ronnie, talk us through your relationship with Craig McRae.

560
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,950
He challenges the norm and that comes with incredible risk at times.

561
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:37,670
I think clubs are stooped in history along with organisations

562
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:41,150
and to take it in a different direction comes with its risk.

563
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,410
But I've taken a lot away from that.

564
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:42,910
Like,

565
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,109
I think it's the way to go.

566
00:32:44,109 --> 00:32:45,990
I think coaching has been done a certain way in the past,

567
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,710
but that doesn't mean it should be done that way in the future.

568
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,950
But as I said, that takes a lot of risk and he has changed the face of coaching,

569
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,789
I believe as well, in AFL football in particular.

570
00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:56,789
Craig, I'm going to go back and we're going to talk about Andrew McDonald now,

571
00:32:56,789 --> 00:33:01,069
who could not have landed more success for the Australian cricket team.

572
00:33:01,069 --> 00:33:04,789
We know how competitive an environment that is and so much scrutiny.

573
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:05,789
Tell us about what you've learnt from him.

574
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:07,390
Can we just talk a bit more about me a bit more?

575
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,309
I'm blushing, I'm blushing.

576
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:12,710
No, I'm a massive critic.

577
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,950
I'm a cricket nuffie, so I watch all the games.

578
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:19,029
And so when I'm getting the inner sanctum stuff of all the cricket,

579
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:20,869
I start and watch the Ashes and the World Cup

580
00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:23,789
and I'm riding every ball with the games.

581
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:27,910
And then to see the insight and hear the storytelling

582
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:32,470
and hear the inner sanctum stuff, I've been very fortunate with that.

583
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:35,230
I think he's a leader in so many ways.

584
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:38,710
Probably the biggest thing I see that we only caught up in the MCG

585
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,190
only a couple of weeks ago,

586
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,829
the amount of work that goes into how many different

587
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:44,990
travel teams that you're part of.

588
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:49,269
Like they're playing 2020s into one days, into test matches, all like that.

589
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:52,869
It struck me when you said that we have a different vision for every team

590
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:55,549
or a different cultural values or something like that.

591
00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:56,309
Remind me of that.

592
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:57,750
Yeah, different layers, different, yeah.

593
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,829
Yeah, and it astounded me that you're going to have a different,

594
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:04,630
like Pat Cummins comes into the 2020 game and then he goes to one day

595
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,309
and it's like this one, I'm going,

596
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:08,070
oh, don't you have the baggy green?

597
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,469
And we're all in the baggy green all the time.

598
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:12,070
So having different layers of doing things really,

599
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:15,030
opened my eyes and ears,

600
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,590
hence that it doesn't always have to be the same delivery.

601
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,429
See what I did then, I used cricket for the analogy.

602
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:25,190
But I think in terms of leadership, we're all so different.

603
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:29,550
And I think you bring a level of consistency in one way,

604
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,429
having to evolve so many different,

605
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:34,429
you're coaching three teams really with the one coach,

606
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:36,070
which is a challenge in itself.

607
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,230
Mike, did you get to know cricket in your time here in Australia?

608
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,550
It's a unique sport.

609
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:42,190
And have you found the coach of the Australian cricket team?

610
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:48,030
Well, enough to know that it stretches your attention span and I'm ADHD,

611
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:52,670
so you got to be ready for the moments because to me,

612
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,710
it's a game of moments.

613
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,909
The thing is that when you start to learn on these conference calls,

614
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:03,949
Zoom, that it's messy what he does because of where he goes.

615
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:07,150
He has different layers of teams and player combinations.

616
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:10,829
He has to deal with circumstance of your opponent.

617
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:11,630
So,

618
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:16,909
you have in your pocket your plan and they say work your plan and you have

619
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:21,889
your tenets of what's going to drive your success and I find that Andrew's

620
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:26,809
very nimble with hard and fast rules and he understands how to shift gears

621
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:32,269
quickly and you know companies and people that do that you can still not

622
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:36,230
lose your way with your compass but you have to understand is the world's messy

623
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:41,869
and those that adjust quickly and not radically but can hold their identity

624
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:45,170
and he holds his identity and the other thing I told him is he ever loses his

625
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:50,210
job that voice is made for radio commercial acting all of that he's got a

626
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:54,869
beautiful voice I'm jealous John I wish you tell us about your experience with

627
00:35:54,869 --> 00:36:00,409
Andrew McDonald yeah I just see that Andrew is very calm and you know I think

628
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:03,530
it was one of the first tours in Pakistan and there was a few issues and

629
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:09,710
and you just you know made the group embrace that and and and how they could

630
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,829
you know be better for it and you know I think it was one of the first tours in

631
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:11,849
Pakistan and there was a few issues and and you just you know made the group embrace that and and and how they could you know be better for it and

632
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:14,909
then you know they remember that because it was a difficult situation I

633
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:19,650
can't recall that the whole story and I was like wow you get in the group to buy

634
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:23,429
into you know that the end no problem we're in this together and then we'll

635
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:27,389
come through stronger together and then it reflected a couple of years later

636
00:36:27,389 --> 00:36:32,730
when you played in the the World Cup final in India and you know how many

637
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:38,150
people hundred so yeah hundred thousand not expected to win but you you had a

638
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:41,809
game plan and you knew that you would win and then so that was the belief that

639
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:46,170
he gives the group and you know you can just see it in the way the players you

640
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,809
know step out onto the field they got a belief in the game plan they got a

641
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:54,289
belief in what they're doing and no matter if it's t20 or you know the 50

642
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:58,929
overs or test match and then you know even when they're dealing with difficult

643
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:02,690
situations you never see him flustered and then that that goes a long way

644
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:07,250
because we know how much pressure there is on the cricket team you know everyone

645
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,730
follows the Australian national team and they want them to do well when they're

646
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,769
not doing well

647
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:15,769
they get scrutinized pretty quickly we are just about out of time you can see

648
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:18,750
there's a deep connection now here on the panel I could go for another three

649
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,170
hours if time permitted but I believe there's some questions from the audience

650
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:27,190
we might just take one given time and I'm going to pitch this to Mike Dunlap

651
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:32,309
who is full of wisdom this question is coming from the audience here Mike at

652
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:35,989
Sport Next in Melbourne thinking about how we can apply your best coaching

653
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:40,289
practices to our business world what's the single most important thing you do

654
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:41,329
to coach a winning team

655
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:45,869
to make sure that you use your eyes to see what you have because whatever your

656
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:51,250
plan is if you go away from the collection of talent you have and getting

657
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,610
to know your talent

658
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:57,090
you're gonna go down the wrong path so you are the people that you surround

659
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:01,889
yourself by and the greatest thing that a leader does is pick those people be

660
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:05,989
selective who gets in your house we don't let everybody in your house and

661
00:38:05,989 --> 00:38:10,650
you have your own standard so you can win a lot when you pick the right people

662
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:12,110
because the winning is in the picking.

663
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:15,849
And so I would say that really focus and take your time.

664
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:18,670
As they say, hire slow, fire fast,

665
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:21,550
kind of that little cliche that people use.

666
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:25,030
But more importantly, the sub-point of that is do your homework.

667
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,010
Put your hands together and thank our panel,

668
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,409
