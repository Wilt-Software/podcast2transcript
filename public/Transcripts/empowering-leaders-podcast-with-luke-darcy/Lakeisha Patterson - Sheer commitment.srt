1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,410
How do you build a mindset of incredible resilience,

2
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:12,289
gratefulness and positivity

3
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:15,410
despite life presenting you with extraordinary challenges?

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,219
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

5
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:22,719
The idea of self-improvement and leadership

6
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,879
both on and off the field has been a lifelong passion of mine.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,800
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,539
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

9
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,719
in education, sport, industry and the arts

10
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,619
that have helped shift to what we see

11
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,679
as the 21st century style of leadership

12
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:40,159
where everyone has a voice.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,740
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

14
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,200
Lakeisha Patterson, or Lucky as she is most commonly known,

15
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,120
is an Australian Paralympic swimming superstar.

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,799
She is a Queensland, Australian Commonwealth and Paralympic champion,

17
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,060
a six-time world record holder,

18
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,299
a seven-time Paralympic medalist,

19
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:16,260
including two gold in Rio and a gold in Tokyo.

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,260
She's also a two-time Paralympic Commonwealth Games gold medalist,

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,959
as well as being a recipient of the Order of Australia medal

22
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,200
for her outstanding achievements.

23
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:28,140
Lakeisha or Lucky, it is great to meet you.

24
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:28,920
Thanks for joining me.

25
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,200
Thanks for having me on.

26
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:34,180
Now, Lucky, I'm going to be familiar enough to go with Lucky.

27
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,760
And I asked you this before we started recording.

28
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:38,400
You said you feel like you're in trouble if we go with Lakeisha.

29
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,560
So, Lucky, a lot of people would think your start in life

30
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,200
was anything but Lucky.

31
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:46,519
Can you share with us what happened at birth?

32
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:47,859
Yeah, absolutely.

33
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,480
So, for those that don't know me,

34
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,120
I was born with cerebral palsy left hemiplegia

35
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,640
due to the trauma I sustained during birth.

36
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,000
So, essentially, I was born breech, blue and not breathing.

37
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,939
So, it was, yeah, a little bit of a tricky situation.

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,319
And essentially, down the line, because of that trauma sustained,

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,099
I was diagnosed with cerebral palsy.

40
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,460
So, essentially, that means that the left side of my body

41
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,840
doesn't quite work as well as my right.

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,099
I don't have as much function, balance,

43
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:25,300
coordination and, you know, a little challenging things along the way.

44
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,620
So, I can't, you know, fully open my left hand

45
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,319
as well as, like, balance and kind of dragging my left foot a little bit.

46
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,840
So, my right side is definitely more dominant

47
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,360
and I have to do a lot compared to my left.

48
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,199
But I suppose for myself, I've just been accustomed

49
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:46,539
to being able to adapt from a very young age.

50
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:48,740
And alongside that, I was also diagnosed

51
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:52,780
with epilepsy when I was five and micrographia at 12,

52
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,460
meaning that my writing is extremely minute.

53
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,539
So, I have to use technology to be able to communicate.

54
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:02,740
So, it's pretty awesome that we are able to live in the world

55
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,620
that we live in today, that I am able to be able to communicate with people.

56
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,539
But, yeah, I suppose for a lot of people,

57
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:10,460
it can be seen as quite a lot of challenges.

58
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,979
But for myself, I've just been raised to be able to overcome anything

59
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:18,219
that's come my way and I definitely don't see it as a disadvantage at all.

60
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:19,080
It's remarkable.

61
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:23,099
A story at the age of five is when you were diagnosed with epilepsy

62
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,460
and reading some of your life story, a theory that I think you were suggesting

63
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,979
that perhaps it was on the back of a bad batch of vaccinations.

64
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:33,099
And I'm going back to the lucky.

65
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:36,060
I'm here talking to lucky and a lot of people would think,

66
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,219
God, how much hardship does one person have to endure?

67
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,419
How much bad luck?

68
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:44,180
I mean, do you remember ever thinking, why me at some stage along the way?

69
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,580
I think it's definitely very easy for a lot of people when they, you know,

70
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,340
come into these difficult circumstances to say, why me?

71
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,099
And I definitely am human as well and have gone through that.

72
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:59,099
I suppose when I was younger, I didn't really know anything different.

73
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,780
So I don't think I really had that mindset then until, you know,

74
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,960
growing up a little bit more and actually being aware of these differences

75
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,139
compared to my classmates around primary school and high school age.

76
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:15,180
But I suppose for myself, I was just grown up with an incredibly strong mum

77
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,560
who raised myself and my two other sisters on her own.

78
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:21,259
And she really instilled in me that power of resilience.

79
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:25,560
And, you know, it's not what happens to you, it's how and what you make of it

80
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,779
and how you can overcome those circumstances.

81
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:31,500
And yeah, it is a bit ironic that my name and nickname is lucky,

82
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,800
but I suppose for myself, it's also a great way of showing that

83
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,180
despite what challenges have been thrown my way,

84
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,300
I have seen the other side of it.

85
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,480
So yeah, it's all, I suppose, how you approach the situation.

86
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,480
You're the middle of thresholds.

87
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,540
Three girls in the family.

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,759
And you mentioned your beautiful mother who raised the three of you as a single mum.

89
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,180
Tell us about the family support for you.

90
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:00,720
And clearly you had unique challenges along the way.

91
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,040
How did they, did they treat you differently?

92
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:04,740
Did they make allowances?

93
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:06,220
What was it like in your household?

94
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:09,399
Yeah, definitely to me, family is everything.

95
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,620
I would not be who I am or where I am without them.

96
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,939
And for as long as I can remember, it's just been us four girls.

97
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,560
And my mum really is the rock of our family.

98
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:20,420
And the glue that holds us all together.

99
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:25,660
And yeah, from a very young age, I suppose she really instilled in all of us girls

100
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,319
that we can do whatever we want and conceive whatever we want to achieve.

101
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,160
And she worked tirelessly three jobs in order to make sure

102
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,800
that we had access to every opportunity possible like everyone else, no matter what.

103
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:44,879
So I suppose for myself, I tried to just do everything that my sisters were doing.

104
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,300
And mum thought it was really important to throw us into all the different sports

105
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:48,560
and activities.

106
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,459
To make sure that, you know, we were doing something, keeping active and being able to

107
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:56,300
find something that we were interested in and find our passion.

108
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:58,220
And for me, that was really important.

109
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,860
So it felt like I belonged somewhere.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,720
So I tried everything my sisters did.

111
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,879
I did karate, athletics, dancing.

112
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,300
I quickly realised that me and land sports don't really get along well with the balance

113
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,879
and everything.

114
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,500
So it wasn't until I found swimming that I really found, you know, felt like I found

115
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,540
my purpose and something that I could do.

116
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,100
Easily, easily enough compared to everyone else as well.

117
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:25,800
And yeah, I just felt free.

118
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,699
I could move easier than I could on land.

119
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,959
And it kind of all started from there.

120
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,540
And mum and my sisters were able to support me all along the way and, you know, never

121
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,259
told me different.

122
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,980
You know, if I was having a bad day saying, you know, oh, I'm really sore, really tired.

123
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,959
You know, they were the first ones to be my cheerleaders and pick me back up and say,

124
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,420
give it another go and try again.

125
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,680
And yeah.

126
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,459
Yeah.

127
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:51,740
I want to go back and touch.

128
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:57,120
You mentioned the word resilience and I often think, you know, people like me and others

129
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,420
will be listening that, you know, we have our bad moments and our down moments and we're

130
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:01,939
all striving.

131
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,459
I think if you wanted to instill something in your kids, I've got four of them, resilience

132
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,519
would be the word.

133
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,839
I mean, how do you build better resilience?

134
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,399
No one's better placed than you, I think, to understand that.

135
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,740
How does it work in your mind?

136
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:15,600
Yeah, absolutely.

137
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,339
As you mentioned, it's so important.

138
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,100
And I think it really...

139
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,120
It has to start from a young age.

140
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,899
It can be worked on at any age, really.

141
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,560
But I think, suppose that possibly anyone listening that does have kids, starting them

142
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,779
young is really important.

143
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:32,860
I think, you know, we're all going to face challenges in life, no matter what they may

144
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,100
be.

145
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,879
And I suppose what I've always learnt is trying to be creative in the situation.

146
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,600
And there is always another way, even when you can't see it at the time.

147
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,939
And I suppose for myself, if I can't see that other way around the roadblock, it's

148
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:53,399
asking someone else for help as well and not being afraid to reach out to find another

149
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,959
solution because there is always one there.

150
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,420
And I suppose, you know, instead of saying, why me?

151
00:07:58,699 --> 00:07:59,519
Say, try me.

152
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:05,579
You know, it's all about changing that mindset and trying to, you know, remain as calm as

153
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:06,759
possible in the situation.

154
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:11,759
If you have to take some time out to just debrief and look at things a little bit differently,

155
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,019
ask those around you.

156
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,500
Take some time to yourself.

157
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,519
What's your favourite movie or your favourite show?

158
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,899
If that helps.

159
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:24,459
And yeah, it's all about just, it's really hard, I suppose, but it's, everything works

160
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:25,600
different for different people.

161
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,899
So it's just finding something that works for you, but just, yeah, not being able to

162
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:31,459
give up in those situations.

163
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:35,860
And if you do have kids and they're going through something like this or a friend or

164
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,100
a family member, it's just being able to support them in any way possible.

165
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,159
And I think that can really help you mentally feel a bit better to build that resilience.

166
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,899
And the more you do it, the stronger you're going to get.

167
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,419
Yeah, incredible words of wisdom from you, Lucky.

168
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:52,539
Instead of why me, try me.

169
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:53,539
I love that.

170
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:54,539
It just resonates.

171
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:57,139
And yeah, I'm sure for a lot of people, isn't it?

172
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:58,139
It's all perspective, isn't it?

173
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:03,080
The things that are enormous for one person aren't so big for another and, you know, we're

174
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,399
all facing adversity at some level, how we deal with it.

175
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,899
I think you have an incredible perspective on that.

176
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:11,539
I've got this theory, Lucky, that people who achieve great things in sport like you have

177
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:16,539
done and continue to do, have a bit of a sense that they're destined for it at some point

178
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:17,539
in time.

179
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:22,620
You said that you watched the London 2012 Paralympics and you might have turned to mum

180
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,100
and said, I'm going to be in Rio and I'm going to win gold.

181
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,100
Is that a true story?

182
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,100
Is that how it unfolded?

183
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,120
Yes, that definitely is.

184
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,659
I suppose for myself, growing up in a very small community and a very small place with

185
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:40,519
not a lot of people around, let alone people with disabilities, I never really saw other

186
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:44,340
people represented like myself and facing similar challenges.

187
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,460
So when the 2012 Paralympics came around.

188
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:56,340
So I was 13 and this was, I suppose, when I started watching TV and media was around

189
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,340
a little bit more.

190
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,379
And this was the first time I actually saw the Paralympics and people and athletes with

191
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:06,460
disabilities represented and doing phenomenal things.

192
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:12,000
And for myself there, that was such a pivotal moment because it showcased that people with

193
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,139
disabilities are more than just people with disabilities.

194
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:16,700
They can achieve anything they want.

195
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,419
You know?

196
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:22,879
They don't have to be an athlete or somebody else doing something extraordinary, but it

197
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:28,240
just shows the possibilities that are on offer and that really resonated with me to try and

198
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
do something.

199
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,399
And, you know, I saw the Australian athletes doing personal best times and winning medals

200
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,179
and yes, that story is absolutely true.

201
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:41,720
I saw the swimming and at that time that was my main focus on something that I was passionate

202
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
about.

203
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,299
So I turned to mum and I said, mum, I'm going to be competing at the next Paralympic Games.

204
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:46,299
I'm going to be competing at the next Paralympic Games.

205
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:47,299
I'm going to be competing at the next Paralympic Games.

206
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:49,860
I'm going to be competing at the next Paralympic Games in Rio in four years' time and I'm going

207
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,299
to win a gold medal.

208
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:54,419
And I think she was definitely thinking, wow, that's so ambitious.

209
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:55,419
Okay.

210
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:56,419
Don't know how you're going to do it.

211
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:58,620
But sure, you know, if you try hard enough, you'll get there.

212
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,279
Probably not really realising, but I was dead serious that this was going to be my goal.

213
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,860
So I worked at it and tried to, you know, figure out how I was going to make this possible.

214
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:15,840
So obviously I had to, you know, reach out to Paralympics Australia, became classified,

215
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,139
got in touch with swimming coaches.

216
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:20,019
And it all kind of started from there.

217
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:25,139
But I suppose for myself, I never really thought I was particularly talented and would actually

218
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:26,500
achieve this dream.

219
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,080
I think for myself, it was more the hard work and the determination, the resilience that

220
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,080
got me there.

221
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,519
We're seeing that trait, Lucky, with a lot of the people who have been fortunate enough

222
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,519
to interview on this podcast.

223
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:40,899
I caught up with John Aloisi recently, who scored the winning goal to get Australia into

224
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:44,600
the World Cup of Soccer and lucky enough that he's an old school friend.

225
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,259
And he told the story that he would turn to his wife.

226
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:47,100
Yeah.

227
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,919
And anyone around him that he was going to score the winning goal to get Australia into

228
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:50,919
the World Cup.

229
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:55,019
And the people were looking at him like, you're crazy, you know, and what people don't understand

230
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,639
were the setbacks and the hardships and not getting a game along the way.

231
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,220
But there was that inner belief that he was going to step up and do it.

232
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,840
And of course he did in legendary fashion.

233
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,539
And I look at you and I went back and watched your race.

234
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:09,799
You're on the starting blocks then.

235
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:12,379
So Rio 2016, it's a dream.

236
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:15,379
And then all of a sudden you're swimming against your idol.

237
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:16,580
You've followed Jess Long.

238
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:22,159
She's a Paralympic legend, a United States and a firm favourite.

239
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,340
And you just have the race of your life, a PB by five seconds.

240
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,340
You break the world record.

241
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,340
You win gold.

242
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,820
I mean, when you reflect on that, what are your thoughts now?

243
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,940
It's absolutely crazy thinking back to that moment, you know, it all kind of happened

244
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,940
so quickly.

245
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:42,299
But I suppose for myself heading into the games, not many other people probably had

246
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:44,960
expectations upon me as to what I could achieve.

247
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,360
And if I would get there.

248
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,600
And, you know, particularly win a gold medal per se, I'd been representing Australia now

249
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,120
for a couple of years in the lead up to this, but I hadn't really made my mark until 2016.

250
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:04,120
I changed coaches, worked the hardest I'd ever, you know, worked and trained in my life

251
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,360
while still trying to complete year 12.

252
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,960
And I did have this inner belief in me that I could achieve this goal.

253
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,799
I knew that I had put all the work in.

254
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,039
I knew that I had all the right support around me.

255
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,039
I knew that I had all the right support around me.

256
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:16,240
I knew that I had all the right support around me.

257
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,340
I knew that I had all the right support around me.

258
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,480
I had the faith.

259
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,639
I had the trust in my coach, my support team and my family.

260
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:27,419
And I just headed into that race, not suppose putting too much pressure on myself, but just

261
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:28,759
wanting to enjoy the moment.

262
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,600
And I knew that all the hard work was behind me.

263
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:34,399
So it was just about putting it all together and having fun.

264
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:40,500
And in a way still, though, I remember being on the blocks and telling myself, OK, lucky,

265
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,440
just breathe, go in, have fun.

266
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:46,139
After the first 50 meters, I remember thinking, lucky.

267
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:47,879
You didn't come all this way to come second.

268
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,980
So let's show them what you've got.

269
00:13:49,980 --> 00:14:08,179
And every 100 meters was slightly, you know, edging a little bit further and further in front until, you know, I touched the wall, finished the race and seeing that number one next to my name and seeing that I had done a five second BB, I think for me was also the massive accomplishment.

270
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:15,840
And then realizing I had won and then broken the world record by 0.11 of a second was, I suppose, the cherry on top.

271
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:30,100
And, yeah, it was just such a such a relief and such a special moment to to show people that, you know, you can overcome anything and to prove all those people wrong that said I couldn't do it or I'll never get anywhere or never be anything.

272
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:41,139
And I think those that are really successful in life in whatever they choose to do, you know, have overcome adversity and have those people telling you you can't do this or you can't do that.

273
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:45,340
But it really does push us forward to strive to go more.

274
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:45,700
And.

275
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,779
To prove people wrong.

276
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,100
I think that's a big motivation for a lot of people and particularly me as well along my journey.

277
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,100
I encourage you, if you haven't seen that, go back and watch it.

278
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,600
You can check out Lucky's website.

279
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,299
Look up Lakeisha Patterson and you'll see it there.

280
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:05,440
And you look like someone who is born to swim.

281
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:11,759
I mean, you move so beautifully in the water and you describe the cerebral palsy effects, your left side and all the challenges.

282
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:14,159
It doesn't make sense when you watch you swim.

283
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,139
You think, God, you just.

284
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:18,500
Are so graceful in the water and you make it look.

285
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,139
Does it feel like when you're a water in the water that this really is what you're meant to do?

286
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:24,240
Yeah, definitely.

287
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,139
I think absolutely.

288
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:38,419
Since I started swimming as soon as I started, you know, initially for therapy, but I instantly knew that this was something that felt like home and could take me places.

289
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,940
So then when I watched, you know, the Paralympics, it kind of reinstilled that.

290
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:44,220
And for myself, it's just so freeing.

291
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:44,639
No matter.

292
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:49,340
No matter what it's, you know, you come home, you have a bad day or whatever.

293
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,519
You dive into the pool, you blow your bubbles and you just forget about everything else.

294
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,139
So for myself, it's not only, you know, physical therapy, it's mental therapy as well.

295
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:07,240
And I definitely notice, though, if there's days that I can't swim or I'm out for quite a period of time, I definitely notice it outside on the land.

296
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,879
My body is definitely a lot more stiff and and swimming by no means is easy for me.

297
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,100
It's taken a long time to get to this point.

298
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:15,080
And.

299
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:19,059
You know, a couple of days out of the water is like a year for me.

300
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:22,059
It takes a long time to get back into it and get into the rhythm.

301
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:24,000
But, yeah, I don't know.

302
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:29,980
It's just so freeing feeling when you when you can move through the water, you're at peace and it all just comes together.

303
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,039
Yeah.

304
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,820
Beautifully said.

305
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:41,039
You mentioned before about being inspired, seeing the London Olympics and watching people, you know, who had disabilities and thinking that could that could be me.

306
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,679
Dylan Alcott has just been named the Australian of the Year in recent times.

307
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:52,639
As someone who's a great ambassador yourself, how important is it to have someone like Dylan now as the as the Australian of the Year?

308
00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:03,980
I think it's incredibly important and so exceptional and astonishing, you know, being able to have that representation out there and show others in the younger generation what is possible.

309
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:14,900
Because, you know, for a lot of us and particularly, you know, Dylan has mentioned it before growing up and the same for myself, if we're coming from small communities or even.

310
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:25,259
Larger communities, we're not always often represented in the media, on TV, social media, on, you know, in stories, movies in our communities.

311
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:39,420
So to be able to see ourselves represented on a large scale in a positive way is so important to show people not only people with disabilities, but showing everyone within our community what we can achieve.

312
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,940
And we are just like everyone else.

313
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,119
Yeah, we may be a little bit different, but that's what makes the world so incredible.

314
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,059
We're all unique if we're all the same.

315
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,799
I think it would be incredibly boring.

316
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,339
So it's absolutely fantastic.

317
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:59,960
And Dylan's really paving the way to show others, you know, what we're capable of and in the inclusion and diversity space is so important.

318
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:10,920
And, yeah, I encourage everyone, whether you have a disability or not, to, you know, reach out to those with a disability and see how you can talk to them, make their life a little bit easier.

319
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,380
And I think we can all learn a lot from each other.

320
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,119
It's such a great way.

321
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,940
It's such a great way to explain it, like, isn't it?

322
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:22,039
I mean, we've all got quirks and we are all different and we're all weird in some ways, isn't it?

323
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:29,000
When you break it all down, you think, you know, when you speak out loud about some of our traits and often we're scared to do that.

324
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:33,559
But really, as you said, that is the beauty, isn't it, of watching that diversity?

325
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:44,619
Do you feel like, you know, you're still young age, you know, you're in your early 20s, that it is a better place now that we're able to, A, have opportunities that weren't there perhaps 10, 15, 20 years ago?

326
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:44,680
Yeah.

327
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:51,599
Do you feel like we're moving forward or in your mind, hey, we've still got a long, long way to go here for people that have challenges like yours?

328
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,619
Yeah, absolutely.

329
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:59,180
I can tell myself, you know, being 23 now compared to on the Australian swim team, I feel like a veteran.

330
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,099
I feel like I've been there for quite a while.

331
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:12,000
But I do feel like particularly from when I first started swimming to, you know, where it is now, not only in the sport side of things, but worldwide and social media,

332
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,440
we are seeing a big improvement in diversity and inclusion and acceptance and representation.

333
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:22,039
However, we definitely do still have a long way to go.

334
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:28,279
But we are so thankful for those pioneers that started well before us to get us into this space.

335
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:39,279
And, you know, it's not just about the disability space as well, but, you know, race, gender, all of those, you know, minorities and groups.

336
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,619
We're really seeing the representation.

337
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,539
It matters now.

338
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:44,220
And we definitely still have a long way to go.

339
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:53,940
But I think it's great that we are able to have these role models and people that we can look up to now that are sharing and paving the way for us in the future.

340
00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:00,420
And I hope that, you know, what I'm doing now is able to inspire other people to move in the right direction as well.

341
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,440
Yeah, it's great.

342
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:09,539
And as you said, going back to Dylan Alcott, he's an incredible person, a great person to meet and be around and, you know, a wonderful choice as Australian of the Year.

343
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,940
And hopefully that continues.

344
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,400
As you said, you mentioned social media.

345
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,839
I did want to touch on this with you.

346
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:22,079
Twenty-three years of age, it's in your sphere much more than it certainly was mine at the same age.

347
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:30,500
But you've also disgracefully and remarkably been on the receiving end, as probably everyone has, you know, of the nastiness of cyberbullying.

348
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,220
And tell us about that.

349
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,700
How have you dealt with that?

350
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:36,220
And I suppose to other young people, what's your advice?

351
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,640
Yeah, it's definitely tough, I suppose, in every situation.

352
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:41,359
You have pros and cons.

353
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,299
With the positives that come with social media, there are obviously definitely a lot of negatives as well.

354
00:20:47,299 --> 00:21:05,619
And that does come with cyberbullying and a lot of more, a lot more people, sorry, you know, feel like they have the courage to say things to you online that they probably wouldn't say to your face in person because they can hide behind a keyboard and a different username and all of that.

355
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:11,980
And I have received quite a bit of cyberbullying, I suppose, when I started my swimming journey in the past.

356
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:25,019
A lot of negativity and nasty comments from, you know, different athletes, parents, people around the globe questioning my abilities and everything else.

357
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:30,359
It's quite difficult and challenging, I suppose, for myself going through that stage.

358
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:40,279
I was, you know, just an early teenager, you know, being thrust into the limelight, the international stage, and now all of these circumstances as well was really challenging it.

359
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,680
And it definitely hit me hard.

360
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:51,660
Initially, and I remember feeling worthless and getting really upset because I was like, you know, these people don't even know me.

361
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,140
They don't know what I go through and they, you know, what gives them the right to be able to say this about me.

362
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:07,819
But I'm really thankful that I have such an incredible support system around me, you know, with the swim team, my family, my coaches and that key network.

363
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,420
I was able to speak to sports psychologists.

364
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,740
And, um.

365
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:28,339
You know, family and friends that really helped me and reassured me and, you know, gave me the advice that really this is a small minority of people in the grand scheme of things that have this one opinion compared to everybody else that knows you and knows how hard you work.

366
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,839
So why are you letting it impact you and affect the way you feel?

367
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:38,220
And that was a real turning point for me to kind of push that aside and be like, you know what?

368
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:38,759
You're right.

369
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:41,799
I shouldn't let these people affect.

370
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,180
The way, you know, I'm living my life and the way I'm feeling when I have no idea who they are.

371
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:53,539
And, you know, we also have the beauty of being able to block people, delete comments and and things like that now, too.

372
00:22:53,539 --> 00:23:01,259
So I suppose I would say to anyone else, you know, don't it's easier said than done, obviously, but try not to let it affect you.

373
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:11,980
If anything, it helps grow that motivation in me to to push harder and go faster and show them, I suppose, what they're missing out on by getting to know me.

374
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:25,299
Yeah, the the ability to compartmentalize that as you did and as you said, to lean on a support network, which is incredibly strong when you when you talk and read about your family and the team that you've got around you.

375
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,160
But as you said, it's it is difficult.

376
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:35,099
I see it in my own kids and the brilliance of how they can connect with it is incredible and how easily they communicate.

377
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:39,640
But, you know, at the same time, everyone knows each other's location, it seems.

378
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,980
And, you know, if you're if you're being invited somewhere.

379
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,819
It's like it's challenging, isn't it?

380
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:48,440
There's there's so many elements to it that are new and we're working our way through it.

381
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:50,099
It's it's been interesting.

382
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:54,680
So people like you and leaders that have found a way through it, it tells a great story.

383
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,839
And I wanted to talk to you about that.

384
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,299
We're really passionate about this new generation of leaders that we're talking to.

385
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:08,400
And I see you very much in that community of being humble and being self-aware and a self-improver and having a massive positive impact on others.

386
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:10,460
Do you see yourself as a leader?

387
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:11,960
I'd like to think.

388
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,900
So I think initially I probably didn't.

389
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:26,539
I was just sharing my story and being authentic to myself and showing others who I am and, you know, instilling that positive mindset and optimism, which is very much me.

390
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,880
But, yeah, now I think I definitely do.

391
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:40,819
And it's great to be told sometimes from younger swimmers or parents and families saying, hey, my daughter and my son or whoever looks up to you.

392
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:46,200
And, you know, your values and what you're instilling to them is really making a difference in their life.

393
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,920
And I think that is so humbling to me.

394
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And it's really important because I just want to show who I am and show others that you don't have to be anyone else.

395
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:56,559
You just have to be your authentic self.

396
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,619
And I've definitely learned a lot.

397
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,500
I've done a lot of leadership courses and self-improvement.

398
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:10,640
And now I've been named as one of the para-athlete leaders on our swim team to, you know, carry our team towards the path.

399
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,539
To Paris and hopefully beyond that as well, which is really quite inciting.

400
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,380
But to myself, you know, you don't really need a title to be a leader.

401
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,799
Anyone can be a leader in their own way.

402
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:29,240
You know, we all have different strengths and tweaks and twerks that, you know, make us who we are.

403
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,960
And we all have something different and valuable to offer.

404
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:39,799
So it's being able to, you know, unite one another, speak to one another and learn a lot by listening.

405
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,779
And communicating to others.

406
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,420
So it is a really exciting space.

407
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,039
And I do hope that I can improve in the future.

408
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:51,059
I know I've got a lot to learn and a lot to share.

409
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,640
But it's exciting what can, you know, come.

410
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:55,579
Yeah.

411
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:05,640
And the characteristics we're talking about, someone who's achieved what you have at your age with the challenges but still have that thought about improving and getting better and sharing it with others.

412
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,799
They're the unique traits we think of great leadership.

413
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:09,779
And you've got all of that.

414
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:16,839
And I did want to flow from there now into these dimensions of leadership that we're really passionate about, the work that we're doing in this space.

415
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,359
And so please be expansive on this, Lucky.

416
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:21,660
There are questions without notice for you.

417
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:23,920
But we start with self-leadership.

418
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,960
We see leaders really are aware of their own sense of leadership for themselves.

419
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,900
What does that mean to you?

420
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:30,819
Yeah, absolutely.

421
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,920
I think it's so important.

422
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,299
And for myself, it's just improving me and being the best person I can, really.

423
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,180
First and foremost, I'm a person.

424
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,319
And I want to improve on that.

425
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,619
It's not always just the athlete side of things.

426
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:48,559
And I've always been drawn to bettering myself.

427
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,960
And I know not really in the sense of chasing perfection because I don't think perfection is really attainable.

428
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,700
Nobody is ever going to be perfect.

429
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,539
And that's 100% fine.

430
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:08,859
But, you know, learning more about yourself and how you operate and the way you do things and how you can also better interact with other people and by engaging them and listening.

431
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:11,619
And actively listening is also really important.

432
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:20,160
And, you know, taking time out for yourself and discovering hobbies and what you enjoy, I think, is really important.

433
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:27,160
Because if you don't look after yourself, you can't properly look after someone else or engage with them in a better way.

434
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:36,619
So I do a lot of reading, you know, autobiographies and self-improvement books, podcasts, all that kind of thing.

435
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:37,619
I love reading.

436
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:41,559
Learning and listening to other people's stories as well.

437
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:50,539
It's just so incredible because we've all come from different walks of life and doing things differently and achieving things differently as well.

438
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,440
So it's pretty incredible to see.

439
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:57,960
Yeah, you're speaking the language of a lot of leaders that I have spoken to on this podcast.

440
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:04,980
And a lot of the coaches are really now so much more about seeing their players as the whole person.

441
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,839
And if they support them as whole people, they naturally get better.

442
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:09,900
They get better results as athletes.

443
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:13,500
And, you know, it's very interesting that you see yourself in that way.

444
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:17,140
I'm not surprised, given who you are and what you've achieved.

445
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:22,180
The idea that leaders really consciously think about how they positively impact others in their environment.

446
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,579
Clearly, you have done that, continue to do it.

447
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,099
Is that something you think of, how you impact others?

448
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:27,940
Yeah, definitely.

449
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:32,559
And I think that's the world we live in today as well, particularly with social media.

450
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:38,839
You know, I personally think about, okay, what I'm putting out there, how it's going to affect me.

451
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:39,559
How it's going to affect other people.

452
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:49,019
I would never intentionally want to put something out there that's going to be, you know, offend people or, you know, those kind of things.

453
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:53,119
So for myself, I'm a very optimistic person most of the time.

454
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,759
I am human, though.

455
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:55,680
I have bad days.

456
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:56,559
Everyone does.

457
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:08,720
But, yeah, they're the messages I like to share as well as, you know, sometimes if also showing on social media, not just the highlights, because as I mentioned, not everything is going to be perfect.

458
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,960
And showing people that it is okay to be vulnerable.

459
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,880
It is okay to go through challenges and circumstances and not feel great all the time.

460
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,319
It's okay to not be okay and to, you know, but in those situations, you don't have to give up and give in.

461
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,500
There's support around you.

462
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:38,660
And so it's important for me to show both sides of that and to show people, you know, what they can do and leaning in on everyone else and just being, you know, authentic to yourself and being able to.

463
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,299
Represent that as much as I can.

464
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:55,019
We see leaders really conscious of how they create and share their vision.

465
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:02,940
And you shared a little bit of your vision as a 13-year-old on the couch with mum watching the Paralympics and really going after that.

466
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,480
How have you gone about doing that in terms of creating and sharing a vision?

467
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,099
Again, I think this is something that is different for everybody.

468
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,460
For myself, I'm a very big goal person.

469
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:15,480
I love setting goals.

470
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:17,599
And doing all of that.

471
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,640
And you can do that in multiple different ways.

472
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:26,039
If you're a visual person, you can write them down, create a vision board, little things like that.

473
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:33,079
Myself being technology savvy, because I have to be, that's the way I do it.

474
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:44,559
But also, you know, I'll write down or type up in my case, you know, my big goals, midterm goals and small goals.

475
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,519
And then break that down.

476
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:48,779
And then break that down even further into how I'm going to achieve them.

477
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:53,220
So the small steps along the way in order to get to that major goal.

478
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:57,660
But along the way, I suppose it can seem quite, you know, lofty.

479
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:03,500
I think a lot of people will have this big dream or big vision and no idea how to get there.

480
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:10,539
Or it could be a three-year goal and you have no idea how you're going to go in that time.

481
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,099
It's a long time to be working towards something.

482
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:15,099
So I think it's really important to set.

483
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:18,960
Celebrate those small goals and the small wins and victories along the way.

484
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,880
And you can tick them off your list.

485
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,539
And it's that sense of gratification along the journey that what you're doing is worth it.

486
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:26,859
And it's not all for nothing.

487
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:31,420
And you can see that you are actually working towards that goal.

488
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,339
And you are getting there.

489
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
You are making progress.

490
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,980
And I know for me, sometimes, say, I'm swimming.

491
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:37,940
I'm doing a session.

492
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:39,539
I'm incredibly sore.

493
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:40,259
I'm tired.

494
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,779
I'm not mentally feeling it.

495
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,440
And, you know, you're thinking, is this all worth it?

496
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,519
Like, what am I doing?

497
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,779
I'm pushing myself beyond breaking point.

498
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:48,440
For what?

499
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,559
So when it does get to those days, I go back to thinking about those small things.

500
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:59,200
I'm like, okay, instead of thinking about, you know, my time, I'll think about my execution.

501
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:01,559
Am I doing my turns properly?

502
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,380
I'll just focus on one thing at a time.

503
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,940
And it really does help you get to the big goals in the end.

504
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:14,480
So it's, yeah, just breaking things up and focusing on the small things and celebrating those victories whenever you can.

505
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:15,359
Yeah.

506
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:15,400
Yeah.

507
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:15,440
Yeah.

508
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:15,500
Yeah.

509
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:21,680
It's a common theme hearing, Lucky, the ability and the need to celebrate those little wins along the way.

510
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,720
It's a great trade.

511
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,180
And it was uncommon in the past.

512
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:29,019
It didn't seem as though that was encouraged unless you won a gold medal.

513
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,220
But that may never happen.

514
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:32,900
In your case, it's happened, you know, on a few occasions.

515
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:37,400
But for those that don't, if you're not really celebrating, perhaps it's harder to get there.

516
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,759
So it's great of you to share that.

517
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,980
The idea of curiosity, you just mentioned you love a reading, you love a learning.

518
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:45,099
I can hear that very much in the person that you are.

519
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:45,140
Yeah.

520
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:49,119
We see leaders really using curiosity as their way to learn and improve.

521
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,420
Does that resonate with you?

522
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:51,400
Yeah, absolutely.

523
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:57,519
And like you said, it's definitely something you do see in a lot of people, a lot of leaders.

524
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:06,480
They do have these common traits and characteristics and that ability and that need and that desire to become better and to learn more.

525
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,279
And as, you know, I've alluded to a little bit earlier, we obviously all do things differently.

526
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,880
But curiosity is really important.

527
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,259
And I think it's something that should be instilled in a lot of us from a very young age.

528
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:26,279
And I think that comes with being exposed to different things and different opportunities and trying your hand at everything.

529
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:32,180
Because unless you try all these different things, you never know what you're going to be interested in or what it could lead to.

530
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:43,440
Instead of just being, you know, shoved in one path, you have all these opportunities and possibilities that you're able to explore and being able to continuously work on that.

531
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,759
And try different things.

532
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:51,420
And try different things is going to help you get to where you want to go or places you never even dreamed you could go.

533
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,359
I'm really big on that at the moment, Lucky.

534
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,299
And I love the way you express that.

535
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:02,039
And I might have referenced in the podcast recently just a book that I read called Reigned.

536
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:04,400
The author, I think, is David Epstein off the top of my head.

537
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:10,579
And he talks exactly like you said, that people who really end up with this great creative life sample lots of different things.

538
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:14,579
And in the past, it might have looked like failure where, you know, as you said, I tried karate.

539
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,500
It wasn't for me.

540
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:16,219
I tried dancing.

541
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,860
It wasn't for me.

542
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:28,619
But they really, you know, in the end, helped form what your passion was and not to be afraid of just continually trying to have range and collaborate with extensive people.

543
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,940
And it sounds like you do that regularly and you do that well.

544
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,280
Does that make sense?

545
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,440
Has that sort of helped you all those experiences along the way?

546
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,659
Yeah, absolutely.

547
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:44,219
And I suppose, as you just mentioned, a lot of people may think, you know, trying different things or it's not working out or failure means the end of it.

548
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:48,460
But I think really failure is just a step towards that success.

549
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,719
Everybody fails in life.

550
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,320
Even now in my swimming career, I don't always win.

551
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,219
Things don't always go my way.

552
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,079
You know, you're going to fail.

553
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,239
It's inevitable.

554
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:02,960
But really, it's how you pick yourself up after those failures that lead to those successes.

555
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,039
And failure is just a turning point and showing you, OK, this didn't work out.

556
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,659
Let's go back to the drawing board and see how I can make it better.

557
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:13,820
So being able to kind of.

558
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:18,360
Get over that fear of failure is going to essentially help you grow as well.

559
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,039
And so important when trying out different things.

560
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:21,579
Yeah.

561
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:25,119
And again, I'm thinking of the great coaches we've been lucky enough to speak to.

562
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:31,940
And they are just so big on making mistakes and taking risks and supporting, encouraging that more than ever.

563
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:39,579
And for the junior coaches listening and for the people that are mentoring young people, you just got to back people in and encourage them to make mistakes.

564
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:42,239
It's how you learn and coach through that lens.

565
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,679
I think you've got that so right.

566
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:49,780
But communicating with clarity is a dimension we're seeing as a really common trait of leaders like you.

567
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,900
You're an incredible speaker.

568
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,039
I've been listening to a lot of your talks in preparation for this.

569
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:57,079
If you want to book Lucky as a guest speaker, I encourage you to do that.

570
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,500
Check out her website.

571
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:00,619
She's incredibly articulate.

572
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,840
Is that something that you've worked on, your communication?

573
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,059
Yeah, absolutely.

574
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,860
And it's something that definitely hasn't come easy.

575
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:13,659
But I suppose from a very young age, my mum, as again, as I alluded to earlier,

576
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:16,579
really gave us the opportunity to do everything we could.

577
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:22,659
And for myself, having cerebral palsy, speaking hasn't always been something that has been very easy.

578
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:31,500
I struggle here and again, every now and again, you know, with my brain being impacted, obviously, neurologically.

579
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,099
It's not always easy.

580
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:41,139
So it's something that I wanted to work on to be able to give me the best opportunity at life and to be able to share my story is incredible.

581
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,659
And so, you know, from a very young age.

582
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,659
Mum got myself and my sisters involved in like gavel club and public speaking.

583
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,760
I'm just really putting us out there to try and do different things.

584
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,139
And I was vice captain in primary school.

585
00:36:55,159 --> 00:37:01,960
And then obviously growing up through the swimming world, I was kind of thrust into that, that limelight very early on.

586
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,679
And I had to just learn how to adapt.

587
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,460
And I'm definitely not an extroverted person by any means.

588
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:10,460
So it's not always easy communicating to people.

589
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,920
But I do love it.

590
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,179
And I definitely learn a lot.

591
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:21,059
And that's something that I've really been passionate about growing and learning more so that I am able to communicate better and more effective with people.

592
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:22,260
And it's crazy.

593
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,900
Now I am studying a communication and digital media degree.

594
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,199
So it's really exciting.

595
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:37,039
And just being able to, again, work on, you know, weaknesses, develop them into your strengths and find where you go from there.

596
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,159
It's pretty incredible.

597
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:43,019
And I've been able to meet extraordinary people all over the world to be exceptional things.

598
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:45,199
And I'm definitely still learning and growing.

599
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:48,079
But, yeah, it is definitely something that's really important to me.

600
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:54,019
Yeah, she sounds like an incredible champion, your mum, in every sense, every time you mention her impact on you.

601
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:54,880
It's profound.

602
00:37:56,059 --> 00:37:58,880
Collaboration is something that we're seeing regularly.

603
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,599
Leaders really valuing it.

604
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,239
And, you know, reading about you, you've had such a strong team.

605
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:11,420
And I haven't done this too much on the podcast, but I feel like I want to mention your sponsors as well because it looks like you've had some good support in that area as well.

606
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:11,900
I'm not sure.

607
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,139
Is it Funke?

608
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:16,440
It's a swimwear, true protein and pain pod.

609
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,039
So I do want to mention that because we need support of athletes.

610
00:38:20,179 --> 00:38:23,320
It's a hard thing for a lot of athletes to find that support.

611
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:28,840
And you've also given back extensively in the community as well as a number of charities that you've supported.

612
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:31,159
How important has that collaboration been for you?

613
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,019
It's so important and so vital.

614
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:38,900
And I would not be where I am today without the support of, you know, my team around me.

615
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:43,159
I think it is incredibly important and vital to everyone.

616
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,940
That they have a network around them.

617
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:52,980
You know, it definitely does take a village to, well, it's taken a village to raise me and to get me along this journey that I'm on.

618
00:38:52,980 --> 00:39:02,440
And it's not always easy, I suppose, being an athlete and to get sponsors and people that are willing to invest in you and help you out throughout your journey.

619
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:07,099
And I am very fortunate to have had incredible people around me.

620
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:12,599
And I want to make sure that the people that I work with align with my values.

621
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:13,139
And I want to make sure that the people that I work with align with my values.

622
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:18,679
And I want to make sure that the people that I work with align with theirs so that we can get the most out of, you know, the collaboration and the partnership.

623
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,719
And I can give back as much as they've been able to help me.

624
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:24,159
It's really special.

625
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:36,280
And I suppose, you know, from my family, my friends, my teammates, my squad to, you know, my sponsors supporting me with my recovery, my training,

626
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:42,820
where all the little things like that is able to help me grow and achieve the best that I can.

627
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:54,920
And, you know, also sharing what they do and the different organisations and how they can help different people in different areas is all really just networking as well.

628
00:39:55,039 --> 00:40:01,420
And being able to get into that space and, you know, this could help someone else, this could help you.

629
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:06,739
And it's really made an impact in my life and I hope it can to others.

630
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:08,760
Final couple of questions.

631
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:13,139
Lucky we've been asking all the leaders that I've been lucky enough to speak to.

632
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:17,639
Lucky, keep saying that the luck's coming up everywhere talking to you.

633
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,059
Who has been the greatest leader in your life?

634
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:22,460
Oh, that's a tough question.

635
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,559
But I suppose probably as cliche as it is, it's definitely been my mum.

636
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:31,780
I know I've mentioned her a lot, but she really is such an incredible person.

637
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:38,760
And like I alluded to a little bit earlier, you know, you don't need a specific title to be a leader.

638
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,000
You don't have to be, you know, the prime minister, the CEO of a company.

639
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:44,860
You don't have to be a manager.

640
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,920
It can be those little people in your life that can make a huge difference.

641
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,039
And my mum has been a massive impact in my life.

642
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:56,920
And I can hands down say I would not be here without her in my life.

643
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,159
She's instilled all these remarkable traits in myself.

644
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:10,159
You know, the strength, determination, resilience, perseverance, going after what you want, not being afraid to fail, giving everything a go.

645
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:12,639
I've learned all of this from her and more.

646
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:32,440
And as well as, you know, a mix of what she's taught me and everyone else I've been able to encounter along my journey, be that coaches, other athletes and friends, people from different organizations and businesses I've been able to meet with and speak with have really shaped me into the person I am today.

647
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:38,019
And, yeah, it's really exciting to see the impact that they've had on my life.

648
00:41:38,139 --> 00:41:41,559
And hopefully I can give that back to them and then to the community.

649
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,440
And hopefully.

650
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:43,579
And hopefully to other people.

651
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:46,079
Yeah, and hopefully mum listens to this.

652
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:58,880
And I'm sure, you know, you've said that to her, but that will be the reward, isn't it, as a parent to understand the impact that she's had, you know, I'm sure on you and your sisters and everyone around her is, you know, another incredible story.

653
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,460
And not told often enough, Lucky, the family legends like your mum.

654
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:06,280
It's great to hear you mention her the way that you do.

655
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,699
In the spirit of collaboration, we love it in our world.

656
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,219
We see great collaboration as a real strength.

657
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:19,320
Collaborate with anyone in the world, Lucky, on any plane, whether it's your sporting life or any other aspect of your life.

658
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,300
Is there someone that jumps out?

659
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,780
Oh, my gosh.

660
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,280
Throwing me in the deep end here.

661
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:26,199
That's a very tough question.

662
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:33,159
There's so many people I would love to meet and talk to in the world.

663
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:35,380
I couldn't narrow it down.

664
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:42,559
Like, there's so many different aspects of my life that have, you know, made me the person I am.

665
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:49,260
Being the athlete space, the personal development space, and person space.

666
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,360
Oh, I don't know.

667
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,900
I'll put you on the spot here, Lucky.

668
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:54,260
Can I give you some inspiration?

669
00:42:54,579 --> 00:43:00,699
I've had people say, Lindsay Boyd is a great author and leadership coach in the UK.

670
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:01,719
She said, Elon Musk.

671
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,760
I want to collaborate with Elon Musk.

672
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,960
I had Luke Beveridge, who's the coach of the board, who said he wanted to collaborate with Peter Garrett,

673
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:12,619
who is starting to really reflect.

674
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:16,300
on the First Nations people and their influence.

675
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,039
So, we've had this rain.

676
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,559
It is a hard question.

677
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:20,780
I put everyone on the spot with that.

678
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,460
So, it could be anywhere in your life.

679
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,599
I'm buying you a bit of think time here.

680
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:27,920
Lucky, is there anyone now with a bit of time?

681
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:31,500
No, I can't think.

682
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:35,559
There's so many names coming to mind, but then I don't want to just, you know, choose one.

683
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,099
That's not who I am.

684
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,460
I'm sorry.

685
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:40,239
It's not quite the answer you're looking for.

686
00:43:41,179 --> 00:43:42,400
That's good enough in itself.

687
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,320
I think there's so many aspects to you that you can't narrow it down.

688
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:47,960
It is a hard thing.

689
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,880
I'm not sure what my answer would be either.

690
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:53,380
So, it's easy when you ask the questions and you don't have to think about them yourself.

691
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,900
But, yeah, we might follow up with that.

692
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,920
I'll see if I can add it on when we hopefully catch up another time.

693
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,659
And I'd love to do it.

694
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,599
I've really been inspired meeting you.

695
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,820
Before we started, I said so many people got in touch with me and said,

696
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:08,519
if you will do it, you need to meet Lucky.

697
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:10,440
You need to hear Lakeisha Patterson's story.

698
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:11,340
It's an incredible one.

699
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,340
It feels like it's...

700
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,440
Clearly, just getting started and looking forward to seeing you in Paris

701
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,980
and leading the team there and everything else that's going on in your life.

702
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,199
It's a great inspiration, a great story of leadership.

703
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,840
And I'm really honoured that you were happy enough to speak with me.

704
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,340
Thanks so much.

705
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:27,500
It's been my pleasure and such an honour to be able to speak to you

706
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,679
and share my story a little bit more.

707
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,219
So, thank you so much for having me on.

708
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:35,380
Empowering Leaders was presented by me, Luke Darcy,

709
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:38,699
