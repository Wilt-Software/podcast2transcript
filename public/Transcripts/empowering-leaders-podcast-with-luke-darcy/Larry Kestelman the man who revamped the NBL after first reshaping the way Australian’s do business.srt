00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:08,269
Hope you enjoy this conversation on the Empowering Leaders podcast with one of Australia's great

2
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:14,710
business success stories, Larry Kesselman. Larry was one of the co-founders of Dodo Internet back

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:21,269
in 2001. He is now the owner of the Australian National Basketball League, the NBL, among many

4
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:26,949
other successful business stories. In this conversation, we cover all the lessons Larry

5
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:31,550
learned along his journey from his humble beginnings growing up in the Ukraine to now

6
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,310
being known as one of Australia's greatest ever success stories. Fascinating to me,

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,990
but you're going to hear Larry put a whole lot of his success down to luck, which I find still

8
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,869
hard to believe, but he also admits to having been skilled at seizing opportunities and happy

9
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:50,689
to take on difficult challenges that others aren't. And you'll also hear what an unbelievably

10
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:56,270
deep understanding of people he has and their needs and how he focuses on that with his business

11
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,530
stories. As we chat, Larry emphasises to him just how important it is to always

12
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,290
be learning, to maintain a positive attitude when the going gets tough, and how self-leadership

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,250
for Larry Kesselman all comes back to knowing what your purpose is. It's people like Larry

14
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,849
Kesselman who inspire the work we do at Alita. Head to alitacollective.com. In particular,

15
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:23,269
we'd love you to look at our Alita Connect signature program. We bring together a diverse

16
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:27,670
range of leaders, people like Larry Kesselman in groups of five or six to connect, to learn,

17
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:31,469
and to share. We feel like the world has had this crisis of connection,

18
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:36,230
and the idea of sharing great stories and seeing the positive ripples that go on from these groups

19
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:41,250
is something that's really inspiring to us. You don't have to be a billionaire like Larry Kesselman

20
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,730
to be part of Alita Connect. You can just simply book a discovery call. Head to alitacollective.com

21
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:51,170
today. Huge thanks as always to Jason Nicholas and his team from Temper Bedding Australia.

22
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:56,150
Great success stories, understand the importance of sleep. We spend a third of our life in bed,

23
00:01:56,769 --> 00:02:00,269
and so investing in a mattress like no other, like Temper,

24
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,510
is a serious investment.

25
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,230
That will change your life for the better. Quality sleep is life-enhancing,

26
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:13,430
and Temper is simply the best in bedding. Larry Kesselman was born in Odessa on the Black Sea

27
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:19,530
in what is now Ukraine and arrived in Australia at the age of 12 in 1978 with his parents.

28
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:24,669
He studied business at TAFE, majoring in accounting, and then began work as an auditor.

29
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,009
His first life-changing decision was to start the Dodo telecommunications business with his cousin,

30
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,789
becoming a huge success before eventually selling it to Alita Connect.

31
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,810
In 2013, for close to $250 million. It seems as though Larry has the unique ability to turn

32
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,430
his attention to a diverse range of industries and passions with remarkable consistent success.

33
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,349
Property development, range of tech companies, private equity, extremely successful call center

34
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:53,870
business in the Philippines, but he's probably best known for his ownership of the National

35
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:59,449
Basketball League here in Australia, becoming the only individual in Australia to own a sports league

36
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:02,110
and one of very few around the world.

37
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:02,789
Larry,

38
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,389
it's great to see you. Thanks for taking the time today.

39
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,330
Great to be here.

40
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,270
Larry, it's a full life that you've lived from humble beginnings to what is an incredible

41
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,949
Australian business success story. What are the traits that you've found in yourself that you

42
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:19,129
think have helped you to have that success? First of all, I think I feel extraordinarily

43
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:23,710
lucky. I think if anyone says that it's all knowledge, it's all skill-based,

44
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,189
I don't agree with them. I think a lot has to do with luck. I think you absolutely have to

45
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:32,569
make the most of it, but I feel very lucky and very privileged. I first,

46
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:37,949
give the credit to my parents for actually bringing me here. I'm a super proud Australian

47
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:42,650
and just think I live in the luckiest country in the world and feel very privileged to be here.

48
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:48,650
You generally believe that luck plays a big part in our life. As we get into your story,

49
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,770
there's consistencies and success everywhere that your life seems to take it. That suggests

50
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:58,250
that you've got a formula that works for you, but you generally feel the luck is an important

51
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,449
part in life? I think you have to take your opportunities. I think it's certainly not all

52
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:06,949
luck, but I think there's an aspect of being in the right place in the right time, seeing

53
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:13,490
opportunities and making the most of it. But I do think luck has to play some component. It wasn't

54
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,930
my choice to come to Australia. I could have right now been in the middle of a war raging in Ukraine

55
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:25,350
with Russia. So I think definitely a component of luck is there. Larry, the telecommunications

56
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:31,209
business is notoriously competitive. I'm fascinated by this story. I think of James

57
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:32,350
Packer and Lachlan Murdoch.

58
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:36,949
They're forming OneTel, two of the biggest families in Australian business life, and they

59
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:43,329
nearly came unstuck, or certainly did around that time. And a young immigrant from the Ukraine

60
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:48,009
moves into the outer suburbs of Melbourne, takes on the big boys in telecommunications.

61
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:49,230
How did you make that a success?

62
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,689
Well, I think it's something that I've realized now looking back is in my DNA,

63
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:59,170
I almost don't like something if it's too easy or it seems too easy and everyone can take it on. I

64
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,410
love a bit of that battler and get in there and do something.

65
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:07,389
Something that needs to be done. And it doesn't matter if it's hard, because the way I look at it,

66
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,209
if it's not hard, then a lot of other people will do it. So I'll back myself to get in there and do

67
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:17,370
it. But I first need to believe that it needs to be done. And when I got into the, well, we say

68
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,250
telecommunication now, it was very clearly internet and even more so it was such early

69
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,870
stages of internet with dial-up. When I got into it, there were nearly a thousand internet

70
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:31,810
providers. It was such a confusing space that even myself, I couldn't understand half of

71
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,389
the plans and what people were offering. And you had really the us and them approach.

72
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:42,230
You had the big boys and then everyone else was really struggling. So I thought what I want to do

73
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:48,129
is I want to bring to Australia a really simple version of the internet with one plan. I remember

74
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:54,550
we literally came out with one plan, one offer. This is what it's about. And be the leader of

75
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,629
the opposition of the rest of the internet providers against the big boys.

76
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,269
And you did a great job. I mean, everyone will remember, Zoto,

77
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:06,829
was everywhere, I remember, at the time. And you got a presence bigger than perhaps

78
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:11,370
your scale at the time, potentially. How did you manage that?

79
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,970
Oh, I think it's the unfair advantage of being able to do crazy things. So the Telstra's of

80
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,089
the world could not do anywhere near what it is that I could do. So I knew I didn't have the

81
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:28,189
budget to out-market them. So I had to really try to use everything that I could use to my

82
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:30,750
advantage, starting with the name of the actual company.

83
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:35,589
I thought, you know, I'm going to go a little bit left field. And how much more left field can

84
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:41,750
you go than call an internet company after an extinct bird that couldn't fly? And the slogan

85
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:47,009
I came up with was internet that flies. So yeah, I had to use every trick in the book to make sure

86
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:52,250
that I got cut through. Yeah, amazing story. I mean, we often get told in life, Larry,

87
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:57,649
you find something you're good at, and then people often tell us, hey, stick to that, because

88
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:03,850
you're good at it. And you're good at it. And you're good at it. And you're good at it. And you're

89
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:08,769
fantastic as a fireman, but you branched out and tried to run a pizza store and your life

90
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:13,490
unraveled or whatever it may be. But you would have heard that along the way. Your life is the

91
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:18,970
opposite of that, it seems, that you can turn your attention to very diverse things and make

92
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:23,149
them successful. How have you done that? It may seem that way, but in actual fact,

93
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:29,810
a lot of the businesses have one continual string through them. And that is the love of people.

94
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,250
And I think they understand that. And I think they understand that. And I think they understand

95
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:36,769
of people. So if you have a look at most of the businesses I'm involved in, they're consumer-based.

96
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,470
So it's about people and consumers and delivering something that I think is needed in the place. And

97
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:48,290
I don't care. I've gone from, as I said, the cheapest internet provider in Australia by a

98
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:52,509
long way at the time, because I felt that was what the consumer needed, through to the most

99
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:59,110
luxurious building in Australia, in Capital Grand in Satyara. So I don't care actually at what level,

100
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,550
but I feel like my love of people and understanding of people and wanting to

101
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,290
deliver something for people, whether it's internally people that work with me or people

102
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:12,769
that are my family, through to consumers, I really have a passion for that.

103
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,769
And that seems a great credit to you, Larry. And you're doing some homework for this

104
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:20,509
preparation. It seems as though some of the young 20-year-olds that started at Dodo with you

105
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:24,589
are now still part of the family and they stay with you for a long period of time,

106
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:28,990
which is a great indication that it's a good place to work. Does that fill you with,

107
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,889
what? Yeah, it does. And we joke about it,

108
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:37,870
but it's actually true. I think the family or the tribe that I have, it's one of two things.

109
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:42,169
You're either in and you're out in the first few months because you look around and go,

110
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:47,049
these people are just crazy. I just can't work with these people. They're nuts. Or the other

111
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:51,590
way around, they just stick around. They go, okay, this is my home and this is my tribe. And I think

112
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:57,690
I like the crazy. So it's one or the other. So yeah, we had a first, I remember, first five,

113
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:59,090
six people that I invited. And I think it's a great thing to do. And I think it's a great

114
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:05,429
that actually understood the internet, which I will own up to the fact that I was not enough of

115
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:12,309
an expert in. A couple of them are still in my world. One in particular is now 42 with a couple

116
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:18,049
of kids and running the offshore Philippines business and my partner in it. So more than

117
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:22,029
just proud, I'm just ecstatic because that's actually one of the most important things. And

118
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:26,070
so many examples of that in my world. Delving into that a little bit more,

119
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,070
you said there's a pattern there. It's around product,

120
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:36,809
and people, and consumables. But there's so much detail in running a call center offshore to

121
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:42,110
opening a hatted restaurant in your building in South Yarra. And people go, God, the restaurant

122
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:47,909
trade's got a whole heap of hand grenades that can appear pretty quickly. And then property

123
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:53,309
development. And well, so there are these trap doors that you can fall into. How have you avoided

124
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:58,049
that in the spaces are different though, aren't they? How have you been able to overcome the

125
00:09:58,049 --> 00:09:58,389
challenges?

126
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:04,269
Yeah. So first of all, I don't want to give myself too much credit. I've tripped myself

127
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:09,190
up plenty of times and I've certainly got a lot of things wrong, but I'm a survivor. So

128
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,750
first of all, I think you have to have the resilience and the calmness to survive and

129
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,129
find a way forward. So I always say, if you haven't made mistakes, you haven't tried hard

130
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:23,529
enough. So I've made plenty of those. But I think what I do is I do always start from

131
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:29,070
belief. Is there a need? I think a lot of people get into businesses because they feel that's

132
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,529
something that we just love to do or it resonates with them. They love that space, but they

133
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:38,450
sometimes forget to check at the door. Does anyone except themselves actually need this or are they

134
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:43,509
truly onto something? So I usually start with a need and I need to believe that I'm fulfilling a

135
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:48,149
need. So what is the problem that I'm fixing? Is there a problem? And then I'm the right guy. I

136
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:52,950
don't care how hard it is. In actual fact, the harder it is, the more I enjoy it. So I'm not

137
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:58,169
sure what that's about. That's probably something I need to go away and explore. But I do love a

138
00:10:58,169 --> 00:10:58,870
great challenge.

139
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:04,750
And I have a tribe of people around me who are just as crazy as I am and they believe in me and

140
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:10,529
we're together going, let's call it solve that problem. So when I got into the internet business,

141
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:16,809
I felt like I was really solving a very, very difficult, challenging problem. And it was. And

142
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:23,009
it was super hard. We could have failed over and over on a number of occasions, but we took it on

143
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:27,850
because it had to be done. And the same with basketball, the same with capital grant. I always

144
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:33,029
feel like we're in a little bit of a mission to solve a problem for others, not a problem that I

145
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:39,570
need solved necessarily. It's not so much about me, but if the consumer and the people we feel

146
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,769
need it, then we're heading in the right direction.

147
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:47,149
I want to come back and ask you about the taking on the impossible challenge in a moment, but pick

148
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:50,710
on what you said before. And I think this is important is that people listen to a podcast

149
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,129
like this, Larry, and they see the highlight reel that I read out at the start, success after

150
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:57,529
success. And it sounds impossible when people,

151
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,950
find that very hard to live up to. But you said, there's more than your fair share of

152
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:07,250
times you've fallen over yourself. Can you share a moment where it went horribly wrong or

153
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:12,370
a fail that you look back and think, God, that was one that went sideways?

154
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:18,129
Oh, there's a number. There's a number. But before I do that, I just want to say, I think

155
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:24,610
I embrace that. I embrace that now. At that time, it was super scary, but I embrace that now. I'm

156
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,830
okay with coming up against challenges and bits of the week. I'm okay with coming up against

157
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:33,710
what we get wrong. I have no problem with it. So I look back now and I go, one of probably the

158
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:39,509
hardest and the biggest things I had to overcome is when we go back to the dodo days, I'd say,

159
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:44,909
I'll tell you two. So one was we got into the internet business early and it was like the

160
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:49,710
wild west. So every day there was something new and building something totally different,

161
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:55,909
this small startup going up against the Telstras of the world. So it was a scary, scary time and

162
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,809
not understanding. And the industry was,

163
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,850
evolving so quickly. So I thought I was getting into the internet business when in actual fact,

164
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:07,409
I got into really a customer service business and providing services and billing. So we started a

165
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:14,169
call center. Success on the signup of the clients was great because I think we got the offer right,

166
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:18,610
but providing the service, we were not experts. So I nearly killed that business by not

167
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,190
understanding how to operate call centers, the technology of it, how to provide the right

168
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,830
customer service. So we grew to nearly 600 people in Moorabbin in a call center.

169
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:33,289
Operating on semi-domestic phones and, uh, and not, not having enough reports and management

170
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:37,529
and understanding it and nearly killed my business. So all servicing data at the time,

171
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:41,990
all servicing data at the time. And, uh, the growth was extraordinary. So we were doing the

172
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:47,470
right things on providing the service, but behind the scenes, we couldn't keep up with the, with the

173
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,690
demand and couldn't keep up with the customer service side of it. So I nearly killed my business

174
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,889
on the back of that and had to quickly hop on the plane and realized I'm not going to scale it

175
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:57,830
enough in Australia. So went to India, Australia, Australia, Australia, Australia, Australia, Australia,

176
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:02,990
went to the Philippines and had to start the call center, uh, in the Philippines, uh, from

177
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:09,450
literally person one. And it was a race to how quickly can I set that up versus, uh, do I kill

178
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,710
my business here whilst I'm setting it up? So it was a real race. What's going to happen first?

179
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:18,309
Uh, am I going to be able to provide the customer service quickly enough before the business

180
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:24,889
literally blows up? So, uh, it was, it was a race to who can do that first. And luckily we,

181
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:29,649
in the end succeeded and managed to set up a great operation that now looks after a lot of

182
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:34,730
other companies and provide services out of that experience to them, uh, out of the Philippines.

183
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,610
So huge learning, but that was a survival moment. I mean, how do you do it? I'm not an expert. So I

184
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:45,929
had to learn really quickly. So, um, that, that taught me, I think, along the journey of how to

185
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:51,009
become a quick learner as well. You ask enough questions, you find the right people. Uh, I don't

186
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:54,450
ever go in with an arrogant approach of, yeah, I've got this.

187
00:14:54,889 --> 00:15:00,309
I'm actually always absolutely shit scared, I think is the, is the right word. So, uh, I always

188
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:05,950
just try to find the right people that I can quickly learn from. And that, um, um, I think

189
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:12,370
breeds that level of right fear where you don't have the arrogance. And, uh, that's one trait that

190
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,889
I cannot stand in people and hope, uh, no one around me ever feels that way where I ask a lot

191
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:22,289
of questions and try to be a learner. So that's one. And the other one, just delve into that area

192
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,809
that cutting you off. I'm fascinated. You're a race against time.

193
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:28,330
Your business is going to blow up if you keep the call center in Moorabbin by the sounds of it,

194
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:33,450
but you land in the Philippines and it's one language barrier. I mean, that's a big task,

195
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:38,149
isn't it? You know, the pressure on that must've been enormous. I mean, in a little bit of detail,

196
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:43,289
how did you get that right? So first of all, I love those scenarios. I really do. I really do.

197
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:48,450
You sort of drop me into a place and you sink or swim and you go figure it out. And it all for me

198
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:53,429
goes back to people. So I quickly try to connect with people and figure out who's who in the zoo

199
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:54,870
and, and how do I actually, you know, how do I, you know, how do I, you know, how do I, you know,

200
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:58,769
how do I actually get this done? So I remember I connected with a couple of Aussies that had

201
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:03,549
already been there. So I quickly connected with them. They had a few people I learned from them.

202
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:08,710
I talked to them. I thought maybe I partner with them. That didn't work out quickly. Then I ask a

203
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,429
lot of questions. Who are the best lawyers? Who are the best accountants buddy up with them?

204
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:17,870
It's about, I think, connecting with people for me. Yeah. Business is business, but I look for

205
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:22,210
the right humans and I'll look for my tribe there. Who are the people that are actually going to

206
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,870
care enough, not just on dollars and cents,

207
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:30,110
but to help me. So I quickly try to connect with people. And I found this amazing group of people

208
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:36,070
that taught me quickly, figure it out quickly and just work my butt off. I mean, you, you work,

209
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:41,809
I was working 18 hours a day just to set these things up and, uh, and find the right people.

210
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:46,330
And again, you make a lot of mistakes. You, that, that worked, that didn't, and just keep pivoting.

211
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:51,710
So I think that's the other really important thing. I don't lock myself into an exact path.

212
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,830
I know the direction I'm going, but I'm prepared to keep,

213
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,470
pivoting and, uh, until I get it right. Yeah. And I can see that, you know,

214
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,830
you sit down and you're, you're already firing questions at me and I can, that,

215
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:05,970
that curiosity comes out. I'll, I'll, uh, I'll ask you more about that in a moment's time.

216
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:10,109
Coming back to what you said as well before about taking on the impossible challenge and,

217
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,910
uh, what is now your home is a famous site here in Melbourne. Everyone who's come to the city

218
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,309
will know the corner of Chapel street and Turok road where your Capitol ground building sits.

219
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:24,289
And it was there for a long period of time, um, famously, and a lot of people failed on that site

220
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:24,869
from what I understand. And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

221
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:28,910
and, you know, I remember the people saying, oh, that's Larry Kesselman. Good luck, you know,

222
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,650
making that work. I mean, have you got an idea of what's in you that says,

223
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,809
I will take that on when others can't. Yeah. So I think there were quite a lot

224
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:42,509
of people saying a bit more than, uh, Larry Kesselman staking that on. I think a lot of

225
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:47,250
people were cheering for me to fail because others had failed before me. So yeah, I think

226
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,250
four different developers had a crack at that site and, uh, and didn't manage to get her off

227
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,750
the ground. So I think, uh, I liken it to like wrestling.

228
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:59,690
Bear. Um, and I'm just one individual and that is the biggest development ever done

229
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:03,950
from a residential point of view in Australia. And it's now the most luxurious and,

230
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:08,710
and well-known one. So it was a, it was a real challenge. I'm not going to sit here and say

231
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:13,950
that was easy. It was not, it was, it was really hard. And, uh, when you take on such big projects,

232
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:19,829
there's also the aspect of time I had banking crisis. I ended up, uh, smacking right at the

233
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:24,710
end into COVID. So, and in the middle, when you're doing something so, so different, uh,

234
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,829
it was a challenge, but I'm super proud of what's, um, what's actually been created.

235
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:34,609
Amazing, uh, story and incredible location. I've got to ask you about the national basketball

236
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:39,309
league. Um, as I said in the intro is probably where people know you more than anywhere else.

237
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:45,670
Now, Larry, it was financially struggling. It was a sub tier sport in Australia without being,

238
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:51,210
uh, unfair. I think even, um, Andrew Gaze would see her and say that basketball wasn't in,

239
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:54,210
in a great space. Why turn your attention to,

240
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,089
to the NBO here in Australia when others again had failed?

241
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:02,130
Well, I think when you look at the consistent, so, you know, you go back and I'll take a step

242
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:08,509
back. So you think about it, the consistent part is, um, Dodo had to be done because the industry

243
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:13,690
was in a mess and all you could get were expensive plans. And I didn't think the consumers were being

244
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,490
served and, uh, it wasn't right. So I felt that it's something I can do. And once I believe I can

245
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:24,509
do it, um, I, I wrestle with myself to walk away. Uh, you've got the same, the same thing with

246
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:29,950
capital grand. I really felt that site needed something special for a particular group of

247
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:35,509
people to live in a particular way. Uh, I'd been lucky enough to travel the world and see it. Uh,

248
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:40,170
and the same with national basketball league. I had been part of it with my family prior with

249
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,849
a club, with the Melbourne tigers. Um, we were just supporters first, then we were sponsors.

250
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:50,789
Then we were sort of part owners and not because I ever grew up as a kid dreaming to be a club

251
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:54,450
owner. That was never my DNA. I'm an immigrant and a survivor. And,

252
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,630
and I don't even dare to dream of these things. If I can, if I can make ends meet and, uh, and be

253
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,670
a success and provide for my family, that was, that was the early aspirations. I didn't grow

254
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:10,250
up dreaming to own a club. Uh, owning the club came out of that club going broke and my family

255
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:15,029
and, uh, and in particular, my mother, uh, telling me, Larry, you're, you're this business guy and

256
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:19,369
you run businesses. Surely you can fix this club. Where are we going to go on the weekend? What are

257
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:24,049
we going to do? What are all the families going to go to? You cannot let this thing fail. Um,

258
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:31,750
and the same story again, I'm like, yeah, I think I can, I think I can fix it. And I came at,

259
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:36,730
at it from a point of, I need to build a sustainable business. 15 clubs had come and

260
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:42,269
gone in Melbourne prior to the Melbourne tigers being the last 15, 15 different brands, 15

261
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:46,630
different versions of teams had come and gone in Melbourne and Melbourne tigers was the last one

262
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,950
standing. So I thought, you know what? I think I can do it. And there's always, it was a hell of

263
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,430
a lot harder than I ever thought and learning and understanding the business of sustainable

264
00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:00,029
sport and how to actually build, uh, what consumer needs. And it came again from the

265
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:05,250
same angle. Forget what I like. What do the consumers expect and want from a basketball

266
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:10,109
club? What are we in the business of? And understanding that and realizing that it's

267
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:14,549
like myself and my family, I was not a huge basketball nut. I didn't play basketball,

268
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:19,349
but I loved the family aspect. I loved the entertainment. I loved what it brought to my

269
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:24,410
family. And that's where I started rebuilding the club. And we first rebuilt the club until

270
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:24,430
last year. And that's where I started rebuilding the club. And we first rebuilt the club until

271
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:29,410
the league went, um, broke. I was about to go broke as well. And I came at it from the same

272
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:33,910
point of view. I couldn't walk away. And I truly believe that I can create something amazing

273
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:40,430
out of it. Why? Because the consumers wanted it. Yeah. 1.2 million registered people playing the

274
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:45,309
game. There's probably 2 million people actually playing the game. I can take zero credit for that.

275
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:52,130
That was there before me. So all I had to do was build a product that those people can be proud of

276
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,410
and follow and actually be in the game. And that's where I started rebuilding the club.

277
00:21:54,410 --> 00:22:00,670
And what it does for them and their families. So, uh, I knew I had to do my part, but this sport

278
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:05,670
is a, is an amazing family product and that's why I'm involved in it. Yeah. And I've been along

279
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:10,009
recently. I was telling you before we started and as someone that hadn't been for 15 years because

280
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:15,730
of, uh, you know, I love all sport, but it was, uh, you know, underwhelmed, I suppose a bit like

281
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,569
a lot of people in Australia came back and it's, that's fun. That's entertaining. You've, um,

282
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:23,549
you've done the things that you see, you can tangibly see it and you, you sit there and,

283
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:24,390
um, well, you love basketball. You've done the things that you see, you can tangibly see it.

284
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,569
It's a good night out. It's a great night with the family, took the kids along.

285
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:32,569
Uh, and it's brilliant. And there's a lot of reasons why that shouldn't succeed, isn't it?

286
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:36,309
Because a lot of the kids now have access to the NBA and they see the American sport. And there's

287
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:41,890
always this theory, Larry, that if you're not, you know, having the top of your game, like soccer

288
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,289
struggled here in Australia for that reason, how have you overcome that? Can you give us some

289
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:50,630
examples around how you've made this product as inspiring as it seems to be now? So I think what

290
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:54,369
you said is spot on. I think, uh, consumers are tough judges.

291
00:22:54,390 --> 00:23:00,009
And now the world is such an accessible place. So we had to actually look at ourselves and go,

292
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:05,910
well, we need to be good enough. And that was the aspiration. I'm going to say, honestly,

293
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:10,670
when I took over, that wasn't the case. And the NBL became just a little bit irrelevant because

294
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:16,190
you could see the NBA and the gap was so large. So for us, a big part of it was to create our

295
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:22,670
own version of the product, uh, and not actually just be something that is exactly like NBA or

296
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,069
exactly like EuroLeague.

297
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:28,450
To have our version of what the sport looks like. And I think that's what we've created. We've

298
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:33,809
created a product that is truly Australian. Uh, it is something that we can all be proud of. And I

299
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:38,769
think it is actually the best version of a day out for a family of entertainment. In my opinion,

300
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:43,710
it's better than the NBA. So when you go to an NBA game, I think what you see on the court is

301
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:49,269
extraordinary, uh, as a product of entertainment overall for the family, I think NBL is better.

302
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:53,930
So, uh, on the court, we're now the second best league in the world, without a doubt,

303
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:58,789
everyone accepts now as a domestic league. NBL is the second best product in the world. We have

304
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:03,849
25 players that have played in the NBL and have gone onto the NBA. We've got players that finished

305
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:10,009
playing here and go three days later onto the court in the NBA. So, uh, NBA is the North star

306
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:15,109
and it is by far the best league in the world without a doubt, without a shadow of a doubt.

307
00:24:15,109 --> 00:24:20,349
But NBL is the second best on the court. But I think as a product, when people go along as a

308
00:24:20,349 --> 00:24:24,049
family, mom, dad, couple of kids, uh, multicultural,

309
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:29,029
boys, girls, uh, it is just an extraordinary product that I think the Australians are now

310
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:34,509
completely embracing, loving. Uh, we're breaking all records. Like this season has started with

311
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:40,470
us breaking all records for attendance. Uh, viewership is 40% up. So Australians are

312
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:45,750
embracing it. Why? Because that's what they want, not what I want. That's what they wanted

313
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,750
as a product. And, um, they're showing that we're right.

314
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:53,529
It's a great story. Again, another one of the success stories you've been involved in people

315
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:54,049
listening to this.

316
00:24:54,069 --> 00:24:59,710
Larry that have got an entrepreneurial spirit, like clearly you have, what's your advice to

317
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:04,230
someone who's maybe started and struggling or thinking about going down the entrepreneur path?

318
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:11,490
I think get over yourself. Uh, I think, uh, we're all very, very, um, smart people that get involved

319
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:16,329
in business and we think we're amazing. And I think get out of your own way and get out of your

320
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:20,609
own story in your own head and check in and make sure that you're actually doing it for others.

321
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,769
And when I say doing it for others, number one, make sure that you actually

322
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:25,869
are doing it for yourself. And then number two, make sure that you're actually doing it for the

323
00:25:25,869 --> 00:25:26,210
people that you're talking to. And that's, that's the, that's the, that's the, that's the, that's the

324
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:26,549
thing that I think is really important.

325
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:32,309
Uh, and is it something that's going to resonate with them? Uh, not just because it's you. I don't

326
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:39,109
like the words niche. Niche is very dangerous. Um, if you're getting into a business that you

327
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:43,109
are going after consumers, make sure that it's actually something wide enough. Does your business

328
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:47,410
model work? Uh, do you have the right people around you that are actually going to help you

329
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:52,549
make it happen? Uh, if not, make sure you go and get them. Do you understand it? Are you a keen

330
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:59,589
learner so i think number one thing is just get over yourself um don't think about what you want

331
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:04,009
and what it is that you're trying to achieve for yourself and think much more about others

332
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:09,170
starting with your consumer what does your consumer want sound advice there isn't it because

333
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:13,049
you're right often people get it in reverse don't they it's good i've found this thing that i love

334
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:18,029
and i'm going to force through a product where maybe there isn't an audience for it and you know

335
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:24,069
we hear the stats on small business so often about failure in your view is that what really

336
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:28,710
brings people unstuck all the time is that they are maybe not solving a problem that needed to

337
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:33,230
be solved is it as simple as that at times i think it's actually a lot more complicated than that i

338
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:37,750
think you there are lots and lots of factors and i'm very happy to talk about those as well but i

339
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,009
think you need to start at the start it's almost like if you do the wrong deal at the start and

340
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:47,009
let's say if i'm in property if i've overpaid for the land and i haven't got my model right

341
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:48,009
uh it's

342
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:53,210
very hard to then undo it so i think that's the starting point i think just making sure that it's

343
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:57,609
not about you that it's about the others about the consumer about the product that's actually

344
00:26:57,609 --> 00:27:03,970
just the starting point but that is if you don't get that right i think you are really in for a

345
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:08,390
tough tough road all the way along there are a lot of other factors but if you get that one wrong i

346
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:13,609
think it's very very hard to undo there i'm always fascinated about this idea of what does success

347
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:17,869
actually mean and and and to me there's a whole range of elements on the

348
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:17,990
world of business and i think it's a very very hard to undo

349
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:23,630
of what makes a happy life and a successful life and financial success is one portion of the pie and

350
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:29,349
happy family life and health and connection to your kids and contribution to others in a positive

351
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:34,529
way makes up this sort of pie of what i think a happy and successful life looks like i mean you've

352
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:40,329
clearly had remarkable business success how do you balance out the other areas of your life to

353
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:45,369
to fill that cup for you i think it's a very complicated formula but ultimately i think a

354
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:47,990
very simple one i think that i think it's a very simple formula i think it's a very simple formula

355
00:27:48,009 --> 00:28:17,990
i think it's a very simple formula i think it's a very simple formula i think it's a very simple formula

356
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:23,650
i start with my family i find if i'm not happy at home i think it's very hard to be just generally

357
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:29,109
happy so i think having the right balance and the right uh feeling around yourself with the closest

358
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:33,990
people and you just look at through the circles as you go further and further out so i think for

359
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:40,589
me it starts there uh that's number one priority and it does not mean that i do everything just

360
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:44,950
around family i certainly don't i think it's a balance of of everything but if you're not happy

361
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:47,970
at home and if you're not putting in the effort to make sure that your relationship

362
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:54,309
they are great that's a challenge for me uh but relationships and how i feel and checking in

363
00:28:54,309 --> 00:29:00,049
with myself and being honest is is really important i'm a i'm someone that will go after things really

364
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:03,750
really hard but as i've got older and i'm not going to say i was always that way i think as i

365
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:08,789
got older i'm much better at being honest with myself and going what feels good what doesn't

366
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:14,809
what is my purpose why do i do what i do uh and being honest with myself the japanese term

367
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:21,930
is fascinating isn't it i've been uh reading a lot in uh in recent times a guy called dan buten has

368
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:26,890
done an extensive study on what he calls the blue zones around these communities around the globe

369
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,410
and there are a handful of them where people routinely live past 100 years of age in perfect

370
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:36,950
health and have uh some patterns around what that is and in japan that term around purpose

371
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:42,710
shows up in parts of uh of greece where they have these blue zone communities or

372
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,789
in sardinia and italy around the globe and there are a handful of them where people routinely live

373
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:49,809
around you know purpose for people is such a big thing around you know nutrition comes into

374
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:54,609
and community and family and connection but uh without that sense of purpose that's one of his

375
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:59,890
things that's a really to long have uh healthy and happy successful life the studies are showing that

376
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:05,930
that is a big factor isn't it is yeah absolutely i think for me the idea of purpose and understanding

377
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:10,309
why you're here why do you do what you do community is really really important so those

378
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:14,789
couple of things you mentioned really really resonate i love love

379
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:21,930
life i really i'm so passionate about it and so thankful you know you get another day to have

380
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:26,589
another crack at this uh and the most valuable commodity and sure enough for your younger

381
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:31,130
listeners they're gonna think that's just something older people say but the only thing

382
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:36,990
that we have of value is time so how i spend my time what do i do what is my purpose uh i think

383
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:42,529
it's a privilege to have another day um on this planet to have another crack at doing something so

384
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:48,910
i don't take that lightly and um you know i'm a positive person so i struggle around people that

385
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:53,769
whinge and carry on and uh and i'm like you know get out of your own head and have a look how lucky

386
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:58,730
you are and especially when a lot of friends struggle with health and other things you're like

387
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:04,730
no just get out there and have a crack i hate a victim mentality i'm like okay you know you're

388
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:10,309
in charge of your own life so if you want to blame others go for it but see how how well that serves

389
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:12,470
you yeah we love this term larry

390
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:16,710
success leaves clues and i was sharing with you a bit of the community uh in our space a leader

391
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:21,690
that's growing and the idea of connecting people around what great life looks like and and sharing

392
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:26,049
those learning opportunities and out of that we've seen a handful of dimensions of what we

393
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:30,009
think great leadership looks like larry in this pattern i want to ask you a few of those now

394
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:34,809
starting this idea larry we think it's hard to lead someone else unless you've got an idea of

395
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:40,210
your own self and and self-leadership what does that term mean to you when i talk about

396
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,509
self-leadership i think it's being able to

397
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:46,990
control your emotions uh it's being able to have your own conversations and being honest with

398
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:51,569
yourself i think if you're living a lie and you're not actually honest where you're at

399
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:57,210
that that is a problem you've got to start there i think if you stop being a keen learner

400
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:03,690
i think that's a problem how do i lead others and the longer i lead others the smarter they

401
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:08,849
are around me like the people that are coming into my world now are bloody smart people so

402
00:32:08,849 --> 00:32:11,410
if i don't keep improving myself and keep learning

403
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:18,730
so i think that concept of the way the western world has decided that you get some sort of a

404
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:23,789
certificate after school and college you're done at studying is a very dangerous one so

405
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:30,250
i think for me as a as a leader i want people that are keen learners that are open to learning that

406
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:36,690
are self-critical uh that are positive but at the same time realize that you never stop learning and

407
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:42,509
it's a journey so my leadership style is to care about others and their

408
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:48,750
evolution and how can i help them so the older i get and i'm an operator by nature but the older

409
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:54,589
i get the less i'm actually running and operating businesses so more and more my job is uh strategy

410
00:32:54,589 --> 00:33:00,049
and how do i actually set people up for success and mentor them and and help them and not just

411
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:04,990
their own business but actually just help them be the best version of themselves they'll need to do

412
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:09,690
what they need to do but my job is to help them find that happiness i think you have another

413
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,509
japanese term while you're talking larry kazan they talk about you know you know you know you're

414
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:17,390
a constant never-ending self-improvement being one of the goals in japanese life and it sounds

415
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:23,970
like that sums up you and how you go about it we see people who have success like you've had larry

416
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:29,930
are really conscious now about how they positively impact people on a daily basis you know you talked

417
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:35,569
about the pride of having the dodo 20 year olds now in their 40s and still part of your world

418
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:39,970
how have you gone about that on a daily basis having that positive impact on those around you

419
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:42,450
i think it's a mindset i think it's understanding

420
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:49,670
your purpose so i understand my purpose now is a big part of it is around uh influencing and

421
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:54,849
affecting people so i start again with family with you know my wife with my son with my mother

422
00:33:54,849 --> 00:34:00,910
how do i impact their life in a positive way what can i bring to them what what is it that i can do

423
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:07,150
to support them and for them to feel loved and supported and uh and that i'm doing my job as a

424
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:12,269
as a husband as a father as a you know as a son and because it goes in cycles you know my

425
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:19,250
parents looked after me and so that constant understanding of what my purpose is um on this

426
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:25,630
planet how do i in a privileged position that i am and we talked about what what does uh financial

427
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:31,510
success bring well the big one for me is freedom i mean i i have the freedom to make decisions to

428
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:36,210
do certain things i didn't have the freedom i you know i joke around i grew up looking through that

429
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:40,550
entertainment book as to where the special is at the at the restaurants and where can i get

430
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,510
a discount and one of the big privileges is that i can get a discount and i can get a discount and

431
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:48,170
i have now i love is i don't worry about how much you know the main course is and uh and i have the

432
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:54,050
freedom to work my schedule and how do i actually make the most impact number one on people around

433
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:59,690
me but also uh i have a group of people that are passionate about giving back so every organization

434
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:05,449
that i lead and there's probably about 15 different meaningful businesses that i'm in a charitable

435
00:35:05,449 --> 00:35:11,510
and csr aspect is a huge part of what's important to me that they do and each ceo does their own

436
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,429
thing my wife

437
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:18,150
uh has worked in that sector for you know most of her life so she helps us guide as a group

438
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:23,969
how do we give back what do we do we've started our own academy for underprivileged kids who are

439
00:35:23,969 --> 00:35:28,710
uh who are looking for a way into the into workplace to make the right decisions called

440
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:34,929
larita academy so it's a balance and the longer we go about giving back and making it more about

441
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:39,889
others uh is really really important to me now you've had some big visions and you've been able

442
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:42,170
to execute on on those

443
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:47,809
we've spoken about them before but from big development projects to telecommunications

444
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:52,070
how have you gone about when you're creating one of those visions and sharing it with your team so

445
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:58,190
that they get it and understand it early on it was uh sitting them down and uh and explaining it now

446
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:02,909
they just just expected they're like okay what's the next crazy thing that larry's gonna you know

447
00:36:02,909 --> 00:36:08,590
dream up and uh and and they all know now it's not it's not a surprise to them what new things

448
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:12,210
we're actually going to dream up what problem are we solving and what are we creating or

449
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:17,769
why we're doing this uh they almost don't question it anymore they they just want to understand and

450
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:24,630
get on the journey and they know my for example my favorite tv ad of all time uh is the steve jobs ad

451
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:29,369
when he came back to apple after being fired and and coming back and there's no product and the

452
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:34,389
company is struggling and uh his ad was something along the lines of you know here's to the crazy

453
00:36:34,389 --> 00:36:38,969
ones because they're the ones that will change the world so i'm not for one second suggesting

454
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:42,510
that i'm the one that will change the world but uh i love that i'm not the one that will change the

455
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:49,170
because i know being a little crazy like myself i'll take on things that actually have a bit of a

456
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:55,949
meaning and uh and maybe that others wouldn't take on so in that is i think a key to our success

457
00:36:55,949 --> 00:37:00,730
now we see curiosity is a common trait of of people that i have the privilege of sitting down

458
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:05,389
with like you today and through curiosity they're constantly learning like you described before does

459
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:11,849
that term resonate with you absolutely i love it you know i love i love learning sometimes really

460
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:18,989
random things through to um industries that i don't understand but i start with people i'm really

461
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:25,289
curious what makes people tick and and who they are and how but yeah i'm i get i really i'm really

462
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:29,670
interested in all sorts of uh industries i may never get involved in i'm really interested in

463
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:35,070
learning about uh the most ridiculous uh things you know i was googling the other day as to

464
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:41,269
spaces and uh how many teaspoons fit into a square pound what does that look like and uh

465
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:42,510
yeah really random things and i'm really curious what makes people tick and who they are and how

466
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:48,489
things that expand your mind and uh and you you learn more about the world that we live in and uh

467
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:54,030
communicating with clarity is another dimension that we we see really consistent around people who

468
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:59,090
get their message across have you thought a lot about how you communicate with your team and your

469
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:03,889
projects that you work on i don't necessarily sit and think about communication what i do think about

470
00:38:03,889 --> 00:38:11,130
is uh how do i affect the people around me and i think it's when you talk about communication

471
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,510
it's everything it's body language it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's

472
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:18,429
you know eye contact it's what what does that mean how do i want the people to feel uh in certain

473
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:23,909
situations i think is really really important so uh you start almost thinking as a as a father to

474
00:38:23,909 --> 00:38:29,969
your son all right if i'm uh acting in a particular way what what example am i setting what outcome do

475
00:38:29,969 --> 00:38:36,489
i want and i think that sort of continues on to me and i have learned that in the tougher the

476
00:38:36,489 --> 00:38:42,010
situation the calmer i get because everyone is looking and they're looking for leadership and

477
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:48,050
they're looking for guidance and and if i'm panicking and if i look erratic and i'm rattled

478
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:53,369
then uh i don't think the people are going to be that comfortable to uh look at me as a leader i

479
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:58,969
think someone told me i think it's fact or maybe they just told me a great story that uh leader or

480
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:06,010
leader in french was something that was given to uh the flag bearer at the front of the army so he

481
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:11,090
was the leader and carrying the flag and and leading the army into into war and i think we

482
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:11,989
all know what happens when you're in a situation like that and i think it's really important to

483
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:17,329
that dude he's probably usually the one that's shot first but if he's prepared to take up that

484
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:22,150
mantle and he's at the front and if he's walking around looking around shaking and uh and he's not

485
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:27,289
confident not too many people are going to lead him into battle so uh in my version of it is be

486
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:34,250
brave and if you want to be a leader know what actually goes with that title comes with some

487
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:38,369
responsibility larry doesn't and i was sitting across from craig mccurry the coach at collingwood

488
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:41,889
just a couple of days ago in this same forum and

489
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:46,789
and he spoke about that privilege of leadership and and that same sense around when the pressure

490
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:52,250
is on that's your time to be calm you can't fake that can you is is that something that is in your

491
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:57,769
dna larry or have you been able to work on that so that when those situations come and it's you

492
00:39:57,769 --> 00:40:02,869
know dodo's on the line here i'll either get this right or we're going under it's a learned trait i

493
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:09,969
can tell you uh i would panic when i was young uh but i have to say when i look back in certain

494
00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:11,989
situations even at the young age i've been able to work on that and i've been able to work on that

495
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:17,730
at a younger age i did manage to control and stay calm uh i would not say you know in some i was

496
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:22,590
maybe a little too fiery and a little too passionate and uh but i was leading less people

497
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:28,309
but uh i think it's something you have to have in you but it is a learned trait as well as you

498
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:32,309
faced with more and more situations i think it's like anything you know when you were playing

499
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:37,250
footy you got a lot better at what your trait was as as you did it more and more and i think

500
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:41,989
the same thing here the longer you are as a leader and and the more you do of it the repetition and

501
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:46,550
and being in more and more tough situations i think you figure that out so i wouldn't be too

502
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:51,210
harsh if you're an up and coming and you're a bit younger in life in your leadership role and

503
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:56,110
you're starting out give yourself a break and and yeah sometimes uh it might get the better of you

504
00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:00,769
but uh it's a it's a learning and as you go on the journey you'll you'll learn more and more

505
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:04,469
how to control your emotions larry who's been the greatest leader in your life

506
00:41:04,469 --> 00:41:11,969
uh unfortunately up until now i have not had a lot of mentors outside of my family

507
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:18,510
i have to say the one consistently that i have looked at is my mother and my father and the way

508
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:24,329
they stayed and dealt with such crazy adversity of moving countries not speaking the language

509
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:30,489
career challenges and how they've done it with a positive attitude and a strong resolve and

510
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:35,949
and the love for this country and for their community and for each other i think was a great

511
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:41,469
model to follow there was certainly not business people it was not about business

512
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:48,429
but i think they set an example for me and to this day my mom is 88 years old and every day she

513
00:41:48,429 --> 00:41:54,889
gets up and uh and has a crack and loves life she does not miss a basketball game she's still at

514
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:59,130
every basketball game that she can get to it's getting harder and harder for her but she's there

515
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:04,989
at every game and how she embraces and loves life i think is a great model for people and

516
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:10,969
that that's been terrific from a business point of view my thing has been that from an early age

517
00:42:11,469 --> 00:42:16,610
no one could really care so there has not been a lot of advice given because why would anyone bother

518
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:22,849
so i've learned to learn from everyone whether it's good bad indifferent i literally learn from

519
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:28,809
every conversation and that's been a trait that i've taught myself and now i'm lucky enough i look

520
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:35,050
at a number of people as amazing leaders i have to say one that i absolutely love as a human and

521
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:39,690
whatever time he can spare i love hanging out with him as a gentleman by the name of jack cohen

522
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,449
from hungry jacks

523
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:45,469
he's becoming a little bit of a mentor in whatever time he can spare i love

524
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:50,250
having a chat with him and he's got that sort of a calm demeanor that i love and he's lived

525
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:55,710
a life and a half and i enjoy spending time with him larry in the spirit of collaboration thanks

526
00:42:55,710 --> 00:43:01,349
for that that answer it's a it's a great response we are a bit obsessed with what a collaborative

527
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:06,789
world looks like um have you looked and thought is there someone on the planet that you thought

528
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:11,349
i'd love to collaborate with and your whole range of passions is there anyone that springs to mind

529
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:17,130
you thought that's the person i'd love to uh to be alongside of one of the biggest privileges i

530
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:22,230
have now and i talk to my family about it all the time i sometimes pinch myself with the type of

531
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:26,909
people that i'm actually exposed to now so you think where i was starting and no one could care

532
00:43:26,909 --> 00:43:32,929
less and i you know had to work my way from the bottom and up and and when i get a chance to talk

533
00:43:32,929 --> 00:43:39,969
to someone who's achieved that was a real privilege now i'm so lucky to talk to so many amazing

534
00:43:39,969 --> 00:43:41,449
leaders and amazing people so i'm really happy to be able to talk to them and i'm really happy to

535
00:43:41,469 --> 00:43:48,050
so i don't like to label any one person because i don't believe in perfect humans so i would love

536
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:52,210
to talk to a whole range of people on a rate on different range of topics so for example

537
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:57,110
richard branson who i've you know met very briefly but i'd love to sit down and talk to him about

538
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:02,349
how his mind works around brands but on the other hand i know he's got challenges with you know

539
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:08,210
certain aspects of running businesses and so he he's an extraordinary success and i'd love to

540
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:11,190
talk to him about particular aspects i'd love to talk to

541
00:44:11,469 --> 00:44:18,969
you know bill clinton about certain aspects of of global politics as to how he tackled certain

542
00:44:18,969 --> 00:44:25,110
aspects so i think there are so many leaders but i would almost make a list and go but i only want

543
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:29,530
a couple of hours on a very specific topic i don't want to learn everything because i don't

544
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:35,449
necessarily either agree with all of it but uh yeah i'm very much about taking certain aspects

545
00:44:35,449 --> 00:44:41,389
from certain people i love the curiosity larry appreciate your time as you said time uh is the
