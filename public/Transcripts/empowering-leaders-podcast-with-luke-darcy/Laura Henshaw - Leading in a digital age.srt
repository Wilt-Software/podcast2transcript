00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:13,609
How do you navigate the world of a start-up business and how do you find a way to deal

2
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:16,609
with the challenge and adversity that inevitably comes your way?

3
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:21,039
G'day, it's Luke Darson.

4
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,839
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field has been a lifelong

5
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:26,699
passion of mine.

6
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,739
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective and have had the privilege

7
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:36,280
of working with thousands of leaders in education, sport, industry and the arts that have helped

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,960
shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership where everyone has a voice.

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,539
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

10
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,049
I was joined by the CEO of Keep It Cleaner, author and wellness entrepreneur, Laura Henshaw,

11
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,390
to talk about how she uses past experience to fuel her desire to help others, the benefits

12
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:16,349
and dangers of social media and how her naivety exploring the business world was actually

13
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:17,069
a good thing.

14
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:23,560
Well, very excited to speak to our next guest.

15
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,239
And it is a success story of the highest order.

16
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:32,980
She's a law and business graduate and initially launched an e-book for good for you recipes

17
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:38,140
that inspired tens of thousands, moved to a range of healthy products stocked in supermarkets

18
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,920
nationally that are now a leading influence in the competitive fast-moving consumer goods

19
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,200
world.

20
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,620
Her app, Keep It Cleaner, has over 250,000 subscribers.

21
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,079
And when you combine her and her business partner and the business together, they reach

22
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,959
over 2 million people on Instagram.

23
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:53,540
Laura Henshaw.

24
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,900
I'm sure an incredible story, a great success story as a 28-year-old young CEO.

25
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,480
What a great pleasure to meet you, Laura.

26
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,239
Thanks for joining us.

27
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,859
Thank you so much for having me, Luke.

28
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
And thank you for the intro.

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,739
I have to say, though, I wish we had 250,000 subscribers.

30
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,379
That's been our total uses to date, but not just so many more.

31
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:13,340
Well, I'm happy to be fact-checked.

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,000
That's good, Laura.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,219
I mean, you've changed the business story.

34
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,639
It's 250,000 people that are accessing what you do for a start is a great success story,

35
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,020
isn't it?

36
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,379
To create something.

37
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,639
It clearly sounds like a passion for you, isn't it?

38
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,199
The well-being and wellness space.

39
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,219
Yes, absolutely.

40
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:32,280
I feel very, very lucky to be working in a business where we get to.

41
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,039
And I mean, especially through COVID, giving people a way to be able to exercise from home

42
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,539
and move their bodies and have fun with it has been really special because I think for

43
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:45,680
a lot of us, being able to move has been kind of one of the only things that we can control

44
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,199
and that makes us feel really good.

45
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,340
And I mean, as you know, coming from a sporting background, the way that physical activity

46
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,759
helps you mentally and physically with your health, it's contagious.

47
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,280
Once you live a healthy lifestyle, you just want to share it with everyone and you want

48
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,219
everyone to do it as well.

49
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,159
So I feel very lucky that we're able to do that with Keep It Cleaner.

50
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,400
So many things to talk to you about, so many different directions to go.

51
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,780
But just picking up on what you said there, I think an interest to me has always been

52
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,340
that people understand the physical part of exercise and what that means to your health.

53
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,400
And I think people have worked out that you need to put something in to that part of your

54
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,219
life to get an outcome.

55
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:26,659
If you want to be healthier and you want to feel the way that you potentially want

56
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:30,400
to feel, but maybe people are now getting the link between doing something for your

57
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,340
mental health as well.

58
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:33,759
And I know that's a passion for you as well.

59
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,719
Laura, has that been always part of your routine as well, looking after your mental health?

60
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,520
Yeah, absolutely.

61
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,560
I mean, as I've gotten older, I am now looking after it more.

62
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,819
I suppose it used to be subconscious and now I'm consciously looking after it.

63
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,199
But for me, actually running is one of the biggest ways for me to look after my mental

64
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:50,620
health.

65
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,159
And I've tried meditation.

66
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,500
I'm very, something that we have in the app on Kiva Cleaner, I'm not very good at it, but

67
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,680
I do like guided meditations because then at least someone is talking to me the entire

68
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,539
time and I don't have to sit with my own thoughts.

69
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,219
But yeah, it's so important looking after our mental health.

70
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:07,879
I'm with you.

71
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,879
It's not for everyone, is it?

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,759
I found it at a young age, at the age of 18 or 19, and it just worked for me and probably

73
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,219
the discipline of playing sport for a living.

74
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:20,699
I do it twice daily, but I know for some people, and that sort of turned me here, I'm not good

75
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:21,839
at meditation, whereas for me.

76
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,399
It's not something you need to be good at necessarily.

77
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,240
I suppose it's just working out if it works.

78
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,819
And there is a broad family in it.

79
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,199
Have you tried other aspects of that space or have you just worked out there are other

80
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,740
things that you do outside of meditation?

81
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,860
I think one thing that one of our meditation experts on Kik, she always speaks to, her

82
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,879
name's Megan, and I'm sure you would relate to this, that if your mind wanders elsewhere,

83
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,779
it doesn't mean that you're doing it wrong.

84
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:50,319
I used to think that if I could not just repeat the three words in my head the entire time

85
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,540
that I can't do it.

86
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
And so that I think that's really, really important.

87
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,660
And with most things, even the same thing with yoga, I used to hate yoga because I'm

88
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,439
inflexible.

89
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:04,699
I played a lot of sport growing up, but I was always in the B team and I just, I really

90
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:05,259
liked running.

91
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,040
So, you know, I did all the hockey, soccer, all those sports where you had to run.

92
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:14,079
I never got near the ball, but I was always there for defense and for offense.

93
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:18,439
But because I'm so unco and inflexible, yoga was something for me that I was like, just

94
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:18,959
can't do it.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,360
And then it's been through Kik, we film yoga.

96
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,139
So I've had to be in the B team.

97
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:27,000
And I've slowly learned to, you know, to actually use it as something that is really

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,439
meditative.

99
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,240
And it really, the only time I was able to do that is when I stopped caring about, you

100
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,980
know, being perfect in every pose and focusing on exactly what I was doing instead, focusing

101
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,300
on, on, you know, doing my best and how it felt.

102
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:44,420
So that's how I try to approach my mental health and yeah, yoga and meditation.

103
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,259
Doesn't matter if you're not perfect at it.

104
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,319
It's just good to give it a go.

105
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:48,800
Married to a yoga instructor.

106
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,980
I am Laura and I found it very intimidating.

107
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,939
I was doing yoga next to her because there's no way in a hundred years I can ever even

108
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,079
potentially do the things that you're doing.

109
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,379
And, and, uh, used to, you know, the competitive nature of playing footy for me, she's like,

110
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,420
it's not competitive.

111
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,399
And I said, well, for me it is, I need to get better.

112
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:10,579
But the at-home yoga has been a bit of a gift to me because going into a studio hasn't had

113
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,699
a lot of appeal, but when you do it on the screen, you can do it at home.

114
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,660
And I think in lockdown, have you found that lots of people are accessing the yoga that

115
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,259
you guys are supportive of?

116
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:19,980
Yeah, absolutely.

117
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,319
And we found that for the whole app.

118
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,240
We've actually got quite a few types of training on the app and that's because everyone likes

119
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,899
different things.

120
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,720
Everyone's, you know, balance looks different.

121
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,379
Some people like to do six really intense workouts a week.

122
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,040
Some people might like to just do three and they might prefer yoga or Pilates.

123
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,100
So we've got yoga, Pilates, strength, training, HIIT and boxing as well.

124
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,540
And what we found is, is the most special.

125
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,579
I mean, definitely through COVID, I think it's been one of the positives is that people

126
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:50,980
have maybe realized that they can get active at home and especially for time poor people

127
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,300
that, you know, they're not as active as they used to be.

128
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,220
They don't have time, you know, to drive to the gym and do a class and then come home.

129
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,959
They can use 20 minutes and do an at-home workout.

130
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,220
And also, I find it really helps people with their confidence as well.

131
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:06,500
And we find that speaking to members of our community, they, especially a lot of gyms

132
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,040
in the weights area, it's quite a male dominated area of the gym.

133
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,800
And so a lot of women find when they walk in there, they have no idea what to do.

134
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,800
They feel really uncomfortable and they just leave.

135
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,300
But with Kik, what we're able to do is really empower our users, you know, to learn how

136
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,279
to do all the exercises.

137
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,939
That they want to do and, you know, master their technique and build that confidence

138
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:25,500
at home.

139
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,060
So then when they go into the gym, they don't have to worry, like they don't care about

140
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,220
who's looking at them or who's in the space.

141
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,500
They just go and do their workout.

142
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:32,939
Yeah.

143
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,439
What a great opportunity that is, isn't it, out of the challenges of being locked down.

144
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,920
I want to speak to you a lot about Keep It Cleaner and the great work you're doing, but

145
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,220
perhaps wanted to jump to, you know, I mentioned 250,000 subscribers.

146
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,939
You said not quite yet, but 2 million Instagram combined with you and your business partner

147
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:53,740
and your combined audience for the business is an incredible reach.

148
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,800
I know you've spoken a lot.

149
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:59,980
Clearly, Instagram has been a positive, but it's also had its challenges for you.

150
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:01,920
What's your relationship like with it now?

151
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:02,540
Yeah.

152
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:07,620
So, I mean, it's really important for me to say without social media, there probably

153
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,939
would not be a Keep It Cleaner or there definitely wouldn't be.

154
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:16,819
When Steph and I started, Steph, my business partner, was very, one of the first on Instagram

155
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:18,100
to really grow a following.

156
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,740
And so we were able to use that.

157
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:20,699
We were able to market our business.

158
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,439
I think before social media, it was almost impossible to, you know, have no connections

159
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:31,939
and start a business with not really any money and, you know, get people to see it because

160
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:33,080
marketing was so expensive.

161
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,460
Of course, you know, for Steph and I starting out, there is no way we would have been able

162
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,620
to afford a page in a magazine or a TV set.

163
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,779
Absolutely not.

164
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,519
So, Instagram in that way really enabled us to reach people and grow organically.

165
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,679
But I think then again, I suppose another...

166
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:55,059
One of the biggest instigators for Keep It Cleaner was the pressure that social media

167
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:59,919
was putting on young women, especially on their bodies and how you should look.

168
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,440
It opened up a whole new world.

169
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,740
I know for me, I grew up in a really healthy family.

170
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,340
I did a lot of sport.

171
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,320
I had no idea what a diet was.

172
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:12,600
I ate healthily, but I didn't even think about what I ate.

173
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,740
I just ate to feel my body.

174
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,960
And then I started doing Instagram when I think I was about 19.

175
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,620
And the what was on there, there was every type of diet in the whole world.

176
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,940
And I was all of a sudden exposed to all of these things.

177
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,879
And it was so interesting because I studied biology in high school.

178
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,220
I understand that everyone's genetics are different.

179
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,700
If I follow exactly the same diet as you, Luke, I'm not going to look like you.

180
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,519
We'll have different bodies.

181
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,299
We have completely different genetic makeups.

182
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,820
But it's funny looking when you're vulnerable and you might be low on confidence and you

183
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,860
go on these platforms, especially as a young woman, you all of a sudden compare yourself

184
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,059
to everyone and you start thinking that you're not good enough.

185
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,440
And then it can be a really, really dangerous place for myself and Steph as well.

186
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:02,500
We both developed disordered eating behavior and really developed a very unhealthy relationship

187
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,759
with exercise and food.

188
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:06,100
So we also have done modeling.

189
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,860
And so that also has a really bad, there's a lot of pressure in the modeling industry

190
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,259
as well.

191
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,279
But for me, Instagram and social media was the main instigator kind of for changing my

192
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,740
relationship for the worst with food and exercise.

193
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:24,220
And so when we started to think about, you know, keep it cleaner, the most important

194
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,379
thing for us was that we were creating a safe place for people to come where they could

195
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:34,700
exercise and eat well, you know, for how it made them feel and not focus on all the transformations

196
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,539
and weight loss and all of those things.

197
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:41,899
Because obviously being healthy is extremely important, but I've lived a time now where

198
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:44,220
I was, you know, the skinniest I've ever been.

199
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,679
I was exercising two hours a day and I was eating a hundred percent.

200
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:53,039
I was eating fish and vegetables and I was mentally the unhealthiest.

201
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,600
So that's extremely unbalanced.

202
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,940
And so now Kik has kind of become this place for us where we want to make sure that any

203
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,279
person that comes into there, any young woman feels safe and they don't feel like they have

204
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:06,139
to lose weight or they have to look a certain way.

205
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,620
Yeah.

206
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,639
What a great summation and congratulations, Laura.

207
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:14,200
It's looking at this conversation through the lens of leadership quite often.

208
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,360
And I did want to ask you specifically about that.

209
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,500
And we both live in Melbourne.

210
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,799
And, um, you know, some of the data that's coming out of this lockdown, particularly

211
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:26,179
in the teenage girl bracket, Laura, is just horrific and not being spoken about enough

212
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:26,879
in my view.

213
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:32,039
And to have role models like you and Steph, your business partner, so the data that came

214
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:35,340
out in the last few weeks was at the moment in Melbourne through the lockdown, we've got

215
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:40,399
830 teenage girls being diagnosed with an eating disorder every week in Melbourne, every

216
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:40,799
week.

217
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:43,120
So you think about, you know, the impact of that on the family.

218
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,840
And then to hear someone like you, who's clearly identified that, now being able to talk about

219
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,980
a creative business that I wants to talk about being positive in that space.

220
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,480
And I mean, there's four families I know directly through the schools we're in that are experiencing

221
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,639
that it's, it's heartbreaking.

222
00:11:58,179 --> 00:11:59,539
I mean, do you still see it?

223
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:01,759
I mean, was it a hard thing for you to work your way through?

224
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,860
Can you explain a bit more about how you and Steph Rao navigate that challenging time?

225
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,259
That data is, it's so sad.

226
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:14,340
I think when it's hard with, and especially for me, I'm a really disciplined person.

227
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:17,799
And so when you're really disciplined, it's very easy and you want to be

228
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:23,460
in control and especially for young women and in all of the poor girls have that have

229
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:28,440
eating disorders at the moment and people that have them when you are, especially during

230
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,759
COVID, there's so much out of our control and what we eat is one thing that we can control.

231
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,620
So, I mean, it doesn't surprise me that that's been the statistic also not being with your

232
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,220
friends, not just not having that normal life is it's so hard on everyone and not having

233
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:43,659
school.

234
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,159
Like I just, I can't imagine.

235
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,679
And then on top of that, I think, I mean, for me,

236
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:53,940
I was 19 when I joined Instagram and, you know, you'd think I would be mature enough at that age.

237
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,320
And these kids are so young and vulnerable.

238
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,419
And for me at 19, I was still affected, let alone, you know, being 13, 12, 14, however young

239
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,399
kids are when they join social media.

240
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:08,019
I think for me and Steph as well, it was, it's definitely a journey.

241
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:10,360
It doesn't kind of fix overnight.

242
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,379
And the most important thing, I was lucky I got through it with kind of support.

243
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:17,559
And for me, it was a realisation that what I was doing, lucky,

244
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:23,179
I never got to the point where my health was at risk and I was able to realise myself,

245
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:30,320
what I was doing was not, I decided that my value was so much more than the way that I look.

246
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,399
My value is in everything else.

247
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,440
Our value is not in the way that we look.

248
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,960
And that for me was how I was able to work myself through it.

249
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,200
But for younger women and if their health is affected, I think the most important thing is to

250
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,519
reach out to someone to help a psychologist, a medical professional, because it can

251
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,340
get really serious really quickly.

252
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,500
And it is so scary, especially in this time in COVID.

253
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,620
Yeah, it feels like a perfect storm at the moment.

254
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,000
It's for all those reasons, as you said, taking kids out of school, having them locked at home and

255
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,200
then looking constantly at images that often aren't real.

256
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,759
Is that getting back to your conversation on Instagram?

257
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,539
And again, I know you've put out a lot of positive messaging exactly around what filters mean and

258
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:16,360
how unrealistic that is and trying to, I suppose, navigate that path again is the term that comes to mind.

259
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,480
You're also an author in that space.

260
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,080
A Girl's Guide to Kicking Goals.

261
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:25,019
Is that part of the mission for you is to try and give this inspiration and be the glass half full

262
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,460
positive voice in this world?

263
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:29,600
Yeah, so our book actually, it came out three years ago now.

264
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,159
I got a reminder on Instagram the other day.

265
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,399
So it's been quite a while since that came out.

266
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,120
But that book, the reason that we wrote that is it's so aligned with our mission of Keep It Cleaner and

267
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,679
just supporting that book is very much female skewed.

268
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,440
So for young women and all of the things that I think, especially through high school,

269
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,000
that maybe we aren't taught things like confidence, things that the fact that, you know,

270
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,159
the way that we look does not matter.

271
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:59,799
And especially navigating, I suppose, after navigating social media, we just wanted to put something

272
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:04,559
together for younger women that, you know, may be struggling now with with all of the comparison.

273
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,919
I can't imagine growing up the way that, you know, the teenagers of today growing up.

274
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:15,639
There's so they're just looking at images of things that are edited and as you said, not real 24 7.

275
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:17,440
And so and I mean, especially.

276
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,559
Things like the the filters now on social media and Snapchat and and all those things.

277
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:28,399
And then it's getting to a point where, you know, some young women are filming themselves on the filters 24 7.

278
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,480
And then I suppose it would be really hard.

279
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,759
These filters, they change when I did a video recently and it changes the shape of my nose, which tells me that the

280
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,960
filter that's called beautiful girl or something, I'm only beautiful when my nose is half the size and I'm only

281
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,200
beautiful when my lips get bigger and my my jawline gets bigger.

282
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,399
It's more whatever you call it, chiseled, whatever you need to do.

283
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,960
And that is such a dangerous message to be sending to young people.

284
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:01,320
So that's the book was really to talk about things that we weren't navigating social media and growing up.

285
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:03,080
But yeah, it's crazy.

286
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,679
That was three years ago. It doesn't feel like it.

287
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:11,519
Yeah. And I think as a parent of a parent of four, Laura, I've got three boys and teenage daughter.

288
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,320
She's our second eldest. She's 16.

289
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,559
And, you know, it's just an interesting experience trying to be.

290
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,679
As consistent and that love and support.

291
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,759
But that seems to me to just be so different to the boys and what they experience.

292
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:30,840
And and, you know, we're lucky she's such a brilliant, healthy and active and connected young girl.

293
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,720
But it's still terrifying at some stages to look and see the pressures that teenage girls are under.

294
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:39,159
How are you? I'm looking for some parenting advice.

295
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:42,480
So how are you with your parents through those teenage years?

296
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,679
Was it challenging?

297
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,919
Do you look back on that and think there was some landmines there?

298
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,240
Oh, I think.

299
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,759
I mean, I was pretty confident as a kid, as in in my body and all those things I did.

300
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,519
I had a very strict mom and my parents separated when when I was 12.

301
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,000
And so I spent most of the time with mom and my mom was so strict.

302
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,319
She would have to if I went to a birthday party in year 12, I would have to walk in with her.

303
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,839
She would walk me into the party and check for alcohol.

304
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:17,279
So I then sometimes went and it's funny, one of her best friends now actually was one of the moms that would be like, don't worry, Laura, you can sleep.

305
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:27,240
So, I mean, I was I kind of rebelled a little bit because my parents were so strict and my mom was really strict.

306
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,519
But I think for me, I really for me in year 12.

307
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:43,920
And I mean, it's definitely something that for younger kids and especially those that have had their year 11 and 12 in lockdown, it's so important to remember that your ATAR, you know, is not your everything.

308
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,240
I think in year 12, you're kind of taught and it's drilled into you that.

309
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,400
If you don't get a good score, you know, you don't have a good future.

310
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,279
And, you know, this is the be all and end all.

311
00:17:52,599 --> 00:18:02,519
I think if I went back, I would tell myself that, you know, it would be OK either way and maybe to not have put as much pressure on myself as I did, you know, to get my ATAR.

312
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:06,559
I think that's something that probably would be good for schools to talk about a little bit more.

313
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:15,599
And it's not not to not push kids to, you know, do their best because it's really important to be disciplined and study because you learn so much in doing that.

314
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,839
I think it's just there's a lot.

315
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,240
Right.

316
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:24,259
And there's a lot of pressure and especially for kids coming up now with a lot of pressure on them coming from all angles with social media.

317
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:24,940
They're in lockdown.

318
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,180
It's probably a little bit too much.

319
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:29,960
That's probably something I would I would have told myself back then.

320
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,160
How about when you look back and you talk to your mum?

321
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:36,599
Do you sort of feel as though that was was was helpful?

322
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,640
I'm a bit inspired, to be honest with you.

323
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,559
I picture me walking in with Sienna and she's like, you're a loser, dad.

324
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,440
There's no way you're going anywhere near the door.

325
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,720
I think that would be the response I would get.

326
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,160
But did your mum think?

327
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:51,180
In hindsight, did that serve you well, that strict parenting, do you think?

328
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:53,119
Or would you rather have been a bit more relaxed?

329
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:53,519
No.

330
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,039
Well, I mean, actually, first of all, my sister's name is Sienna.

331
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,259
It's a beautiful name.

332
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,819
So that's so nice.

333
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:06,680
My mum was actually I am so grateful for my mum and the way that that we were raised and my parents.

334
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,900
My mum raised me.

335
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:16,599
And I think being the I suppose the leader that I am today in what I'm doing, there is no way I would be doing what I'm doing without my mum.

336
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:25,720
We actually had a sticker on the fridge growing up that a man and the sticker said a man is not a financial plan at my mum's house.

337
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:30,859
I saw that when my parents separated, when I was 12, my younger sister was six.

338
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,519
My mum had been out of the workforce.

339
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,680
I think she'd just gone back part time.

340
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,220
But when you have kids and often the mum will stay home and look after them.

341
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,859
But what I saw as a young person was that, you know, my parents separated.

342
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:46,220
My mum then didn't have.

343
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:56,880
I had a really stable income and it wasn't, you know, we had a lot of financial pressure and stress on us because it wasn't a lot to support a single household.

344
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:08,599
And so I looked at that situation and my mum, I think my gender is as really now I've seen why there is a lot of gender inequality in the workplace now.

345
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:15,700
But at that time, I saw my gender as something that it kind of almost pushed me to be like, you know, I have to I want to be successful.

346
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,579
I have to set myself up.

347
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:28,579
I have to set myself up for financial freedom, create my own opportunities and not, you know, rely on anyone else because I could end up and my mum is she's absolutely fine now and she's happy and everything.

348
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:38,740
But I think seeing her going through that really made me realise that, hang on, I'm not just going to, you know, marry someone and just rely on them to, you know, look after me.

349
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,880
I want to look after myself and be independent and be able to, you know, create opportunities for myself.

350
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,539
Without my mum, I definitely wouldn't be doing what I do.

351
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,640
What a brilliant message.

352
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:50,539
A man is not a financial plan on the fridge.

353
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:59,519
That's, you know, what a great, that obviously stayed with you because, you know, to see what you're doing now, as I said, 28 years of age, you're the CEO of an incredible business.

354
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,019
You've got a huge following.

355
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,259
And do you think that that message subliminally was there?

356
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:09,539
Has this been part of the plan for you, Laura, the way it's eventuated or is it a bit of a surprise to you?

357
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:16,559
I think for me, I grew up thinking and I want to say as well, my mum really taught me that hard work.

358
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:17,779
Hard work is the most important thing.

359
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,599
And I prove that to myself in year 12.

360
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:23,779
I'm not naturally, you know, the kids that just get through everything.

361
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,859
They don't need to study.

362
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,599
That wasn't me.

363
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,799
I had to study my butt off to pass, but I studied my butt off and I did really well.

364
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,839
And so that really taught me that actually when I work hard, I can achieve things.

365
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,000
Obviously, I know as well now, it is so sad.

366
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:45,740
There are so many people that in the world that work so hard every single day and they're still earning minimum wage.

367
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,180
So I,

368
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:51,720
I acknowledge that I have a lot of privilege in being able to work hard and create opportunities for myself.

369
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:53,140
But I,

370
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,940
I feel that, yeah, so with high school, that's, that taught me that.

371
00:21:57,019 --> 00:22:02,000
And then, I mean, in what we're doing with Keep It Cleaner, we've at the start, before we started the e-book,

372
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,500
we just were so open to any opportunity.

373
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,859
And I feel you have to work really hard to get there.

374
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:13,859
And I feel at the start when you're trying to grow, you kind of feel like you're in a dark room and there's no light

375
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:15,859
and you'll knock on every door.

376
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:17,480
And no one opens the window.

377
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,619
And then all of a sudden, 10 people will say yes.

378
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:24,240
And opportunity kind of then creates more opportunity.

379
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,940
But you just have to work to get there.

380
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:34,380
And I think as well, because I didn't have a backup plan, I suppose this was, you know, what we wanted to do.

381
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,339
And I wanted, I just have that ever since I've young, that I've wanted to create financial freedom for myself and independence

382
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:45,420
and also create a path for myself that when I am after, you know,

383
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:47,920
maybe we'll still be doing Keep It Cleaner when we're 80.

384
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:51,019
And I don't know about doing squats when we're that old.

385
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:56,380
But I suppose enable myself to have the opportunity to then be able to help young women,

386
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:00,799
especially, I suppose, with confidence in being able to grow in their career

387
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:06,420
and especially underprivileged people coming up because I feel really lucky to, I suppose,

388
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,920
have been as privileged as I was to work hard and be able to create opportunity.

389
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,259
And I really am passionate about wanting other people to feel that way as well.

390
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,460
I can hear the passion.

391
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:16,500
It's fantastic.

392
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:23,500
And Keep It Cleaner is a six-year, you know, maybe past the startup's age to getting towards that sustained success.

393
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,880
But what people often think is the overnight success.

394
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,700
You read about it.

395
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:28,960
You see the profile now.

396
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,400
And you and Steph have got a great story to tell.

397
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:36,940
But can you tell us maybe about some of the dark room you just spoke about and being knocked back?

398
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,240
And were there times where you thought, this isn't going to fly?

399
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,200
We're not going to make this work?

400
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:41,900
Yeah.

401
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,559
I mean, there were so many times.

402
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:48,000
Because it's so interesting looking back now and reflecting.

403
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,259
I think we just really believed in what we were going to do, what we were doing.

404
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,599
So we just kept going.

405
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:58,920
And I think for us, being naive was one of the best things in the world.

406
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,640
Because I think if we knew what we were in for and the experience of other people in the industry

407
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,799
compared to our very limited experience, we probably would not have done what we're doing.

408
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,420
So I always say that naivety for us was a superpower.

409
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:14,059
At the start.

410
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:19,319
And I mean, also that confidence that I had in myself instilled that I could do this.

411
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,279
And I believed in myself.

412
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:23,819
And just our gender didn't hold us back and all those things.

413
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,740
When you have nothing to lose, really, and you get a no, it doesn't really matter.

414
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,579
You just keep trying for a yes.

415
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:37,960
But I think for me, it's been really interesting because my confidence has actually got probably worse the bigger that we've got.

416
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,140
Because I think if I look at what Keeper Cleaner is now as a business, I see it.

417
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,200
And I'm like, hang on, that's a really big business.

418
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,640
I can't run this business.

419
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:48,079
You know, I don't know how to do it.

420
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,700
I've only been doing it for, you know, six years.

421
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,140
And it's interesting, I suppose, which is a bit of imposter syndrome.

422
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,980
And I think it's interesting because I kept thinking the bigger we got or the better that we did and the more goals that we ticked off,

423
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,079
the more confident I would feel.

424
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,680
But it's almost been the opposite of that.

425
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:12,259
And I think at the start, it's just, it's honestly, it's faking it.

426
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:16,079
And until you make it, really, that's a really good saying.

427
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,640
And it's true.

428
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:22,519
Like, I remember one of the first times Steph and I were pitching Keeper Cleaner, we were trying,

429
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:25,019
we thought another way that we could generate revenue in the business.

430
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:26,619
This was really back at the start.

431
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,440
We started with the e-book and then we, with the money that we sold the e-book with,

432
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,559
we then made a website, which was so basic.

433
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,539
It was $6.95 for a subscription.

434
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,380
And back then, subscription wasn't really the norm.

435
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,380
It was very new.

436
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,880
There was no Netflix or anything.

437
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:48,980
It was three very basic recipes and a workout filmed on our phones with a PT, random every time.

438
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,640
So, that's what we were doing.

439
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,539
And we thought, you know, how can we build this?

440
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:55,160
Let's go, maybe we can get a partnership as we grow our brand.

441
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:59,259
And we had contacted, it was, the business actually doesn't exist anymore,

442
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:01,019
but it was quite big at the time.

443
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:03,799
And they said, okay, yep, come in and present to us.

444
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:09,500
And I remember we walked into this, I'd never been in a boardroom before that was this big.

445
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,759
It had like 12 chairs and they're all really big.

446
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:17,559
Two of the male execs from the company that were, you know, 40 to 50 years,

447
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:23,240
Steph and my senior were sitting there and I had no idea what to say, what they wanted to hear.

448
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,039
And I knew we probably weren't big enough to be pitching what we were, but I thought, you know what?

449
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,880
We literally have nothing to lose.

450
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:31,140
Let's just, let's just be confident.

451
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:36,079
And I think what I learned in that time, and I mean, we got a partnership with them and it was fantastic.

452
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:41,140
And what I learned from that is that, you know, if you believe in yourself, that's the most important thing as a leader.

453
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,099
You have to believe in yourself.

454
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:42,240
Yeah.

455
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,180
It's like, if you go to a job interview and you don't believe you're good enough to get the job,

456
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,960
how on earth is the stranger interviewing you going to believe that you're good enough?

457
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:52,759
You know, you have to believe in yourself first.

458
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,460
And so that's something that I've always stuck to.

459
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,240
And even in moments where I feel extremely insecure and like, I'm not good enough to be there.

460
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:02,940
I just repeat to myself, fake it, fake it, fake it.

461
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,400
You're doing a very good job.

462
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,359
If that mantra is working for you and I can picture the, you know, the two of you walking in and you've got

463
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,720
male execs with experience and that's intimidating for anyone.

464
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:22,079
Has that been challenging for you, you know, and Steph to overcome that as, you know, young execs you are

465
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:24,140
and CEOs and running your own business?

466
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,880
Have you been surprised by the reception you've got?

467
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,119
Have you had bad experiences?

468
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,019
What's it been like?

469
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,759
We've had some interesting experiences, I suppose I would say over time.

470
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,920
I think one of the biggest learnings we've had is that you can't trust everyone.

471
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,200
Steph and I really trust.

472
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,619
Trusting of people.

473
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:49,579
And I think the most important thing to me is in leadership is, you know, leading with openness, transparency and authenticity.

474
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:57,279
And that transparency led to a few contract negotiations that we've been in where we've thought that, you know,

475
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:02,619
every single person that you go into business with has your best interest at heart, which has been a huge learning.

476
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:09,160
That is, it's obviously for anyone that is experienced listening, they'll know that that's absolutely not the case, unfortunately.

477
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,279
So we've learned that the hard way a few times.

478
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:35,099
But I think one thing that I have really acknowledged in myself and I really I want to work on is as a female in most circumstances where it is in a kind of male dominated room or space, you have to prove, and I do feel this quite often, you have to prove why you're there and why you should be there and why you deserve a seat in the room.

479
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:39,000
And for me, curiosity and asking questions is how I learn.

480
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:39,740
It's so important.

481
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,200
But I find when I'm in an environment...

482
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:48,940
That is really male dominated, I will apologize before I'm asking a question or saying something.

483
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:53,500
I have to apologize for speaking in a room that's to do with our business.

484
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,700
So I have, you know, I have every right to say something just as anyone else does in the room.

485
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:05,539
And another thing that I that I know that we do as women is we when we say a sentence, we try to make people feel more comfortable.

486
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:08,299
So if we're voicing an opinion, I do this all the time.

487
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:10,859
And it's so funny because I talk on podcasts about it.

488
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,000
I still do it.

489
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,660
So I need to start not practicing what I preach.

490
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,740
But I'll say, you know, I believe in, I don't know, a calendar.

491
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:31,200
And instead of just saying, I'll put a question at the end, because putting a question at the end then means that if anyone doesn't agree with me, I can then kind of backtrack because I've posed it as a question.

492
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,200
And I think as well, another thing that I have really identified that I do myself and my male counterparts don't often do is if I...

493
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,259
Yeah.

494
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:36,279
Yeah.

495
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:36,339
Yeah.

496
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:36,359
Yeah.

497
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:36,380
Yeah.

498
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:36,400
Yeah.

499
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:36,420
Yeah.

500
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:36,440
Yeah.

501
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:36,460
Yeah.

502
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:36,519
Yeah.

503
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:36,579
Yeah.

504
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:36,599
Yeah.

505
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:36,619
Yeah.

506
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:36,680
Yeah.

507
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:36,700
Yeah.

508
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:36,759
Yeah.

509
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:36,819
Yeah.

510
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:36,859
Yeah.

511
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:36,920
Yeah.

512
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,019
Yeah.

513
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:37,079
Yeah.

514
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:37,140
Yeah.

515
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,099
Yeah.

516
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:38,299
Yeah.

517
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:48,779
Yeah.

518
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:50,259
Yeah.

519
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:50,400
Yeah.

520
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:50,920
Yeah.

521
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,119
Yeah.

522
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:51,140
Yeah.

523
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,720
And it comes back to a confidence thing in women.

524
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,319
There's an amazing TED talk.

525
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,660
It's called The Science of Women's Leadership.

526
00:29:57,859 --> 00:30:08,259
I really recommend that anyone listening that's female, anyone watches it, and they speak about how women in leader efficacy, we are so much,

527
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:14,299
less confident and even though we are more skilled in there was a study that they did and it was

528
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:19,740
between I think 18 to 21 year old school or university students and there was more women

529
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:26,359
in the leadership course than there were men except when the peers in the class were questioned

530
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:32,019
on how confident they were in their leadership the women were made way less confident and it's

531
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:37,299
really interesting because it's like this inherent kind of lack of confidence that that we have and

532
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:43,380
I think one of the main reasons for it is as women and this is something that I really struggle

533
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,859
with is that you want to be liked it's something it's like something that we just I don't know why

534
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:54,059
it's like it's genetically put into our brains that we need people to like us and I think

535
00:30:54,059 --> 00:31:00,319
if you were to write a list of the traits that makes a good woman it's kind of kindness you know

536
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:06,599
all of those things caring and then if you were to do the same for a male it would be you know

537
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,279
strong

538
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:12,839
driven all of those things and and it's really hard because I think leadership traits are actually

539
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:20,079
probably more um towards traits that we would qualify as as a good man and so for a female to

540
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:24,480
be you know if you're in the boardroom and you're pushing because you have to have difficult

541
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,720
conversations in leadership and when leading a company otherwise if we didn't if Steph and I

542
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,700
avoided difficult conversations we would not be where we are now you have to fight for your

543
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,660
company and so you're so often kind of found to be you know

544
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:43,059
emotional or you know too over the top or aggressive because you have an opinion whereas

545
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:48,420
I don't think it's the same for for males and so I think for me it's this it's always this debate in

546
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:53,460
my head when I'm in these rooms like I don't it's kind of like I almost don't like the person that I

547
00:31:53,460 --> 00:32:00,079
am but yeah I think I only think that way because it's the stereotype of how I should be and I think

548
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:03,940
we really need to change that and I think we all have this subconscious bias of these gender

549
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,259
stereotypes and it's not it's not fair especially if you're a woman and you're a man and you're a

550
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,220
in the leadership space and there's there's not enough women in the leadership space as there is

551
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:16,299
and we need to work on that and I think we really need to like look at this bias that we have that

552
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:21,059
it's not conscious it's not on purpose but it's just the way that we think yeah beautifully said

553
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:26,380
and thanks for sharing that so openly Laura it's a really powerful thing that that you just said

554
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:31,700
and and really it goes to the core of why I'm recording this podcast in lots of ways because

555
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,480
what we really are saying and what I really am passionate about is that there is a shift Laura

556
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:44,660
I'm sure it is away from that male-dominated hierarchical I'm the boss how do I you know

557
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:50,539
exert my ego over a group of people and then get them you know through command and control to do

558
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:55,460
what I say and I've got this sort of essence of confidence really below a lot of those males in

559
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:00,019
my experience is a real lacking in confidence and they overcompensate with but the brilliance

560
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:04,660
of what you bring is what the best male leaders are now doing which is self-reflection and

561
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,000
self-awareness and openness and vulnerabilities.

562
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:12,079
The the term of the time at the moment you know and I've seen this in the sporting world that I

563
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:17,940
came through Laura where we grew up with coaches that were just aggressive and abused and berated

564
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,279
you as the only way they knew and that was their experience but the new generation they build great

565
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:27,480
relationships and they're connected and in sporting organizations you know I'm lucky enough to sit on

566
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,099
the board of the old footy club I play and Kylie Watson Wheeler I interviewed on this podcast is

567
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:37,259
our CEO and Fiona McGeckney our board has skewed more femur not only are the girls but they're

568
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:44,380
smarter but they bring a presence that is so much more effective in in in my experience that's not

569
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:49,660
to diminish you know they've all got incredible experience so I'm glad you're identifying that

570
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:55,019
I'm glad the world is because it's not tokenistic in my mind it's just effectiveness and and we're

571
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:59,539
learning so much more because it's hard for us you know we grew up as males not being vulnerable

572
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:04,000
was was that you were weak and you weren't able to do that so I'm hoping that that's that's the

573
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,259
brilliance of what you're saying is that you are the new generation of male leaders and you're

574
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,739
of leaders and and I hope the 16 year old girls I hope we get some the teenage girls open my

575
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:16,059
door she won't listen to me but hopefully she listens to you and and inspired to say yeah you

576
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:20,739
might be scared you might be nervous but as you're proving you can be very effective too can't you

577
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:25,579
Laura I completely understand what what you when you say that you know the way that it's looking

578
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:30,860
at sport for example my dad actually was um he played for North Melbourne and he was coached

579
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:36,860
under Ron Barassi and I have seen a few videos of him he was the coach wasn't he Ron Barassi was

580
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,579
famous and uh you didn't get in Barassi's way and and uh and that's some of the old audio that

581
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:47,820
exists and what was your dad's first name Ross of course I had no idea that was yeah that's my dad

582
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:52,539
so what there you go and what a great history at North Melbourne but he would have been on the

583
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:57,480
receiving end of some Barassi's praise yes exactly and it was kind of the I've seen some of the video

584
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,820
and it's crazy

585
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:13,780
not concentrated your body not switched on properly now you get over and try and mind

586
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:19,980
the body forward pocket okay and it's you know it's changed so much now and I think as you were

587
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:25,420
saying it's fantastic and and I hope down the track we don't even have to talk about female

588
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,639
leadership it's just leadership and we don't have to talk about women in business because it's just

589
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:34,300
people in business because you know everyone there's there's equality and that's exciting

590
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:43,900
to go especially especially Australia as as a country the the statistic for where we are in

591
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:50,159
gender equality has it's dropped uh it's since I think it's about 2000 since 2003 or 2006

592
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:57,260
Australia's dropped by about 16 places so I think we're 29th now or something which is not

593
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:02,179
obviously not great so there is there is a long way to go for us but it's awesome that you're

594
00:36:02,179 --> 00:36:06,519
having these conversations and it doesn't mean that you know women are smarter than men or

595
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,260
anything that's a good thing but it's also a good thing that you're having these conversations

596
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,400
it's absolutely not the conversation or that men it's not that men are smarter than women either

597
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,619
it's that think of all of that untapped talent pool that we just haven't accessed because you

598
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:19,539
know we didn't think that you know women are able to be CEOs because they need to have children and

599
00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:24,420
then stop working like the amount of times I've been told it's so it's I just sit there now and

600
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,539
kind of laugh to myself but oh Laura you'll want to have kids soon like you won't want to work like

601
00:36:29,539 --> 00:36:34,940
this you know this that's not what you want and I'm I'm kind of sick of being told what I should

602
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,239
want you know I can decide what I want to do and I'm kind of sick of being told what I should want

603
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:43,440
what I want and if I want to work um and you know and have kids that's okay and if I don't want to

604
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,340
work and have kids that's also okay so I think it just comes back to again those stereotypes

605
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:54,119
and as you said I I love that the kind of the way you speak about leadership in that it's not

606
00:36:54,119 --> 00:37:02,780
hierarchical hurry up I can never say that and kind of it's like a boss and then I don't like

607
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:06,679
the word boss because it kind of infers that you tell people what to do when you boss them around

608
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:13,119
and I think with with good leadership and from people that I've seen lead the the best people

609
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,059
that lead are the ones that are leaders and you can't be I don't think you're a good leader if

610
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:23,719
you're a boss because then you're not empowering your team to kind of you know to grow and and

611
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:27,719
learn and be better and and all those things you're just telling them what to do and I think

612
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:34,139
for me our our Keep It Cleaner team now they are so fantastic I can't take credit for a lot of what

613
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:36,659
we do at Keep It Cleaner because our team do most of it and I think it's a really good team and I

614
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:41,960
and I'm so proud of of all of them and they're so good at their jobs and I cannot imagine

615
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,460
you know bossing them around and telling them what to do because

616
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:50,599
it would make no sense because we're all a part of this journey together and we're all equal in

617
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:54,480
our contribution it doesn't matter if you know you contribute to the social media or if you're

618
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,960
an engineer developer or if you're a senior marketer everyone contributes to what we do

619
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:06,199
and you know the journey that we're on together and it's I think that's what why I hope I hope

620
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:09,739
it's a leader for them but that's really important to me I'm going to pick you up because you're

621
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:13,780
doing it again Laurie said I can't take credit for the fact that we've got a great team you have

622
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:18,579
you're the CEO you're driving that culture and uh you know your humility comes through in a

623
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:23,059
beautiful way but I can imagine that the environment that you're creating with that with

624
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:27,019
your partner and you as the CEO uh Steph would be would be something really special I've got so many

625
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:30,760
things I want to ask and there are a series of questions about leadership I want to get to but

626
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:36,519
one of the things to the health and well-being space in itself is is an interesting and

627
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:41,480
sometimes conflicted world too Laura there's all sorts of different diets and regimes and people

628
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,320
get protective over whether you should be vegetarian or there should be paleo or this

629
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,300
is how you meditate or not how have you waded through that world with keep it clean and I

630
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,119
suppose what what does health mean to you if you describe it so I mean the the biggest thing for

631
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:02,280
keep it cleaner is health is holistic and health is all about balance and my personal I think for

632
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,480
us it's been it's been great from a business perspective because we've never yes we have

633
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:11,400
recipes that are allergen friendly so people that follow gluten-free vegetarian pescatarian

634
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:17,679
you know whatever they follow vegan but we've never ever ever pigeonholed ourselves into and

635
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,579
that's because it's not what Steph and I believe in into a certain way of eating you know keto

636
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:27,860
whatever all those things that because for Steph and I it's restrictive and I think because we

637
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:33,380
came from that the background of restrictive eating and us having a very unhealthy relationship

638
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,500
with food we've really tried to step away from that in the app

639
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:40,860
we don't have any mention we have a dietician obviously that checks every single recipe and

640
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:46,139
all the calories and nutritional profiles of every recipe are calculated but you won't find that in

641
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:51,400
the app because we don't want that to be the focus it's all about balance and you know health is not

642
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,239
eating fish and vegetables every single night for dinner and you know especially for families

643
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:00,659
the you know the parents having to eat a different meal to their children because they're on a diet

644
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:06,400
and then the kids are eating something else it should just be sustainable changes and

645
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:12,179
maybe someone has been keto or whatever it might be for their entire life good on them but I think

646
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:17,619
for most people sustainable changes in your health that you can actually you know start tomorrow and

647
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:23,199
then still be doing when you're 75 80 years old they're the ones that incorporate balance and

648
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:28,519
they're achievable they're not expensive they're not time consuming it's just really really simple

649
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:34,199
changes adding a little bit more vegetables into your diet you know kind of working out five because

650
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:36,500
I feel like we all end up making the same recipes every day so I think it's really important to

651
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:40,460
every single week because you just that's all you can think of but making those recipes healthy

652
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:45,079
ones and teaching yourself you know how to cook healthily and then finding exercise that you

653
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:50,000
actually enjoy and finding exercise that you can fit into your day you know if you're a high level

654
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,159
exec or even you know if you're a mum working from home mum you have to manage home school you have

655
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:59,559
to manage your work you have to then try and exercise it's not going to be realistic that

656
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:04,199
you're going to do crossfit for two hours a night because you don't have time so find something

657
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:06,500
that's going to be realistic and that I think is what health is about.

658
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:11,659
It's knowing that every single person's journey is different it feels different for everyone it

659
00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:16,860
looks different but you just need to find things that you can sustain like for me I love running

660
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:21,360
I know a lot of people hate it it's literally the worst thing ever they don't have to do it that's

661
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,440
okay find something else that they love because you just you have to find things that you can

662
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,900
sustain because we you know the we don't without our health we don't have anything and it's

663
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,860
something that we take for granted so it's really really important you know next time if anyone's

664
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,500
listening and they're thinking of making a healthy change or switch in their life I think it's

665
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:42,559
their life don't go on a fad diet for five days and have shakes because that is not going to get

666
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,139
you know that's not sustainable you're not going to eat have shakes for the rest of your life

667
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:51,440
make change and it's hard work you know to make those changes at the start but then they become

668
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,760
normal. Yeah sustainable I love that word and the successful people you tend to speak to have great

669
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,519
daily habits and routines don't let it stick and they're able to make that as you said really

670
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:13,090
easily part of their life and things they love things they enjoy doing. Now I've got a handful

671
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:13,289
of questions for you. I've got a handful of questions for you. I've got a handful of questions

672
00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:18,610
that Laura been trying to ask we have been asking all the leaders and and loving the different

673
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:24,730
perspectives from Justin Langer as the Australian cricket coach to Steve Biddulph who's you know

674
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:29,150
spoken and written about raising you know boys and girls and written great books and so the

675
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:33,949
different perspectives but the way people approach leadership so please be as expansive as you like

676
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:39,409
or or as brief as you like self-leadership Laura what does that mean to you when I ask you that?

677
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:43,130
Yeah it's a good question I've loved I've listened back to a lot of your episodes I have

678
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:48,449
to say I'm very humbled to be on. Oh I'm very humbled that you agreed Laura thank you so much.

679
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:55,469
Thank you. I think what self-leadership means to me I think it's for me it's knowing that I'm

680
00:42:55,469 --> 00:43:00,730
always growing and developing as a leader and I think that's not for me that is for my team I

681
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:07,070
think I can always do better for them and if I'm not developing myself how can I expect them you

682
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:12,409
know to develop themselves in their career as well and I think as well it's being very very clear on

683
00:43:12,409 --> 00:43:19,289
my personal values and I mean it's being a the founder of Keep It Cleaner with Steph our personal

684
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:24,829
values are very much intertwined with the company values they're almost identical and so I feel very

685
00:43:24,829 --> 00:43:30,510
lucky in that way that I'm so clear obviously as we all are in our personal values and of course

686
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:34,849
very clear on the Keep It Cleaner values because they're so similar that's really really important

687
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:41,530
as a leader in being so clear on your vision and your values because then it's so much easier to

688
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:46,869
be decisive which is obviously extremely important and then you're able to lead with

689
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:50,789
authenticity and purpose because you know why you're doing what you're doing and so I think

690
00:43:50,789 --> 00:43:56,610
with self-leadership it's always coming back and realigning with those values and at kick in in our

691
00:43:56,610 --> 00:44:02,769
time even though it's only been a short time any of the times we've gone off track away from what

692
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:09,610
our core is that's when we've seen I suppose the the more detrimental effects of that whereas when

693
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:12,389
we're clear on our purpose and our goals that that's when we've seen them come true.

694
00:44:12,409 --> 00:44:17,289
And did you and Steph actually sit down and write your values together so you had them

695
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:21,809
consistently do they do they change and and if you've got an example as you said when we've

696
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:25,010
gone away from that we've had bad experiences is there something that comes to mind?

697
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:30,269
Yeah so I mean when we first started we weren't that serious about it we didn't know that you

698
00:44:30,269 --> 00:44:35,909
need to have company values so I think that's why the business has really formed around our own

699
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:41,690
personal personal values I mean one of them kindness is a really big one especially because

700
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:47,849
what we we do in our offering is our Facebook community so it's a place as I've said it has

701
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:53,150
to be safe for young people and or for all people and we actually it's it's funny I shouldn't say

702
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:57,710
young people because we have I mean really I'm it's because I think everyone is young but we do

703
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:04,670
have people up to 60 and about I think 65 in the Facebook community that kindness is is really

704
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:09,670
really important there so that's the value that crosses over I think with the steering away it's

705
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:12,389
it's more from a business perspective you need to be clear about what you're doing and what you're

706
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:16,909
on who you are as a business what your differentiators are we're very very clear on

707
00:45:16,909 --> 00:45:23,150
that now and not trying to be everything for everyone I think that's where we've kind of

708
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:28,469
gone a little bit off track because we were trying to do a hundred things and when you try and do too

709
00:45:28,469 --> 00:45:33,389
many things you don't do anything well but we can do you know the things that we do very well and

710
00:45:33,389 --> 00:45:37,809
so that's what you know we it doesn't mean that you were not open for opportunities but I think

711
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:40,590
you just have to be very clear on what the right opportunity is.

712
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:42,329
Positively impacting others.

713
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:44,750
What are your thoughts on how you go about that?

714
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:50,570
Oh I mean it's it's so important especially I feel like that is for me one of the biggest

715
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:56,289
roles as I said we've got an awesome team now that do so much of of the great work that you

716
00:45:56,289 --> 00:46:00,849
see on the app and so a big part of my role now is I think well for me I feel it's bringing that

717
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:07,090
positive energy to our team. I think as a leader a really really important thing is setting the

718
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:11,650
tone for your team and of course there's times when serious conversations need to be had so it

719
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:12,309
can't always be.

720
00:46:12,409 --> 00:46:18,210
100% positive and happy but bringing that to every meeting that I'm in I don't think you can expect

721
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:22,750
that of your team if you're not going to lead by example and be that way so I think that's really

722
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:27,329
really important and it ties into believing in what you're doing if the leader doesn't believe

723
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:31,989
in what you're doing and isn't positive about the journey and the goals of the business then

724
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:33,550
how can you expect your team to be?

725
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:38,070
Yeah have you got you know it sounds like it's been something you had to work on the

726
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:42,389
the authentic conversations is that something that as you said you can't survive.

727
00:46:42,409 --> 00:46:48,289
Can you in business you have to call out when things are there is that come easier to you if

728
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:54,989
you've found that better as you've got on? Because Steph and my social because of our

729
00:46:54,989 --> 00:47:01,530
social media and our we're very open with everything online we are then I think it's

730
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:06,829
forced us to be authentic with with our team and I can't say any other way because I show most of

731
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:11,650
my life on social media and I have pulled back a little bit as I've gotten a little bit older

732
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:12,389
but I've gotten a little bit older and I've gotten a little bit older and I've gotten a little bit

733
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:18,210
older but our brand and kick and who we are is built on authenticity and that's what I really

734
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:22,710
hope with my social media obviously we've spoken about how social media can be so negative but

735
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:28,530
I really try as hard as I can that I you know I feel so grateful to have a following and so if I

736
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:33,590
can influence them in the right way and showing you know realness and being authentic that's so

737
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:39,789
important and I mean probably an example that comes to mind is I am I'm quite an anxious person

738
00:47:39,789 --> 00:47:42,070
which is something that's built more and more as

739
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:42,389
you know I've been in the business for a long time and I've been in the business for a long time

740
00:47:42,389 --> 00:47:49,110
and I was really scared to talk about it because I thought that it would mean that my team would

741
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:54,250
think that I was flawed and I wasn't good enough you know to be their leader or for them to work

742
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:59,690
for and it's funny because when I opened up about it and and I ended up opening up and about it

743
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:04,989
because I thought you know I've got 250,000 people following me on social media and if I can make one

744
00:48:04,989 --> 00:48:11,110
person not feel alone or flawed in you know themselves because anxiety is so common and

745
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:14,909
there's definitely more than one person that follows me that that experiences it

746
00:48:14,909 --> 00:48:21,269
then I you know I'm doing I feel like I'm living my purpose and what I need to be doing and then

747
00:48:21,269 --> 00:48:26,110
in turn obviously anyone I mean it was just public knowledge that that's something that I lived with

748
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:29,969
and my team do not treat me any differently absolutely not they do not think I'm flawed

749
00:48:29,969 --> 00:48:36,230
but that's an example where I think social media and the responsibility that I feel to the people

750
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:41,030
that follow me to be real push me to be more authentic but I think now I'm yeah I'm

751
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:45,190
pretty much open about everything so yeah well said probably too authentic for the team

752
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:51,289
too authentic that's uh that's an amazing quality how about when you talk about the vision that you

753
00:48:51,289 --> 00:48:56,349
guys um have uh have created how do you go about sharing your vision we've actually just worked

754
00:48:56,349 --> 00:49:00,489
through we had an amazing consultant come in and work with us at the start of this year

755
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:08,449
and her name's Gabrielle and she worked with us on really clarifying our revisiting our goal we've

756
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:11,090
had company vision goals all those things but we've had company vision goals all those things but we've had

757
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:16,789
revisited them and really clarified them for the team and we presented them and it was actually

758
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:22,329
especially with the I think with our company goals especially in values while that's not

759
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:26,710
really I suppose essentially the vision it's still a very very big part of it because I think

760
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:32,510
if you're setting goals for the company and what you can do with it you need your team needs to

761
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:36,929
feel first of all a part of the story and a part of the journey but then also they need to feel

762
00:49:36,929 --> 00:49:40,550
connected with why you're doing what you're doing you know if it's just to make money why would

763
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:46,750
you care or give you know give any more of themselves and so we did this activity we we

764
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:52,809
finalized all of our company goals we ran through all of them and then we got everyone to paint we

765
00:49:52,809 --> 00:49:58,110
we're in a common it's called the commons and I know the common yeah that's yeah in South York

766
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:03,489
it's fantastic and they've got an art room there and we thought let's use it so we went in there

767
00:50:03,489 --> 00:50:11,090
and we all painted how or maybe we I can't remember we painted all these um textures how we saw the

768
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:15,510
company goals kind of within a picture and then we all explained it and it was so interesting

769
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:19,929
because every single person while we'd run through the company goals at the start of the day and it

770
00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:25,389
was really clear on what they were the interpretation of them was so different in every

771
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:30,570
single person of the team and I think that's I mean that's such a great example of why you can't

772
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:36,010
you know you have to as a leader ensure that you it's not that you change when you speak to each

773
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:39,789
team member but when you're communicating with them you need to communicate how they communicate

774
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:45,969
you know that's why dictatorships and it's not the way to lead because you you're not you're not

775
00:50:45,969 --> 00:50:50,690
really putting yourself in in the other person's shoes and how they understand things and how they

776
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:55,750
like to communicate and hear and listening to them and so that was really a really good exercise

777
00:50:55,750 --> 00:51:00,829
because I think while everyone did an amazing job it gave me a different perspective on our company

778
00:51:00,829 --> 00:51:05,409
values that I didn't understand before and I would not have got that if we hadn't have opened up the

779
00:51:05,409 --> 00:51:09,829
floor to the entire team it didn't matter what their role was in the hierarchy of the business

780
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:11,090
or on the org chart where they were and I think that's a really good exercise because it's a really

781
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:16,429
everyone offered such such a great perspective on that yeah it sounds like you do these things

782
00:51:16,429 --> 00:51:21,269
so naturally because of of who you are and the way you are and heard you earlier on mentioned

783
00:51:21,269 --> 00:51:26,670
curiosity and that's the way you tend to learn in meetings and ask questions can you explain a bit

784
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:30,570
more about that with one of the dimensions we talk about of leadership is curiosity and then

785
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:36,530
how that affects your learning oh I think I mean asking questions is how you learn I remember in

786
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:41,070
grade five my teacher said to my I think it was in an interview that

787
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:46,369
Laura asked sometimes she she said something like she asked a lot of questions and sometimes

788
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:53,989
it's very annoying but I think it's a good thing and I'll always I'll always remember that and I

789
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:59,150
think now I one thing that's really important so often there's people I don't think it's very

790
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:03,690
productive to sit in a meeting and not understand things and be okay with asking you know what does

791
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:08,750
this mean because you're not expected to know everything if we were expected to know everything

792
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,070
you wouldn't need a team you could just do it and you know you're not expected to know everything

793
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:16,630
do it all by yourself which would be very sad existence but it's so important to ask questions

794
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:20,789
and I think a lot of people don't ask them because they're worried that it it shows that they don't

795
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:25,510
know enough or they're not intelligent but asking questions I think it shows that you know you're

796
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:31,530
interested in what people are doing and it's how you understand especially for me as I said a lot

797
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:36,969
of in my university as well a lot of studies things didn't come naturally to me so I had to

798
00:52:36,969 --> 00:52:41,070
ask questions to be able to understand it better and without that I'm not going to be able to

799
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:45,610
I wouldn't have understanding on things so curiosity and asking questions is so important

800
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:51,090
I think it also shows for if anyone doesn't like you asking questions and they're probably not a

801
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:56,210
good teacher but I find when my team asks me questions about things that I'm presenting for

802
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:59,869
me it's a compliment because it shows that they're interested in what I'm saying they're listening

803
00:52:59,869 --> 00:53:04,630
and they're trying to understand it themselves and that's fantastic yeah it takes courage too

804
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:09,369
to put yourself out there isn't it you're always hoping that that hits the mark but as you said

805
00:53:09,369 --> 00:53:11,070
it's always well received isn't it if you are trying to understand what people are saying

806
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:17,510
something regardless of the nature of it communicating with clarity is something

807
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:23,610
we're talking about a lot in leadership how does that work for you oh it's so important you I mean

808
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:28,489
especially on the vision of the company you can't expect again your team to buy into this

809
00:53:28,489 --> 00:53:33,429
kind of story and journey that you're on if you're not clear on what it is I know you've

810
00:53:33,429 --> 00:53:38,150
spoken about this on the podcast a lot and it's great because as a leader you don't need to have

811
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:41,050
every single answer and it's okay to say you know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't

812
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:44,929
know but there's someone else in the team that's really good at that and they do that or I don't

813
00:53:44,929 --> 00:53:49,150
know but I'm going to find the answer but this is something that I've learned I think being a law

814
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:55,590
student you have to be very clear in your reasonings and I remember my first assignment

815
00:53:55,590 --> 00:54:00,789
that I did I think it was a lot of the law exams they give you a big problem and then you have to

816
00:54:00,789 --> 00:54:07,030
go away and try and solve it and come back with maybe 2,000 words and I'd written 4,000 words

817
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:11,030
and I had no idea on how to cut it down because all I knew

818
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:15,510
was how to write these really wordy sentences and and what I've learned throughout my degree

819
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:20,929
is that that is not always effective or efficient in getting I kind of used to fill as many words

820
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:26,849
as I could because then hopefully within it it would be the right answer but you know that's

821
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:31,389
not the best way to communicate it's really really important to be clear and concise I think

822
00:54:31,389 --> 00:54:37,349
the more ambiguity that you leave in the way that you're explaining things it's not great because

823
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:40,869
sometimes people it's there's more I suppose chance for things to be

824
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:44,809
misinterpreted so being clear is is really really important and that's something I think

825
00:54:44,809 --> 00:54:48,469
in leadership is probably one of the most important things in being able to communicate

826
00:54:48,469 --> 00:54:53,849
clearly and concisely. Clearly you're a collaborator and collaboration that's coming

827
00:54:53,849 --> 00:54:58,610
through in everything you do with your with your business partner Steph as well but do you actively

828
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:03,550
think about collaboration and what does that mean to you? I think it's it's so important again it

829
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:10,469
comes back to that the whole idea of not really focusing on the hierarchy in a business I think

830
00:55:10,469 --> 00:55:10,929
if you are a business partner you're not really focusing on the hierarchy in a business I think if you

831
00:55:10,929 --> 00:55:16,469
only think that for example ideas can come from senior individuals then you're not tapping into

832
00:55:16,469 --> 00:55:21,389
your entire team and empowering them so what we do it's really really important that we do

833
00:55:21,389 --> 00:55:27,929
brainstorms within teams all the time to make sure that everyone feels heard and understood

834
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:32,730
and that they can contribute and often you know ideas will come from everywhere it was like when

835
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:37,429
we did that exercise with the company goals the perspectives were so the company values the

836
00:55:37,429 --> 00:55:40,909
perspectives of all of the team were really really interesting and you know I think it's

837
00:55:40,929 --> 00:55:46,030
it just it for me I just kind of stood there and I was like wow this is the power of collaboration

838
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:51,610
and and listening to everyone and also making everyone feel valued I think as a team member

839
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:58,349
the one of the things that can is the hardest to be an environment is when you don't feel valued I

840
00:55:58,349 --> 00:56:02,849
mean in any relationship or part of your life if you don't feel valued it's really hard to show up

841
00:56:02,849 --> 00:56:08,269
so I think in collaboration within that a really really big part is ensuring that every single

842
00:56:08,269 --> 00:56:10,909
person in your team feels like they are valued and they are valued and I think that's a really

843
00:56:10,929 --> 00:56:16,670
big part of the team. Sounds like a great place to be keep it cleaner with the values and the

844
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:21,150
vision and the way you speak I think it's I speak about that often there's nothing sadder than

845
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:25,469
watching people feeling like they have no voice at all in whatever they do whatever environment

846
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:31,909
as you said home life or the workplace for sure. How about this question Laura I've been asking

847
00:56:31,909 --> 00:56:36,969
to everyone who's come on who's the greatest leader in your life? Oh my goodness that's

848
00:56:36,969 --> 00:56:38,590
I knew it was coming.

849
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:45,210
Such a good question I think I mean for me my mum's had a huge impact on me as I've said

850
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:50,909
and then the other person that's had a huge impact on me recently is Gabrielle the consultant her

851
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:56,349
surname's actually famous it's a pretty cool name. Gabrielle famous that's a hard name to forget.

852
00:56:56,949 --> 00:57:04,769
And she's consulted with us she's now the CEO of Vamp but for the first kind of four to five

853
00:57:04,769 --> 00:57:09,809
months of this year we had her working with us at Kik and it was fantastic she helped me develop in

854
00:57:09,809 --> 00:57:10,909
my leadership so much.

855
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:19,389
And she really instilled in me a lot of confidence I think it's it's very as a young leader and I

856
00:57:19,389 --> 00:57:25,389
suppose as a female leader it's really easy to lose confidence as we've discussed and it's quite

857
00:57:25,389 --> 00:57:31,130
rare for someone to come in and really instill that in you and make you feel really empowered

858
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:37,329
and I think having that time over the past four months has given me back this confidence that I

859
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:40,909
lost a little bit last year. I think confidence is not a sure thing.

860
00:57:40,929 --> 00:57:45,090
It's it comes and goes and you have time when you're super clear and then times when you're not

861
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:49,650
but working with Gabrielle over the past at the start of the year for kind of four to five months

862
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:56,510
was incredible and yeah she's had a huge influence on me as a leader. Yeah and there's so many great

863
00:57:56,510 --> 00:58:01,250
bits of wisdom that you've shared today Laura I really appreciate it I'm looking forward to the

864
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:06,030
the TED talk the science of women's leadership. I love the sticker on your fridge it's inspiring

865
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:10,469
man he's got a financial plan I as I said I'm thinking through the eyes of

866
00:58:10,469 --> 00:58:14,969
of my teenage daughter a lot talking to you and and and wanting to to get more of that

867
00:58:14,969 --> 00:58:19,769
inspiration out there it's an incredible story that you've created along with your partner

868
00:58:19,769 --> 00:58:26,170
Steph congratulations Keep It Cleaner what's to come where do you see yourself in maybe 15 or 20

869
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:33,230
years? Oh goodness no idea that's such a hard question I think I mean we have some huge goals

870
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:39,130
for Keep It Cleaner and our vision with that especially in terms of international expansion

871
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:40,230
there's a lot of

872
00:58:40,469 --> 00:58:45,809
areas that I can see huge growth for us and and potential in what we're doing we truly we truly

873
00:58:45,809 --> 00:58:50,150
believe with our product and what we're offering it's it's one of the best or if not the best on

874
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:54,070
on the market and I think that the more people that we can get in front of the better so we've

875
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:58,789
got huge goals with that and then I think as well something that I'm extremely passionate about is

876
00:58:58,789 --> 00:59:04,710
is empowering women to feel confident and believe in themselves more especially in their workplace

877
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:09,909
and I think for me I will just continue to try and tell as many people as I can about that and

878
00:59:10,469 --> 00:59:17,690
what's important for companies to get women in I mean in especially the statistic for CEOs in the top

879
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:24,889
200 ASX companies it's very low and there's so much so much we can do there and I think one of

880
00:59:24,889 --> 00:59:28,969
the biggest things we need to do is get women into senior leadership because that is where they are

881
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:34,329
promoted from so while I don't really know how I'm going to help with that at the moment I hope

882
00:59:34,329 --> 00:59:40,070
in 20 years I'm doing something to contribute to that as well. I wouldn't doubt you for one moment

883
00:59:40,469 --> 00:59:45,329
