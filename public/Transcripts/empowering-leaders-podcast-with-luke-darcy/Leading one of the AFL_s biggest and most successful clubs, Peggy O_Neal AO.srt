00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:10,699
I hope you enjoy this episode of the Empowering Leaders podcast with Peggy O'Neill, the first

2
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:15,919
ever female president of an Australian rules football club, the famous Richmond Tigers,

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,640
who she helped steer to win three premierships in four years, one of the most successful

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,000
periods in the history of the game.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,199
Peggy teaches us a lot, and certainly me, about being calm, always positive and clear

6
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,939
thinking, but I wouldn't underestimate Peggy's determination to succeed and find a solution

7
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:38,380
to be the best in whatever environment she is, whether that's president of the Richmond

8
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:43,640
Football Club, she's the current chancellor at RMIT University, an incredible leader with

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,500
some great lessons and wisdom to share.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,759
It's leaders like Peggy O'Neill who inspire the work we do at Alita, and I'd love you

The Empowering Leaders podcast proudly presented by Temper, a mattress like no other, and we

22
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:30,219
know from talking to incredibly successful leaders like Peggy O'Neill that they all understand

23
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:31,219
the value of sleep.

24
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:36,980
And investing in the world's best bedding, NASA approved, is a decision that you will

25
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,439
not regret.

26
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,140
Peggy O'Neill was born and raised in the now abandoned small mining community of Killarney,

27
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:46,819
West Virginia.

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,280
She comes from a family of coal miners and was the first in her family to go to university

29
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,719
studying law at the University of Virginia.

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,719
Peggy became the first female lawyer at her legal firm in Charleston in the company's

31
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,739
100-year history.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,480
After moving to Australia in the late 1980s, Peggy's incredible career has been a part

33
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,620
of her leadership success story, including becoming the first female president of an

34
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:13,379
Australian rules football club with Richmond in 2013, helping steer them to premiership

35
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,800
success in 2017, 2019 and 2020.

36
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,120
Peggy has a lifetime of community and business achievements.

37
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,560
She's currently the Chancellor of RMIT University, was made an Officer of the Order of Australian

38
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,039
Recognition for her service to football superannuation and finance law, and for the advancement of

39
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,139
women in leadership roles.

40
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:34,139
She was named Melbourneian of the Year in 2021.

41
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,419
And in 2022, was appointed Chair of the Commonwealth Games Organising Committee.

42
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,120
Peggy, it's great to see you today.

43
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,139
Thanks for taking some time.

44
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,639
Oh, you're welcome.

45
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,479
Good to see you too.

46
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,879
Hey, Peggy, I love your life story.

47
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,639
It's fascinating to me growing up in a tiny mining community, as I said, in West Virginia,

48
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:56,419
a coal mining family, to go on to break new ground for female leaders and to hold some

49
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:59,840
of the most significant leadership positions in Australian public life.

50
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:03,800
Can you cast your mind back to being a young girl growing up in America?

51
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,840
Is it hard to imagine where you've ended up?

52
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,300
It's impossible for me to have imagined this, considering where it started.

53
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:21,939
But here I am, and I think it all sort of goes back to in those small towns, I had parents

54
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:28,460
who really encouraged me, and even though they weren't educated, and thought that my

55
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,919
sister and I should have the education that they didn't have.

56
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,360
Yeah.

57
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,919
And along with that, and their sort of encouragement, I just had this curiosity about the world.

58
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,819
And right away, if you're in a small town, the world seems so big, and there's so much

59
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:45,500
going on.

60
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:48,379
But for me, I thought, oh, I want to see some of that.

61
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,379
I want to do that.

62
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,039
And I had a wonderful childhood.

63
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,900
And when you're in a small town, you don't realize that you might be missing opportunities.

64
00:03:55,659 --> 00:04:00,560
But I just thought, I just want to learn and experience as much as I can.

65
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,479
But I was 21 before I saw the ocean.

66
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,099
So it was way up in the mountains, and pretty landlocked.

67
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:12,580
And then I didn't know anyone who had a passport, but I got one, and I started traveling.

68
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,120
And here I am, I ended up in Australia, where I've spent most of my adult life and working life.

69
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,540
So I'm interested in your sister, Peggy.

70
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,100
So you've gone to as far away as you possibly can from West Virginia.

71
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,199
Did she travel?

72
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,560
Did she have a similar trajectory?

73
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,100
No.

74
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,220
She was very bright.

75
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,399
She's a veterinarian.

76
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,420
And she's a veterinarian.

77
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:33,439
And she's a veterinarian.

78
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:33,500
And she's a veterinarian.

79
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:33,600
And she's a veterinarian.

80
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:33,639
And she's a veterinarian.

81
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:33,779
And she's a veterinarian.

82
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,160
And she is a small-town vet.

83
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:42,800
So she went away to one of the Ivy League schools in New York for undergraduate school.

84
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,819
And then she went to vet school at the University of Georgia.

85
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,740
And then she and her husband, who's also a veterinarian, bought a practice and have lived in a...

86
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,800
It's not as small as where we grew up.

87
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,120
It's got about 6,000 people, as opposed to 200 people.

88
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,300
But no, she still lives over there.

89
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,600
She's been to...

90
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,620
Australia and we've...

91
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:12,779
Now that she's traveling a bit more and we've met over in Ireland and thought about her family history and those kinds of things.

92
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,540
But I'm hoping or planning to go back to the U.S. in May.

93
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,560
It'll be the first time I've been there since the pandemic.

94
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,660
So that'll be interesting.

95
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,680
I've got a bit of business to do over there and I'll go down south and see her for a couple of weeks.

96
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,339
It's a long time away from your home country, Peggy.

97
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:33,439
And it's an interesting place, America, at the moment.

98
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,879
On a whole range of fronts and talking leadership at the moment.

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,199
We've just seen the former president arrested in recent times.

100
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,360
How do you feel jumping back into that world?

101
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,459
Is it something that you struggle to align with at the moment?

102
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:53,879
What's your thought on leadership in your old country, the U.S., at the moment?

103
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,079
Well, you're right.

104
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,180
I have a bit of trepidation about what it might be like.

105
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,040
I think once you're outside looking in and you've sort of lost contact.

106
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:09,319
Because before the pandemic, I went at least every nine months or sometimes a couple of times a year.

107
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,879
And so you sort of felt like you had a finger on the pulse a bit better.

108
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:17,040
But I think now it's looking from afar.

109
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:28,439
You think, how did it get to this point with the great divisions in society and people giving credibility to someone who seems so lacking in credibility?

110
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,860
In most of this business life.

111
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,439
So I'll go back and see.

112
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,180
I'll see what it's like.

113
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:42,480
I suspect that if you live there, you don't feel the same way about it as we do outside looking in.

114
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:47,000
Because I think that, and not just because I'm a dual citizen, I have two passports.

115
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,379
And it's not just because I grew up there.

116
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:54,600
But lots of Australians have said we always look to America for leadership across the free world.

117
00:06:54,899 --> 00:07:02,720
And then once that vacuum was there, all sorts of horrible things have been happening and extreme views given.

118
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,139
As if they were legitimate views.

119
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:17,240
So I think that that vacuum of leadership, because even though we have a president there now who's perhaps a bit more functional in getting some things done,

120
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:23,300
you'd have to say there doesn't seem to be a pipeline of inspirational leaders coming through on either party.

121
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,379
And you think we really need someone who thinks long term.

122
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,920
And I think every government might be the same thing.

123
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,139
We need more than that short termism, just get reelected sort of stuff.

124
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,019
So I'm very interested.

125
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,899
I don't think this will be my last trip ever to America.

126
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,439
I have not.

127
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:43,920
But just got to think, well, maybe we'll meet somewhere else if it becomes so difficult.

128
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,199
But I'm looking forward to going back and seeing my family and my friends.

129
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,800
And Peggy, one of the challenges that I see and I follow the US with interest, like I think we all do,

130
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:01,220
because we take a lot of the pulse of America here in Australia and it dictates still a lot of our world down here.

131
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,420
But one of the things I find alarming now, Peggy,

132
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,379
is the search for what actually is factual and true.

133
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:13,839
And we used to have trusted sources where you felt like that was, you know, journalists reported on the facts.

134
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,439
They didn't have alternative facts.

135
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:25,360
And suddenly it feels as though we're cut into this corner now where really we can't even agree on what's factual.

136
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,160
Even when something happens right before your eyes, you can stand there as a leader and say, no, it didn't happen.

137
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,320
How do we put that genie back in the bottle?

138
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:41,960
Oh, I think unless, you know, the public demands it and maybe through voting, something might happen.

139
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,960
But but I agree is how can you not believe what you see?

140
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,519
How can you not believe?

141
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,460
But I think you're right.

142
00:08:50,460 --> 00:09:00,940
It goes back to where the trusted sources anymore, because more and more it's become across the media landscape, the soundbite, the short term.

143
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,820
Let's make something sensational.

144
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,320
Let's make something sensational.

145
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,419
Let's make something sensational.

146
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:13,080
Even though a sensational headline, even though it might not be sensational story, just so we get someone to look in, because that's how we judge ourselves now.

147
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:17,639
Not not on the investigative side, not on getting to the facts.

148
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:28,899
And there's some that do that, but they don't get the airplay or the or the space in newspapers that some of the others do, because it doesn't sell in the same way.

149
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:33,379
I think our attention span and our willingness to read long.

150
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,620
Form journalism or to listen for half an hour about one story, it just isn't there anymore.

151
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,139
And media doesn't give the time to that either.

152
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:57,019
So so I don't know how that would ever be solved, but you have to look far and wide and you have to almost do your own balancing act about listen to some of this, because we all like to listen to things that reinforce what we think.

153
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:03,320
But to find someone who can balance it out for you, you got to search and before that.

154
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,820
It used to be a bit of even handedness, I think.

155
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:19,340
But now I think one of the disturbing things, too, is there might be a minority view, say, that represents five percent of the people, but sometimes that's given equal time as if it represents half the people.

156
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:29,419
And so I just wonder if those extreme views being given airtime is for ratings, too, and not because it's a legitimate view.

157
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:33,100
And so that kind of analysis and.

158
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,559
Tutorial control seems to be missing as well.

159
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,379
So it's a huge problem.

160
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:41,299
But you're right. Where is there a source of truth?

161
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:51,500
And and it's and maybe we're all in it for ourselves, which is putting a lot of we don't have the resources that the news organizations have.

162
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:57,220
Yeah. And the clickbait world, as you described, is is where the money is, isn't it?

163
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,080
And those algorithms are driving that that narrative is why I love this forum, Peggy.

164
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,279
It's a chance to sit down.

165
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,539
With someone and and have time to be able to get your thoughts.

166
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:09,460
And I hope there's a swing back to that.

167
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:15,399
If you want a trusted source, you can actually listen to Peggy O'Neill and find out what she what she generally thinks.

168
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:23,440
I wanted to change tech type slightly because I know you've you've been on the receiving end of mainstream journalism as well.

169
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,259
And I'll ask you about it in a moment when you take these big public roles, all of a sudden Peggy O'Neill becomes in the spotlight.

170
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:33,159
But I want to quote your former current CEO of Richmond, Brendan Gale.

171
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:40,399
Who's a champion player in his own right and the CEO throughout the whole time of of your presidency at at Richmond.

172
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,600
And he said this about you said he praised the brilliance of your leadership.

173
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,000
He said Peggy did never get angry.

174
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,379
She got determined.

175
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:52,240
She didn't panic in a crisis, but instead she pondered problems in the pursuit of a solution.

176
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,340
She has left a powerful lesson for us that there is another way to win.

177
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:02,460
Can I ask you, Peggy, was that a conscious way that you approach that that role, that big public role?

178
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,159
Or is that just you?

179
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,299
Being you?

180
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:07,720
Well, I think some of those are my natural attributes.

181
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,600
I didn't think they were anything special.

182
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:21,700
And sometimes I wonder if that's why I was attracted to the law, because you go, Hmm, I always found that in negotiations, if someone lost their temper, they usually lost the argument.

183
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,460
You know, the business judgment went out the window.

184
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,120
But it's not something that I think too much about.

185
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,480
But I've come to realize that I'm I don't anger is not my first emotion.

186
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:37,659
And, uh, taking time and being patient.

187
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:45,120
I think sport teaches you a lot about being patient as well, more than I probably realize.

188
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:53,379
So I think it's a bit of just who I am and there are other ways, but that was my way.

189
00:12:53,379 --> 00:13:01,279
I also thought that that gave me a chance to respond in a more thoughtful kind of way.

190
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,299
If I needed to respond.

191
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:07,919
If I needed to respond to things. And like you say, I must have been naive.

192
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:17,559
I was still surprised when my becoming president of Richmond, the story lingered for a very long time, perhaps until we won the first premiership.

193
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:21,740
So it's about four years. Richmond might be better if she wasn't there.

194
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:27,379
And that wasn't so explicit. But there was this, you know, what have they done?

195
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:33,200
And so I thought, well, I can't second guess myself. I can't worry about that.

196
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,779
I was elected to be president of Richmond until someone else gets elected. I'll just do it my way.

197
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:52,360
It was it was a pleasure to work with Brendan. And we look back and say, as I was finishing and said, you know, even the bad times, we learned so much and we solved problems that that was rewarding in itself.

198
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,360
You don't know that it's going to end up with, you know, the wonderful result that we were able to achieve.

199
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:04,840
During those years. But you think if you bring the right sort of mindset and that the goal is the same.

200
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:12,539
And once you say the goal isn't to make sure I stay in my position, the goal is to do the right thing by the football club.

201
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:21,779
I think members recognize that. And I think that that's a motivation that everybody can respect you for, even if they don't agree with what your decision is.

202
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,919
And Peggy, you were the first female president in Australian rules football history.

203
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:30,059
Consequently, we've had several others.

204
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,600
I get to spend some time with one of your friends, Kylie Watson Wheeler, who's doing an incredible, incredible job.

205
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:49,299
But going back to, you know, perhaps what we'd seen in the past and what Benny was alluding to in leadership in football was that aggressive thumping the desk and masculine sort of leadership that was all that we knew.

206
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:56,740
I mean, you've been a great champion of women's leadership and the qualities that you bring, as Benny described, that more feminine approach.

207
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,360
You know, less.

208
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:58,720
You go less aggression.

209
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:04,940
I mean, clearly it's it's a it's a different approach, but it seems more sustainable and more successful.

210
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:13,139
Do you feel like we've just we overlooked that for so long and it took the world a long while to understand the strength in the type of leadership you bring?

211
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:20,639
Well, I think that all the sport, not just, you know, Australian rules, but a lot of sport had one model.

212
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:27,360
And that was usually the male model of how leadership, how coaching, how.

213
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:29,840
All of that, because that was all everyone knew.

214
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:34,480
Women's sport was very secondary and no one had a lot of experience.

215
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:44,139
But when I became involved with Richmond on the board in 2005, I thought my skills as a lawyer.

216
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,340
But I also started thinking, well, what are the skills you need to help your football club be successful?

217
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:57,120
And and while there had always been this idea, sort of the amateur idea, which was which was.

218
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:02,840
The case for so long is that you had to play, you had to know the people in the area.

219
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:12,980
But now as football clubs have moved on, what you need are people who have business skills, people who have some of that sporting background, need a variety of things around the table.

220
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,500
And just because you were a great player or a great coach didn't necessarily mean you were right to run the football club.

221
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:27,080
So I sort of saw my being an outsider as of time to be a benefit because I.

222
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,299
I didn't know anyone.

223
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:37,220
I didn't know where the, you know, the bad feelings or the good feelings or who was married to whose brother and who had played and how many teams together.

224
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,480
But it was more just, well, what do we need to do next?

225
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:42,519
What's the what's the plan here?

226
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,919
And you don't have to play to sort of make that happen.

227
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,279
Now, it might it might be easier because, you know, everyone.

228
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,740
But that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to make the right decision.

229
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,340
And I know early on, Brenda and I talked about.

230
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:02,600
If we just make the right decision more often than not, then that's going to set us on a good path.

231
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:05,599
Just don't just try to avoid making bad decisions.

232
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,319
So make neutral ones or make good ones and we'll keep moving on.

233
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:25,619
So so I think that with the as we as you said, the the number of women who are taking president roles and executive roles in football clubs now show that we need a skill and the gender of the person.

234
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,440
It doesn't really matter.

235
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:35,380
And I guess that over time, I started to think of it as perhaps a strength for Richmond.

236
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,519
And and there I was.

237
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:43,220
But again, as I mentioned earlier, I think I was a bit naive about how much attention it would draw.

238
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:47,799
And I started to really understand how outside the loop I was.

239
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,460
And as you said, Peggy, what a great strength in so many ways.

240
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,480
And I think we're understanding that better now, isn't it?

241
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,319
When you haven't got.

242
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:00,500
The history, you can make a more independent judgment at times, can't you?

243
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:11,779
As I said, when you don't know where the bodies are buried, to use a maybe more brutal phrase, you really are thinking about it purely from what's the best outcome for the Richmond Football Club.

244
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:20,960
And we see that in the work we're doing in the leadership space, Peggy, around the brilliance of bringing together someone and diverse thinking, because you don't know what you don't know, do you?

245
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,859
And if you're all the same and, you know, I grew up and played in that industry, Peggy.

246
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:26,319
And you start to sound the same.

247
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,400
And act the same.

248
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:29,799
And it just happens with time.

249
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:34,940
When you put someone in from a different background, there's some real superpower in there, isn't there?

250
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,880
Well, I think so.

251
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,519
I think the real motivation is wanting success for your organization or your team.

252
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,380
And the other stuff is what can you contribute?

253
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:47,880
What can you help us achieve?

254
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:55,400
And you don't want everybody from the same background, whether it's a playing background or a sports administration background.

255
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:55,700
You want people.

256
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:55,940
You want people.

257
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,039
You want people.

258
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:56,099
You want people.

259
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:56,119
You want people.

260
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:56,140
You want people.

261
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:56,160
You want people.

262
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,200
You want people.

263
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,299
You want people.

264
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:56,319
You want people.

265
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:59,319
You want people who have a lot of new ideas.

266
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:06,319
And I often said the Richmond board, I see that what is it the board is unique?

267
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,059
What is it the board can do that nobody else can do?

268
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:14,019
Because otherwise we've got a fantastic management team and Brenda's brought together to great people.

269
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,200
What do we add over and above that?

270
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,740
And I came up with the phrase, we bring news to the outside world.

271
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,880
We bring news of the things that are happening that might help our club.

272
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:39,380
Either through technology, through connections to other businesses, to introducing new people into committees and people into the pool of executive talent.

273
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:47,140
So I always think that the board is a bit of the outside and we need to bring that into the football club.

274
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:54,700
And Peggy, you've got a great calmness about you and I always sense that in your decision making.

275
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,559
Anytime we heard from you across that period of time.

276
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:11,680
But as is the nature of the way that the media works, there was personal attacks that came your way and staggeringly in my mind, someone had contributed in volunteering their time like you were.

277
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:18,720
And there was a famous line, and I've heard you quote it before, that someone once described you as, you being president of Richmond is a bit like a bear on a bike.

278
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:20,660
It just didn't seem natural.

279
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,559
I mean, they're nasty, horrible things that were there.

280
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,160
It was part of how you had to deal with it.

281
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,359
I mean, was it hard to cope with that?

282
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,500
Did you look back and think you wanted to fire back at some stage or?

283
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:36,839
Oh, you know, you can't help getting your feelings hurt when you think, well, then it's then.

284
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,119
But then this person doesn't know me.

285
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,859
They're just, you know, creating a part for me.

286
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:48,779
They've got some narrative and this is just a highlight that I don't know what I'm doing.

287
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,960
But I did say to someone, you know, I always rode a bicycle pretty well.

288
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,579
And so I think you just got to put it in perspective.

289
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:06,920
And I just stopped listening to that and saying, would you really take that opinion about anything else in your life?

290
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,220
Like even what car to buy or what to get in the supermarket?

291
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,940
Do you think a person's opinion matters on things so mundane as that?

292
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:19,299
Then why do you think their opinion matters on you as a person when they don't know you?

293
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,799
Which is a great bit of a life lesson to share, isn't it?

294
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:24,259
Because that, you know, with the.

295
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:30,180
Advent of social media and our youth now, Peggy, who are bombarded with this on a daily basis.

296
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,500
You can find a skill like you just described then.

297
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:34,000
And it's so true, isn't it?

298
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,180
I mean, really, someone that doesn't know has no history or why would you even consider taking that on board?

299
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,559
But it's it's easier said than done.

300
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:45,119
Perhaps a little bit more public on that.

301
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:51,880
Peggy was 2016 and the famous infamous challenge of your board.

302
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,339
And there was a group and there was some, you know, heavy.

303
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:02,180
Hitting high profile past players that were part of that, that wanted to take over the board just before the success took place.

304
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,000
You went on to win three of the next four premierships.

305
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:05,819
You won the premiership the next year.

306
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:11,299
And part of their mission was they were going to sack the coach, Damien Harwick.

307
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:17,539
Have you ever had the time to ponder and look back and think what would happen if they had have succeeded at that time?

308
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,900
Oh, well, you know, it's all speculation.

309
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:24,440
But we had a lot of.

310
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,039
Things going on behind the scenes.

311
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,380
There was momentum building.

312
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:40,480
We sort of had had a strong feeling or almost, I would say, knew that 2016 was going to be a difficult year for the football department and for us to take that next step.

313
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,559
Because we we had gotten into final three years in a row.

314
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,640
You might recall we didn't win any.

315
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:54,339
We thought, well, this is probably about as far as unless we make some changes to personnel.

316
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,900
But this is about as far as we could go.

317
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,500
But the one thing we knew and we took a lot of time to think about this as a board.

318
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:05,119
And we got lots of input and analysis from Brendan and Dan Richardson was head of football at the time.

319
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,259
And the two of them analyzing, is the coach the right person?

320
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,980
And the one thing we did know is he was the right coach.

321
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,759
So there are other things to change.

322
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:20,660
But that's one of the things that always surprised me around any kind of sport is if you change the coach, we'll all be OK.

323
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,700
You know, it's this sort of one person makes all the difference.

324
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,400
The coach is very important.

325
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,140
Important person.

326
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,299
But that's not going to guarantee success.

327
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:35,200
So we were committed to finding the things that needed to be changed rather than just changing stuff and finding out afterwards.

328
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,440
Oh, that was the good part.

329
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,880
We've changed a good thing.

330
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,660
And that's that's not right.

331
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:46,980
So I guess with spec speculating, we didn't know we would win in 2017, but we thought it was coming together.

332
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,880
And then Damien is, you know, has been reported, went to Harvard and did a lot of work on leadership himself.

333
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:05,859
And how he could be a better leader and came back and decided it was going to be fun and play to your strengths and all those things that now seem to be across football everywhere.

334
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:19,240
But I think it was him deciding the kind of leader he wanted to be and having some additional tools on personal development, because so much of football and sport had been about professional development.

335
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,500
You know what the latest gadget, what's the latest training technique?

336
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:24,019
But the real.

337
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,980
Success is often those connections and those personal relationships.

338
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:36,339
And and and the course that Damien took was helping him identify when was he at his best and how far is that off what you've been doing?

339
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,319
So so that made a big difference.

340
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:43,220
But back to your original question, I don't think any of us.

341
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:45,240
Well, we wouldn't have been there as a board.

342
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:54,420
I doubt that we would have had a CEO who would have stayed and Damien would have been gone and we would have been starting all over again.

343
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,700
Because I kept thinking if we every five years we change, we'll always be starting all over.

344
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,819
And at some point you've got to stop starting all over because you've got to figure out what's good and what you can build on.

345
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:09,859
And and so we brought in some new people in administration.

346
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:11,859
We brought in some new assistant coaches.

347
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:14,400
Damien applied himself in a different way.

348
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,799
Trent Cotchen was maturing as a captain.

349
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,279
And and then we had a great trade season.

350
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,279
And got.

351
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,200
Out of the the core of a of a good team and some position.

352
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,079
So there were a lot of things that had to come together, but we were working on them.

353
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:36,160
And there are things that you can talk about until they come to fruition.

354
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,500
And for example, we were already talking to Neil Baum.

355
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,420
And so he came in to assist us and, you know, as a champion Richmond player.

356
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,099
And but there were lots of things going on.

357
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:54,440
And I thought if this happens, then we'll be gone and they'll have to deal with all the change.

358
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,519
That's going to happen.

359
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:06,059
And it's really hard to come in with this wholesale board changes when you don't have the corporate history about what's what what's been tried before and what didn't didn't work.

360
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:13,200
So so I don't know for sure what would happen, but it wouldn't have looked like our twenty seventeen, eighteen, nineteen to twenty.

361
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,240
It would have been a different thing.

362
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,779
And in effect, I believe starting all over.

363
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:24,240
Yeah, and I think it's great credit to your leadership and to Brendan's leadership at the time, as you said.

364
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:32,440
Probably the history of your football club in the thirty seven years after the previous premiership was that it did change every five years.

365
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,420
And I find this fascinating conversation for you, this obsession in sport around sacked the coach, sacked the coach.

366
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:43,960
We frame a market at the start of the year on which coach is going to get sacked first, Dan.

367
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,900
Where's the pressure?

368
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,819
Yeah.

369
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:54,420
And you think these are people, well, you know, and you see it and you think, what if every CEO in the country got ranked every January?

370
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,420
But which CEO is going to make it to the to June?

371
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,500
Who's going to be gone?

372
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,240
Who's who's vying for that job?

373
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:09,119
But but also with twenty sixteen, you know, the lawyer in me came out as well and it's like I've been elected to do a job.

374
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,059
And if someone else gets elected to do this job, I will.

375
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:13,559
Well, we'll all leave.

376
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:19,460
And there's an election every year and three three positions turn over on the board.

377
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,220
If you run for election and you get elected, we'll work together.

378
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,400
But the lawyer in me went.

379
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,839
I can't legally even turn over my office to you.

380
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:33,039
So there was a bit of go on, get your legal advice and run for election.

381
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,460
And no one ever ran for election.

382
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,519
And I love, you know, going back to Brennan's quote about you, you didn't get angry.

383
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:40,640
She got determined.

384
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,920
And and we just saw a little piece of that then.

385
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:50,779
And, you know, for all the people that love the Richmond Football Club, which is tens and tens of thousands, it's been a golden era.

386
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:54,140
And you can say and I love just the strategies and finding out.

387
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,920
And where to make change, not change for change sake.

388
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,160
And, you know, and also like the empathy of the people.

389
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,119
We know those people.

390
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:03,460
A lot of them face ridiculous scrutiny and pressure.

391
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:08,839
And we've seen horrible outcomes for for senior coaches in this indigenous game we play in Australia.

392
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:12,279
It seems a bit out of and out of hand at times.

393
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:16,299
I love Peggy that I never hear even when you it sounds like you're fired up.

394
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:17,980
You don't ever say anything negative.

395
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:23,839
I can't you know, my research going through, I was looking for some moment where you might have said, you know what?

396
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,579
I've had enough of that person.

397
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,559
I mean, is that is that your upbringing?

398
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:28,519
Is that your nature?

399
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:31,700
Or it's it's it's a brilliant practice.

400
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,180
Oh, I say plenty negative, maybe just not on the record.

401
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:43,079
I mean, to me, but I also sort of think, well, people have said plenty of negative things about me and I don't want to be one of those people.

402
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:45,400
People said a lot of wonderful things about me, too.

403
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:51,380
And I think, you know, I think everyone's mother said to them, if you can say something good, don't say anything at all.

404
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,859
And maybe that sunk in.

405
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:53,200
But.

406
00:28:53,839 --> 00:29:14,519
I think it's better to be silent than to say something negative and then find out that you've said the wrong thing or you've hurt somebody unnecessarily or it's not really who wants to battle something out in the media or in a public kind of way.

407
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:23,819
So, so, no, I, I, I can't believe that you look to see if you find something negative, I said, but but it's been it was a pretty good experience.

408
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:24,380
It's been a pretty good run.

409
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,839
So, you know, there wasn't a lot of negative to talk about.

410
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,980
It was an amazing, amazing period of time.

411
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:37,759
And can I ask you, how does an American born lawyer who moved to Australia fall in love with this unique, strange sport?

412
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,460
You always find when I'm talking to Americans, it's the hardest sport in the world to describe.

413
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:46,240
The Americans don't tend to get Australian rules football.

414
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,140
And what what made you love it so much?

415
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:53,359
Well, I've always loved sport, you know.

416
00:29:53,839 --> 00:30:07,480
Where I grew up, it was so remote and so poor, and there would be like one field for gridiron and basketball and baseball in the springtime and all that.

417
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,420
But, you know, it's like small towns anywhere.

418
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:14,839
The big social element of those small towns is sport and the church.

419
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:23,660
And so even though girls weren't allowed to play any of those things and there wasn't space for them to play,

420
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,880
it was, you know, predominantly boys growing up.

421
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,119
I loved, you know, I was the tomboy.

422
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,259
I loved playing.

423
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,240
I was a pretty good quarterback.

424
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,119
I like kicking the ball at basketball.

425
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:37,099
I loved my dad.

426
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,720
It was just me and my sister.

427
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,539
But my dad played as a softball pitcher in the local leagues until he was 50.

428
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,440
And so so I was the one that went along with him to do a lot of those things.

429
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:53,480
And even growing up, I wrote a column for the university newspaper on.

430
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:58,099
Girl sport and, you know, who had played and all that sort of thing.

431
00:30:58,099 --> 00:30:59,420
So I just loved it.

432
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:06,440
And and even though I was never an athlete, I always went to everything.

433
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,420
You know, I was a great spectator and I'm still a great spectator.

434
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:18,140
And so when I moved here and, you know, I live with inside of the MCG and I always have and I live in Richmond.

435
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,579
And so I picked Richmond as my team and because everyone seemed to have one.

436
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:23,460
And that's what everybody talked about.

437
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:23,559
Yeah.

438
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,900
Talked about all the time as their team and the results.

439
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,799
And so I thought, well, I got to have a team.

440
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:32,019
And so Richmond was just coming out of the Save Our Skins campaign.

441
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:37,859
And and and people would say to me, oh, you should have been here when they were good.

442
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,940
And I thought, oh, they'll come good again.

443
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:43,180
I didn't know I'd wait another 30 years.

444
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,819
But that was sort of, well, once you pick it.

445
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:53,460
And then I went to first match the the what was then the new Great Southern Stand had just opened.

446
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,759
And it was an April afternoon.

447
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:56,700
It was gorgeous.

448
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:04,259
And just to see how big the ground was and because I listened on the radio, but I hadn't been to a game and and I just loved it.

449
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:07,619
I loved the fact that it was such a big part of the community of Melbourne.

450
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:13,339
And and so I joined a tipping competition to force myself to learn a bit more about the game.

451
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:19,619
And and then I just became a sort of priority to get to the game.

452
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:23,220
So maybe it was a relief from, you know, being a partner in a law firm.

453
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:36,420
And having that that, you know, a lot of people find their the sort of relief of of going to a sporting event is a is is just part of what you need to manage the sort of stress of your job.

454
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:46,319
But that I just loved it and started doing more and more and and realized that over time that if you paid more, you got better class and membership and you got a better seat.

455
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:50,220
And if you paid even more, you could go to these auctions and buy things.

456
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,980
And so I remember one of the first auctions.

457
00:32:53,220 --> 00:33:01,259
I went to I bought dinner with the captain and coach, and it was when Campbell and Danny Frawley and we did that for three years.

458
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:09,539
And so I became very good friends with them and, you know, it was very sad about Danny a couple of years ago and and all that.

459
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:18,539
But so it just and I thought, oh, they're nice people and and I enjoy this and and then I wasn't on the board at that time.

460
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:21,839
And then I went on the board and got a bit more distance from from that.

461
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:23,220
But I still hear from Wayne, you know.

462
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,460
And Sarah Campbell quite a bit.

463
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:35,759
That's what I love, Peggy, the community of of anything, I suppose, and I picture myself, you know, perhaps going the other way and dialing into what life would have been like in West Virginia.

464
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:37,980
I suppose you try and find community, don't you?

465
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,960
And that's the community I've grown up in.

466
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,299
And you mentioned those names where we're all close.

467
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:45,839
You know, Wayne's an incredible person.

468
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:51,599
We had some good rivalry in our time on the field and loved Danny and working with with Danny.

469
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,019
And so it's, you know, from you.

470
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:53,740
I love it.

471
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:58,759
It's you come to town, you move into Richmond randomly and, you know, you end up being Melbourne into the year.

472
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:07,259
You end up now as the as the Commonwealth Games organizer for the city of Victoria in 2026, the chancellor of MIT University.

473
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:13,119
It's a it's a it's a great contribution you've made to come into a foreign community.

474
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:20,139
You must have incredible pride in what you've done because it's a it's a fascinating and an amazing contribution.

475
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:21,360
Peggy, I wanted to.

476
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,019
I love talking to different leaders.

477
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:29,019
There's about what we think are really common traits for leaders in different settings.

478
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:34,139
And you've brought such a unique perspective to to the world that you're in.

479
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:39,780
And we think one of those dimensions that we start with, it's hard to ignore is a sense of self-leadership.

480
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,099
It's hard to be a leader of someone else unless you've got that sense of self-leadership.

481
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:46,179
Does that resonate with you?

482
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:52,840
Yeah, I over time, it's when people ask me questions like this, because usually when you're going about your day to day,

483
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,420
life, you don't reflect on these things.

484
00:34:55,420 --> 00:35:05,340
But but over time, I think that self-awareness about who you are is what you really bring to the leadership role.

485
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:13,000
And if you're trying to be somebody else, then you're never going to really succeed because it's not you.

486
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:22,840
It's not who you are. So I think that self-awareness, that idea about what do you want to do with?

487
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,760
This leadership role, why do you want to be a leader?

488
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,420
I think coming back to even the basic motivation about what is this?

489
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:33,420
What do you think leadership is? Why do you think it's something that you want to be attached to?

490
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,000
As we all know, having a title doesn't make you a leader.

491
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,179
We know a lot of people who have a title and nobody follows them.

492
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:45,639
I often say, you know, the first thing about being a leader is do you have any followers?

493
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:52,000
And I think that comes from that self-awareness about are these people with me or are they not or why?

494
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,460
What am I trying to do?

495
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:52,840
Yeah.

496
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:59,679
What am I trying to achieve and am I communicating because communication, I think, is important, but listening, I think, is really important.

497
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:11,079
And it's all those self-awareness about the traits that galvanize people to want to join in whatever you're trying to, whatever goal you're trying to achieve.

498
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:16,239
But I think it all starts with that self-awareness about who you are.

499
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:21,219
And that means some things you need to work on if you want to achieve certain things.

500
00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:22,460
But to listen to the feedback.

501
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:29,039
And to listen to the feedback that you're getting about, but I often just think, why do you want to be a leader?

502
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:31,880
Why do some people want it more than others?

503
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,539
Why do some think they are a leader when they aren't?

504
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:43,340
Why do we just naturally go to some people for guidance who may not think of themselves as leaders?

505
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:48,340
But I think if you have a real sense of yourself, you can tell whether people are with you or not.

506
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:52,079
And it all sort of goes back to you got to have some followers.

507
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,380
Yeah, it's a great thought to share, and I appreciate you doing that.

508
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,780
And we're really passionate about that sense too, the title, Don't Make Leadership At All.

509
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:10,159
And you can be on your first day and have as big an impact in a place as someone who's been there for 20 years just by the nature of what you bring.

510
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:17,699
And I think for us, that sense of not having to wait to have an impact as well is really important.

511
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:21,880
And I love the way you described that, that sense of self-awareness.

512
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:30,579
And I think moving on to, we see people in positions like yours are really conscious of how they positively impact others in their environment on a daily basis.

513
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:33,719
And that's a thought that they think of regularly.

514
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:39,050
How have you gone about positively impacting others?

515
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:46,730
Well, a bit of it's what we've already been talking about is what's natural to you.

516
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:52,269
I think also that constructive criticism is much more helpful.

517
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,230
I think that's a good point.

518
00:37:53,230 --> 00:38:01,030
It's much more helpful that you want to help people get better at what they do to understand what you're trying to do.

519
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:10,030
So I think the positivity is helping people find out more about themselves and about their capabilities.

520
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:17,469
It doesn't mean that you stick with things that aren't working, but that you give people a chance and that you feel you've been fair.

521
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:21,610
And I remember early on when I had, I was a partner in a law firm,

522
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,230
and I had to,

523
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:31,030
accept the responsibility of some people aren't going to work out and some people on my team I'm going to have to have those terrible conversations with.

524
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:42,030
And I thought, if you can put your hand in your heart and say, you know, you've been fair and they're going to be no surprises because if it's me, I'd want to know where my shortcomings were along the way.

525
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:46,429
And I was given a chance to fix it and it could be this job isn't for everybody.

526
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:53,030
But I think that's part of helping people develop and helping them understand that, perhaps,

527
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:58,329
what they're doing isn't their real strength and they need to look somewhere else.

528
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:09,329
So I think it goes back to being somewhat easy to get along with, not getting angry at people for something that is usually about you more than about them.

529
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:15,329
And I think that we all like to work with people that seem to like us.

530
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:17,329
Yeah, great, great answer.

531
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:22,329
And I love your description is that sometimes you have to make hard decisions when you're in positions.

532
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:26,829
And you've done that all your life in the legal firms you work with, I'm sure.

533
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:39,230
But often if you do that with empathy and kindness and a sense of fairness, it's a very different way to go about it rather than, you know, some of the brutal environments that we've all seen and decision makers that don't have empathy.

534
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,829
We know the lasting effect of that.

535
00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:47,829
Creating and sharing a vision in a clear way is a dimension of leadership we're really seeing as a common trait.

536
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:49,630
That's played out for you a lot.

537
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,730
I mean, we've talked a lot about the Richmond Football Club.

538
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:52,230
It was a really clear vision.

539
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:56,730
And there was some, you know, the industry sort of mocked a bit of that vision at the start.

540
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:01,730
I remember Brendan coming out and talking about premierships and, you know, large membership bases.

541
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:04,730
I mean, how have you gone about that in your life?

542
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,730
I said, whoa, Brendan, whoa.

543
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,730
Think about that a minute.

544
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,730
I think he took us with him too.

545
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,730
So, anyway, sorry I interrupted you.

546
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:14,730
No, that's good.

547
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,730
I mean, was there some – he came out at the time.

548
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:21,630
He said, we want to have 75,000 members and win two premierships in a pretty short space of time.

549
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,630
And the industry laughed at Richmond, didn't they?

550
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,630
I mean, were you a little concerned at the time or?

551
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:34,130
Well, I knew Brendan didn't think they were just words.

552
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:46,130
You know, this wasn't – but at the same time, we needed something to energize, something to get all the Tiger Army who had been very loyal.

553
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,130
People talk about it.

554
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,130
They haven't been.

555
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:51,130
We weren't winning anything and we still kept getting record memberships.

556
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:55,630
So, we needed something to spark a new Richmond.

557
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,630
And this was something for us to work toward.

558
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:03,630
And we talked about it at a board level and measured ourselves all the time.

559
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:08,630
And, oh, well, you know, we've retired dead a year earlier than we'd planned.

560
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:13,630
And we've made finals, but we haven't made – you know, gone beyond it.

561
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,630
And membership kept creeping up.

562
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:20,630
And I remember the first year when I was on the board, I think it was about 20 years.

563
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:24,630
I think it was about 2006, I guess.

564
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:28,630
We actually made like a $4,000 profit.

565
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,630
And it was like, oh, my goodness.

566
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,630
We actually have made money.

567
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:36,630
So, those little victories along the way.

568
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:44,630
But I knew that Brendan came in as the new CEO, Steven Wright having retired for health reasons.

569
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:49,630
And Brendan came in and very much wanted to jumpstart.

570
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,630
Jumpstart the club again.

571
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,630
And he talked to us and walked through it.

572
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,630
And it's like, well, we're going to give it a go.

573
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,630
We're going to try this.

574
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:01,630
And then after we were – we did pretty well in the first five years of his 10-year plan.

575
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:08,630
And then it was sort of parked, you know, and nobody really thought about, oh, that was a 10-year plan.

576
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:18,630
And then when we're coming up for our third premiership and if we win this, we have won three premierships in 10 years when we started from nothing.

577
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:23,630
And hadn't even been in finals in, I think, 11 years at that point.

578
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:28,630
So, it was – yeah, I think it was necessary.

579
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:34,630
And it made us all have a lot of energy about trying to achieve something for the club.

580
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:39,630
Yeah, and 100,000 plus members is the current number.

581
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:44,630
It was – yeah, as you said, it was a vision that was shared really publicly, wasn't it?

582
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:47,630
And you felt when it started happening.

583
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,630
Great credit to you.

584
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:52,630
And backing in the CEO to fulfill it.

585
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,630
It's been an amazing success story all around.

586
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:58,630
We see curiosity as a common word when I sit down and talk with different leaders, Peggy.

587
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:02,630
And through that curiosity, they're constantly learning and developing themselves.

588
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:05,630
Does that resonate as well with you?

589
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,630
Well, it does.

590
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:11,630
But I'm one of – I'm someone who loved being a student.

591
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:16,630
And it's sort of a – you know, you get to the point you're not doing formal education in the same way.

592
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,630
But you're meeting new people that, you know –

593
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:23,630
You're meeting new people that you learn from if you let yourself.

594
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:29,630
And I think that goes back to understanding a bit more about the kind of person that you are.

595
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:36,630
And I think that my curiosity about people and places is really sort of the theme of my life.

596
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:46,630
And I often think that if I didn't take on some of the jobs that I have now, that I'd love to go work on a Ph.D. in something.

597
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:50,630
And everything is just wonderfully – I'm curious about it.

598
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:55,630
It's just a wonderful experience to meet someone new, to get the new ideas.

599
00:43:55,630 --> 00:44:00,630
And whether – I'm sort of more in the arts kind of thing rather than science.

600
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,630
But I can be fascinated by science too.

601
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:10,630
But I just think to meet someone who writes something wonderfully or a musician who does something that creates beauty in the world.

602
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:15,630
And how little we know – or how little I know about that whole process.

603
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,630
And who these people are.

604
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:27,630
And more and more sometimes this information overload is how many people are doing things out there that would be exciting if we knew more about it.

605
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:32,630
And so every day I learn something new from someone or about someone.

606
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:35,630
So I think that that means you're never stale.

607
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:39,630
That means you never feel like you've arrived.

608
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:44,630
And that you can continue to be excited about new experiences.

609
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:45,630
Peggy, we see –

610
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,630
Lee is really conscious of how they communicate with clarity.

611
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:50,630
You've got some big roles.

612
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,630
Chancellor of RMIT.

613
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:57,630
A big job with the organizing committee for the Commonwealth Games in 2026.

614
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:01,630
There's some high public profile roles again that you've had.

615
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:04,630
How have you gone about your communication?

616
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:11,630
Well, both of those are – because of my curiosity about them.

617
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:14,630
It's not as if – it's sort of like walking into Richmond and going,

618
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:17,630
oh, I want to learn about this.

619
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:24,630
Both of those roles when I was approached to sort of assess my interests, I thought, are you sure?

620
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,630
I don't know anything about this.

621
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:37,630
And then, again, it was a bit like the Richmond role is, well, you don't have to have spent a lifetime in it to understand it.

622
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:38,630
And so take your time.

623
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:39,630
You're going to learn a lot.

624
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:42,630
You're going to meet a lot of new people who are doing a lot of different kinds of things.

625
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:43,630
There's going to be good times and bad times.

626
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:53,630
But, again, going back to I think I am the kind of person that can understand the big picture eventually.

627
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:56,630
I'm not going to understand the minutiae of anything.

628
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:58,630
But I do like working with people.

629
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:06,630
And I often have said if you don't like being on committees, you don't want to be on a board because they're just committees.

630
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:12,630
And there's one decision that's made, and we all have to get to the point that we can agree with that.

631
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:14,630
And I think I can do that.

632
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:19,630
I've always enjoyed working with groups of people to achieve things.

633
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:27,630
When I was a lawyer, I had a great team of people and we're still friends, even though I don't practice law with any of them anymore.

634
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:37,630
So I think that all of those kinds of elements go into running anything at that board level.

635
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:41,630
I'm not the CEO or the CFO or the execs who have to do that.

636
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:44,630
I'm not the execs who have to know the intimate detail.

637
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:54,630
What I have to do is to get people to come together and make decisions, as I said, hopefully make more good decisions than bad decisions.

638
00:46:54,630 --> 00:47:04,630
And that leads to the last dimension I wanted to talk to you about, which is the sense that collaboration now is something that leaders are really conscious of and seek out.

639
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:08,630
You mentioned that a board is effectively collaborative.

640
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:11,630
When you get on a committee, you have to be collaborative.

641
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,630
How important has that been to you?

642
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:18,630
Well, I think it's what interests me in being on boards.

643
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:31,630
And the ones who, the boards that function the best doesn't mean that everybody agrees, but everybody has matured discussions and brings something to the table about another perspective, as we were saying earlier.

644
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:40,630
So I just think it's great to work with a group of people and to go in with one point of view and through discussion find out that, oh, well, that wasn't the only point of view.

645
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:41,630
Right.

646
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,630
And now I need to think about it some more.

647
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:52,630
And if you're on a board that has those people with those attributes, some days you just think, gee, we've done good work today.

648
00:47:52,630 --> 00:48:06,630
And sometimes if you're spending all your time on a board or a committee working with difficult people who don't have that same idea that it's a collective decision, you realize that it can really hold the organization back.

649
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:10,630
So it's a fine line to walk between.

650
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:21,630
Groupthink, which no one wants, and then having people who are just there to argue all the time because only their view is the legitimate one.

651
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:23,630
But I enjoy it.

652
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:33,630
I have some, I've been on some great boards and RMIT and the Commonwealth Games are shaping up to be great boards too.

653
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:35,630
I'm really enjoying my time there.

654
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:39,630
Peggy, ask these questions to all the community.

655
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:42,630
To all the great people I've had the privilege of sitting down with.

656
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,630
And I've loved this conversation.

657
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:52,630
I always feel like I learn an enormous amount about your positivity and patience and clear thinking and calmness.

658
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,630
It's inspiring.

659
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:57,630
Who has been the greatest leader in your life?

660
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:01,630
Well, I think all the public figures.

661
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:02,630
I don't know.

662
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:06,630
You know, when you think and always think, well, that's what we see.

663
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:08,630
But.

664
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:18,630
But I guess if I would think of who's inspirational in that way, I've been on a number of not-for-profit boards.

665
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:25,630
And when I see what people do with so little to make changes in society, I think, no, there's a real leader.

666
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,630
Unsung for the most part.

667
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:37,630
Working really hard on behalf of people in need or a cause that needs to be addressed because, you know, we'll all be better off for it.

668
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:38,630
Those are the people that I really just applaud.

669
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:39,630
You know, and think that I would like to be regarded as that kind of person.

670
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:40,630
Someone who just works hard for the cause.

671
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:41,630
You're mine.

672
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:42,630
Initially, I felt Peggy went to a few public inspirations.

673
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:43,630
Was there any, you know, and was there anyone specifically in the social venture and the not-for-profit space?

674
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:44,630
Is there any names that spring to mind?

675
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:45,630
Oh, yeah.

676
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:46,630
Yeah.

677
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:47,630
Yeah.

678
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:48,630
Yeah.

679
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:49,630
Yeah.

680
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:50,630
Yeah.

681
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,630
Yeah.

682
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:52,630
Yeah.

683
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:53,630
Yeah.

684
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:54,630
Yeah.

685
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:55,630
Yeah.

686
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:56,630
Yeah.

687
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:57,630
Yeah.

688
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:58,630
Yeah.

689
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:59,630
Yeah.

690
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:00,630
Yeah.

691
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:01,630
Yeah.

692
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:02,630
Yeah.

693
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:03,630
Yeah.

694
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:04,630
Yeah.

695
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:05,630
Yeah.

696
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:06,630
Yeah.

697
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:07,630
Yeah.

698
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:08,630
Yeah.

699
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,630
Yeah.

700
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:10,630
Yeah.

701
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:11,630
Yeah.

702
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:12,630
Yeah.

703
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:13,630
Yeah.

704
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:14,630
Yeah.

705
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:15,630
No more recommendations, Mmmm.

706
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:19,630
I'm on the Board of Women's Housing that builds social housing for women who are destitute,

707
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:25,590
women in domestic violence situations, women coming out of prison.

708
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:36,050
And the CEO of that has dedicated her life to improving the lot of women in those dire

709
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:37,610
circumstances.

710
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:45,869
you'd never know who it is but who she is but she works tirelessly for that and then sometimes I

711
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:51,150
look back and think about in those small coal mining towns and my mother was one of these people

712
00:50:51,150 --> 00:51:00,289
the volunteers who just make things work and who never did it for themselves but to but to benefit

713
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:04,809
someone else and whether that was you know volunteering to put together Christmas baskets

714
00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:12,110
were needy families I used to say to my mother people would have thought we were a needy family

715
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:16,070
she said but we were so much better off than everybody else so she would be the one going

716
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:20,869
around and helping everybody and getting somebody to drive them to the doctor and getting all those

717
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:26,750
sorts of things and I think we really rely on volunteers and people like that who are community

718
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:33,389
minded to to achieve so much in this world that that we take it for granted sometimes and most

719
00:51:33,389 --> 00:51:34,010
of them are women.

720
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:40,389
Yeah great credit for you for uh for giving that a a positive mention in the way you did and you're

721
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:45,449
right isn't it's the unsung heroes that make our whole community thrive and and the as you said the

722
00:51:45,449 --> 00:51:51,110
women element to that is uh is off the charts uh in the spirit of collaboration we're really

723
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:55,949
obsessed with uh collaboration and you've got so many diverse interests and uh so many different

724
00:51:55,949 --> 00:52:01,929
roles is there been one person who's got to collaborate with them on you know whatever it

725
00:52:01,929 --> 00:52:04,690
might be you mentioned a PhD before or a musician.

726
00:52:04,809 --> 00:52:08,630
Or uh another lady you've thought that's the person I know I could do something special with

727
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,869
is there any can I prize a name out of you Peggy?

728
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:19,949
Well uh this is sort of uh way out there but I would love to have been a collaborator with the

729
00:52:19,949 --> 00:52:28,909
Beatles. I don't know the the recent um I think it was last year the documentary Get Back uh the

730
00:52:28,909 --> 00:52:34,289
long where they're in the studio and the way they made great songs again it's that miracle of

731
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:36,170
creativity that I have none of that.

732
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:44,550
And if maybe you can collaborate and maybe bring some of that along um there's uh and and figures

733
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:50,409
in history I mean I would think um I don't know if it's collaborate but to make change like the

734
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:58,849
suffragettes who are but look what look what they faced and look what they did and uh and now we

735
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:04,190
find too often people take the vote for granted where people all over the world are still dying

736
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:04,989
for the right to vote.

737
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:06,170
So so that's.

738
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:10,989
That's sort of a bit of a that way but I would love to have been able to learn how to play the

739
00:53:10,989 --> 00:53:16,210
guitar and been there in the in the Beatles sessions when they were putting all their albums

740
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:16,610
together.

741
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:21,269
That would be a special uh collaboration to to sit on wouldn't it?

742
00:53:21,269 --> 00:53:26,909
Not so serious but I I would um have been in awe.

743
00:53:27,429 --> 00:53:32,309
Well Peggy thank you so much for taking the time and uh and for your contribution to

744
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:35,670
community that served me incredibly well from a young age and and

745
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:40,809
being on the other side of the fence and growing up and really wanting to be in that from uh from

746
00:53:40,809 --> 00:53:45,949
the age of of five to see what you've been able to do and the the leadership and the you know as

747
00:53:45,949 --> 00:53:52,530
as Benny Gale said so uh eloquently you you've shown a different way a a humble and a a caring

748
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:57,510
and a kind way to achieve success and I think it's a great lesson that has been left behind for

749
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:03,489
for lots of us in in an industry that can be combative at times to to the extreme so thanks

750
00:54:03,489 --> 00:54:06,170
Peggy for uh for all of your your efforts and your work.
