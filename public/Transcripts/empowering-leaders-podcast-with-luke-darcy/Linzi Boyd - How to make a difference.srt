1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:12,279
How do you make a decision earlier in your life of where you want to be

2
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,839
and how do you follow that passion?

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,160
G'day, it's Luke Darcy.

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,019
The idea of self-improvement and leadership both on and off the field

5
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:24,780
has been a lifelong passion of mine.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,679
With one of my oldest friends, we created a leader collective

7
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,440
and have had the privilege of working with thousands of leaders

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,600
in education, sport, industry and the arts

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,560
that have helped shift to what we see as the 21st century style of leadership

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,039
where everyone has a voice.

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,619
In this podcast, we hear stories from these iconic leaders.

12
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:02,359
I sat down with the founder of One Earth, Lindsay Boyd,

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,079
to chat about adapting your passions amongst the pandemic,

14
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,000
finding your purpose in wanting to make a difference

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,299
in a new platform that creates an entirely new form of collaboration.

16
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:18,739
Our next guest needs the full introduction

17
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:21,579
because it's an extraordinary life that she has lived.

18
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,480
She's a visionary leader.

19
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:25,280
Lindsay Boyd is a woman known for building famous brands

20
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,540
and speaking on the world stage

21
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:26,739
about her passion for leadership.

22
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:30,340
She's here to create the face of the modern world.

23
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:32,859
She's also a best-selling author, serial entrepreneur

24
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,939
and founder of Bob, which is about to undergo a rebrand.

25
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:37,140
I want to ask her about that.

26
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,140
By age 24, Lindsay had set up and sold two businesses.

27
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:42,000
Her second company was sold to Caterpillar

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,599
and her third business, Surgery,

29
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,879
championed some of the most well-respected brands known today.

30
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:48,680
Lindsay now works in the enterprise market.

31
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:51,920
She's teaching entrepreneurs how to build a famous brand

32
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,200
for bigger valuation and to scale to make impact in the world,

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,519
changing the way modern business,

34
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,200
operates and creating the face of modern business.

35
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,120
She launched the first purpose-led platform, Bob Earth,

36
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,120
which will soon be One Earth in 2020,

37
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:07,859
which connects people to unite, learn to grow and trade

38
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:09,120
with positive impact in the world.

39
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:11,539
It is an extraordinary life that she has lived

40
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,560
and very excited to speak to Lindsay Boyd.

41
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,060
Welcome, Lindsay.

42
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,879
Thank you for having me today.

43
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,860
I'm excited to be on your show.

44
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,080
Thanks for your time.

45
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,659
You were born in Leeds and doing some research

46
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:23,819
just to find a bit of your background.

47
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,800
You've got two older brothers, I understand.

48
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,500
Can you describe yourself?

49
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,840
We've been from a rag-trade family with grandparents

50
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,000
who worked in fashion and manufacturing,

51
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,680
even though your father was a dentist.

52
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:37,379
But I think the first place to start is at the age of 15,

53
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,319
you decided school wasn't for you.

54
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,379
That was a pretty big call, Lindsay,

55
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,900
to go home and tell the parents.

56
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,960
How did that go down?

57
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,379
Yeah, well, as you can imagine, my dad was a dentist,

58
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:51,219
so he came from an educated, you know, university background.

59
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,699
And at the age of 11, I stood in the kitchen with my mum

60
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:55,460
and I said to her,

61
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,400
do you know what, I'm thinking of leaving school, mum.

62
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:02,300
And my mum was like, Lindsay, what are you going to do with your life?

63
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,419
And I said, well, I think I'm going to be as big as Oprah Winfrey.

64
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,000
And my mum looked at me and really like I had two heads

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,639
and I'd lost the plot at this point.

66
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,939
And at the age of 15, I did leave school with no qualifications

67
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:20,500
and I had this mad, deep, burning desire

68
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,560
that I could do something impactful in the world.

69
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,419
And I'd seen Oprah.

70
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,020
And she'd inspired me to believe that I could build something,

71
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:32,340
not knowing what that was.

72
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,240
And so I did leave school.

73
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:39,000
And at the age of 18, I started in retail.

74
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,099
You heard that I came from the rag trade

75
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,840
and my grandparents, both sides were tailors.

76
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:47,520
And so I bought my first retail shop in Leeds,

77
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
in the north of England.

78
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:52,800
And I brought diesel and replay into the north of England.

79
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,439
And I don't know if there's any like big football,

80
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,439
but I had a very famous footballer's wife work for me.

81
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,680
And it gave me my first taste of what celebrity and fame

82
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,560
could do for your shop,

83
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:09,060
because literally my clothes used to walk out of the shop.

84
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,659
And so it was a very successful shop.

85
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,019
And then I sold it at 21 when my friends were going to university.

86
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,860
And I set up in my second business,

87
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,459
which was the footwear manufacturing business.

88
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,439
And we spotted a trend in the market for fashion sneakers,

89
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:30,459
and I then, we sold 150,000 pairs of shoes in the first season.

90
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,360
So at the age of 21,

91
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,819
I had a business turning over nearly 5 million pounds.

92
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:42,819
And we had seven distributions set up around the world,

93
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,319
had the shoes in the design museum in England,

94
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,019
in London, next to Evian bottles.

95
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:51,459
And as you heard, I sold the business to Caterpillar

96
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:53,240
when I was 24.

97
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,980
So it was a bit of a crazy journey for me,

98
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,819
but I did it.

99
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:55,160
It was a great journey for me.

100
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,879
My first early years of my life,

101
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,300
because by the age of 24,

102
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,920
I was onto my third business when my friends were still at university.

103
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:07,279
Remarkable story all around.

104
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,860
And there's so many places to go there.

105
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,259
I've got to ask you two questions.

106
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,379
One, the fact that I love that,

107
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:12,740
isn't it?

108
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,959
I'm going to be as big as Oprah is a,

109
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,339
is a profound thing to say as a teenage girl or boy or anyone.

110
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:21,199
And then who was the footballer?

111
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,560
Who was the footballer's wife that sold the clothes?

112
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,759
I can't reveal the name,

113
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,860
but he was a very look,

114
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,480
just remember Leeds United.

115
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,699
It was Gary McAllister,

116
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:30,540
Gary Speed,

117
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,600
Vinnie Jones,

118
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,860
Eric Cantona.

119
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,420
It was all the biggies.

120
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,319
And so look,

121
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,360
I knew all those guys because one of them were one of the wives worked for me.

122
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,300
So I was 18 and I,

123
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:41,639
you know,

124
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,300
it was a crazy time.

125
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,240
Some of the biggest names ever in the round ball game,

126
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,639
you know,

127
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,399
Vinnie Jones and Eric Cantona,

128
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,300
who can forget his,

129
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,620
his influence as well.

130
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,459
So you,

131
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:52,360
you had a,

132
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,759
an inkling in terms of what a celebrity and,

133
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,079
and profile could do,

134
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:05,259
but you must've had incredible self leadership at that age to be able to work your way through the complexity of buying and selling businesses and learning on the job.

135
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,199
Where did that come from within you?

136
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:07,600
Look,

137
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,019
um,

138
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:10,660
both my sides of my family were,

139
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,740
were entrepreneurs.

140
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,240
So,

141
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,319
um,

142
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:12,540
you know,

143
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,560
my grandpa on my grandparents side,

144
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,319
my dad had his own company.

145
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,259
My brothers have got their own company.

146
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,720
So nobody really,

147
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,779
and either side of my family had ever worked for anyone else.

148
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:24,759
And I think it's just inbuilt,

149
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,120
in me,

150
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,379
that kind of drive and determination.

151
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,699
And I've always said,

152
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:33,160
you don't have to be the cleverest or the smartest to be the best.

153
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,879
And you really need that grit and determination and that vision.

154
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,319
And when everybody and everything is failing around you,

155
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,939
it's that grit and determination that you get up and you pick yourself up off the floor and you continue on.

156
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,360
It's a great term.

157
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,600
Great.

158
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,680
Is it a brilliant book too?

159
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,399
That's Angela Duckworth wrote a book about grid and studied,

160
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:54,600
uh,

161
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,740
the data of that term.

162
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,120
It's a,

163
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,000
it's worth reading.

164
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,120
And,

165
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,279
and clearly if you've done what you've done in that space of time,

166
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,240
you must have been able to cope with and push through,

167
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:03,920
uh,

168
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,360
some challenges and hurdles on the way.

169
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,180
Do you look back on it?

170
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,980
And was it,

171
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,800
was it fun?

172
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,839
Was it stressful?

173
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,279
Was it a bit of the,

174
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,040
all the above?

175
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:11,759
Okay.

176
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,019
So my second business,

177
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:18,120
the footwear business was one of the most stressful periods of my entire life.

178
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:20,980
I was 21 to 24.

179
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,300
I had no mentor.

180
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:22,839
Um,

181
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,600
I had to learn how to set up,

182
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,699
things like letter of credits and foreign exchange set up distribution channels.

183
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:32,819
We had two huge distributors in Japan.

184
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,860
I was manufacturing the shoes in Korea.

185
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,639
I was 22 in a factory in Korea with all men.

186
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,420
And,

187
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:39,819
um,

188
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:43,680
and then obviously we were selling these shoes all around the world.

189
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,279
So I was incredibly stressed.

190
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,019
Um,

191
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,620
but at the same time,

192
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,279
it was probably one of the steepest learning curves I've ever had.

193
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:54,360
And when I,

194
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,759
when I transitioned into my third business,

195
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,439
um,

196
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,079
which was a business that I then transitioned all my knowledge into building other

197
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,139
people's brands.

198
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,439
I started with a man called Mark Newsome and you may know his name because he

199
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,040
designed the,

200
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,199
I watch for Apple,

201
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,420
great Australian designer,

202
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:18,120
but I came with Mark to Sydney for the Olymp for the millennial.

203
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,639
When he did the Sydney opera house,

204
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,980
I was with him and I traveled around the world with him.

205
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:29,180
I launched his car and his book and his watch and his bike and everything with him.

206
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,560
He was a fantastic guy.

207
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:31,300
And,

208
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:31,699
um,

209
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,980
and then when I transitioned my knowledge as well into a brand called Pringle of Scotland,

210
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,019
that was a golfing brand.

211
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,580
And I brought it back to be a brand on Bond street,

212
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,080
which is one of the most famous streets of London.

213
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,279
Um,

214
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,779
I brought in David Beckham.

215
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,059
I brought in Sophie Dahl.

216
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:53,960
I did some big celebrity projects and turn the business around.

217
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:00,840
That was when I really made my name in the game because I kind of worked with Mark Newsome.

218
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,159
And I turned around and renovated this brand Pringle of Scotland.

219
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,860
And I did a big collaboration with a brand called dry shot and come to gas on.

220
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,480
And I started to make my,

221
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,840
my name in the game from building my other business stride,

222
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,980
which was the footwear brand.

223
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,059
People started seeing me then as building other people's businesses.

224
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:21,519
Yeah.

225
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:22,220
I want to get to,

226
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:22,740
to all of that.

227
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,940
You wrote the book brand.

228
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,620
You wrote the brand famous and a bestselling book and your business is business of brand.

229
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:28,840
That,

230
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,019
that,

231
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,580
that is you.

232
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,360
I suppose there's a question that is nagging me at the moment because you're,

233
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,559
you're now a mother of two.

234
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,240
What do you do if one of your kids at 15 comes to you,

235
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,480
Lindsay,

236
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:37,960
and says,

237
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,259
uh,

238
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,379
not for me,

239
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,299
I'm out of school.

240
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,019
How do you handle that one?

241
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:41,559
Look,

242
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,899
I thought about this a lot because,

243
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:44,240
you know,

244
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:45,639
I was very driven,

245
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,220
um,

246
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,759
and very determined.

247
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,820
And with that,

248
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,100
you know,

249
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,340
comes a bit of a,

250
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,899
not a rebel girl,

251
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:52,419
but you know,

252
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,899
she's got her own mind.

253
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:54,419
And,

254
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,019
you know,

255
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,980
I've definitely got two kids,

256
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,240
particularly my daughter,

257
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:01,460
but the apple hasn't fallen too far from the tree.

258
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,639
I have to say,

259
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,139
and,

260
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:03,460
you know,

261
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,559
I loved performing as well.

262
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,539
So acting,

263
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,080
singing,

264
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,179
and that was the other route that I wanted to go down.

265
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,259
So look,

266
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,840
if either one of them comes to me at that age,

267
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,500
I will let them follow their dreams and their journey if they wanted to leave school,

268
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:23,940
but they have to work and they have to either go and do work with someone,

269
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,940
to learn a skill or a trade or,

270
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:29,000
and they have to learn business.

271
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,700
So they have to learn how to grow and scale a company.

272
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:32,559
And then,

273
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:32,899
you know,

274
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:36,980
I'm a big believer in people following their dreams and doing what they want to do in life.

275
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:37,480
Lindsay,

276
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:43,259
the Empowering Leaders podcast is really based on this premise that we're passionate about is this shift in leadership.

277
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:50,320
As we see from the old way of hierarchy and command and control into this more collaborative and self-reflective approach to leadership,

278
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,240
which to me reflects people exactly like you.

279
00:10:53,240 --> 00:11:09,019
We've been talking to you and I look at your life and I see someone who's picked trends ahead of time and from the youngest possible age and even bringing brands like diesel and replay down to leads that I'm assuming back then weren't well ahead of really where they ended up becoming.

280
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,240
You're now in this space of heading businesses towards purpose.

281
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,500
And you say the words purpose is the new currency,

282
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,080
not just commercial gain.

283
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:20,440
What are you saying?

284
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,960
What's the trend that you're so passionate about in terms of purpose?

285
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,559
About 12 years ago,

286
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:30,879
I started really looking at building businesses,

287
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:32,440
not just for commercial gain,

288
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:34,440
but for commercial and cultural gain.

289
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,419
I've been building businesses for over 27 years at that point.

290
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:50,279
And I recognize that when I was building my businesses with my third business and I built some of the most famous brands on the high street,

291
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,580
look for 19 years,

292
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,200
I worked with pretty much,

293
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,700
everyone from celebrities,

294
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,620
very famous celebrities to very famous brands,

295
00:11:58,879 --> 00:11:59,419
G star,

296
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,120
super dry,

297
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,620
Wrangler,

298
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,240
Lacoste,

299
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,860
Aldo,

300
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,860
Urban Outfitters,

301
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,539
all these brands that everybody recognizes.

302
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:07,039
I either built brands,

303
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,580
renovated brands or refreshed brands.

304
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,059
And that we always talked about brand as your business,

305
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:16,340
not as a branding exercise.

306
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:21,080
So how you built out the whole of the business model end to end,

307
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,179
and then 10 to 12 years later,

308
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:26,899
I recognize that I couldn't do this anymore.

309
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:32,419
I couldn't just build businesses for commercial gain where people were lining their pockets,

310
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,700
but they weren't giving anything back to the world.

311
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,179
And so I moved out of the world that I'd worked in since the age of 18,

312
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:44,000
the world of famous brands and celebrities and consumer.

313
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:50,500
And I moved into the world of enterprise and in the world of enterprise,

314
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,340
my priority was,

315
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,059
I,

316
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:57,679
I would give people every single bit of knowledge that I knew on how to build

317
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,580
and grow and scale a business and increase the value and,

318
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:01,940
you know,

319
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,700
all the good stuff that comes with a commercial business,

320
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:09,259
but they had to lead with impact and they had to lead with purpose.

321
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:12,559
And it couldn't just be a marketing strapline.

322
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,940
It had to be driven into absolutely everything.

323
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,259
They do an ethical business model.

324
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,039
And what I saw 12 years ago was that purpose was going to be,

325
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:24,440
be the new currency.

326
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,120
The next generation,

327
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,539
our kids were going to want to build a business.

328
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,580
It wasn't going to be a business.

329
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,159
It was going to be around what they could do in the world.

330
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,100
So when I hung out with some younger kids and I,

331
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:42,120
and I actually got the privilege of speaking on stage to about 500 people with a

332
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,679
16 year old girl.

333
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,100
And she got up on stage and said,

334
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,620
I've got a sweatshirt t-shirt range,

335
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,299
and I'm working with Donna Karen,

336
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:51,139
the most famous,

337
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:52,940
one of the most famous fashion designers in the world.

338
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,620
And I said to her after,

339
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,659
how are you working with Donna Karen?

340
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:57,379
And she said,

341
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:57,879
well,

342
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,740
every time I sell a sweatshirt or a t-shirt,

343
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,179
I give a school uniform to somebody in a developing country.

344
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:05,779
And I said,

345
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:06,279
well,

346
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:06,980
how many of you,

347
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,059
those have you given?

348
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:08,779
And she said,

349
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:09,620
650,000.

350
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,399
Wow.

351
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,000
And so,

352
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,659
you know,

353
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:15,620
the trend even back then was the fact that our next generation,

354
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,740
our kids were going to lead with purpose and impact.

355
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,940
And we needed to,

356
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,659
you know,

357
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:21,620
we needed to,

358
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,659
we needed to,

359
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:25,580
we needed to transition our businesses,

360
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:30,259
to understand how to lead us into a new era of trade,

361
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:31,419
to be a guru,

362
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:38,419
but somebody that was able to be from a commercial and cultural space,

363
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:42,940
and be able to drive purpose into everything that they do.

364
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,259
Lindsay,

365
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:46,620
you're often talking about the next generation.

366
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,820
They really care about where a product comes from,

367
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,139
its carbon footprint,

368
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:50,899
and you know,

369
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:52,139
whether it was made in ethical,

370
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,620
and sustainable way and the businesses they work for,

371
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,419
the values are really important to this generation that you picked 12 years ago.

372
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:01,259
And effectively you're saying to businesses,

373
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:01,820
you know,

374
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,820
stop selling,

375
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,419
start building communities.

376
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:07,539
Is that a too succinct a way to describe it or not?

377
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:13,340
I did a very big interview for a very famous newspaper.

378
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:19,139
You can probably see it if you Google me and it was in the UK and I,

379
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:20,419
and I got quoted,

380
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,620
stop selling.

381
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:22,820
I was like,

382
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,700
I'm not going to start leading with the human response.

383
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,220
And during the pandemic and the recession,

384
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,580
it was exactly what I taught businesses to do.

385
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,940
I had over 2000 businesses globally come around me during the pandemic.

386
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:46,059
That was in the first 10 weeks because we had been teaching businesses over five and a half thousand businesses with my business.

387
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:48,779
In the business schools that we ran around the world.

388
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,820
And because we were teaching them how to lead with purpose, and impact,

389
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,899
and not the commercial sales side,

390
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,259
when the pandemic and the recession hit,

391
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:01,340
I actually had hundreds of businesses around me and I started saying to them,

392
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,139
stop selling and build communities,

393
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,139
lead with the human response.

394
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:11,179
And the businesses that were dropping 90 to a hundred percent in revenue.

395
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:11,419
I mean,

396
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:16,580
there was some scary times for some people started to record record sales,

397
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,620
not just from that year,

398
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,100
but from all the years that they were trading because they said,

399
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,259
I'm not going to do this anymore.

400
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:31,220
And they started to build communities and they started to actually put impact and purpose into these communities.

401
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,059
And when the world started to come back online again,

402
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:37,940
that was when they built loyalty.

403
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,580
They had they'd created leadership in their community,

404
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,500
not just in the business community,

405
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,860
but in their local communities as well.

406
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,340
We had a guy Sav in Australia.

407
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,899
If you Google him and go onto my,

408
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,580
it's YouTube channel,

409
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,379
you will be able to see Sav.

410
00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:01,100
And he got himself on channel seven news for putting his arms around the community,

411
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,580
giving pizzas,

412
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,660
setting up an online TV,

413
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,660
YouTube channel,

414
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,859
and actually just helping the community rather than selling to them.

415
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:11,819
There's some fantastic stories in that,

416
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,619
in that space.

417
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:18,859
I was thinking of the thank you social enterprise that I'm not sure if you've seen their story.

418
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:20,019
It started with thank you water,

419
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:21,220
young Aussie called Daniel Flynn.

420
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,859
He was reading,

421
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:27,460
that four and a half thousand children around the world died daily due to waterborne disease.

422
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,740
And he decided to have a look at the bottled water market.

423
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:35,059
$140 billion globally annually is the bottled water market.

424
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:36,539
And he started with a thank you water.

425
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,660
And amazingly because of the community that he built,

426
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,859
he was able to go to the biggest two supermarkets here,

427
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:43,059
Lindsay and Coles and Woolworths.

428
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:50,579
And so his community demanded that thank you water be on their shelves and almost impossible to compete with the multi nationals that have got their products on those shelves.

429
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:51,660
But the community,

430
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,220
he won the day and he's since got out of bottled water because of the single use plastics part of it.

431
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,500
But that thank you brand and what it's been doing to,

432
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:00,460
as you said,

433
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,420
purpose driven organizations are having this incredible impact.

434
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,779
Is there other stories that spring to mind that you can share with us?

435
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:08,420
Well,

436
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:08,779
you know,

437
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:09,420
interestingly,

438
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,380
you spoke about Daniel and we in November,

439
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,019
as you know,

440
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:14,819
cause you were a guest at the summit,

441
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:21,619
we decided to run a 24 hour live stream summit and the United Nations,

442
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,740
opened it for us and we ran it for 24 hours.

443
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:36,900
And Daniel came and spoke at the summit and I had the pleasure also of interviewing Daniel and his story really laid laid a lasting impression for me.

444
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:45,940
But there's another gentleman that also spoke at my summit who I've now become a very good friend of David Katz and David Katz.

445
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,180
You all want to Google him.

446
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,380
He's from plastic bank.

447
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,539
And he is all about.

448
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,579
Turning plastic into gold.

449
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,220
And he has now has a mark.

450
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,019
You can see it.

451
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:57,420
Actually,

452
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,180
when you go into some retail shops,

453
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,819
they've got his plastic bank mark on their carrier bags.

454
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:09,940
People can trade their plastic in all around the world and poor and people that are underprivileged or poor,

455
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:16,579
they don't have enough money can go to the plastic bank and trade in their plastic for a digital currency.

456
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:19,220
And they make money from picking up rubbish.

457
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,619
Yeah.

458
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:20,539
Amazing success,

459
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:20,859
isn't it?

460
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:21,059
I mean,

461
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:21,500
the issue is,

462
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:22,180
you know,

463
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,500
we've got to get rid of plastics in our oceans and to as you said,

464
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,819
the brilliance of turning that into currency and digital currency.

465
00:19:27,819 --> 00:19:28,380
David Katz,

466
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:28,700
as you said,

467
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,660
check out plastic bank.

468
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,339
It's it is fantastic and credit to you,

469
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:32,700
Lindsay.

470
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:32,900
I mean,

471
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,339
as you said,

472
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,740
you had this shift in yourself,

473
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,299
I suppose.

474
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:41,299
I'm not going to continue down the path of just commercialization and what you've done with your platform,

475
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:46,299
which is really shifting the world to use your language around purpose.

476
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:51,019
And I understand you're obviously the branding expert and you've changed now.

477
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:51,700
It's Bob Earth,

478
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,700
which was Bob standing for business of brand.

479
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,140
You're about to rebrand to one earth and that platform which I have had exposure to.

480
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:03,500
You've got a brilliant way of synthesizing what seems like complex ideas into really practical,

481
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,859
certainly benefited what we've been trying to do in the leadership space in a brilliant way.

482
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:12,180
Can you share with us a bit more about how that works and what this platform is all about?

483
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,539
Yeah.

484
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:13,299
So look,

485
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,940
I genuinely had an epiphany moment and I woke up one morning.

486
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,900
I was in Mallorca.

487
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,940
My in-laws lived in Mallorca.

488
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,220
And I and I said to my husband,

489
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,380
do you have a pen?

490
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:33,180
And I got up and I sat on a sofa for four hours and I drew out what I'd been gifted from above.

491
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,539
And it was a platform,

492
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:37,059
a purpose led platform.

493
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:38,700
And I drew the whole thing out.

494
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:50,299
I've still got all the drawings on my iPad and and I saw this vision of one earth and I just and the vision was to create this place.

495
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:50,900
One earth.

496
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,859
Which is now what I've rebranded to,

497
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:55,940
which was always what I saw when I when I sat down.

498
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:09,460
And it was a platform that you could connect people all around the world to unite and then they could learn together to grow and then trade with each other to impact change.

499
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,980
And so a few years,

500
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,619
it took me a number of years to get this platform live.

501
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,940
It was a gamified platform that I saw.

502
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,819
And it's an earth and on the earth you come on.

503
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:29,140
And you create an avatar and you build your own house and your house represents your business or you and you come on.

504
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,339
And instead of being a business saying I'm a commercial business,

505
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:36,900
everybody on the platform is talking about their purpose.

506
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,779
So we have people on there that's all about architecting your own health,

507
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:46,460
finding the cure for cancer in dogs and becoming the voice of women's wealth,

508
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,779
all different purposes.

509
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:50,700
And everybody's profile is their purpose.

510
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:52,380
On the platform,

511
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,420
as you go into the learning area,

512
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,259
you learn together in a classroom environment,

513
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:58,980
a bit like Google Classroom.

514
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:01,259
And in that classroom environment,

515
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:07,180
you understand people's purposes and you understand how to grow and scale your business.

516
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:14,339
And once you come out of the classroom and you're certified with your purpose,

517
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,940
then you can trade with each other.

518
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,619
And this is the fun part.

519
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:20,619
You can either trade time,

520
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:28,779
knowledge or money so you can just give somebody some of your time without anything in return.

521
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:36,019
You can share knowledge for the same value without having to pay for it or you can pay for somebody's service.

522
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:37,460
But every time you do that,

523
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,900
we give education to somebody that can't afford it.

524
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,900
And that's through our foundation.

525
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:50,420
And so we've been able to give hundreds of people actually during the pandemic as well that could never afford to come on.

526
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:55,700
And educate themselves the education because people have been able to support that.

527
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,019
And we've supported that through a bursary.

528
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,180
It's extraordinary.

529
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,059
And speaking of leadership,

530
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:02,460
it is an amazing,

531
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:03,900
I suppose,

532
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,339
ambition that you've got and you've created it already.

533
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:09,940
And there's a program that you run called Personal DNA that I want to talk to you about,

534
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,299
Lindsay,

535
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:10,700
which is,

536
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:10,980
again,

537
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,539
brilliant.

538
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:17,259
And I have to admit it challenged me and I've been through it because whenever someone spoke about personal brand,

539
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:18,900
I felt squeamish in the past.

540
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,460
It was like,

541
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,339
why would I,

542
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:21,579
be worried about that?

543
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:23,099
Why would I care what someone thinks of me?

544
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:24,700
But as you point out correctly,

545
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,059
we all Google each other now and we've got a digital footprint,

546
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:28,579
whether we like it or not.

547
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:32,859
And then you'd go through that nauseating experiment of actually Googling yourself.

548
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:33,099
Oh,

549
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:33,539
wow.

550
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:38,859
That's what people are saying about me as someone who didn't have a social media account for 46 years of his life,

551
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:40,779
but has joined in recent times.

552
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:42,059
And I suppose what it did,

553
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:43,299
the penny dropped with me to think,

554
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:43,900
well,

555
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,099
okay,

556
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:45,099
what do you stand for?

557
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:46,180
What is your purpose?

558
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,140
And how do you communicate that?

559
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,740
And if you're doing something purpose driven,

560
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,099
of course,

561
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:51,099
you want to communicate that.

562
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:53,180
I think in the past to me to always been,

563
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,140
why would I want to put a picture of myself out there?

564
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,579
Didn't necessarily sink in,

565
00:23:57,579 --> 00:23:58,299
but talk,

566
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:01,859
talk us through your passion for this personal DNA and where you want to take it.

567
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:05,059
My passion came from my very first company,

568
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:17,420
that retail shop when I was 18 years of age and then drove through every single company because I've worked with building pretty large celebrities as well as businesses.

569
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,380
I recognised the power of fame.

570
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,619
And what that could do either for your business,

571
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:23,779
for your life,

572
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:25,259
for the world.

573
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:31,500
And then what I started to teach people was that fame was just a state of mind.

574
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,180
And it was the biggest limiting belief that people could do.

575
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,099
People would say,

576
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:39,900
I provocatively used to get on stage and say,

577
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,660
who wants to be famous?

578
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,380
And people would be like,

579
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,940
she's just asked me if I want to be famous.

580
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,059
Oh no.

581
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:47,460
You know?

582
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,259
And then,

583
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:49,339
and then what I'd say,

584
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,220
is who wants to be known in the world for making a difference?

585
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:53,420
And,

586
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:53,940
you know,

587
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,619
when I do these talks around the world,

588
00:24:56,619 --> 00:24:58,900
sometimes 500 people in the audience,

589
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,500
I'd say 90% of the hands went up.

590
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,220
And then I'd say,

591
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,859
who wants to be known outside their industry for making a difference?

592
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:10,220
And I'd say about 70% of the hands went up.

593
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,900
And then I'd say,

594
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,539
who wants to be known in the world for making a difference?

595
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:18,579
And I'd say still about 50% of those hands would go up.

596
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:18,980
And so,

597
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,980
when I said to them,

598
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,339
fame is just a state of mind.

599
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:24,859
And I would specifically ask,

600
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:27,380
what do you want to be known for?

601
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,900
And how do you want to show up?

602
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,180
And at that point,

603
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,059
people would sit there and they would say,

604
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:36,180
what do I want to be known for?

605
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,380
Whoa,

606
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,859
nobody's asked me that question.

607
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:46,779
And then people started to recognize that you could build a profile around what you wanted to be known for.

608
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,819
And you could lead either,

609
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:50,420
your community,

610
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,619
your business,

611
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:53,140
society,

612
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,220
an industry,

613
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:58,059
or even the world into a new era.

614
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:00,099
And I always used to say to people,

615
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:02,779
look at myself as an example.

616
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:08,460
It's not necessarily the biggest people that end up being on the stage.

617
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,339
Everybody has a role to play in life.

618
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:15,099
And if you can really re-remember who you are,

619
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:17,380
why you're on this planet,

620
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,779
what you're here to do,

621
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,980
then everybody's role is important.

622
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,660
It's not,

623
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,180
it can be somebody that does something in their local community.

624
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,500
It can be somebody,

625
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,940
I have a beautiful lady,

626
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,220
Julie King,

627
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:38,019
and you look her up and she moved from having an agency to now shifting the whole of the travel tourism industry.

628
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:39,819
And people can,

629
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:41,420
when they get confidence,

630
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,220
when they believe in themselves,

631
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,819
when they believe I can,

632
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:48,259
if you understand what you want to be known for,

633
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:50,019
and how you want to show up,

634
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:52,660
then you can lead into a new space.

635
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,339
And look,

636
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:53,539
you know,

637
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:58,140
I turned it into a board game called the race to impact the world.

638
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,819
And I am teaching kids in my board game.

639
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,539
It comes out next year.

640
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:10,500
I'm teaching kids how to understand how to have a profile online and how that wants to show up.

641
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:17,740
Then how to build a profile around shifting an industry and buying impact businesses.

642
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,180
And then,

643
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,220
the game is all about becoming a guru,

644
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,339
creating a foundation and leading into a new era.

645
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:39,140
I know you've got a passion about the next generation and particularly in schools and sitting here in Melbourne,

646
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:39,819
Australia.

647
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:40,539
And unfortunately,

648
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:46,859
we've got the record as the most locked down city in the world through the COVID era.

649
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:50,740
And it has spawned an epidemic of eating disorders,

650
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,619
particularly in the teenage girl bracket.

651
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:53,500
It's horrible.

652
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,779
The numbers that are coming through,

653
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,619
are really tragic.

654
00:27:56,619 --> 00:27:57,900
And as you know,

655
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,900
I've spoken to you about this before,

656
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,779
which is young girls not really understanding who they are and what they value and what they stand for.

657
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:06,259
It's not really taught at school.

658
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:06,900
And unfortunately,

659
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:13,579
now looking at these images that are unrealistic on your phone that we know of this perfect storm,

660
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:16,779
you're isolating young girls and then you're training them to their phone.

661
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:17,900
I suppose that to me,

662
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,299
I love the idea of teaching all of us,

663
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:20,700
you know,

664
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,660
what do you stand for?

665
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,339
What are your values?

666
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:23,059
What do you want to be?

667
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:23,779
Everyone has got that answer within themselves.

668
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:24,779
And I think that's what we need to do.

669
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:28,099
It's a brilliant idea to get it into schools.

670
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:29,259
I know you're passionate about that.

671
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:30,180
It's interesting.

672
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,380
Look,

673
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,220
I obviously,

674
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:31,619
you know,

675
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:34,619
and I didn't know you'd done my personal brand curriculum.

676
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:35,700
That's fantastic.

677
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,220
Thank you.

678
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,019
I'd love to speak about that offline.

679
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:39,180
Look,

680
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:39,539
you know,

681
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:44,579
I have a curriculum and I teach people how to not only build the business out,

682
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:48,420
but also build themselves out as a brand and as an asset.

683
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,099
And look,

684
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:52,660
I worked in the fashion industry for many years,

685
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,579
from the age of 18 to the age of 30,

686
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:55,700
to the age of 38.

687
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,140
And,

688
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:56,619
you know,

689
00:28:56,619 --> 00:28:58,660
being a young girl in the fashion industry,

690
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,579
myself and my friends had eating disorders.

691
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:01,859
You know,

692
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:05,619
it was part and parcel really of being in the fashion industry.

693
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,819
And I recognize that young girl.

694
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:11,460
I can speak firsthand from that young girl.

695
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,660
And yet I didn't have social media around me then.

696
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:20,619
When we were growing up as young girls and I did work in the fashion industry and so forth,

697
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:24,259
there was enough pressure on being able to look the way

698
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:29,740
that you looked and be and perform and all the different things that come on.

699
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,500
And it's not just about young girls.

700
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,140
I have to say many boys now are in the same space.

701
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,099
It's both genders.

702
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:41,539
And I've seen a massive upsurge of boys as well in this space.

703
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:44,220
So what I recognized and one of my passions,

704
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,420
and obviously I've been teaching businesses,

705
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,299
but a huge passion of mine,

706
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:48,940
as you know,

707
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,500
is youth and kids predominantly because I left school at a young age.

708
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,099
And I felt a bit,

709
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:56,259
a bit let down by the schooling environment.

710
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:59,500
They didn't teach in the way that I think that they could teach now.

711
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,940
Like you've just said,

712
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,180
being able to empower kids in a different way.

713
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:10,299
And the second layer is that you've got these young girls and boys and they're on the internet.

714
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:11,819
And what I'm teaching them is,

715
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:14,660
and what I've taught my own kids and my son,

716
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,099
who's a very big sports person,

717
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:17,940
he's 13.

718
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,859
And as you know,

719
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,099
he's going,

720
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:20,619
he wants to,

721
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:23,579
his vision is to be a GB climber.

722
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:25,660
And I said to both my kids,

723
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,259
you can go on the internet,

724
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,579
you can have your own Instagram and so forth.

725
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,299
What are you going to be known for?

726
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:32,980
What do you want to show up as?

727
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,859
What are you going to post online?

728
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:37,940
It can't just be around synthetic fame.

729
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,140
I'm just going to post things and have a laugh online.

730
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,140
It has to be around what you care about.

731
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,140
And everybody's DNA is already in them,

732
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,099
as I described.

733
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:52,900
So somebody might be slanted more towards art or drama or,

734
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,539
you know,

735
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:57,099
sport or whatever it is that is inside them,

736
00:30:57,099 --> 00:30:58,579
their DNA.

737
00:30:58,579 --> 00:31:01,660
Then think about that and put that out into the world.

738
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,500
Think about what you're known for,

739
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,099
how you want to show up.

740
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:07,180
What do you stand for?

741
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,980
And then that way you start to craft your own brand,

742
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,339
even at the age of eight or nine,

743
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:14,619
and it sits with you.

744
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:18,980
And then as you evolve as a child into a young adult,

745
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,180
that DNA,

746
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,859
that strand will grow with you.

747
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:26,900
And then when people look at your profile online,

748
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,619
you will be the one that will get recruited quicker,

749
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:33,460
because people will see this confident person that's sitting

750
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:38,180
with their purpose and not just online because of synthetic

751
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:38,740
fame.

752
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,579
And, you know,

753
00:31:39,579 --> 00:31:42,940
we all know what that does for our own self-esteem.

754
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,460
I love it.

755
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,900
It's such a powerful message of leadership,

756
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,660
talking leadership,

757
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:46,940
isn't it?

758
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,619
Finding your purpose and sharing that,

759
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:50,099
isn't it?

760
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:51,420
It's a lost art.

761
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,740
And I know it's something that you're,

762
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,099
you're personally doing a great job in,

763
00:31:55,099 --> 00:31:56,539
in bringing that back to people,

764
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,700
whatever age it is.

765
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,819
And then by extension,

766
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:01,339
so I love the idea that it gives people a voice,

767
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:03,940
something we're passionate about in your work environment.

768
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,140
If everyone understands what their purpose is,

769
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,539
and if you can connect together and collaborate,

770
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:09,579
even in big companies,

771
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:09,940
isn't it?

772
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,180
It's a,

773
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,019
it's an opportunity,

774
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:11,259
isn't it?

775
00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:12,579
If the people that work around,

776
00:32:12,579 --> 00:32:13,980
you know what they stand for,

777
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,259
and you can find some common ground,

778
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:16,539
there's,

779
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:16,900
there's,

780
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,460
you know,

781
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,420
commercial channels that work well with that,

782
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,700
as well as making people happier because everyone understands,

783
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,940
where they're coming from.

784
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,420
Lindsay.

785
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:29,220
Interestingly that you've now touched on what I describe as brand culture.

786
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,619
So now we're into the employees that are all people that work inside

787
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:34,940
organizations.

788
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,460
And this is a real speciality that I work on.

789
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,380
I've recently just worked on a beautiful client of mine that I've worked with for

790
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,339
over three and a half years.

791
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:47,900
They're engineers and they came in my business school and they were,

792
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,180
you know,

793
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,339
sat there crossed arms.

794
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:51,460
I'm an engineer.

795
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,700
And that's what I am.

796
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:58,940
And I peeled back this onion,

797
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,660
peeled it back,

798
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,460
peeled it back and got this guy,

799
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:01,940
Gary,

800
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,819
bless him.

801
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:03,019
I know,

802
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:03,299
you know,

803
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:04,380
if you go on again,

804
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,140
my LB presents YouTube channel,

805
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,500
you will be able to watch his interview,

806
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,660
Gary Elliot would anyway,

807
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,740
he sat there and he went,

808
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,180
and I said,

809
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,099
Gary,

810
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:15,859
what is it?

811
00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:16,140
You know,

812
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:16,619
what is it?

813
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,339
You are,

814
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:18,740
what do you want to be known for?

815
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:22,099
I peeled back this onion and eventually I got into a space and he said,

816
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:22,660
okay,

817
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,299
we're here to engineer a better society.

818
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:26,259
And I went,

819
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:27,140
Ooh,

820
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,460
what does that mean?

821
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,940
And he went,

822
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,539
well,

823
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:32,299
we're all about revealing the unseen,

824
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:33,619
seeing the hidden asset.

825
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:38,579
But what we're really about is building impact into all our engineering.

826
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:41,660
So that goes down to the materials that we use.

827
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:47,539
And he talked to me about a community that he really cared about where they

828
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:49,220
designed this bridge.

829
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:49,700
And he said,

830
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,779
the bridge wasn't about just engineering.

831
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,180
The bridge,

832
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:56,900
but about connecting the two communities on either side of the bridge.

833
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,859
And I went,

834
00:33:57,859 --> 00:33:59,900
that is so inspiring.

835
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,339
And we then looked at how to rebuild his business.

836
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:04,059
And I said,

837
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:09,699
what if you had a coworking space where you could have an Academy and

838
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:12,780
teach all your engineers that were coming out of college,

839
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,860
how to be impact engineers.

840
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,260
Anyway,

841
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,739
last week I went to his coworking space with the Academy and all the

842
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,579
engineers in it.

843
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:28,780
And he has created his Academy and he launched his first coworking space

844
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,699
three and a half years on.

845
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:35,820
But the project that I then started working with was all the people inside

846
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,980
his organization.

847
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,780
And I had 25 of them around me and eight weeks on a program.

848
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,460
And they all sat on the very first program.

849
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,820
We're engineers,

850
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,219
we're efficient.

851
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,579
That's what we do.

852
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:49,860
And by the end of the summer,

853
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,860
we're all working together.

854
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,260
And so,

855
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,820
at the end of the seven weeks,

856
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,980
I went into the coworking space and I ran the session with them.

857
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,260
And they all stood up at the front of the room for Gary.

858
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,139
And they announced their purpose.

859
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:05,099
Every single one of them.

860
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:09,940
I nearly cried because not only was that purpose around what they really,

861
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,539
truly cared about and every single purpose was different.

862
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:15,940
They were now running this as a campaign,

863
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:20,179
which we designed with them to go out externally into the market and talk

864
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:20,900
about what they were.

865
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,219
Known for.

866
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:24,619
They are now using it as a recruitment.

867
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:28,579
Videos so that they can recruit people in all around purpose.

868
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:31,659
Each one of them is designing their own purpose,

869
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:34,139
project off their purpose.

870
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:38,940
And they're driving this now through 180 people inside of their company.

871
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,019
They're running the project through every single person inside the company.

872
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:46,139
So it just shows you even engineers,

873
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:49,900
but sit there with arms crossed and I'm just an engineer.

874
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,460
And.

875
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:57,739
turn into massive purpose impact people. Worth looking up Elliot Wood and having a look at

876
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:02,820
the vision video that I know you were behind creating as well, Lindsay. So we'll put that

877
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:09,079
details in the show so you can check out transformation, isn't it? The stiff engineer

878
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:15,099
into a purpose-led organization is a fantastic story. There's a bracket of questions I want to

879
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:19,139
ask you, Lindsay, which we're seeing is a bit of a common thread of iconic leaders like yourself

880
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:25,260
and picking up the patterns and the habits. But what we're seeing is the dimensions of great

881
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:30,139
leaders like you who are really taking leadership into the 21st century. I want to start with self

882
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:36,320
leadership, Lindsay. What does that mean to you? Everything. And this is what I try and instill in

883
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:43,500
my kids because I've always been extraordinarily driven and self-leadership for me is the thing

884
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,119
that's got me to places when actually most things would fail.

885
00:36:48,119 --> 00:37:08,400
And sometimes people look to other people to lead them. And that's that's OK. That's good as well. You know, everybody needs guidance and leadership and so forth. But your own intuition, your own belief, your own leadership, your own knowing, as I describe it, is the thing that will get you there in life.

886
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:24,179
And really, truly, if you listen to your gut, you know, your stomach, your third human brain, as you describe it, then that inner leadership that will drive you, you do know the answers.

887
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,159
People think they don't know. You do know the answers. You just need to look within.

888
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:36,320
That is a brilliant answer, Lindsay. And it's interesting. I've heard so many people on this podcast describe it in different ways.

889
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,380
We had a great author, Steve Biddle.

890
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:40,400
Talk about the super sense, he calls it.

891
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,440
Tuning into your super sense is where the great answers and intuition comes.

892
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:47,400
And other leaders talking about exactly that.

893
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,579
When they've gone away from listening to their gut instinct, that's when they've made bad decisions and finding a way back to there.

894
00:37:54,019 --> 00:37:59,500
The other dimension we want to talk about is how you go about positively impacting others in your environment.

895
00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:01,900
That's a great question.

896
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:06,239
Look, we've all been through a pandemic and a recession.

897
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:12,639
And I would say when the when the boat, you know, when you're in that boat.

898
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:25,980
Right. And it's rocky. And, you know, you know, for me, when you went through that pandemic and the recession and I had firsthand of having thousands of businesses around me that were in that boat, you know, and also my own business.

899
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:35,019
You know, my my own business was in that boat where I had to pivot very quickly to be able to support, you know, over 2000 businesses in 10 days.

900
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:36,219
When we.

901
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:38,599
We had business schools running offline, not online.

902
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:47,739
And so when you're in that space, you need to become you need to be confident and you need to really be lead from the front.

903
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,079
And that means but you still need to bring people with you.

904
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:52,940
That's the most important thing.

905
00:38:52,940 --> 00:39:04,699
So that means that when you have confidence and you're going a certain direction and people are scared or they're feeling anxious about something or they're in fear.

906
00:39:04,699 --> 00:39:12,699
You need to bring them into a space of love and into a space where they feel calm, where some people freeze.

907
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,800
They don't know what to do next.

908
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:21,679
And so in that space, when you're in a leadership space, really what you want to do is people feel assured.

909
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:22,699
They know.

910
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,039
Yeah, she's got it.

911
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,320
You're going in that direction.

912
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,239
This is what's happening right now.

913
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:27,699
There's a confidence.

914
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,119
There's an air.

915
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,000
But you also have people.

916
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:34,500
You have them around you and you bring people.

917
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:35,219
People with you.

918
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,699
That's the most important thing.

919
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:41,519
Now, I described you in the intro as a visionary leader, and you are certainly that.

920
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:48,840
And you have big visions, including the earth, the one earth that you're creating around really shifting the world.

921
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,000
They're big ambitions.

922
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:50,960
They're big visions.

923
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:54,199
How do you go about creating and sharing those visions?

924
00:39:54,559 --> 00:40:01,260
Look, to stand in front of your mom at age 11 and turn around and say, Mom, I'm going to be as big as Oprah Winfrey.

925
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:04,679
And my mom and dad are not.

926
00:40:04,699 --> 00:40:06,719
I'm not from that world.

927
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,340
You know, you know, my dad, you know, the academic, more academic space.

928
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:12,900
There's something innately in me anyway.

929
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,539
And I I have the gift of sight.

930
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:21,320
So I was born being able to see in a psychic space as well.

931
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:31,820
And so I've always been able to see what's coming up next or what's happening or trends or things that are future.

932
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:34,659
And, you know, that's that's a gift that I.

933
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:35,480
Was born with.

934
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:40,079
And so I have always said, and you'll have heard me say this.

935
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:45,199
I'm here to shift the world into a new era through the eyes of brands.

936
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:53,159
I believed that I was here to create a quiet revolution that was built from a space of love.

937
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:59,199
And think of this, the biggest quiet party that the world has ever seen.

938
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:04,039
And all of a sudden, one day we all pop out and go, surprise.

939
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:08,440
And my belief was that it's the small.

940
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:11,460
It's it's the it's the individual people.

941
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,679
It's my engineer.

942
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,780
It's my travel tourism lady.

943
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:17,219
It's my influencer.

944
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,539
It's my wealth person.

945
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:30,139
It's all these people that if we can have one earth with one billion purposes, then each person's purpose will lead us into a new era.

946
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:34,539
And I've always believed that you need world leaders, industries.

947
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:40,460
You need industry leaders, societal leaders, business leaders, community leaders.

948
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:45,320
You need all the different layers and they all come together.

949
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:48,980
And that was where to shift the world into a new era came from.

950
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,900
I've always been very good at being the woman kind of behind the brands.

951
00:41:54,219 --> 00:42:02,780
The woman that's kind of the orchestrator, helping people to understand how to build, grow, scale a business, but also to impact change.

952
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:04,699
And also to be behind.

953
00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:11,460
And teach them around how to be known, what that looks like.

954
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:32,860
And so if we all come together and make that positive change, then my whole thing around standing for the face of modern business and the face of the modern world means that everybody has the right to be seen and heard no matter where you live or the demographic that you live in.

955
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,099
You don't and nobody.

956
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:34,559
Everybody.

957
00:42:34,699 --> 00:42:37,679
Doesn't have the right to be commercially successful.

958
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:39,480
You need to put work in that.

959
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:43,679
Everybody has the right to be on the same playing field, to be seen and heard.

960
00:42:43,679 --> 00:43:04,280
So to create the face is all around everybody having a face and a modern world or a modern business means we're moving people from 20th century thinking to 21st century thinking, where people can genuinely become a guru or a guru.

961
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:29,539
A modern day person where it's more of the spiritual and the commercial and people are moving from competition to collaboration and they're coming together and shifting industry or society and they move from an I conversation to a we conversation where we can come and do this together.

962
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,199
Well, yeah, I think I just felt that vision and you couldn't have explained it any.

963
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:34,480
Better.

964
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:37,820
Clearly, you know your vision and you know how to share it.

965
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:43,139
That's a spectacular answer to clearly something that is just part of who you are.

966
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:56,840
We talk about curiosity a lot as a dimension of leadership that is clearly identified in leaders who are, to use your terminology, 21st century leaders and then curiosity as a way to approach learning and development.

967
00:43:57,139 --> 00:43:59,639
How do you approach curiosity in your world?

968
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:04,260
Oh, isn't curiosity the crux of it all?

969
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,420
Isn't that the kind of cornerstone milestone?

970
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,519
Curiosity, creativity.

971
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:21,579
Do you know that creativity as a skill will move from number, I think it was like 22 to number three in the next 10 years?

972
00:44:22,179 --> 00:44:29,019
Because curiosity and creativity is really all you've got.

973
00:44:29,019 --> 00:44:34,019
And when you're curious and when you allow yourself to be in a creative,

974
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:39,360
creative space to get those juices flowing, then truly anything is possible.

975
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:47,260
And, you know, I sat there and when, you know, I was gifted with, you know, a vision down to say, create this one earth.

976
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:59,960
But, you know, I sat there and for a few years, people went, what you want to create an earth with three platforms in one, a community area, a learn area and a trade area.

977
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:04,119
And you want it to be gamified and you want it to have its own currency.

978
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,400
And it's like, you know, people think that you're mad.

979
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:16,059
And and so that curiosity and creativity is the thing that will drive you and lead you because it links with purpose.

980
00:45:16,059 --> 00:45:33,860
And when you have that and you stick with that and you have a true belief that anything is possible, if you put your mind to it and then you can succeed, then, you know, hold on to curiosity is what I say, because that will get you into places that you may not have imagined.

981
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,920
Maybe didn't think was possible.

982
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,400
Yeah, beautifully said.

983
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:41,940
Again, I'm looking forward to your answer on this because I think you do it brilliantly.

984
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,800
And that is, you know, the area of communicating with clarity.

985
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,239
What are your thoughts on that?

986
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,280
I come from a comms background.

987
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,480
So what I always talk about is your language patterns.

988
00:45:54,739 --> 00:46:02,400
And I believe that people stop themselves from getting to places because of the language patterns that they put around themselves.

989
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:03,719
So I can't.

990
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:18,099
Aren't limiting beliefs that are put in the way and people use language that actually people then hear from what's coming out of somebody's mouth and puts people off.

991
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:28,099
So what I always say to people is think about every word that comes out of your mouth and try and replace the word with a positive word.

992
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,219
So my kids will say, you know, I can't.

993
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,780
And they'll always laugh because they'll say.

994
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,699
I'll ban something for a week.

995
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:42,860
And I try and get them into a space of not using that word, but using a different word.

996
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:53,420
And if you have seven days of not using that word, but using a different word, your brain then re engages into a new space.

997
00:46:53,579 --> 00:47:00,840
And that then links with positive thinking, because what you say is your actions of what you do.

998
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,840
So if I'm saying and I do this with myself.

999
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,000
I do this with my kids all the time.

1000
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,599
I have a parking space.

1001
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,059
Thank you.

1002
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,260
Thank you, universe, for the parking space.

1003
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:12,260
And then all of a sudden a parking space appears.

1004
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:22,179
I'm putting a positive intention out to the world and then creating manifesting something to be to bring it into being.

1005
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:27,280
If I'm constantly saying I'm bad, I'm not worthy, this, that and the other.

1006
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,039
I'm never going to get a parking space.

1007
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,460
I'm never going to get that job.

1008
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:33,219
Then I'm just putting that out into the world.

1009
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:37,239
So what you speak is what you make a reality.

1010
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,840
Yeah, well said, isn't it?

1011
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,320
It's incredible how powerful that is.

1012
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,239
And then retraining those negative thoughts.

1013
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:49,900
I think a lot of people get into that habit where you don't even realize that you are imposing negative thoughts on people around you.

1014
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:55,039
And it becomes isolating in the end because people generally don't want to be around that too often, do they?

1015
00:47:55,059 --> 00:47:57,059
And you can retrain your brain.

1016
00:47:57,059 --> 00:48:00,480
And as you said, we're about this world of collaboration.

1017
00:48:00,699 --> 00:48:03,760
And we see collaboration and leadership as really what people.

1018
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,460
Like you are doing brilliantly.

1019
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,159
What do you think about collaboration?

1020
00:48:07,579 --> 00:48:14,599
Well, our whole thing and through one earth is all about moving people from competition to collaboration.

1021
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,539
And it sits at the heart of our business model.

1022
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:25,519
So genuinely, I believe that people, even in the purpose space, we're still saying my purpose.

1023
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:27,380
This is what I stand for.

1024
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:31,579
And actually forgetting that if you move from.

1025
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,800
Just my purpose.

1026
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,800
If you connect your purpose with somebody else's purpose, we call it the purpose footprints.

1027
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:45,139
How do you connect your purpose footprint with somebody else's purpose footprint?

1028
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,039
And then together you grow.

1029
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:58,679
And when you move from collaborate from competition to collaboration, people have been in an old school mindset that, oh, no, they're the competition.

1030
00:48:58,679 --> 00:48:59,639
I can't work with them.

1031
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:01,480
I can't let them see what I'm doing.

1032
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,780
And actually our business model.

1033
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,360
It's an open business model.

1034
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:13,579
So we will reach out to people that are in the same space as us and look at it and go power in numbers.

1035
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:19,579
How do we create and collaborate to be able to shift the world into a new era?

1036
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:23,940
Because we know that when you bring people together, you'll make that happen.

1037
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:29,099
And in industries, we now work with specific industries.

1038
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:33,539
So we work with engineering, accounting, finance, travel, tourism, health.

1039
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:40,559
We're manufacturing all the different industry sectors, and we're now bringing industries together.

1040
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:52,760
So as I mentioned, Julie King, she's in the travel industry, and we're bringing 180 people advocates from the travel tourism industry, and they're all coming together.

1041
00:49:53,119 --> 00:50:00,840
We're teaching them how to switch over their business models to 21st century thinking to lead with impact and purpose.

1042
00:50:01,139 --> 00:50:03,599
But the main thing is that.

1043
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,039
But they're all going to be taught how to campaign together.

1044
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:16,820
And when you learn how to campaign together around a cause and a purpose, that's when you really make the biggest change.

1045
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,500
Yeah, what an impact that will have.

1046
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:21,519
You think of how affected the travel and tourism industry is.

1047
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:24,480
And I love the work that you're doing in that space.

1048
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:30,699
A couple of final questions for you that we've been asking regularly all the guests that have come on the Empowering Leaders podcast.

1049
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:33,460
And the one I want to start with.

1050
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,780
Who's the greatest leader in your life, Lindsay?

1051
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,039
My kids.

1052
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:38,280
Really?

1053
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:51,940
Yeah, because when you watch your children and you watch them go through all the things that they go through, oh, my gosh, you learn so much about yourself from watching your children.

1054
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,539
It's a great mirror, isn't it, Bec?

1055
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:56,079
It's a great answer.

1056
00:50:56,659 --> 00:51:00,500
I always try and claim the, that's definitely me, that one.

1057
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,480
That's definitely not me.

1058
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,239
That's yours, Bec.

1059
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,360
If we can pick.

1060
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,619
The traits that come through.

1061
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,340
You mentioned about the teenage years and, oh, my gosh, hold on to your hats.

1062
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,500
That's what I would say.

1063
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:16,639
They will be my biggest leaders and learners of that period of time.

1064
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:18,219
And it's really coming up now.

1065
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:19,960
Yeah, incredible, isn't it?

1066
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:24,400
You do learn so much, don't you, through watching them grow and develop.

1067
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:28,699
If you could collaborate with any person in the world, who would you collaborate with?

1068
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,179
Elon Musk.

1069
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:30,860
Why?

1070
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,139
He's one of the most visionary.

1071
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:36,239
He's one of the most visionary people that I have ever come across.

1072
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,119
And I'm putting that out there, actually.

1073
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:42,960
I did this with, I wanted to collaborate with the United Nations.

1074
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:49,199
And every single school I used to teach and I used to say, you know, we could be working with the United Nations.

1075
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,800
And I would put it out there all the time that I wanted to work with the United Nations.

1076
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,420
And then, obviously, they opened and I've been working with them for the last two years.

1077
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:03,420
So, Elon Musk, if you are listening to this podcast, I would like to collaborate.

1078
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:18,199
And the reason why I would like to collaborate with you is you are one of the most visionary people that I have seen in the world that I think looks beyond the realm of what's there and what's possible.

1079
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:32,800
And I know that having the brain that I have and the visionary space that I am in, I'd be quite interested to see what we could do with impact and purpose and put those two brains together to really collaborate.

1080
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,039
And I know that having the brain that I have and the visionary space that I have and put those two brains together to really collaborate.

1081
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:34,079
And I know that having the brain that I have and the visionary space that I have and put those two brains together to really collaborate.

1082
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:40,940
And that would be a collaboration that I would like to hear the transcript from your energy and your vision, Lindsay.

1083
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,179
An extraordinary, you know, what he has done, isn't it?

1084
00:52:44,219 --> 00:52:49,980
You think of pushing through the car industry to electric when it was sitting there for all of the car makers forever.

1085
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:56,280
And he, as you said, has quite an extraordinary way of living for sure.

1086
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:02,079
Lindsay, I've loved listening and learning and hearing all of your incredible vision.

1087
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:02,699
And if you want to hear more, please do.

1088
00:53:02,699 --> 00:53:02,760
Thank you.

00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:08,460

1091
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:10,139
Have a look at the book, Brand Famous.

1092
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,900
Check out One Earth.

1093
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:18,000
At the moment, you might have to check out it under the name of Bob Earth, but coming in the rebrand is One Earth.

1094
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:25,440
And having seen it and used it and benefited from it firsthand, Lindsay, it's a fantastic, incredible thing that you are doing.

1095
00:53:25,659 --> 00:53:26,820
It's brilliant.

1096
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,780
It applies to almost everyone.

1097
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:32,780
And, you know, more power to you, more strength to your arm, as they say.

1098
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,699
You're doing incredible things and inspiring many people.

1099
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,699
And it's been a great pleasure to talk to you.

1100
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,340
Thanks for your time.

1101
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,559
Thank you so much for having me.

1102
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:44,119
And, you know, you are a true inspiration for all as well.

1103
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:46,599
And congratulations with everything that you're doing.

1104
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:47,820
Thanks so much, Lindsay.

1105
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:51,400
Really great to speak to you and look forward to hopefully doing it again sometime.

1106
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:51,920
Thanks again.

1107
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:52,880
Thank you.

1108
